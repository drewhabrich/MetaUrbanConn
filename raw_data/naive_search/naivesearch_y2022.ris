AB  - Cities worldwide are expanding in area and human population, posing multiple challenges to amphibian populations, including habitat loss from removal of wetlands and terrestrial upland habitat, habitat fragmentation due to roads and the built environment, and habitat degradation from pollutants, extensive human use and introduced species. We developed an eight-step urban amphibian conservation framework based on established monitoring, analytical methods and community engagement to enable amphibian conservation in a large urban centre. The framework outlines a process used to conserve biodiversity in a complex landuse and decision-making environment supported by a series of successive complementary modelling techniques to measure amphibian presence, priority habitat and functional connectivity. We applied the framework in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to illustrate its potential. Here, urbanization has reduced wetlands by 90% and ecological knowledge on amphibians was poor. We improved knowledge on amphibian diversity and distribution, identified core wetlands and movement pathways for amphibian species and identified barriers in the wetland network where construction or restoration measures could re-establish amphibians or increase their densities. This knowledge was shared with ecologists and city planners for implementation through appropriate policies and plans. Our framework provides a series of stepwise products to improve an urban municipality's ability to restore or conserve priority habitat and movement pathways necessary for amphibian survival under pressure from multiple land uses. The framework provides a platform to identify city plans, policy and or programmes and to derive necessary information to support amphibian conservation.

AB  - Natural habitats in rural and urban areas are increasingly fragmented and altered by human impacts that are limiting the animal and plant dispersal process. Fragmentation and isolation can be reversed by restoring landscape connectivity through effective Ecological Network (EN) planning. However, most of the studies analyzing the influence of connectivity and landscape structure on biodiversity are focused on animals, while the understanding of their interplaying role on plant diversity remains limited. .We studied the relationships between alpha and 13 diversity pattern and landscape structure and connectivity in the nodes of an EN developed in agricultural landscapes, as a part of regional landscape planning framework in Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-East of Italy). As an innovation, the study aims at parsing the interacting effect of landscape structure, surrounding habitats and nodes, and structural connectivity on EN plant diversity at two specific scales of investigation i.e., the habitat and the node scale. The habitat was the basic ecological unit, while the node was the basic cartographical unit for the EN mapping (multi-habitat or mono-habitat nodes).A total of 443 plant species were collected across 219 sample plots, in 14 different habitats and 87 nodes of the EN. We found that high node connectivity leads to higher species richness (alpha-diversity) but also increases plant community similarity (i.e., low 13-diversity) at both scales. The effect of landscape structure showed differing trends depending on the habitat. In general, landscape composition of semi-natural land cover (i.e., hedgerows, watercourses) showed a positive effect on species diversity as opposed to that of the configuration of anthropogenic elements on both scales. Our results provided crucial information on the landscape processes useful to improving biodiversity conservation by EN. Our findings suggest that i) improving connectivity within ENs favors alpha plant diversity ii) different habitats have different sensibility to landscape structure iii) semi-natural land cover around nodes improve plant diversity; iv) planning both mono-habitat and multi-habitats nodes, increases the biodiversity conserved therein; v) nodes with more compact shapes are to be preferred.

AB  - Environmental and ecological degradation can be monitored by biological indicators such as plants, yet little research has been done using subterranean organisms such as collembola, especially in cities. Collembola, a soil fauna group, can be used to assess soil quality and to decipher assembly rules of soil organisms in cities. Here, we review 75 articles on soil collembola in an urban context. We found that soil properties and landscape characteristics influenced soil communities. There is a need for more connectivity between green urban spaces to allow the dispersion of collembola. Little information is available on the assembly of collembola communities, on biotic interactions and on dynamics of colonisation.

AB  - Context Structural and functional connectivity, as subconcepts of landscape connectivity, are key factors in biodiversity conservation and management. Previous studies have focused on the consequences of connectivity for populations of terrestrial organisms, which may not be appropriate for aquatic organisms. Objectives As landscape connectivity critically affects the potential value of ponds for biodiversity, here we used diving beetles (Dytiscidae), an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, to investigate how structural connectivity affects functional connectivity to aquatic invertebrates in an urban landscape. Methods We assessed pairwise similarities of dytiscid community, i.e. the variation of species composition between clustered and isolated ponds in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. We investigated how dytiscid community similarity is affected by Euclidean distances between ponds, as an indicator of structural connectivity. Results We found that clustered ponds shared more species than isolated ponds. Dytiscid species community similarity responded negatively to increasing Euclidean distance between ponds. Effectively dispersing species were widely distributed across the landscape, while poor dispersers were scarcely distributed in the same landscape. Conclusions Structural connectivity determines which species are able to disperse successfully, with poor dispersers restricted to well-connected ponds. The different responses of effective dispersers and poor dispersers to the same structural connectivity indicate that functional connectivity determines species composition. We recommend providing well-connected aquatic habitats in urban landscapes and the implementation of measures to reduce isolation of wetland assemblages. Even clustered ponds need dispersal from other habitats to ensure their contribution to urban biodiversity.

AB  - Cities are socioecological systems that filter and select species, therefore establishing unique species assemblages and biotic interactions. Urban ecosystems can host richer wild bee communities than highly intensified agricultural areas, specifically in resource-rich urban green spaces such as allotments and family gardens. At the same time, urban beekeeping has boomed in many European cities, raising concerns that the fast addition of a large number of managed bees could deplete the existing floral resources, triggering competition between wild bees and honeybees. Here, we studied the interplay between resource availability and the number of honeybees at local and landscape scales and how this relationship influences wild bee diversity. We collected wild bees and honeybees in a pollination experiment using four standardized plant species with distinct floral morphologies. We performed the experiment in 23 urban gardens in the city of Zurich (Switzerland), distributed along gradients of urban and local management intensity, and measured functional traits related to resource use. At each site, we quantified the feeding niche partitioning (calculated as the average distance in the multidimensional trait space) between the wild bee community and the honeybee population. Using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we tested direct and indirect effects of resource availability, urban beekeeping, and wild bees on the community feeding niche partitioning. We found an increase in feeding niche partitioning with increasing wild bee species richness. Moreover, feeding niche partitioning tended to increase in experimental sites with lower resource availability at the landscape scale, which had lower abundances of honeybees. However, beekeeping intensity at the local and landscape scales did not directly influence community feeding niche partitioning or wild bee species richness. In addition, wild bee species richness was positively influenced by local resource availability, whereas local honeybee abundance was positively affected by landscape resource availability. Overall, these results suggest that direct competition for resources was not a main driver of the wild bee community. Due to the key role of resource availability in maintaining a diverse bee community, our study encourages cities to monitor floral resources to better manage urban beekeeping and help support urban pollinators.

AB  - The high-intensity development of a city encroaches on the ecological land, such as lakes, rivers, and forests, which changes the stable land relationship, resulting in ecological security problems, such as regional waterlogging and a decline in biodiversity. Identifying urban ecological systems and constructing ecological security patterns (ESP) are of great importance for urban ecological protection and spatial planning. The complexity of the ecological environment in landscape cities makes them more difficult for planning and construction than in plain cities. Additionally, they are more susceptible to torrential rains, mountain torrents, and river tides in the process of urbanization. This study introduced the functional wetland theory into the construction of the ESP and obtained a new set of methods for landscape cities. Based on the functional wetland theory, the "patch-corridor-matrix " model was used to combine the geographic information system (GIS) runoff and catchment analysis with the MSPA-MCR ecological corridor construction method to form a new wetland and habitat network by coupling the two together. Additionally, construction principles of protection priority, maximization of ecological benefits, guarantee of connectivity, and targeted design to guide the construction of landscape cities were put forward. This study takes the central urban area of Fuzhou as an example to show the application path of this method.

AB  - Explicit characterisation of the complexity of urban landscapes is critical for understanding patterns of biodiversity and for detecting the underlying social and ecological processes that shape them. Urban environments exhibit variable heterogeneity and connectivity, influenced by different historical contingencies, that affect community assembly across scales. The multidimensional nature of urban disturbance and co-occurrence of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effects leading to nonlinear responses in populations and communities. Yet, current research design of urban ecology and evolutionary studies typically relies on simple representation of the parameter space that can be observed. Sampling approaches apply simple urban gradients such as linear transects in space or comparisons of urban sites across the urban mosaic accounting for a few variables. This rarely considers multiple dimensions and scales of biodiversity, and proves to be inadequate to explain observed patterns. We apply a multidimensional approach that integrates distinctive social, ecological and built characteristics of urban landscapes, representing variations along dimensions of heterogeneity, connectivity and historical contingency. Measuring species richness and beta diversity across 100 US metropolitan areas at the city and 1-km scales, we show that distinctive signatures of urban biodiversity can result from interactions between socioecological heterogeneity and connectivity, mediated by historical contingency.

AB  - Cities' green areas are fragmented patches and are often confined to smaller sizes than the higher built-up proportions. Such small-sized green areas can be essential components of green infrastructure to compensate for biodiversity loss. As a proxy to biodiversity, we studied birds in nine small green area locations of Freiburg and eight area locations in Regensburg in Germany. We investigated the neighboring green networks (distance to the nearest water body and another green area) and landscape metrics (patch abundance and habitat heterogeneity at a 1 km radius) that might benefit and explain bird richness and composition in small green areas. We found that the variations in the observed species richness and composition at the surveyed locations were better explained solely by green networks in Freiburg and by green networks and landscape metrics in Regensburg. In general, it indicates that a small green area could be biodiverse if its spatial distribution considers a nearby water body and other green areas, allowing a higher abundance of similar patches and habitat heterogeneity in the neighborhood.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to landscape fragmentation and habitat loss. As an organic structure integrating green space, an urban ecological network can effectively reduce ecological risks and protect biodiversity if its landscape connectivity is maintained. Chaoyang District in Beijing is facing the challenge of transformational development due to excessive urbanization. Taking this district as the study area, this study assessed the environmental impact of different development scenarios on landscape connectivity indices and explored the most relevant strategies for important green space patches by combining ecological network modeling (Graphab) and scenario simulation techniques (FLUS model). The results show that under the urban expansion scenario, the probability of connectivity (PC) decreases by 59.7%, while under the master plan scenario, it increases by 102.1%. Even under the ideal ecological scenario, the ecological network structure of the region faces structural problems. Patches and corridors with high delta probabilities of connectivity (dPC) are concentrated in the north, with no effective connection between the north and south. Finally, planning strategies and priorities for important patches under different urban development goals are proposed through a strategy matrix. Overall, this study proposes a framework for decision-makers to solve planning conflicts between urban expansion and biodiversity conservation, especially for cities in transition.

AB  - Preserving and expanding green infrastructure (GI) is key to biodiversity conservation in cities, but a significant share of urban land is commonly underutilized in GI plans: gardens. This is despite the fact that gardens can support diverse wildlife communities by providing habitat and by functioning as corridors. In this article, we apply circuit theory-based modeling in order to quantify the contribution of two types of gardens to connectivity in the city of Braunschweig, Germany: private gardens and allotment gardens. We ran four permeability scenarios: 1.) all green spaces including private and allotment gardens are permeable; 2.) private gardens are non permeable; 3.) allotment gardens are non-permeable; 4.) only public green spaces but no gardens are permeable. We based our modeling on the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a common, relatively well-understood and well-liked urban species. Observations by citizen scientists were used for a plausibility analysis and interpreting the results. Our results confirm the importance of gardens for providing habitat and connectivity. The overall landscape permeability to the movement of hedgehogs would decrease by 75% and the area of core habitats would decline by 63% without private and allotment gardens. While private gardens contribute most to landscape connectivity, some allotment gardens occupy key areas for the overall connectivity in the city. In conclusion, circuit theory-based modeling is a promising tool for urban GI planning and the output of those models can inform decision makers and gardeners.

AB  - Cities continue to grow worldwide, and the highly modified urban landscape becomes an inhospitable envi-ronment for many species because the natural vegetation cover is commonly fragmented, and the remnants are often isolated. Protected Areas (PAs) located surrounding or within urban areas may not achieve their goal of protecting local or regional biodiversity. Thus, an urban ecological network is essential to support their PAs. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the PAs connectivity in an urban landscape in Brazil and understanding whether urban forest fragments can support an urban ecological network. Besides spatial models based on functional connectivity and graph theory, we used participatory techniques to design the resistance surface and the least-cost paths (LCPs) for Atlantic Forest birds. The results showed critical paths (LCPs), important areas for restoration programs for improving PAs connectivity, and essential forest fragments for conservation and restoration. Although the landscape has a forest structure with 1873 forest fragments and 516 links through which the LCPs were structured, most forest fragments and LCPs cannot provide the necessary support for the PAs connectivity. The current ecological network is dependent on forest fragments neighboring (outside PAs) and the flux dispersions occurred mainly in the peri-urban areas. Riparian zones and anthropic grasslands also showed importance for the PAs connectivity. We identified only 28 forest fragments spatially connected, pre-senting several sizes, and located near large forest areas, relevant PAs, and riparian zones. Six of these forest fragments, smaller than ten hectares and strategically located in the urban matrix, were indicated for restoration actions. The current low connectivity among PAs brings the importance of native vegetation restoration in the riparian zone and anthropic grassland and the importance of the periurban areas to promote biodiversity con-nectivity in the urban landscape.

AB  - Variation in species richness and density of native birds in urban parks and greenspaces ("parks") is often substantial. Understanding why differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48 undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area, and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape, connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high tree cover in Portland's landscape. Separate analyses of forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance migrants would likely disappear from Portland's landscape.

AB  - Green roofs are often promoted as a mean to counter the negative environmental effects of urbanization on nature and to increase the amount of green space in cities. Green roofs often enhance aboveground biodiversity, especially herbivores and pollinators. However, if and in what way they support belowground biodiversity, and more specifically soil fauna, is rarely studied. Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics. However, we suggest that future studies are needed to investigate whether our findings are applicable to other groups of soil-living arthropods.

AB  - Cities are considered important refuges for insect pollinators. This has been shown repeatedly for wild bees, but may also be true for other diverse taxa such as hoverflies. However, our understanding of how urban environmental filters shape pollinator species communities and their traits is still limited. Here, we used wild bee and hoverfly species, communities and their functional traits to illustrate how environmental filters on the landscape and local scale shape urban species pools. The multi-taxon approach revealed that environmental filtering predominantly occurred at the landscape scale as urbanisation and 3D connectivity significantly structured the taxonomic and functional composition of wild bee (sociality, nesting, diet, body size) and hoverfly (larval food type, migratory status) communities. We identified urban winners and losers attributed to taxon-specific responses to urban filters. Our results suggest that insect pollinator conservation needs to take place primarily at the landscape level while considering species traits, especially by increasing habitat connectivity.

AB  - Ecological connectivity is the foundation of maintaining urban biodiversity and ecosystem health. Identifying and managing ecological (connectivity) networks can help maintain the stability of urban ecosystems. However, few studies have explored the cluster effect in the ecological network caused by the imbalance in connectivity strength between habitat patches, which is not conducive to the in-depth restoration of ecological networks. In the present study, a typical urban area, Shenzhen, was used as an example to analyze the important habitats in the city based on the focal species and to identify an ecological network. Habitat patch clusters in the ecological network were explored based on random walk network community detection. These are clusters of closely connected habitat lands. Finally, we analyzed existing urban policies for the protection of clusters and the points to be repaired in the network. The results showed that 50 ecological corridors connected 39 habitats in the study area, which further formed seven habitat patch clusters. Most of the clusters were well-protected by existing policies. Nineteen barrier points were identified between the clusters, and their restoration helped strengthen the connectivity between clusters. This study provides a reference for future urban ecological restoration.

AB  - With the new round of western development being pushed forward and territorial spatial planning being put into place, northwest China's urbanization rate has sped up. Urbanization will inevitably affect the city's general landscape pattern and features, aggravating the landscape's fragmentation and destroying the urban ecological environment. That threatens the well-being of the residents and the city's biodiversity. Urban green space provides a habitat for the creatures in the city, and its connectivity provides corridors. Researchers and planners have developed green space networks to protect urban biodiversity and satisfy urban residents' needs for recreation and ecologically friendly open space. This study uses RS, GIS, SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP), and Conefor Sensinode. Applying the landscape connectivity index, least-cost path model, and corridor curvature analysis to identify potential recreation and biodiversity conservation corridors with a reasonable width, identifies good quality green space patches and corridors, or which ones need improvement. The results show that: (1) The patches selected by the possible connectivity index (PC) calculated with a threshold of 100 m in the urban area of Kashgar have higher recreational attributes. (2) There are 24 effective recreational corridors in Kashgar, with a total length of 43.44 km, and 53 effective biodiversity conservation corridors, a total of 78.23 km. Suppose recreational and ecological functions are considered to build a comprehensive green space network. The 50 m recreational corridor is mainly distributed in the center, and the 30 m biodiversity conservation corridor is primarily distributed on edge. (3) We can determine the location of the new green space suitable for protection or development by analyzing the corridor curvature. Through the constructed green space network, we can find that green space planning has severe fragmentation, unfair distribution, and other problems. Based on these issues, optimizing urban green space can promote the connectivity of urban green space. Furthermore, studying the width of corridors suitable for dense urban areas is conducive to protecting urban biodiversity and resident well-being.

AB  - Accelerated urbanization and population growth lead to the fragmentation of urban green space and loss of biodiversity. There are few studies on the integration of structural and functional connectivity to solve this problem. Our study aims to draw up a methodology to synthesize two methods of connectivity evaluation, accordingly, to construct an urban green infrastructure (UGI) network which is of great significance to maintain the stability of the urban ecosystem. Taking Beijing as a study area, we first used Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to identify the source patches, then combined with the graph theory-based landscape metrics to discuss the effect of different diffusion distances on the regional landscape connectivity and classify the importance level of the source patches. Finally, we used both least-cost path (LCP) and circuit theory to construct network and identify pinch areas in corridors for network optimization. The results show that (1) the landscape connectivity of the study area is obviously polarized. Source patches in mountain and hilly areas have good ecological bases and large areas, and the density of corridors is relatively high, which makes a large contribution to the overall landscape connectivity; Source patches in plain areas are severely fragmented, and there are only a small number of potential corridors connecting urban areas and suburban areas. (2) The UGI network is composed of 70 source patches and 148 potential corridors. The diffusion distance that is most beneficial to improve landscape connectivity is 20-25 km. (3) 6 pinch areas that are of great significance for improving the connectivity of the landscape present the coexistence of high migration resistance and large optimization potential, and urgently need to be restored first. This study provides a method to combine the structural and the functional analysis to construct a UGI network and formulate more scientifical protection strategies for planning departments.

AB  - More than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase. Even if urbanisation is widely regarded as a major threat to global biodiversity, recent research highlighted the potential ecological importance of cities for pollinators. Key determinants of cities' ability to sustain pollinators are the presence of green areas and the connectivity between them. However, also temperature is expected to be of primary importance for pollinator activities. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of temperature, open habitat cover, and distance from the city centre on wild bee communities in the city of Rome (Italy). We selected 36 sites along two statistically independent gradients of temperature and open habitat cover, and we sampled wild bee communities using pan-traps for 4 months. Then, we measured functional traits of wild bee species, that is, body size, social behaviour, nesting strategy, and diet breadth. Temperature emerged as the main driver of wild bee communities, with communities richer in species and individuals at warmer temperatures. We found little species replacement between cold and warm sites. In addition, with increasing temperatures, bee communities were dominated by polylectic and small-bodied species. Here, we showed that in a highly urbanised environment, temperature shapes pollinator communities irrespective of other landscape metrics. Even if warming seemed beneficial for urban pollinator abundance and richness, it might strongly homogenise bee communities by selecting for those traits that make species more easily adaptable.

AB  - Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Urban landscapes, though a primary contributor to habitat fragmentation, have the potential to facilitate habitat connectivity for native pollinator species, especially with strategic green space planning. Citizen science data have been proven to be useful to address conservation issues in urban areas, especially where knowledge is lacking about species richness and habitat preferences. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul, with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities, and what parts of the city facilitated habitat connectivity. We found that the most suitable habitats for multiple families were located in public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. These results are directly applicable in order to better understand urban planning stakes for pollinators and wildlife in general and provide avenues for improvement to recreate functional greenways in a dense city like Seoul. The preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas. Innovative urban planning and architecture are therefore required as well as the setting-up of ecological management practices to lead to a more sustainable urbanism for pollinators and wildlife in general.

AB  - The development of road networks over the years has caused serious damage to biodiversity. However, few studies have explored the impact of different road grades on ecological network connectivity, especially at multiple levels and at different dispersal distances. Here, we propose an analytical framework based on the integrated graph theory and the circuit theory method, in order to model the ecological network of virtual species, to evaluate connectivity at the landscape, patch, and corridor levels, and to identify the key patches and key corridors that contribute the most to the maintenance of connectivity. The empirical analysis in this study was performed on six scenarios, which were designed by successively integrating different road grades into the landscape. On this basis, the impact of different road grades on the connectivity, key patches, and key corridors in Wuhan, China, were explored. The results showed that: (1) High-grade roads have a significant impact on landscape-patch-corridor connectivity, while medium-grade roads have a similar degree of impact on patch-level connectivity as high-grade roads do. (2) Species with long dispersal ability (25 km) are susceptible to roads at the landscape and corridor levels; species with low and medium dispersal abilities (10, 15 and 20 km) are vulnerable to roads at the patch levels. (3) The importance of key patches and the resistance of key corridors are signifi-cantly increased by the influence of roads, while their spatial distribution changes slightly. This integrated framework contributes to an evaluation of the impacts of different grades road on ecological processes, so as to better provide targeted suggestions for biodiversity conservation and transportation planning.

AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to urbanization. However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.

AB  - Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be species-specific differences in response. We detected 14 non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types. Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management in an era of global change.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) can provide social and ecological benefits, and the coordination of these two functions will largely advance human-nature harmony in cities. As such, we proposed a comprehensive framework to evaluate UGSs multifunctionality, i.e. the coupling coordination relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGSs. Wuhan City in Central China was taken as a case study, and multiple ecosystem service values of green space patches and the disordered use of UGSs multifunctionality were explored. The results demonstrated low-level coupling coordination of UGSs multifunctionality in Wuhan. More than 70% of UGSs were imbalanced, 27.91% of which featured small sizes, low connectivity and accessibility. We suggest that planners should optimize UGSs arrangement to improve species reachability, especially for species with dispersal distance less than 4 km, and to create 15-minute community life circles for residents at the same time. Our findings are expected to support the promotion of UGSs multifunctionality and the balance of urban development and habitat conservation.

AB  - Urbanization can have profound consequences for mammalian biodiversity and is thought to contribute to patterns of species richness and community composition. Large cities can be particularly challenging environments for mammals because these habitats are often impacted by anthropogenic perturbations, including high human population density, fragmented habitats, and extensive human development. In this study, we investigated mammalian species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and evenness in the most densely populated region in the United States: the New York metropolitan area. Specifically, we deployed camera traps from 2015 to 2019 to investigate six drivers of mammalian diversity across 31 greenspaces: (1) human population density, (2) patch size, (3) habitat type, (4) surrounding land cover, (5) geographical barriers to dispersal, and (6) habitat heterogeneity. We found that mammal community composition is largely influenced by a multitude of anthropogenic factors. Specifically, mammal species richness was higher in greenspaces with larger patch sizes and lower in greenspaces surrounded by more development. Moreover, Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness were higher in urban natural landscapes than human-altered landscapes. In a subset of data that only included carnivores, we found that carnivore Shannon-Wiener diversity was higher in urban natural habitats and in sites with lower human population densities. Finally, we found that geographical barriers to dispersal contributed to both patterns of mammalian diversity and patterns of carnivore diversity: mammal taxa richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and evenness were all significantly higher on the continent (Bronx/Westchester) than on Long Island. These results suggest that preserving urban greenspaces is important for maintaining both mammalian and carnivore biodiversity and that management of mammals in cities should concentrate on maintaining large, connected, natural greenspaces.

AB  - Increasing urbanization degrades quantity, quality, and the functionality of spatial cohesion of natural areas essential to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. The uncontrolled pace of building activity and the erosion of blue (i.e., aquatic) and green (i.e., terrestrial) landscape elements threaten existing habitat ranges and movability of wildlife. Local scale measures, such as nature-inspired engineered Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are emerging mitigation solutions. Originally planned to promote sustainable stormwater management, adaptation to climate change and improved human livability in cities, such instruments offer interesting syn-ergies for biodiversity in support of existing ecological infrastructure. BGI are especially appealing for globally declining amphibians, a rich and diverse vertebrate assemblage sensitive to urbanization. We integrated bio-logical and highly resolved urban-rural land-cover data, ensemble models of habitat suitability, and connectivity models based on circuit theory to improve multi-scale and multi-species protection of core habitats and ecological corridors in the Swiss lowlands. Considering a broad spectrum of amphibian biodiversity, we iden-tified distributions of amphibian biodiversity hotspots and four landscape elements essential to amphibian movability at the regional scale, namely i) forest edges, ii) wet-forest habitats, iii) soils with variable moisture and iv) riparian zones. Our work shows that cities can make a substantial contribution (e.g., up to 15% of urban space in the study area) to wider landscape habitat connectivity. We highlight the importance of planning BGI locally in strategic locations across urban and peri-urban areas to promote the permeability and availability of 'stepping stone' habitats in densely populated landscapes, essential to the maintenance of regional habitat connectivity and thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.

AB  - Biodiversity in urban green areas has been widely explored in several bird studies because birds are known to be important bio-indicators. Many studies have investigated the different responses of bird communities to ur-banization and land use changes in urban environments. However, there are still important knowledge gaps related to the impacts of the heterogeneity, spatial structure, and connectivity of green areas on avian diversity. Such information is needed for sustainable urban planning. In this study, we focused on the comparison of bird communities between urban parks in the heritage city of Olomouc and hardwood floodplain forests in the vi-cinity of the city. The results of the study indicate the high importance of urban parks for the maintenance of bird diversity even though urban parks are man-made habitats. The results highlight the importance of some native vegetation structures in urban parks (old trees, bush ecotones) for maintaining urban bird biodiversity. Some implications of the results can be widely used as a decision support tool for the management of urban green areas and for the planning of ecological networks in urban landscapes.

AB  - Global urbanization has resulted in local habitat fragmentation, influencing ecological processes and biodiversity conservation. However, little is known about the diversity and distribution of microbial communities across urban biotopes. Here, we compared testate amoeba communities in Moscow (63 samples from five urban parks) and Xiamen (69 samples from six urban parks) across four biotopes (tree hole, moss, soil, and sediment) to better understand microbial diversity and ecological processes shaping microbial communities. A total of 116 morphospecies (31 genera), corresponding to 90 in Moscow and 84 in Xiamen, were identified using light microscopy. The species richness per sample (mean +/- standard error) was higher in Moscow parks (14 +/- 1 species, n = 63) than Xiamen parks. The mean species richness per biotope was highest in the mosses (13 +/- 1 species, n = 33). 13-26% of the total species richness was shared by all biotopes, indicating the ubiquitous distribution of testate amoeba morphospecies. The community composition in different biotopes markedly differed in both Moscow and Xiamen regions. Community connectivity varied among biotopes, and community complexity and dynamics were substantially stronger in soil and sediment. The stochastic processes explained a significantly high percentage of community composition in all biotopes (57-81%) in 11 parks. The standardized effect size for C-score in all biotopes changed from 1.48 to 6.92, indicating the enhanced significance of deterministic processes for the testate amoeba communities. The different relative importance of stochastic or deterministic processes in four studied biotopes suggests that factors influencing the testate amoeba communities greatly vary across heterogeneous urban environments.

AB  - Urban expansion is a major threat to diversity, especially in rapidly developing tropical countries where urban areas are growing at great pace and protection is limited. We conducted a systematic review of published research on the ecology of lentic habitats in tropical urban areas. The review focused on understanding: (1) how much is currently known about the biodiversity of these habitats; (2) whether this knowledge is biased towards certain taxonomic groups and/or geographic areas; (3) what is known about the factors influencing their diversity; and (4) which ecosystem services urban lentic habitats provide. The review aimed to establish whether existing knowledge is sufficient to help guide conservation and provide evidence to policy makers of the importance of conserving tropical urban wetlands. We found 64 papers that addressed questions about the diversity and/or distribution of lentic ecosystems within tropical urban areas. Papers came from 15 countries, although almost half (45%) were from India; relatively few countries from Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, or South America were represented in the literature. Publication patterns revealed a growing interest in urban wetlands, but several biases and gaps were evident from the review. Firstly, papers generally focused on larger natural or semi-natural wetlands, with other types and sizes of lentic habitat under-represented in published work. Secondly, most papers focused on a single site, with a limited number of multi-site, city-wide, or landscape-scale diversity assessments. Thirdly, studies tended to focus on understanding the influence of water quality on diversity, with work assessing the influence of physical habitat or factors related to dispersal and connectivity very limited. Finally, work assessing the ecosystem services provided by wetlands in tropical urban areas remains narrow in focus, with few quantitative assessments of the relationship between ecological characteristics and ecosystem functions and services. We suggest a number of research focal points and approaches to help address these biases. Research is needed to improve understanding of the distribution patterns tropical freshwater species in urban areas and of the relationships between species diversity and a wider set of environmental and spatial conditions. Overall, there is a need for diversity assessments of tropical urban wetlands of all types and sizes, especially new and novel habitats, and scope for much greater adoption of ecosystem service concepts and evaluation tools to help emphasise the importance of these habitats.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has intensified habitat fragmentation and shrinkage of waterbirds, threat-ening the sustainable development of waterbird diversity. Urban waterbird restoration can be achieved by considering suburban waterbirds as the source of restoration of urban waterbird diversity and by overcoming the separation between urban and suburban populations. Optimal design of ecological corridors is the most effective approach to facilitate movement of waterbirds. However, three challenges to applying ecological corridors to urban waterbird diversity resto-ration remain: (1)identifying focal species for the ecological corridor network; (2)identifying nodes in the ecological corridor; (3) assigning priority for design of the different areas in the corridor. The aim of this study was to develop methods to resolve these challenges using the design of a waterbird ecological corridor in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in Southern China as a case study. Under the proposed methods, it is hoped that waterbird re-covery will occur in the city, characterized by a complex three-dimensional space, thereby pro-moting an increase in urban waterbird diversity.

AB  - The proximity to transportation hubs and the large movement of goods and people in cities make trees especially prone to invasive insect pests. Urban tree arrangements, in isolated tree sites or in forest patches, may alter their susceptibility to insect herbivory. Surprisingly little is known about how urban tree spatial arrangements influence pest abundance and top-down regulation by natural enemies. We sampled the abundance of an invasive pest of Eucalyptus, the psyllid Glycaspis brimblecombei, and of two of its natural enemies, the specialist exotic parasitoid Psyllaephagus bliteus and the generalist native predator Anthocoris nemoralis over two years. We measured insect abundances in isolated trees versus monospecific planted forest patches in 17 pairs of sites, each within a Portuguese city. The abundance of the exotic pest was three-fold higher in forest patches than in isolated trees. The parasitism rate was similar to 30 times higher in forest patches (11.5 %) than in isolated trees (0.4 %). The interdependence among insect species abundances also differed between spatial arrangements. In isolated trees, predator and parasitoid abundances depended markedly on prey abundance. In forest patches, we found a marked dependence of the predator on the composition of the surrounding landscape. Our study adds empirical data indicating that urban tree isolation matters for pest abundance and regulation by its enemies. In similar systems, avoiding dense monospecific patches of exotic trees and increasing the compositional heterogeneity of the landscape are promising paths to maintain the sustainability of urban trees and their environmental and societal benefits.

AB  - Green roofs provide many ecosystem services, but little is known about the way they contribute to urban functional connectivity. This paper has the following four objectives: (1) to compare the potential green roofs' role to connectivity in relation to other urban green spaces, (2) to specify the green roofs contribution's type, (3) to explore the influence of building height integration method and finally (4) to assess the impact on connectivity of simulated greening new roofs. Using a landscape graph approach, we modeled ecological networks of three species groups with different dispersion capacities in the Paris region (France). Then, we computed several connectivity metrics to assess the potential contribution of green roofs to functional connectivity. At a large scale (metropole scale), our results show that green roofs can slightly improve the global connectivity largely through the connections rather than the addition of habitat area. More than a stepping stone function, green roofs would have a dispersion flux function at a local scale. Furthermore, when the difficulty of crossing movement is exponential to the height of buildings, green roofs over 20 m high are mostly disconnected from the ecological networks. In addition to the green roof's height, our analysis highlights the very strong role played by buildings' configuration. This study raises promising directions for the integration of building height into the analysis of urban connectivity. Detailed research and long-term biological data from green roofs and green spaces are needed to confirm our results.

AB  - Urban landscapes are rapid changing ecosystems with diverse urban forms that impede the movement of organisms. Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape connectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and object based image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations. Thus, the combination of this reproductible remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a very fine scale provides new insights into the characterisation of ecological networks for conservation planning.

AB  - Green roof soils are usually engineered for purposes other than urban biodiversity, which may impact their fungal communities, and in turn impact the health of plants in the urban ecosystem. We examined the drivers of fungal diversity and community composition in soil of green roofs and adjacent ground-level green spaces in three Midwestern USA cities-Chicago, Cleveland, and Minneapolis. Overall, fungal communities on green roofs were more diverse than ground-level green spaces and were correlated with plant cover (positively) and roof age (negatively) rather than abiotic soil properties. Fungal community composition was distinct between roof and ground environments, among cities, and between sampling sites, but green roofs and their immediately surrounding ground-level green space showed some similarity. This suggests dispersal limitation may result in geographic structuring at large spatial scales, but dispersal between roofs and their neighbouring sites may be occurring. Different fungal taxonomic and functional groups were better explained when roofs were classified either by depth (extensive or intensive) or functional intent of the roof design (i.e. stormwater/energy, biodiversity, or aesthetics/recreation). Our results demonstrate that green roofs are an important reservoir of fungal diversity in the urban landscape, which should be considered in future green roof design.

AB  - Green roofs are often installed atop buildings to provide ecological services such as mitigating storm water runoff and cooling air within urban heat islands. We found that green roofs in Portland, Oregon, also can support biodiversity, including a diverse assemblage of parasitoid wasps, with 20 morphospecies from 10 families present on the four roofs we surveyed. The roofs with greater plant diversity and structural complexity harbored comparatively more parasitoid morphospecies than the structurally simpler Sedum-dominated roofs. The oldest green roof supported much greater diversity than the younger roofs, including a comparably planted roof three times its size. Parasitoid wasps from the Hymenopteran families we found are high-trophic-level organisms known to feed on a variety of arthropods, including many insects commonly considered to be pests in urban areas. We suggest that green roofs have the potential to provide an often-overlooked ecological service by supporting parasitoid wasps that can act as natural biological control agents.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts in cities are becoming increasingly common worldwide and are a challenge to urban biodiversity management and landscape planning. In comparison to compensatory management, which often focuses on addressing emergency conflicts, precautionary management allows decision-makers to better allocate limited resources on prioritized areas and initiate long-term actions in advance. However, precautionary approaches have rarely been developed or applied in biodiversity conservation. Since 2020, human-raccoon dog conflicts in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the world, have tripled in reported number due to the rapid spread of the species in the city from 70 residential districts in 2020 to 249 residential districts in 2022. Here, we use ensemble and circuit modeling to predict suitable raccoon dog habitat and identify their potential dispersal pathways to aid the development of precautionary management strategies. We find that raccoon dog distribution is positively associated with several anthropogenic factors, including residential buildings and nighttime light, which could be signs that the species' foraging behavior has adapted to the urban environment. We find that raccoon dogs only occupy 10.1% of its suitable habitat, and thus there is a high potential for the expansion of the raccoon dog population and more frequent human-raccoon dog conflicts in the near future. We predict 60 potential dispersal pathways across Shanghai, seven of which cross densely human populated areas and are likely to trigger excessive conflicts. Based on our findings, we propose priority areas where precautionary management strategies, such as constraining stray animal feeding and wildlife-vehicle collision prevention, would potentially alleviate human-raccoon dog conflicts. We present the first study on the precautionary approach of human-wildlife conflict in China's major cities, and provide a practical example of how comprehensive modeling approaches can be used as the foundation of precautionary management in urban landscapes.

AB  - Landscape pattern significantly impacts habitat quality, especially in cities undergoing rapid urbanization, where landscape patterns are changing dramatically. However, the spatial and temporal driving mechanisms of land-scape pattern on habitat quality are still unclear, and the proposed methods of Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) and Multiscale Geographic Weighted Regression (MGWR) provide possibilities for the exploration of these mechanisms. This study was conducted in Nanjing from 2001 to 2020. Landscape pattern indices indicating aggregation, connectivity, diversity and compactness were calculated using Fragstats from 2001 to 2020. The habitat quality was computed using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. By combining two new spatial measurement models, GTWR and MGWR, the spatial and temporal driving mechanisms of landscape patterns on habitat quality were explored. The results show that (1) as Nanjing's land under construction has expanded, habitat quality has decreased significantly, and the overall landscape pattern has fluctuated drastically. (2) GTWR and MGWR are well-suited to such analysis and provide important insights. (3) Overall, aggregation and compactness were negatively associated with habitat quality in areas of low-quality habitat. Increased connectivity on low habitat substrates had a positive effect on habitat. The increase of diversity in proximity had a positive effect on habitat, while the opposite was true in high habitat zones. (4) As the urbanization level increases, the negative effects of aggregation expand, as do the positive effects of connectivity and diversity. (5) The extent of influence of landscape pattern effects are ranked from largest to smallest: compactness, diversity, connectivity, and aggregation, while the intensity of effects is reversed. Based on these findings, a reference point for urban planners is provided to plan urban landscape patterns in a sustainable and rational manner. It also provides a new means of integrating GTWR and MGWR into the study of landscape ecology.

AB  - Urban watersheds can play a critical role in supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services in a rapidly changing world. However, managing for multiple environmental and social objectives in urban landscapes is challenging, espe-cially if the optimization of one ecosystem service conflicts with another. Urban ecology research has frequently been limited to a few indicators - typically either biodiversity or ecosystem service indices - making tradeoffs and synergies difficult to assess. Through a recently established watershed-scale monitoring network in Central Texas, we address this gap by evaluating biodiversity (flora and fauna), habitat quality, and ecosystem service indices of urban green spaces across the watershed. Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity in biodiversity and ecosystem service levels and multiple synergies (stacked benefits or "win-wins"). For example, we found that carbon sequestration positively correlated with tree species richness and the proportion of native trees in a green space, indicating that biodiversity goals for increased tree diversity can also provide carbon sequestration benefits. We also documented correlations between green spaces with greater riparian forest cover and lower particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and cooler temperatures. In addition, we found that bee and wasp species richness was positively correlated with carbon seques-tration and human visitation rates, meaning that urban green spaces can optimize carbon sequestration goals without

AB  - Cities in China support higher human population densities compared to those in western countries; consequently, the high pressure placed on cultural ecosystem services (CES) provision of residential green spaces might hinder overall human wellbeing and the maintenance of avian diversity. Thus, this study aimed to identify how to meet the main preferences of citizens for residential green spaces while simultaneously enhancing bird diversity in city neighborhoods, generating a win-win scenario for human needs and biodiversity. This study was implemented using 568 questionnaires for residents and GLMM for bird-environment statistical analyses. Residents in Beijing preferred higher levels of bird species richness than individual abundance in neighborhoods. Residential green space appeared to serve as the movement corridor for some rare species, indicating the importance of promoting the presence of migrant bird guilds, which is currently incidental. The cultivation of fruit-bearing shrubby plants was supported by most city residents, and would also promote the presence of migratory birds in green spaces. In contrast, while increasing the width of residential green spaces would benefit migratory birds, it had less public support. This multi-disciplinary study clearly demonstrated that both the quality of life of humans in cities and biodiversity conservation could be efficiently incorporated in green space plans, even under highly urbanized circumstances.

AB  - As the foundation and skeleton of urban space, the street network is significant to the urban travel environment and socio-economic activities. To reveal the structural characteristics of the street network, this paper proposes a measurement index system to study the street network structure and urban travel characteristics. To illustrate the relationship between spatial accessibility of streets in strip cities and residents' travel and service demands, we take Lanzhou, a typical strip city, as an example for network analysis and study the hierarchical structure of physical, functional, and environmental characteristics of the street topological network. The results show that Lanzhou City has formed a radial network structure with traffic-oriented streets as the backbone and interconnected living streets. However, the development of old and new urban areas is still uneven. In terms of street function distribution, streets with a high degree of diversity are more attractive to population clustering and show a polycentric clustering feature in space related to the regional functional orientation and travel characteristics. Much of the structural difference in the centrality core-periphery of the street network under pedestrian and vehicular travel patterns are influenced by the street's type and function. In addition, as part of the contribution, we provide an evaluation methodology that enables the analysis of street network centrality. These findings advance our understanding of strip city development.

AB  - Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict in urban environments.

AB  - Understanding the effects of local habitat and wider landscape connectivity factors on tick presence, nymph density and Borrelia species (spp.) prevalence in the tick population is important for identifying the public health risk from Lyme borreliosis. This multi-city study collected data in three southern England cities (Bath, Bristol, and Southampton) during spring, summer, and autumn in 2017. Focusing specifically on urban green space used for recreation which were clearly in urbanised areas, 72 locations were sampled. Additionally, geospatial datasets on urban green space coverage within 250 m and 1 km of sampling points, as well as distance to woodland were incorporated into statistical models. Distance to woodland was negatively associated with tick presence and nymph density, particularly during spring and summer. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect between habitat and season for tick presence and nymph density, with woodland habitat having greater tick presence and nymph density during spring. Borrelia spp. infected Ixodes ricinus were found in woodland, woodland edge and under canopy habitats in Bath and Southampton. Overall Borrelia spp. prevalence in nymphs was 2.8%, similar to wider UK studies assessing prevalence in Ixodes ricinus in rural areas. Bird-related Borrelia genospecies dominated across sites, suggesting bird reservoir hosts may be important in urban green space settings for feeding and infecting ticks. Whilst overall density of infected nymphs across the three cities was low (0.03 per 100 m2), risk should be further investigated by incorporating data on tick bites acquired in urban settings, and subsequent Lyme borreliosis transmission.

AB  - Question The harsh geophysical template characterized by the urban environment combined with people's choices has led ecologists to invoke environmental filtering as the main ecological phenomenon explaining urban biodiversity patterns. Yet, dispersal is often overlooked as a driving factor, especially on expanding vacant land. Does overcoming dispersal limitation by seeding native species in urban environments and increasing the functional or phylogenetic diversity of the seeding pool increase native plant species diversity and abundance in urban vacant land? Location Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Methods We took an experimental approach to learn how different dimensions of plant biodiversity within a regional species pool augmented via seed additions, can explain variation in community structure over a three-year period. Vacant lots were cleared and manipulated with seeding treatments of high or low phylogenetic and functional diversities from a pool of 28 native species. Establishment success, total native cover and native-species richness were followed and compared to cleared, unseeded control lots as well as unmanipulated lots. Results Seeding increased native plant abundance and richness over uncleared plots, as well as cleared and unseeded control plots. Phylogenetically diverse seed mixtures had greater establishment success than mixtures composed of closely related species. Diversifying seed mixtures increased the likelihood of including species that are better able to establish on vacant land. However, there were no differences in varying levels of either functional or phylogenetic diversity. Conclusions Augmenting the regional species pool via diverse seed mixtures can enhance native plant cover and richness under the harsh environmental conditions conferred by land abandonment.

AB  - Urban growth seriously threatens biodiversity worldwide. I present an exhaustive review of the impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity. In particular, I focus on the relative contributions of distinct components of urban sprawl (i e., urban area, dispersion degree and land use intensity) to the impacts on biodiversity for different taxonomic and ecological groups classified according to species characteristics and functional traits that are expected to be sensitive to urbanization. I also show how functional structure and assembly patterns of biological communities respond to urbanization at broad spatial scales. Urban sprawl mostly relates to the homogenization of species assemblages. Urban area has the strongest impacts, but the intensity of urban land use and the degree of dispersion of urban areas significantly contributes to these impacts. Responses to urbanization are greatly affected by species mobility, specialization degree and their interaction. Urbanization modifies community assembly patterns and drives marked trait-dependent compositional changes in species assemblages. This results in biotic homogenization, low functional redundancy and diversity levels, and potentially reduces ecological resilience. Impacts of urban sprawl impacts are expected to be especially harmful when it reaches sites of high conservation value due to the species and habitats they host, such as protected areas. I present an analysis of the degree of urbanization in Nature 2000 protected sites over the recent past, which shows an incipient urban sprawl into this protection network.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most intensive threats to biodiversity worldwide. The rapid sprawl of urban settings often comprises a drastic landscape transformation due to the replacement of natural vegetation by impervious surfaces. However, cities can serve as critical refuges for some native fauna, particularly for pollinators. Here we used citizen data to contrast the structure of hummingbird-plant meta-networks across different greenspaces (natural protected areas, urban parks, urban gardens and street trees areas) in a tropical megacity. We compiled hummingbird-plant visitation records in Mexico City available in two citizen science resources: iNaturalist and eBird. We first determined whether the retrieved dataset was representative to estimate network metrics by calculating sample coverage and estimating species richness in different greenspaces. Then, we characterized network structure and plant importance for network organization according to plant origin, life form and pollination syndrome. We recorded 17 hummingbirds visiting 84 plant species, encompassing a total of 742 interactions. Natural protected areas and urban parks showed a higher richness of hummingbirds and plants. All networks had low levels of connectance, specialization, and nestedness. Modularity was significant across all networks with higher values in natural protected areas and urban gardens. Native and introduced plant species showed a similar contribution to network organization. Non-ornithophilous plants were most important in natural protected areas, while tree species were most important in street trees greenspaces. Our results provide evidence of generalization of hummingbird-plant networks in urban areas. Introduced species and nonornithophilous plants were equally important for hummingbirds, suggesting an integration of alien plants with no specialized bird pollination traits into ecological networks in urban scenarios. Promoting conservation initiatives as pollinator gardens with key native species for hummingbirds across the city could contribute to the functional connectivity and restoration of ecological interactions in cities.

AB  - University campuses, as important elements of urban greenery, are related with a positive impact on student health and well-being. They provide unique possibilities for estimating biodiversity change. This study focused on the biodiversity in the Campus. The study aimed at: assessing the plant biodiversity occurring in the park: assessing the representation of native species and determining the frequency at which invasive species occur: as well as recommending an adaptation of the park management. The Park was sub-divided into biotopes and a phytocoenological releve was recorded. Park projects create biodiversity islands that may contribute to improve urban space. A species composition that is close to natural vegetation creates a space for native species, which thus better adapt to living in urban conditions. Localities created by humans, which imitate natural ecosystems. increase the biodiversity and are valuable natural islands in cities. The semi-natural phytocoenoses however, do not resist the occurrence of invasive plant species. Regarding the small size of the studied park, manual elimination or cutting of invasive plant species is sufficient.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation and structural changes are associated with spatial ecological and social processes. Landscape fragmentation modeling and land use distribution analysis provide a framework within which landscape pattern and structure can be studied and quantified. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing urban agglomeration in China and due to the speedy socioeconomic development and urban expansion, the landscape became more diverse, fragmented, and complex in land use, structure, and shape. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area based on the 40 years' time-series remote sensing data (19802020), fragmentation modeling, and structure change analysis. We used the fragmentation analysis at category and patch level and analyzed the fragmentation over forest, cropland, and grassland. We further employed the economic model of spatial Lorenz Curve and Gini Index for estimating the distribution of land use land cover (LULC) categories and structure changes. The results indicated that the landscape pattern indices of Greater Bay Area as whole, and its eleven cities had an obvious variations and diversity during 1980 to 2020. However, the diffusion and coalescence processes in each city follow distinct patterns. Due to the anthropogenic modifications, the landscape pattern and structural complexity increased gradually during the study period.

AB  - As a form of green infrastructure, green roofs can enhance urban biodiversity by providing complex vegetation structures, supplying increased foraging and roosting opportunities for animals and increasing habitat connectivity. Although it is widely believed that green roofs can promote urban biodiversity, this idea has not been widely studied on an empirical scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding of the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity from different perspectives is still lacking. Here we provide a systematic review of the empirical literature on the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity. The results suggest that green roofs benefit urban biodiversity to some extent but cannot replace quondam natural habitats or complex artificial greening environments. Additionally, the studies reviewed here focused primarily on the diversity of plants or arthropods and were conducted almost exclusively in the United States and the United Kingdom. Moreover, most studies investigating the factors of green roofs affecting biodiversity focused on roof area, height, age, substrate depth, and plant community. To improve our understanding of the relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity, more extensive research, particularly in developing countries, as well as more in-depth studies of a greater number of species and taxa, including chordates, mollusks and microbes, from different perspectives (e.g. at the genetic level) and other potential pathways are needed. In the future, the density, distribution pattern, distance and location relationship between different green roofs should be considered in an integrated manner. In order to more effectively support urban biodiversity, green roofs should be used in conjunction with other urban green spaces.

AB  - Urbanization and agricultural intensification are the main drivers of biodiversity losses through multiple stressors, especially habitat fragmentation, isolation and loss. Designing Blue and Green Infrastructure Networks (BGIN) has been recommended as a potential tool for land-use planning to increase ecosystem services while preserving biodiversity. All municipalities in France are required to perform BGIN planning. This article focuses on the Couesnon watershed (Brittany, France) and the participatory process used to define and analyze five possible pathways of future land-use and land-cover changes that included implementation of BGINs. Impacts on biodiversity were estimated by quantifying the change in landscape connectivity of woodlands, grasslands and wetlands. The effectiveness of BGIN policies was assessed by comparing current landscape connectivity (2018) to those in possible futures. Landscape connectivity referred to functional connectivity for three indicator species (Abax parallelepipedus, Maniola jurtina and Arvicola sapidus) across three landscape features: woodlands, grass-lands and wetlands, respectively. Results allowed impacts of urban and agricultural land-use changes to be identified in terms of extent and quality. If BGIN policies were applied effectively to control the expansion of gray infrastructure, they would help increase the area and the quality of grassland and woodland connectivity by no more than 2%. Agricultural land-use and land-cover changes could have more impact on the extent of grassland (-82% to +38%) and wetland (-49% to +47%) connectivity. Current and future trends for hedgerows implied a decrease in woodland connectivity of 9.8-33.8%. Impacts on the quality of landscape connectivity is not pro-portional with the extent, as a decrease of the latter can have relatively more negative impacts on the former, and inversely. The study highlights that the BGIN strategy can preserve landscape connectivity effectively in urban ecosystems, where human density is higher, but can be threatened by agricultural intensification.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the primary forces driving worldwide pollinator decline. Moderate urban expansion with appropriate green space planning can help in maintaining pollinator diversity and pollination service. We investigated the relative effects of landscape and local factors on the diversity of flower-visitor functional groups in a moderately urbanized city, Wuhan, located in central China. We found that the proportion of impervious surface had no significant effect on the number of visitations, but it was negatively associated with the diversity of flower-visitor groups. The number of visitations by Halictidae and Lepidoptera correlated positively with local flower density and flowering plant species richness, respectively. Flowering plant species richness was also positively correlated with the diversity of flower-visitor groups. The proportion of green space was negatively associated with the visitation number of Muscidae and the overall diversity of flower-visitor groups, revealing the potential influence of green space quality on pollinator assemblage. The pollination networks under three urbanization levels (with a total of 11 flower visitor groups and 43 plant species) were asymmetric, highly nested, and generalized. The suburb sites contained the highest diversity of interactions. Core flowering plants (Oenothera speciosa, Coreopsis grandiflora and Cyanus segetum) are exotic species with attractive flowers. Improving green space quality (high flower density and flowering plant species richness) and using attractive native flowering plants (Nandina domestica, Rosa chinensis, Astragalus sinicus, Cirsium arvense var. integrifolium, and Zabelia biflora) would enhance the function of urban green space to maintain pollinator diversity and ecosystem stability.

AB  - Neotropical forested landscapes have become agricultural areas and human settlements, causing forest fragmentation, land degradation, and habitat loss. Nonetheless, complex tree cover loss and recovery processes may occur even while urban areas expand. Biophysical, social, political, and economic drivers influence forest loss or recovery over time. This study analyzes land-use change dynamics in urban and peri-urban landscapes in the western sector of Xalapa City between 1966-2018 and identifies the primary drivers that have played a significant role in deforestation and forest recovery processes. The main finding denotes the city's expansion between 1966 and 2018, initially covering 8% of the study area and increasing to 27%. However, between 1966 and 2018, 15% of forest cover was lost in net terms, a finding ascribed to forest recovery in some abandoned areas. Social and biophysical variables significantly influenced deforestation and forest recovery trends, and few variables were singular to one process. The deceleration of forest loss and accomplishing tree cover recovery are possible in some urban settings. In this context, green urban and peri-urban landscapes become strategic to achieve more sustainable cities. Among other benefits, green areas provide landscape connectivity, temperature regulation, air quality improvement, noise dampening, and recreational areas.

AB  - The remaining historical forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in urban areas. However, the integrity and stability of historical forests are affected by land-use/cover change. A better understanding of these impacts can help prioritize protection and restoration. In this study, we estimated the loss of area and levels of threats and analyzed the importance of critical areas for historical forests in the built-up area of a rapidly urbanizing city-Guiyang, China. We used the threat indicator, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and probability of connectivity based on InVEST, GuidosToolbox, and Conefor software. The results based on remote sensing image classification showed that 1988.46 ha of historical forestlands was transformed into other land-use/cover types. The mean value of the threat index of all the historical forest patches increased by 33% compared to the baseline year. The area of cores and bridges, considered as key nodes and links for the connectivity of forest networks, decreased by 193.32 and 353.61 ha, respectively. Most of the critical areas with high importance values for connectivity were located in the central part of the city and were severely threatened by the surrounding areas. We recommend that effective measures be implemented to control the further loss of historical forests and to increase the connectivity and buffering capacity of the remaining forests by creating tree belts and corridors in key locations.

AB  - Aims Grassland plant species diversity is affected by local, temporal and landscape environmental factors, but what is the relative importance of those factors? Understanding this is crucial for the effective conservation of grassland vegetation. We analyzed the factors affecting species richness to contribute to native species conservation and alien species management in grassland vegetation. Location Semi-natural grasslands in Shiroi City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods The species composition in 36 grasslands was surveyed in 2014. Plants were classified as native grassland specialist, other native or alien species. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were developed, with the number of species in each plant type as the response variable and local (habitat area, use of mowing management), landscape (adjacent land use, connectivity to other grassland habitats) and temporal (period for which the grassland has been preserved from development, i.e., temporal continuity) factors as explanatory variables. Other GLM were developed with the presence/absence of each species as a response variable and three factors as explanatory variables. Results Habitat area, use of mowing management and temporal continuity were most important in explaining the number of grassland specialist species and had significant positive effects on their richness. Species-based analysis identified a significant positive effect of temporal continuity on grassland specialist species. By contrast, habitat area and adjacent land use were most related to alien species richness. The number of alien species was high in grasslands adjacent to farmlands or roads. Conclusions The relative importance of temporal and spatial factors differs between native grassland specialists and alien species. Mowing is effective for the conservation of grassland specialists' species diversity, particularly in historically old grasslands. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the invasion of alien species from adjacent residential or agricultural areas.

AB  - Promoting biodiversity is a major issue in urban planning. Estimating the biodiversity potential of patches in the landscape matrix often uses the tools of spatial analysis and landscape ecology indices, especially in large study areas. In this paper, we present the construction of a composite biodiversity potential index (CBPI) based on structural and functional approaches of landscape ecology. The CBPI is composed of eight indices (quality: permeability, fragmentation, environmental management; shape: size, shape complexity; configuration: contrast between neighbouring patches, distance to the most favourable habitats, distance from built-up areas). The CBPI appears to be suitable for anthropised and fragmented landscape matrices. It can be used to identify ecological networks in an `Avoid, Reduce, Compensate' approach and can be readily updated with new map databases.

AB  - Identifying how natural (i.e., unaltered by human activity) and anthropogenic landscape variables influence contemporary functional connectivity in terrestrial organisms can elucidate the genetic consequences of environmental change. We examine population genetic structure and functional connectivity among populations of a declining species, the Blainville's horned lizard (Phrynosoma blainvillii), in the urbanized landscape of the Greater Los Angeles Area in Southern California, USA. Using single nucleotide polymorphism data, we assessed genetic structure among populations occurring at the interface of two abutting evolutionary lineages, and at a fine scale among habitat fragments within the heavily urbanized area. Based on the ecology of P. blainvillii, we predicted which environmental variables influence population structure and gene flow and used gravity models to distinguish among hypotheses to best explain population connectivity. Our results show evidence of admixture between two evolutionary lineages and strong population genetic structure across small habitat fragments. We also show that topography, microclimate, and soil and vegetation types are important predictors of functional connectivity, and that anthropogenic disturbance, including recent fire history and urban development, are key factors impacting contemporary population dynamics. Examining how natural and anthropogenic sources of landscape variation affect contemporary population genetics is critical to understanding how to best manage sensitive species in a rapidly changing landscape.

AB  - Background: It has been recognized that urban green spaces play a crucial role in providing many landscape services. The research aimed at identifying the main knowledge gaps in this framework and to support urban planning, taking into account the spatial configuration of green areas through a pilot study area, and mapping urban landscape services. Methods: In this research, (1) a systematic review, analyzed through a network analysis; (2) an urban pilot study to map the Urban Green Index and, jointly, the spatial composition and configuration of urban green areas, through the integration of three landscape metrics; and (3) the mapping of Urban Landscape Services Index have been carried out. Results: The 37% of the reviewed articles focused on regulating services, while the network analysis identified four clusters. The total Urban Green Index was 26%, and some districts showed a percentage that surpassed it. The total overall Green Connectivity Index was 21%. Some districts were the best providers of landscape services. Conclusions: This research was in line with the EU Joint Science for Policy Report suggesting giving emphasis to the spatial pattern map of green spaces in European cities to provide spatial data available for decision-makers in relation to GI deployment.

AB  - Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of "natural" habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle ("old-field"), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.

AB  - Beneficial insects provide valuable services upon which we rely, including pollination. Pollinator conservation is a global priority, and a significant concern in Ireland, where over half of extant bee species have declined significantly in recent decades. As flower-visiting insects rely on flowering plants, one way to conserve and promote pollinator populations is to protect high-quality habitat. We analyzed the structure of insect-flower interactions from multiple habitat categories in a large database of interactions from Ireland. Our primary goals were to compare spatial and temporal variation in Irish network structures, compare Irish networks to published networks from other countries, and provide evidence-based recommendations for pollinator conservation in Ireland by identifying well-visited plant species that may promote high pollinator diversity, abundance, and functional complementarity. Habitat types within Ireland differed substantially: seminatural grasslands had the highest pollinator species richness and largest number of unique pollinator species, while intensively managed habitats exhibited negative asymmetry (more plant than pollinator species). This negative asymmetry is notable because most plant-pollinator networks exhibit a positive asymmetry. Within intensively managed habitats, agricultural and urban habitats differed. Urban habitats had the highest number of non-native plant species while agricultural habitats had the lowest pollinator species richness. We also found Irish networks varied across the growing season, where July had the highest plant and insect species richness. When comparing Irish networks to published networks from other countries, we found Irish networks had a higher ratio of plant species to pollinator species, and that this difference was most evident in agricultural habitats. This ratio means the typical network asymmetry (more pollinator than plant species) was flipped (more plant than pollinator species) in the Irish network. We conclude that conserving seminatural grasslands in Ireland will be an essential component of pollinator conservation and identify thirty-five plant species important for restoring seminatural habitats.

AB  - Despite a growing literature-base devoted to document biodiversity patterns in cities, little is known about the processes that influence these patterns, and whether they are consistent over time. In particular, numerous studies have identified the capacity of cities to host a rich diversity of plant species. This trend, however, is driven primarily by introduced species, which comprise a large proportion of the urban species pool relative to natives. Using an experimental common garden study, we assessed the relative influence of local assembly processes (i.e., soil environmental filtering and competition from spontaneous urban species) on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native plant communities sampled over four seasons in 2016-2018. Taxonomic and functional diversity exhibited different responses to local processes, supporting the general conclusion that species- and trait-based measures of biodiversity offer distinct insights into community assembly dynamics. Additionally, we found that neither soil nor competition from spontaneous urban species influenced taxonomic or functional composition of native species. Functional composition, however, did shift strongly over time and was driven by community-weighted mean differences in both measured traits (maximum height, Hmax; specific leaf area, SLA; leaf chlorophyll a fluorescence, Chl a) and the relative proportions of different functional groups (legumes, annual and biennial-perennial species, C4 grasses, and forbs). By contrast, taxonomic composition only diverged between early and late seasons. Overall, our results indicate that native species are not only capable of establishing and persisting in vacant urban habitats, they can functionally respond to local filtering pressures over time. This suggests that regional dispersal limitation may be a primary factor limiting native species in urban environments. Thus, future regreening and management plans should focus on enhancing the dispersal potential of native plant species in urban environments, in order to achieve set goals for increasing native species diversity and associated ecosystem services in cities.

AB  - Biodiversity is declining through human activities and urbanisation is often seen as a particular concern. Urban settings, however, provide diverse microclimatic conditions for plants and pollinating insects, and therefore may be significant habitats for the conservation of solitary and primitively eusocial bees, a major group of pollinators. This study analysed the interactions between these bees and the plants on which they forage, using a network approach. We compared urban habitats (gardens, roadsides, and open vegetation) in a large British town with nearby nature reserves. One native plant Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) was a core generalist species visited in all habitat types. Other core plant species restricted to particular habitats include species of Geranium, Bellis, Crepis, and Ranunculus. Two generalist bee species, Anthophora plumipes and Osmia bicornis were the core visitor species within the networks. The networks were comparatively more nested in urban habitat types than nature areas, suggesting more frequent interactions between generalist and specialist species in urban areas. Network connectance, network level specialisation (H-2' index), and plant generality (network level) were not significantly different in urban and nature areas. However, visitor generality was found to be significantly higher in urban gardens than in nature areas. Careful management of common urban vegetation would be beneficial for supporting urban wild pollinators.

AB  - Urban forests and parks are essential for the maintenance of biodiversity as well as human health and well-being. Residents and tourists commonly use urban forests and parks for recreational and sport purposes, contributing to changes in vegetation. This study aimed to assess the effect of distance from formal paths on the abiotic conditions, vegetation cover, as well as ecological diversity of vascular plant species in the undergrowth of urban forests and parks. The investigations were carried out in 2021 in 10 urban forests and 10 urban parks located in Krakow (southern Poland), using a total of 400 plots (1 x 1 m) situated in close (CL) and further (FU) vicinity of formal paths. We found a positive effect of the distance from the path on the depth of the compact soil layer, vegetation cover and height of the tallest shoot in the undergrowth of urban forests and parks. On the other hand, the distance from the path had a negative effect on the number of vascular plant species in the undergrowth in both forests and parks. Forests and parks differed significantly from each other in light intensity, the content of P in soil, depth of compact soil layer, number of species, as well as in cover-abundance of species representing different life forms, dispersal types, habitat affiliations and origins. Trampling leads to low plant cover and height of the undergrowth, as well as contributing to shallow localization of the compact soil layer near paths. Human movement on paths (walking, running, biking) with accompanying pets contributes to the successful dispersal of plants, resulting in high species richness. High light intensity in urban parks enhances the total number of species, cover-abundance of meadow and grassland plants, as well as cover-abundance of hemicryptophytes. The number of alien species was higher in parks than in forests, but the cover-abundance of alien plants was higher in forests than in parks. Urban forests are more suitable for the growth and biomass production of some alien herbs than urban parks, as mowing commonly used in parks appears to be an important factor in reducing their cover abundance. Regular fertilization and irrigation contribute to the high content of phosphorus in the soil, as well as to the high cover-abundance of meadow and grassland plants in urban parks. Urban forests enhance cover abundance of plants with dispersal mechanisms of the Bidens and Lycopodium types, whereas urban parks promote cover abundance of plants with the dispersal of the Allium type. Further study is needed to confirm the role of urban forests and parks in the preservation of ancient forest species, as well as to develop an appropriate design of paths that will allow the protection of vegetation and soil in urban forests and parks.

AB  - Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19 quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden characteristics differed according to the species in question, highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of wider conservation and urban planning strategies.

AB  - As cities develop multidimensionally, regional landscape patterns and ecological network structure considerably change. Understanding spatial relationships between landscape patterns and ecological networks is important for optimising urban ecological patterns. However, actual landscape connectivity in ecological sources remain unknown, the spatial structure of ecological networks has not been quantified. In this study, the impacts of landscape pattern on ecological network evolution of the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration (CZXUA) in China was investigated. Ecological sources were identified based on morphological spatial pattern analysis, and identification methods were optimized through of threshold experiments in landscape connectivity distances in the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Ecological resistance surfaces were constructed by introducing patch-type factors, and ecological corridors were extracted based on the minimum cumulative resistance model. The ecological networks were evaluated using the gravity model, network closure index (alpha), network connectivity index (beta), and network connectivity rate index (gamma). Ecological network quality index (ENQI) quantified by the ratio of ecological security to ecological resistance was proposed. The impacts of landscape pattern on ENQI during different periods were evaluated using geographically weighted regression model. The results show that: (1) The landscape connectivity distance thresholds of CZXUA in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 were 1100 m, 1100 m, 1000 m, and 1400 m, respectively. The numbers of ecological sources and corridors were 16, 15, 14, and 14, and 120, 105, 91, and 91, respectively. During the period 1990-2020, delta of probability of connectivity (dPC) decreased while ecological resistance increased, the ecological sources and corridors in the centre of the study area decreased considerably. (2) The proportion of important corridors decreased from 40.83 % to 20.88 %, the highest ENQI value decreased from 6.0410 to 5.7513. (3) The aggregation index (AI) decrease observed for the central area of the study reduced its negative impact on ENQI. The negative impact region of largest patch index (LPI) on ENQI gradually connected, while the increase in patch density (PD) in habitat patches increased ENQI. The enclave-like outward expansion of construction land followed by internal mosaic filling initially strengthened, then weakened the impact of the mean perimeter-to-area ratio (PARA_MN) on ENQI. The homogenization of patches in the central area of the study extended the Shannon's diversity index (SHDI)-positive impact range on ENQI. These results are expected to serve as a reference for studies of urban ecological networks evaluation.

AB  - The Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a new approach for dealing with biodiversity conservation based on maintaining the ecological networks by ensuring the survival of animal and plant species. GBI is considered a new public policy to avoid the loss of biodiversity by preserving landscape connectivity and protecting natural habitats from fragmentation. Countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Japan, China, Brazil, and Turkey are seeking to integrate this concept into their environmental policies. This study proposed a methodology to design a GBI at a regional scale applied to the Sousse region in Tunisia. Two main approaches were used. The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them. This methodological approach and the characterization of the Sousse city GBI map represent the first innovative research applied in Tunisia. This prototype can be a reference for other local or regional spaces, contributing toward realizing a national GBI and promoting sustainable projects.

Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeatvisit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (x = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (x = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (x = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (x = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (x = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (x = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores. These findings highlight the potential conservation benefits for incorporating private working lands with multiple land uses and land covers into future conservation planning scenarios, both for their wildlife conservation potential and as buffers around traditional protected areas.

AB  - Understanding how human-dominated landscapes affect biodiversity and ecosystems is essential for effective conservation planning. This work aims to understand the relationship between the acoustic diversity of forested landscapes, and descriptors of habitat structure, composition, and anthropogenic pressure, as well as to identify the characteristic scale at which acoustic community diversity relates to those metrics in central Massachusetts. Ten passive acoustic recorders were placed within forest areas in central Massachusetts, during the breeding season. Mono audio recordings were collected during the dawn chorus. The relationship between acoustic indices (AI), and core habitat quality, connectivity, vegetation productivity, percent tree cover, human edge, artificial illumination, and traffic noise were assessed. Significant relationships were found between AI and variables related to habitat structure and human pressure. Sounds related to biota (biophony) and acoustic complexity were positively correlated with core habitat quality, connectivity, and vegetation while negatively correlated with human pressure variables, including nighttime lights, traffic noise, and human edge. AI can therefore act as successful indicators of habitat quality in highly modified landscapes The highest correlations were found at buffers between 1.5 and 3 Km. This response of AI to the broad spatial context and not to the local site characteristics indicate that they can act as robust landscapescale indicators. The large characteristic scale indicates that urban planning should consider potential impacts acting at scales beyond site planning. Moreover, conservation planning can benefit from managing the context matrix to support biodiversity, particularly traffic noise and artificial illumination reduction initiatives.

AB  - Globally, grasslands represent a critical but shrinking habitat for native plants and pollinators, with declines driven by alterations to landscape-scale habitat cover and local-scale disturbance regimes, among other factors. Specifically, as cities expand in size, an increasing proportion of regional pasture and grassland habitat is being replaced by urban development, and fewer periodic grazing and burning regimes are being supported locally, despite evidence that such regimes promote plant species richness and facilitate their interaction with native pollinators. The quantification of these plant-pollinator networks-through indices such as network connectance, specialization, nestedness, and robustness-can provide a unique opportunity to characterize key structural properties of species interactions and their response to human management and seasonal phenology. While urbanization and local disturbance regimes likely influence plant and pollinator communities and their interactions, past research in this area has primarily been conducted at limited spatial and temporal scales and has not typically quantified the impacts of both local and landscape forces on network properties. In this study, we investigate the effects of contemporary (past 10 years) and historic (prior 90 years) disturbance regimes on plant-pollinator community composition and network structure across more than 200 km of grassland in Central Texas. Our analyses indicate that for plant and pollinator communities, both contemporary and historic land management practices have led to significantly dissimilar community composition. Plant and pollinator richness and network nestedness are negatively correlated with phenological period, while pollinator richness is positively correlated with landscape-scale (2 km) urbanized land cover and is higher in historically grazed land, likely due to greater food and nesting resource availability. In contrast, we show that network connectance is positively correlated with phenological period and negatively correlated with landscape-scale urban cover. Finally, we show that pollinator robustness, a measure of resilience to plant species loss, is positively correlated with landscape-scale urbanization, likely due to greater redundancy provided by common weedy plant species. Overall, our results demonstrate that historic grazing regimes, current urbanization levels, and distinct phenological periods can simultaneously drive plant-pollinator community composition and network dynamics in shrinking but critical grassland ecosystems.

AB  - We investigated whether green urban areas (GUA) improve the urban environment. Field measurements were conducted to record noise and light pollution as well as other environmental characteristics in four GUA in Athens. The biodiversity status of the examined areas was derived from the existing data. Not all GUA represent ecological refuges, mostly depending on their configuration. Special attention should be drawn to planning and designing GUA so that human pressures could not penetrate. Soundscape assessment combined with artificial lighting, environmental and biodiversity status investigation of a site clarifies the edge effect of ecosystems leading to an alternative, integrated, multidimensional management approach.

AB  - Climate emergency, landscape connectivity and rapid urbanization are among the major challenges of the 21st century. This paper discusses ways in which cities can respond to the changing climate and put in place a sustainable vision. It uses the garden city concept as a vehicle to investigate the future of our cities in relation to the climate emergency and the elements that urban centres need to provide. Cities and their wider regions are recognised as key actors in supporting systemic change and climate change governance, and therefore the scope of this paper is to explore contemporary models of garden cities and the ways in which these might be able to address climate emergency as well as the concepts of zero carbon and sustainability. The study uses the 2014 Wolfson Economics Prize, which was based on a garden city question. Taking an environmental perspective on the delivery of future cities, and using the competition essays and masterplans, this study produces analytical drawings aiming to unpack the concepts of sustainability and low carbon. This research concludes that the garden city concept can support the future needs of our settlements, but a 21st century approach needs to be developed. The social and economic ideas originally introduced at the end of the 19th century need to be updated as a holistic vision, including nature and biodiversity, climatic conditions, climate emergency adaptation and mitigation processes as well as community health and wellbeing, to be able to fully respond to the needs of the future.

AB  - The benefits of ecosystem services to cities are well documented; for example, water-sensitive urban design to mitigate stormwater flows and purify run-off, the cooling benefits provided by tree shade, and psychological benefits of urban greening. Cities tend to displace nature, and in urban environments where nature exists it tends to be as highly altered ecosystems. This paper sets out how it is possible to regenerate nature in cities. We outline the principles of how to do this through a study on a new regenerative urban development in Perth, Australia, where urban planning is intended to support the regeneration of a bioregional habitat within the city. The authors, drawn from sustainability, property development and ecological backgrounds, describe how urban regeneration can potentially facilitate the regeneration of endemic habitat within the city. This builds on the original ecosystem functionality to provide an urban ecosystem that enables biodiversity to regenerate. Perth lies on the Swan Coastal Plain, a biodiversity hotspot; it is home to 2.1 million people and numerous endemic species such as the endangered Black Cockatoo. Low reproduction rates and habitat loss through agricultural clearing, fire and urban expansion have greatly reduced the Black Cockatoo's range and this continuing trend threatens extinction. However, the charismatic Black Cockatoos enjoy passionate support from Perth's citizens. This paper describes a range of strategies whereby new urban development could potentially harness the popularity of the iconic Black Cockatoo to build momentum for urban habitat regeneration (for the cockatoos and other species) on the Swan Coastal Plain. The strategies, if systematically operationalised through urban planning, could allow city-scale ecological gain. The authors suggest a framework for nature-positive design and development that offers multiple benefits for human and non-human urban dwellers across scales, from individual gardens, to city/regional scale habitat corridors. Collectively, these strategies can increase the capacity of the city to support endemic species, simultaneously enhancing a bioregional "sense of place", and numerous associated ecosystem services to increase urban resilience in the face of climate change.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape modification which leads to the displacement of species, is arguably one of the most profound impacts on animal movement globally. In urban landscapes, animal movement is generally impacted by varying levels of increased urbanization. However, this is species dependent and is mostly guided by the surrounding habitat. Fragmentation and habitat patch isolation must be considered at scales appropriate to the study species. Using telemetry, we test these assumptions investigating movement patterns of flocks of Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso; RTBC) between three regions: urban, peri-urban, and forest using GPS and satellite PTT. This species occurs at varying levels of urbanization, however, how this might affect its movements is largely unknown. We did not find evidence that RTBC movement was impaired in the urban region compared with peri-urban or forest regions. It found, however, a significant within-region variation in movement extent among flocks and across regions depending on foraging resource availability and location. Differences in daily movement distance (Av. 4.96 - 16.41 km) and home range size (6.02 - 52.57 km(2)) between urban flocks appeared to be associated with the proximity of green spaces as roosts and foraging sites, with roadside vegetation providing important foraging resources and movement corridors. Key urban habitats were predominantly located in public nature reserves and private properties, with roadside vegetation connecting these sites for RTBC. The findings of this study highlight that conservation management for this and many other threatened species should regard the urban landscape as a critical habitat for urban adapted species. This would include management of its green spaces with connectivity and offsets from roads in mind. Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying additional key habitat sites (resource selection) and species distribution modeling, which will facilitate an active and adaptive approach towards this species' conservation management.

AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the habitat quality (HQ) in urban areas has been eroded. This phenomenon is destroying the balance of ecosystems, triggering the reduction of biodiversity and the decay of ecosystem service functions. The study of the relationship between urbanization and HQ in Zhengzhou City is beneficial for the reference of sustainable urban ecological planning and management. Based on landscape classification data and socioeconomic data for three years, this study analyzes the spatial correlations between socioeconomic and landscape pattern factors and HQ, compares the dynamic changes in the explanatory power of different factors, and explores the joint effects between multiple fac-tors. The results show that: (1) The overall value of HQ index in Zhengzhou City decreased by .10 during 2000???2020, mainly occurring in suburban areas, with a small amount of HQ improvement occurring in the core areas of ecological protection, such as mountains and river channels. (2) The spatial autocorrela-tion of all influencing factors with HQ increased during this period, while the negative impact from socio-economic sources was stronger than the positive impact from landscape patterns. (3) Intensive human activities lead to a single habitat type, which reduces HQ; rich landscape types and complex landscape composition can enhance HQ. Improving the connectivity of blue-green landscapes helps to attenuate the negative effects of urbanization on HQ. (4) Changes of HQ in the study area and the development of multi-factor effects on HQ are driven by the Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area Plan. Urban development policies and management can build idyllic complexes at the edge of urban development, preserving pris-tine blue-green patches to avoid their homogenized distribution and thus slowing the decline of HQ. The above results provide new ideas for the development of sustainable urban ecology.

AB  - Rapid urbanization development and construction has seriously threatened the connectivity of habitat patches in cities and hindered the construction of ecological networks in highly urbanized areas. Among them, China is affected by early compressed urbanization, and the broken ecological space in cities and towns has attracted the extensive interest of researchers. To avoid the subjective randomness and single analysis of ecological space in urbanization areas, this paper takes the central urban area of Wuhan as the main research area. It comprehensively evaluates the ecological network space by combining the MSPA-MCR model. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Identifying the ecological landscape types with important ecological significance in the study area: Core (88.29%), Islet (0.25%), Perf (0.63%), Edge (9.74%), Loop (0.22%), and Bridge (0.14%). Through the dPC landscape index, seven important ecological sources south of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were identified. (2) According to the comprehensive factors of natural and human factors constructed by the MCR model, the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surface was established, with an average value of 2.65, a maximum value of 4.70, and a minimum value of 1.00, showing a trend that the ecological resistance values in the central and eastern parts are lower than those in the western part. (3) According to the standard deviation ellipse, the distribution direction of NE-SW in ecological sources was analyzed. The ecological sources distributed in the north were less, and the spatial distribution was scattered on the whole. The strong global positive correlation and local spatial aggregation characteristics of ecological resistance surface were evaluated according to spatial autocorrelation.

AB  - The Accra Plain of Ghana is experiencing rapid urbanization, but there is scant information on its impact on local biodiversity. We assessed the changes in land use/land cover of the Accra Plain since 1991 and evaluated how the observed changes have influenced local small mammals in forest fragments. We applied supervised classification and intensity analysis time-series Landsat imagery data to assess land use/land cover changes between 1991 and 2017. Small mammals were surveyed in two forest fragments, the Pinkwae and Adumanya forests from June 2019 to January 2020, using capture-mark-recapture technique. We compared our data with baseline data gathered in 1991-1992, when large areas of the city remained mostly undeveloped. Our data revealed that the urban area has increased by 832%, while the forest area declined by 85% between 1991 and 2017. The Pinkwae and Adumanya forests, which covered 120 and 1.5 ha, respectively, in 1991 have each been reduced to < 1 ha. We found changes in the small mammal species composition in the forest fragments, but not species richness due to species turnover. Grammomys poensis and Dephomys defua are first records for the Accra Plain. Our data suggested that small forest fragments within the urbanizing landscape are important for maintaining the local small mammal species. For the conservation of local small mammals in urbanizing landscapes, it is important to maintain the greatest possible number of small forest fragments and establish policies that prevent forest remnants from being further depleted.

AB  - A wide body of research in recent years has studied either green infrastructures as providers of multiple ecosystem services, especially at the urban level, or ecological corridors and the issue of connectivity between landscape patches in the face of growing fragmentation. However, not many studies have analyzed how the two concepts can be combined to ground evidence-based policy and planning recommendations. In this study, a methodological approach for such a combination is proposed: after mapping a regional green infrastructure building upon the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and a network of ecological corridors through the resistance to movement of species, the two spatial layouts are combined so as to analyze correlations between the potential provision of ecosystem services and the resistance to movement. The methodology is applied in the case of the island of Sardinia, whose self-containment makes it possible to discard potential effects from surrounding areas, hence facilitating the implementation of the model. The outcomes of the regression model point out three ecosystem services as the most important factors that should be targeted by appropriate spatial policies if connectivity is to be increased: regulation of micro and local climate, forestry productivity, and cultural identity and heritage values.

AB  - There is still a lack of knowledge on the effect of urban environmental factors on bryophyte species distribution and richness. The goal of this study was to fill that gap. We assumed the hypothesis that the urban heat island is the most important factor affecting epiphytic bryophyte species in urban space. The survey was based on a network of 500 one hectare study plots, scattered throughout the city of Wroclaw (SW Poland). A set of 27 environmental factors was assessed in the field, as well as by the collection, processing, and interpretation of satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and climatological data. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to evaluate the significance of the effect of the studied variables on the distribution of bryophyte epiphytes. The effect of the normalized difference vegetation index on epiphytic bryophyte distribution and richness was the strongest. The effects of the urban heat island as well as the tree species diversity appeared weaker, though significant. Among the tree stands features, the supply of European ash Fraxinus excelsior and tree height appeared to be the strongest. Maintaining afforested areas rich in old tree individuals with cooler and more humid microclimates seems to be crucial to the keeping of epiphytic bryophyte species diversity in the urban landscape.

AB  - The area of semi-natural grasslands has decreased dramatically causing many grassland specialist species to persist in small habitat fragments. Furthermore, ecological communities once shaped by disturbances related to traditional agriculture now face the impacts of modern agriculture and urbanization. Many of the species have become endangered due to the combined effects of habitat destruction and degradation. We studied the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, while accounting for the effects of local environmental conditions. We conducted vegetation surveys in 33 fragmented, unmanaged dry grasslands in Southwest Finland. A total of 191 vascular plant species and 60 bryophyte species were recorded. Higher vascular plant diversity was associated with higher historical connectivity, whereas bryophyte diversity declined with increasing current connectivity. Edaphic conditions, microclimate and disturbances were found to structure both vascular plant and bryophyte communities, but the responses to individual environmental variables were very different. The contrasting responses could be explained by the differences between the typical life-history strategies in vascular plants and bryophytes as well as resource competition between the two groups. These results highlight the need to consider different species groups when planning conservation measures. Vascular plant richness may best be conserved in connected grasslands whereas bryophyte richness in isolated ones. The results also indicated that trampling by humans could result in positive disturbance and to some extent help maintain richness of grassland specialist species.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) enhance the quality of life in urban environments and serve as habitat corridors or refuge for organisms, including beetles and spiders. The attributes of UGS allow them to harbour species that offer essential ecosystem services. However, the ability of UGS to provide services is limited by the extent to which they have been altered anthropogenically. We described the taxonomic richness and functional composition of arthropods in a mountainous urban ecosystem of Ghana by focussing on the activity of both beetles and spiders at the family level. Two main land-use types (woodlands and built-up areas) were identified and characterised based on the presence or absence of certain vegetation attributes. Sixteen plots in each land-use type with sizes 20 x 20 m were demarcated and fitted with four pitfall traps in each plot to sample continuously for eight weeks, the activity density of both beetles and spiders. Samples were sorted into families and functional groups (detritivores, fungivores, herbivory and predators). The taxonomic richness and activity density were both significantly higher in the woodlands than in the built-up areas. Similarly, all functional groups showed a higher affinity to the woodlands than the built-up areas. Habitat attributes defined by plant diversity and structural complexity were the underlying drivers explaining the differences in arthropod communities between the land-use types. Though the built-up areas seem degraded and open, the remaining small vegetation patches still support the activities of some taxa that should merit the protection of such remnant vegetation in urban ecosystems.

AB  - As fragmented landscapes become increasingly common around the world, managing the spatial arrangement of landscape elements (i.e., landscape configuration) may help to promote the conservation of biodiversity. However, the relative effects of landscape configuration on different dimensions of biodiversity across species assemblages are largely unknown. Thus, a key challenge consists in understanding when it is necessary to focus on landscape configuration, in addition to landscape composition, to achieve multifunctional landscapes. We tested the effects of landscape composition (the percentage of tree cover and built infrastructure) and landscape configuration (degree of fragmentation) on landscape-level species richness and different metrics of functional diversity of urban birds. We collected data on different bird guilds (nectarivores/frugivores, insectivores) from Brisbane, Australia. Using structural equation models, we found that landscape structure (landscape composition and configuration) affected functional diversity via two main pathways: (1) through effects of landscape composition, mediated by landscape configuration (indirect effects), and (2) through direct ("independent") effects of landscape composition and configuration, filtering species with extreme trait values. Our results show that landscape-level species richness declined with the extent of built infrastructure, but patterns of trait diversity did not necessarily correlate with this variable. Landscape configuration had a stronger mediating effect on some metrics of the functional diversity of insectivores than on the functional diversity of frugivores/nectarivores. In addition, fragmentation increased the effects of built infrastructure for some traits (body size and dispersal capacity), but not for others (habitat plasticity and foraging behavior). These results suggest that differential approaches to managing landscape structure are needed depending on whether the focus is on protecting functional diversity or species richness and what the target guild is. Managing landscape fragmentation in areas with high levels of built infrastructure is important if the objective is to protect insectivore species with uncommon traits, even if it is not possible to preserve high levels of species richness. However, if the target is to enhance both functional diversity and species richness of multiple guilds, the focus should be on improving composition through the reduction of negative effects of built infrastructure, rather than promoting specific landscape configurations in growing cities.

AB  - The organization of species metacommunities can be controlled by local factors, such as habitat quality, landscape factors, such as land use, and spatial factors, such as stream network distances. Species within a metacommunity have different traits that may be used to understand the determinants of community structure. This study aimed to understand how changes in environmental and spatial factors affected stream fish assemblages delineated based on their dispersal-related traits, such as preferential habitat use (i.e., benthic, nektobenthic, nektonic, marginal, and surface), preference for water velocity (i.e., fast, intermediate, and slow), and body size (i.e., small, medium, and large). We sampled 18 stream reaches in a dendritic network in the Upper Parana River basin, located in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We used variation partitioning techniques to test the relative effects of local environmental, landscape, and spatial variables on different species groups defined according to dispersal-related traits. Environmental and spatial variables weakly explained the variation in total assemblage taxonomic composition. However, based on different functional trait groups, we found that the environment had a strong relationship with assemblage composition of nektobenthic and small fish, whereas spatial variables were most strongly associated with marginal and surface fish. Large-scale spatial variables were associated with large fish and those that prefer slow water, whereas fine-scale variables were associated with small and surface-dwelling fish. These findings help improve understanding of how functional composition of stream fish assemblages may be affected by urban development, riparian conversion, and resulting changes in local environmental conditions.

AB  - Plecturocebus ornatus is an endemic vulnerable species due to its population decline and its restricted range within the Eastern Plains of Colombia. This region is affected by deforestation as a result of legal and illegal economic activities. The aim of this work was to analyze the presence and abundance of P. ornatus during a period of urban and livestock production expansion (1986-2019) in Villavicencio, Colombia. This municipality is the most affected by land-use changes associated with regional economic development and represents 3.4 % of P. ornatus distribution???s area. The analysis was performed using satellite images Landsat 4 and 8, with V-Late in ArcGIS 10.5 to describe landscape structure, and P. ornatus occurrence records, obtained through field observations and the Global Biological Information Facility. Densities were calculated for each fragment based on total individuals observed by transect. A generalized lineal model was used to evaluate the effects of patch-scale, landscape-scale and other variables on P. ornatus abundance. By 1986 the rural and peri-urban areas of Villavicencio were already a transformed landscape. During the analyzed period, landscape was predominantly made up of disconnected linear fragments with a secondary humid forest cover. Around 82.1 % of the fragments with P. ornatus records are threatened by urbanization and only 50 % are in protected areas. Densities varied from 0.00 to 7.26 ind/ha (0.00???726.82 ind/km2). Abundance of P. ornatus was highly influenced by landscape-scale variables related with landscape connectivity, as well as fragment area and number of other primate species. Therefore, the implementation of restoration measures that increase landscape connectivity and habitat availability is proposed, as well as more control over environmental land-use planning, to contribute to the conservation of P. ornatus in urban areas.

AB  - The diversity of avifauna is assessed in relation and to the fruit trees in the premises of University of Peshawar. The main objective of the study is to assess the species richness and population density of frugivores and fruit trees in our study area. The study is being done using random walk method with focal observation for avian biodiversity identification and enumeration. The site was visited every weekend for two months continuously from March-May 2022. The data was collected twice a day i.e. during dawn and dusk. Initially 02 study sites were studied i.e. (Botanical Garden and Research Garden) and (Malakander Horticulture Research Farm) with an area of 15 acres and 38 acres respectively. Highest number of fruit trees species were encountered in Site A (Botanical Garden and Research Garden) which were fifteen in number followed by Site B (Malakander Horticulture Farm) which consist of 10 species in number. Therein, Apricot trees were highest in number with 1014 plants followed by Peach 901 plants, Pear 690 plants, Plum 206 plants, Persimmon 130 plants, Loquat 128 plants and Guava 40 plants respectively. The specie richness of avian birds being observed in Site A were 28 with highest number of Striated prinia (56) followed by 36 species in Site B with highest number of Red Vented Bulbul (54). While specie abundance in Site A was 456 and Site B was 332 respectively. According to the results of Simpson diversity index both the Sites comprises of 93% heterogenic species and 7% homogenic species. Whereas Shannon diversity index for Site A was (H=2.94) and for Site B (H= 3.10). Conservation of avian biodiversity within Peshawar city can be flourished by managing the urban green space and promoting native flora with special emphasis on fruit trees.

AB  - Background Urbanization process around the world has not only changed the patterns of land use, but also fragmented the habitat, resulting in significantly biodiversity loss. Urban rivers, serve as one of the natural corridors in urban ecosystems, are of importance for urban ecosystem stability. However, few studies have been done to explore the relationship between vegetation and pollinators in urban river segments. In this study, two urban streams in the city of Chongqing were selected as the study area, riparian vegetation, butterflies and bees were investigated along all four seasons of a year to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution patterns. Simultaneously, the ecological functions of the river corridor were analyzed. Result In this study, 109 plant species belonging to 95 genera of 39 families were recorded; the number of sampled species for butterflies and bees were 12 and 13, respectively. The temporal and spatial patterns of species diversity among vegetation, butterfly, and bee are different, but the trends of variation among them are similar between the two streams. Bees were found to be more closely correlated with native flowering plants in riparian zone, rather than with cultivated riparian vegetation. Conclusions The native riparian vegetation in urban rivers plays an important role in urban biodiversity conservation by serving as a corridor. This study provides data supporting the protection of the remaining natural patches and restoration of damaged habitats in the city. The survey has accumulated data on native riparian vegetation and pollinators in urban rivers.

AB  - The polarization and diffusion effects of landscape patterns are important features of megalopolis development. Under the urbanized effects, green space is a key spatial unit in delivering vital ecosystem services for sustainable urban planning. However, currently, fast urban developing is swamping the green space. In this study, by tracing landscape pattern changes of a fast-developing megalopolis, the Chengdu-Chongqing Megalopolis in the southeast of China, and using land-use data from 1980 to 2020, we aimed to determine the polarization and diffusion effects of the megalopolis and their impacts on the green space within and between the cities. We found that: (1) during the past four decades, spatial expansion of the megalopolis mainly occupied grassland and farmland, triggering an increase in landscape fragmentation; (2) based on socio-economic indicators, the spatialattraction network analysis showed a significant polarization effect; however, based on the natural landscape, this analysis demonstrated a more scattered pattern; (3) importantly, the megalopolis developed at quite a similar pace, which caused the green rural area between the central cities demonstrating an encroached trend by the urbanization. To promote sustainability of the fast-developing megalopolis, we suggest that the boundary of the green space should be broadened to form a green network in which natural green space and urban green space are interconnected, improving the connectivity of habitats within the megalopolis for urban biodiversity. Our study implied that maintaining the green buffer shall be considered in advance for sustainable megaregional planning and establishing resilience of the fast-developing megalopolis.

AB  - Human interventions, i.e. settlement and construction activities, in the agricultural landscape including farmland but also natural and semi-natural habitats are a major driver of biodiversity loss. Consequently, their impacts on nature and landscape have to be compensated by no net loss policies in many countries around the world. However, their practical implementation often poses challenges with regard to the optimal spatial coordination and assessment of measures, especially in the case of eco-accounts or other habitat banking approaches.Against this backdrop, different approaches to offset biodiversity loss at regional level are analysed with due consideration of indicators of economy, ecology, landscape aesthetics and food production. We used an interdisciplinary modelling approach based on estimates for offsetting demand until 2030. In the integrated land use model, we associated a biophysical crop growth model with an economic optimisation model. The Stuttgart Region - an area with stiff competition amongst anthropogenic land use patterns in Germany - served as the study area. Our main focus was on arable land that has a high potential for nature conservation enhancement. In this context, farmers are deemed to be a major stakeholder group.We observed differing economic and ecological outcomes for the offsetting scenarios we considered. In urban areas with high population density and low biodiversity (e.g. Stuttgart city), compensation close to the site of intervention (on-site) may be more expensive than off-site compensation. However, further added value can be generated by on-site compensation in terms of visual landscape quality enhancement and habitat connectivity, provided that the measures lend themselves to establishing connectivity. Consequently, spatially unrestricted markets for eco credits may exacerbate ecological polarisation between urban and rural areas. Therefore, we concluded that offset site selection should not be driven solely by economics, as this may not optimise overall welfare from a societal perspective, resulting in the need for legal constraints.Our results show the trade-offs between the political goals of spatial planning approaches and compensation strategies. They can, therefore, thus provide valuable information that enables political decision-makers to more clearly weigh up the effects of policy measures in this area.

AB  - Ecosystem services refer to the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment and healthy ecosystems. Green roofs can be used to enhance ecosystem services, which are reduced by urbanization. Moreover, green roofs can improve biodiversity by connecting green spaces. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the multi-dimensional contributions of green roofs to urban ecosystems. To this end, we used i-Tree Canopy to identify changes in land cover and tree canopy ecosystem services from 2003 to 2021 in Suwon City, Republic of Korea. Next, we simulated improved ecosystem service effects of tree canopies by green roofs. Graph theory was also used to analyze connectivity improvement at local and landscape scales. Tree area was found to decrease from 2003 to 2012, alongside the corresponding ecosystem services, which then showed a tendency to increase from 2012 to 2021. The tree area was expected to increase further in the green roof scenario than in 2003. Green roofs were found to improve tree canopy connectivity at the landscape scale more than the local scale, by acting as stepping stones in connecting fragmented forests and trees. Areas with improved connectivity at both scales should be prioritized for green roof development. These results will aid in the strategic planning of urban green infrastructure and provide support for decision-making processes to improve ecosystem services and connectivity using green roofs.

AB  - A recent issue highlights the need for a wildlife corridor to mitigate habitat fragmentation and biodiversity degradation caused by intensive urbanization in the country, such as the development of infrastructure, roads, and highways. Indeed, the issues of frequent road and vehicle-animals collisions are ever-increasing in urban corridors. As a result, flora and fauna populations can become isolated, leading to an unbalanced ecosystem. This study developed the Wildlife Corridor Design and Conservation (WCDC) index, assessment model. The study has investigated the wildlife corridor design and conservation features through a systematic literature review, clustered them into three criteria (biophysical, structural, and environmental designs) and twenty-one sub -criteria. The study applied the Analytic Network Process method to measure the weights of features; habitat preservation (WC1.1 = 0.280), species varieties control (WC1.2.=0187), and conduit for movement (WC1.3. = 0.100) play critical roles in wildlife corridor design and conservation. The Weighted Sum Method verified the WCDC model through a case study (Red Earth overpass, Canada). The model assigns certification labels (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or not-certified); accordingly, it ranked the evaluated site as Gold, which means the Red Earth overpass performs intimately in biophysical, structural, and environmental preservation of mammal habitat. The study conducted regression analysis for model validation, determining a significant association between the base and case-study models.

AB  - Urbanisation is rapidly transforming terrestrial environments, especially in the tropics. Many squirrel species tolerate urbanisation, but studies are biased towards temperate regions. We quantify the distribution and abundance of squirrels and (ecologically similar) tree-shrews along an urbanisation gradient in a rapidly urbanising tropical mega-city (Bangkok, Thailand) located within the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. We used repeated point counts in 150 1 km cells, selected using random stratification across the urbanisation gradient. We quantified species responses to (i) urbanisation intensity (measured using impervious surface cover), (ii) environmental conditions (woodland quantity and quality, human disturbance and predation pressure from free-ranging cats and dogs) and (iii) urbanisation impacts on hybridisation between congeneric Callosciurus squirrels. Three of the six species from the regional species pool were extremely rare or absent within our study region (Tamiops macclellandi, Callosciurus caniceps and Menetes berdmorei). Of the three more widespread species (Tupaia belangeri, Callosciurus finlaysonii and Callosciurus erythraeus) only C. finlaysonii had a higher abundance in more urban locations. The increasing intensity of urbanisation has thus markedly reduced squirrel diversity and abundance, contrasting with the perception from temperate regions that squirrels typically tolerate urbanisation. Urbanisation is thus likely to have reduced important ecological functions provided by squirrels, such as seed dispersal. Models of species responses to environmental conditions suggest that improving habitat quality by increasing tree cover and diversity at local and landscape scales and reducing human disturbance and numbers of feral dogs would partially mitigating adverse impacts of urbanisation on tropical squirrels and tree-shrews. Urban infrastructure (bridge construction across the Chao-Praya River) appears to have increased the permeability of a geographic barrier that previously separated C. finlaysonii and C. erythraeus distributions, increasing hybridisation rates. Our study enhances understanding of the ecological impacts of urbanisation in biodiverse tropical regions and the action required to mitigate these impacts.

AB  - Urban rivers and riparian areas serve as corridors that move matter, organisms, and energy to urban areas from adjacent landscapes. However, anthropogenic disturbances and obstructions in river basins have severely impeded the function of many urban rivers as ecological corridors. Here, we used carabid beetles to assess the impact of urbanization on a river and its riparian areas. We identified carabid diversity and composition along an urbanization gradient. We classified 1,855 individuals in 17 species along a river. The carabid communities in riparian areas reflected critically disturbed habitats, and their composition markedly differed between the riparian areas and their adjacent habitats. Carabid beetle diversity sharply decreased with increasing urbanization. Flight capacity and feeding type varied along the urbanization gradient. Environmental variables associated with urbanization such as riparian quality and disturbance level significantly influenced carabid diversity. Land use type in increasingly urbanized areas was correlated with decreased carabid diversity and increased carabid dominance. Patch density, patch size, and interspersion metrics revealed that fragmentation and isolation influenced carabid diversity. Mitigation of disturbances and conservation of riparian microhabitats are required to improve biodiversity in riparian areas.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion has significantly altered the regional landscape pattern, posing a serious threat to the sustainable development of natural and social ecosystems. By using landscape patterns indices and an area transfer matrix, this study analyzed the spatial-temporal changes of landscape patterns in the karst mountainous cities of southwest China from 2000 to 2020, by taking the central urban area of Guiyang City (CUAG) as the study area. This study explored the spatial and temporal driving factors of landscape pattern changes by using stepwise multiple linear regression and geographic detector methods. The results show: (1) CUAG's landscape types altered changed drastically, with the area of forestland and construction land rapid increment and cultivated land decrement significantly. (2) The patches of construction land and forestland tended to be aggregated, the degree of fragmentation was reduced, and the shape was complex; cultivated land fragmentation was intensified. The connectivity of the landscape was improved, while the level of landscape diversity declined, the trend of landscape homogenization was obvious. (3) Socioeconomic and geographical endowment drivers have determined landscape pattern changes. The findings of this study may be used to interpret other similar landscapes worldwide and may imply the protection of urban ecosystem and sustainable development.

AB  - Urbanisation significantly shapes species abundance, diversity, and community structure of invertebrate taxa but the impact on orthoptera remains widely understudied. We investigated the combined effects of spatial, urban landscape and management-related parameters. Additionally, we discussed different sampling strategies. We sampled orthopteran assemblages on green infrastructure associated with the public transport system of Vienna, Austria. Sampled areas include railroad embankments, recreational areas or fallows. Using LMs, (G)LMMs and nMDS, we compared quantitative sampling using transect counts and semi-quantitative sampling which also included observations made off-transects. We found that vegetation type was the most important parameter, whereby structure-rich fallows featured highest species diversities and, together with extensive meadows, highest abundances, while intensive lawns were less suitable habitats. The semi-quantitative data set revealed an underlying species-area-relationship (SAR). Other important but highly entangled parameters were the mowing intensity, vegetational heterogeneity and cover of built-up area in a 250 m radius. Most found species have high dispersal abilities. Urban assemblages are most significantly shaped by management-related parameters on the site itself, which highlights the potential of conservation efforts in urban areas through suitable management. Sites of different vegetation types differ greatly and need adjusted management measures. Urban landscape parameters, such as the degree of soil sealing, appeared less important, likely due to the high dispersal abilities of most observed orthoptera species. The indicated species-area-relationship could be used to prioritize sites for conservation measures.

AB  - Biodiversity is vital for the integrity and stability of ecosystems and sustainable development. Karst regions of Southwest China is featured for undulating and broken karst terrain as well as high plant diversity. Land use changes induced by the growing population and expanding human settlement have threatened biodiversity preservation in this region. However, the impact of urban expansion on plant diversity remains unclear here. This study focuses on how expanding countryside landscapes affect the recovery rate of plant diversity and demonstrate how urban expansion affects plant diversity conservation in karst regions of Southwest China. In situ biodiversity investigations and multisource remote sensing images were combined to analyze the role of human settlement evolution in the conservation of plant diversity using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Unmanned vehicle images, historical aerial photographs, and long-term remote sensing images were used to observe the human settlement pattern changes over 40 yr and found that plant diversity is restored faster in countryside ecosystems than in island ecosystems restricted by water. Forests, however, contribute the most to plant diversity conservation in both ecosystems. While the forest area is stable during urban expansion, massive forest patches play an essential role in plant diversity conservation. Arable lands and grasslands shrank but with a fragmenting trend, which was conducive to preserving plant diversity, whereas increased and regularized large patches of built-up areas were not beneficial to plant diversity. Accordingly, forest protection should be prioritized to coordinate future socioeconomic development and plant diversity conservation in karst and broader regions. Furthermore, large built-up patches should be limited, and the irregularity should be improved during urban expansion. Irregular shaped cultivated land and grassland were suggested to promote biological information exchanges as landscape corridors.

AB  - Gene flow in birds can be affected by urbanization depending on natural history traits and adaptability to habitat change. Contrasting results can be expected when comparing species with opposite resilience to urbanization. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis, and the urban dweller house wren Troglodytes aedon. We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological systems and improving human well-being in cities. The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou's UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai-Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.

AB  - Biological control is a major ecosystem service provided by pest natural enemies, even in densely populated areas where the use of pesticides poses severe risks to human and environmental health. However, the impact of urbanization on this service and the abundance patterns of relevant functional groups of arthropods (herbivores, predators, and parasitoids) remain contested. Here, we synthesize current evidence through three hierarchical meta-analyses and show that advancing urbanization leads to outbreaks of sap-feeding insects, declining numbers of predators with low dispersal abilities, and weakened overall biological pest control delivered by arthropods. Our results suggest that sedentary predators may have the potential to effectively regulate sap-feeders, that are one of the most important pests in urban environments. A well-connected network of structurally diverse and rich green spaces with less intensive management practices is needed to promote natural plant protection in urban landscapes and sustainable cities.

AB  - Over 60% of the global population are expected to live in urban areas by 2050. Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution.

AB  - Human-caused landscape transformation represents a danger to conserving the Earth's natural habitats. Landscape fragmentation (LF) caused by transportation infrastructure and urban development poses a threat to human and environmental health by increasing traffic noise and pollution, reducing the size and viability of wildlife populations, facilitating the spread of invasive species, and reducing the recreational qualities of the landscape. It is especially noticeable in the metropolitan areas of developing countries due to rapid and unsupervised urban sprawl. In this context, this study aims to protect natural landscapes and biodiversity, promoting forms of sustainable development. To exemplify our aim, we bring a spatio-temporal analysis of landscape change comparing three metropolitan areas in the Western Balkans (WB). First, we compare the land use land cover (LULC) changes in Tirana (Albania), Skopje (North Macedonia), and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina). The comparison was based on the Urban Atlas (UA) data of 2012 and 2018. The analysis was performed on two levels, at the metropolitan and urban spatial scales. Apart from descriptive statistics about the changes in surface area and patch counts, we used effective mesh size (meff) as a landscape metric to quantify the LF level. Our results show that each city has faced significant LULC change between 2012 and 2018, with a dominant increase in artificial surfaces. Furthermore, the cumulative natural surface area reduction is followed by increased landscape patch counts, indicating an increased LF at both levels. This study enhances public awareness about the landscape transformation trends in the developing metropolitan regions of WB. The respective administrative bodies at both local and central levels are invited to consider our results and adopt proper measurements to reduce the adverse consequences of subsequent spatial development decisions.

AB  - Urban expansion occurs in horizontal and vertical directions, but the construction process of a traditional planar ecological network (EN) ignores the ecological protection of the vertical space. Birds, as representative species in urbanized areas, are important for expanding the vertical analysis dimension of ENs. In this study, urban parks with good habitat quality were extracted as ecological sources from the perspective of birds. Then, 2D and 3D ecological resistance surfaces were constructed on the basis of the perspective of influencing bird migration, and planar and 3D ecological corridors were extracted and compared for analysis. Finally, accessibility analysis was performed to identify the parks in the study area that need priority protection. Results show that building height is an important factor affecting bird migration, and the introduction of 3D resistance surfaces into EN construction is important for adapting to the trend of vertical urban expansion. The combination of accessibility and EN analyses can help identify ecological spaces having the dual role of "species conservation" and "human well-being enhancement." This study can provide a reference for refining the service species of ENs, exploring the vertical dimension of ENs, and improving the health of urban ecosystems and the rationality of urban planning.

AB  - The construction of ecological security patterns is an effective means to improve ecological environment quality, protect regional biodiversity, and alleviate the landscape fragmentation caused by urbanization in plateau lake cities. Taking the Dianchi Lake area as an example, we used the morphological spatial pattern analysis method (MSPA) and the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCR) to construct a comprehensive resistance surface, ecological corridor network, and ecological security pattern for the study area. Firstly, we selected 12 ecological sources with more than 1000 hm(2), PC, IIC index more than 1, and high habitat quality and connectivity from the study area, including the Dianchi lake body and the mountain forests in the south, north, and west. The overall habitat quality in the eastern region was poor. Secondly, the regional comprehensive resistance value was 1.0925-4.5395. The comprehensive resistance surface showed that the influence of human activities in the region was strong, and the connectivity between important sources was poor. Thirdly, we identified 26 important corridors with interaction force values higher than 50, mostly mountain corridors, between sources that were close to one another and over 40 general corridors with interaction force values lower than 50 in urban built-up areas, most of which were river corridors. Fourthly, by identifying five potential sources and 43 potential corridors in the eastern region, we improved the ecological network function and overall connectivity. The alpha index (loop pass degree), beta index (line point rate), and gamma index (connectivity degree) were 2.895, 5.5, and 2.2 before optimization and 3.206, 6.412, and 2.422 after optimization, respectively. Lastly, the "ridge lines" and "valley lines" were used to screen the ecological nodes in our ecological network model and construct a "one core, three regions, and one belt" ecological security pattern by combining the geographical characteristics of the research region and the local policy planning guidance. We also provided ecological control, restoration, and construction suggestions based on the corridor plans of other administrative regions and the different types of source area.

AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) constitute an important ecological problem in cities. Ecological space has a positive effect on UHI mitigation, which can be effectively organized in the form of ecological networks. In this study, the framework for structural UHI improvement based on ecological networks considering the source-corridor model is proposed to examine the spatial threshold of the thermal effect of ecological network factors. Additionally, the cooling mechanism of each constituent element in the ecological network context is further explored. The results demonstrate that (1) an obvious cold and heat island spatial aggregation distribution exists in the Xuzhou main urban area, and land of the same land use type exhibits the dual thermal environmental properties of cold and heat islands through its spatial distribution and characteristics. Ecological space is the main bearing area of cold islands. (2) The ecological network in the main urban area of Xuzhou city occurs at a moderately complex level, and the overall network efficiency is acceptable; the network connectivity is low, while the network loop distribution is uneven. (3) Ecological networks represent an effective spatial means to improve overall UHI patterns. The ecological source area cooling threshold is 300 m, and the optimal threshold is 100 m, while the ecological corridor width threshold is 500 m and 60 m, respectively. (4) Within the optimal threshold in the context of ecological networks, the temperature of ecological sources in category G land is influenced by NDBI and FVC; ecological corridors are mainly influenced by NDBI. The results can provide a quantitative basis for urban ecological network planning considering UHI improvement and a reference for urban thermal environment research within different ecological substrates and planning and control systems in other countries and regions worldwide.

AB  - Urban-ecological landscape connectivity and pattern optimization can significantly enhance biodiversity and sustainable development capacity, which play an important role in continued ecosystem functioning. Previous studies identified ecological sources based on the area threshold method or combination with morphological spatial pattern analysis and the landscape connectivity index (CMSPACI) method, but few studies have compared the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of the two methods. In this paper, taking Nanchang as the study area, we address the ecological sources via area threshold and the CMSPACI method. Then, the minimum cost distance method is used to generate potential corridors of different methods, and the differences in ecological networks are analyzed. Finally, the circuit theory is used to identify barriers, and we provide targeted recommendations for ecological network pattern optimization in the study area. The results show that (1) the ecological sources extracted by different methods are different. The ecological sources extracted by the area threshold are far away from the surrounding sources, and the landscape connectivity is low. The ecological sources identified by the CMSPACI method are closely related to the surrounding sources, and the landscape connectivity is high. (2) Compared with the area threshold method, the habitat quality of corridors under the CMSPACI method is better, and the interaction intensity between patches is larger. (3) There is little difference in the number of ecological barriers under different methods; all of them are located between patches or on the edge of patches, and most of them are roads or construction land. Overall, the area threshold method is simpler. Ecological sources can be effectively addressed through the CMSPACI method, and the landscape connectivity of the ecological network will be better. This study provides an important reference for the selection of ecological sources in the construction of ecological networks.

AB  - The prevailing trend of increasing urbanization and habitat fragmentation makes knowledge of species' habitat requirements and distribution a crucial factor in conservation and urban planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer powerful toolboxes for discriminating the underlying environmental factors driving habitat suitability. Nevertheless, challenges in SDMs emerge if multiple data sets - often sampled with different intention and therefore sampling scheme - can complement each other and increase predictive accuracy. Here, we investigate the potential of using recent data integration techniques to model potential habitat and movement corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), in an urban area. We constructed hierarchical models integrating data sets of different quality stemming from unstructured on one side and semi-structured wildlife observation campaigns on the other side in a combined likelihood approach and compared the results to modeling techniques based on only one data source - wherein all models were fit with the same selection of environmental variables. Our study highlights the increasing importance of considering multiple data sets for SDMs to enhance their predictive performance. We finally used Circuitscape (version 4.0.5) on the most robust SDM to delineate suitable movement corridors for red squirrels as a basis for planning road mortality mitigation measures. Our results indicate that even though red squirrels are common, urban habitats are rather small and partially lack connectivity along natural connectivity corridors in Berlin. Thus, additional fragmentation could bring the species closer to its limit to persist in urban environments, where our results can act as a template for conservation and management implications.

AB  - Globally insects are declining, but some guilds of pollinators are finding refuge in urban landscapes. The body of knowledge on urban pollinators is relatively mature, which means it is now possible to begin to make generalization. Unfortunately, studies do not represent climatic regions evenly and there is a gap in research from the African continent. This study aimed to address some of the gaps on urban pollination knowledge in South Africa and to identify opportunities to improve urban habitats for pollinators. We reviewed the international literature on urban pollinators and the South African literature on pollinators with a landscape ecology focus, drawing on literature with an emphasis on agricultural and ecosystem services. The findings show that some taxa (e.g. large-bodied, cavity nesting bees) will exploit urban environments increasing in abundance with urban intensity. Moderately sensitive taxa (such as small-bodied, ground-nesting bees) take advantage of urban environments only if local habitats are supportive of their needs for resource provision and habitat connectivity. The South African urban poor rely on pollination services for subsistence agriculture and the reproduction of wild-foraged medicines and food. Potential interventions to improve habitat quality include strategic mowing practices, conversion of turf-grass to floral rich habitats, scientific confirmation of lists of highly attractive flowers, and inclusion of small-scale flower patches throughout the urban matrix. Further research is needed to fill the Africa gap for both specialized and generalized pollinators (Diptera, Halictids, Lepidoptera and Hopliini) in urban areas where ornamental and indigenous flowering plants are valued.

AB  - The rapid transformation of natural environments is driven by urban sprawl for a growing human population, mainly characterized by peri-urbanization that threatens the conservation of critical ecological species and processes. In this approach, our main objective was the prioritization of areas for forest conservation, aiming at functional connectivity in a landscape under urban sprawl. Firstly, based on the literature review, we defined the criteria, assigning them weights through expert opinions. However, we proposed an improvement in this stage, which was the evaluation of criteria influence and their respective control level. Thus, the final weights bring these two important characteristics to the criteria maps, which were normalized to 255 bytes scale with coincidence between the highest values and priority levels. The selected criteria were proximity to forest fragments, Landscape Resistance Index (LRI), proximity to the drainage network, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), and slope. We produced the priority map, aggregating criteria using the Weighted Linear Combination, a Multicriteria Evaluation method. The sensitivity analysis validated the criteria and the spatialization of areas proposed by their aggregation. Our results indicated the highest priority areas (37.3% of the landscape) with values between 188 and 255 bytes were represented in 32% by proximity to forest fragments, 27% by the LRI, proximity to the drainage network amounted to 26%, TWI (8%), and slope (7%). We concluded that our model supports the prioritization of areas for functional forest connectivity based on robust criteria representing landscape features. And that the criteria robustness depends on the level of their influence control. Finally, the sensitivity analysis validates the decision process since it identifies the criteria contributing to the final map and its respective priority levels.

AB  - Rapid and disordered urbanization has created a fragmented landscape, the urban-rural fringe (URF), which has led to the degradation of ecological connections between urban areas and rural hinterlands. The ecological security network (ESN) offers significant advantages for restoring interrupted urban-rural ecological processes. However, classic ESN construction approaches are ineffective in the URF when applied to a highly complex urbanization landscape. In this paper, a new approach for a stepwise ESN construction in the URF is proposed, which integrates the basic ESN and the connecting ESN to create an optimized ESN. Taking Xiamen as a case study, the ecological elements of the URF were extracted and reclassified for ESN construction. The scarcity of transitional patches and complexity of land cover were responsible for the lack of urban-rural connecting corridors. The final optimized ESN consisted of 19 source nodes with 7 rural structural corridors, 22 urban-rural connecting corridors, and 8 urban structural corridors. Moreover, the structural performance and spatial coverage of the ESN were both significantly improved after optimization. The optimal buffer widths of rural structural, urban-rural connecting, and urban structural corridors were 600 m, 180 m, and 120 m, respectively. This paper provides an operational framework of ESN construction adapted for the URF as well as management guidance for policymakers. It can support decisions for regulating urban growth and outlining ecological protection areas, thus contributing to sustainable urban development.

AB  - Recent studies carried out by landscape and urban ecologists have shown that habitat fragmentation has negative environmental effects and is accountable for the loss of biodiversity. The development and extension of road infrastructure to support economic growth, the urbanization and the land-use changes are major drivers of habitat fragmentation. Planners have attempted to develop tools for restoring connectivity and stopping biodiversity loss at the landscape scale and which can be applied at the urban scale, too. The study fills in the gap by developing a methodology for identifying the ecological corridors of a Romanian large carnivore (brown bear) in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains at several spatial scales. The methodology relies on geospatial data; this is equally its most important advantage and challenge. Our findings suggest that the implementation of ecological corridors in current planning practice must be completed cautiously, provided the possible restrictions are imposed on economic activities by plans, and highlight the importance of field data in increasing the scientific soundness of the results. In addition, the findings show the need to interconnect spatial planning policies with environmental policies by improving the actual legislation.

AB  - Identifying urban areas with a high potential for providing pollination is essential for the management of urban agriculture. Urban green spaces have a vital role in providing nesting and foraging habitats for pollinators, and they act as pollinator refuges in cities. Therefore, regions adjacent to green spaces can host agricultural products in dire need of pollinators for their produce. To determine the suitable areas for urban agriculture according to the proximity to urban green spaces, we used two models, the Lonsdorf and the graph theory models. The Lonsdorf model focuses more on the capacity of the patches to support pollinators but graph theory methods on the connectivity between the patches. According to graph theory, a set of patches with functional connectivity for pollinators can lead to the formation of clusters around them. Each of these clusters has a certain potential for supplying pollination for urban agricultural products. Both models estimate the capacity of patches in supplying pollination services based on the distances at which bees can fly. To test the robustness of the results of each model, we perform both models at distances of 500, 700, 1000, and 1500 m as maximum foraging distances of bees. Our results suggested that both models showed similar results in determining suitable areas for urban agriculture. Both models showed that the northern and northeastern regions of Tehran were the most suitable areas for urban agriculture and have a high potential to support the pollinator population. In contrast, the central regions had a low capacity to maintain pollinators for urban agriculture, and had little support from wild bees for pollination. Our results also showed that the conversion of bare lands into green spaces could significantly increase the pollination level in Tehran city.

AB  - The bird community in urban areas indicates the species-specific adaptability to urban conditions such as the increase in man-made habitats. Urban adapters and urban exploiters, two groups that make up most of the urban birds, were assessed to determine their suitable habitat and explain their distribution, as well as to determine the environmental predictors for the two bird groups assemblages in Depok, one of Jakarta's satellite cities. We used the point-count method to survey the birds in three habitat types, green spaces, residentials, and roadside, and then we used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to analyze the species distribution modeling. We also the predicted habitat distributions for the urban adapters and urban exploiters based on several environmental predictors. Our results suggest that both urban adapters and urban exploiters were abundant in residential areas. Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) and cave swiflets (Collocalia linchi) were the most common species in all three habitat types. On average, canopy cover was most extensive in green spaces followed by residential and roadside areas. Urban exploiters were likely to have a high suitability extent compared to urban adapters. The distributions of both groups were affected by the distance to perennial water, then by land function for the urban adapters, and distance to patches for the urban exploiters. The presence of urban adapters and urban exploiters in residential areas suggests that home gardens supported critical habitats when green spaces were unavailable.

AB  - The urban ecological network has gained substantial interest in the context of urban sustainable development research in recent years. It guides the optimization of the urban ecological spatial layout, which is an important means for inventory development and ecological construction. However, traditional construction methods may not be suitable for urban environments with complex matrices. This can result in the inaccurate extraction of urban ecological networks. This study aimed to improve understanding of the current distribution and composition of key elements in urban ecological networks. In the present study, an optimized evaluation method involving ecological source patches and resistance surfaces was used to identify and extract an urban ecological network. The Minhang District (MhD) of Shanghai formed the study area. The results showed that: (1) There was spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality and the location importance of cores in the MhD. These two factors were inconsistent with the area size. (2) The habitat quality for the same land use types were significantly different. This was because of both vegetation quality and the external environment. (3) The urban ecological network for the MhD had 82 source patches. These were unevenly distributed and mainly concentrated in Pudong. (4) A total of 133 least-cost paths were extracted from between the source patches. However, the cost of least-cost paths were generally high in Puxi. This was not conducive to forming functional connections between patches. This study provided an optimization method for identifying and extracting ecological networks in urban areas by combining Geographical Information System software (GIS), Guidos, Graphab, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Ecological indicators such as NDVI, the percentage variation of the probability of connectivity (dPC), and habitat quality were applied to improve accuracy. The study findings lay the foundation for further layout optimization and supporting ecological planning.

AB  - The yellow-legged gull is an opportunistic and generalist bird that has colonised urban areas, where it has found very favourable trophic resources but also causes disturbance to humans and damage to infrastructure. Here, we investigated the potential role that gulls play in the dispersal of plants in Barcelona, a highly populated city of northeastern Spain. We analysed the stomach contents of 145 chicks collected in urban nests and reported the presence of seeds of 27 plant taxa. We then developed a plant dispersal model based on the movements of 20 GPS-tracked yellow-legged gulls breeding in the city of Barcelona. We estimated seed dispersal distances, seed shadows and percentage of seeds reaching habitats suitable for seeds regurgitated in pellets and those excreted in faeces. Seven of the 27 plant taxa found in the stomachs were alien taxa to Spain. Average dispersal distances of plant seeds by gulls were around 700 m, but maximum dispersal distances reached up to 35 km. Dispersal distances and seed spatial patterns did not differ between faeces and pellet models, as most strongly depended on gull movements. About 95% of the seeds were dispersed within urban environments and between 20 and 30% reached suitable habitats for seed deposition (urban woodlands, green urban parks and urban grasslands). Urban gulls frequently dispersed seeds (including alien species) within urban habitats, both via direct consumption or via secondary dispersal after consuming granivorous birds that had ingested the seeds, such as pigeons or parakeets. Urban planning for Barcelona is based on native plant species, and thus, special attention should be paid to alien plants dispersed by birds, which could pose a risk to native biodiversity in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation, a contributor to biodiversity degradation in urbanized regions, will result from rapid urbanization. Due to the low quality of habitats and the complexity of land use in high-density cities, traditional ecological corridor development approaches may not be viable for urban contexts. Furthermore, unlike other ecological corridors, the width of urban ecological corridors is not fixed due to very constrained land use and a high density of structures in urbanized areas. However, we discovered few studies on how to build urban ecological corridors in densely populated areas. Aside from that, earlier studies primarily concentrated on identifying potential paths for ecological corridors, with the spatial range of ecological corridors typically being determined subjectively. The goal of this research was to develop an integrated approach for determining the suitable areas of ecological corridors in a rapidly urbanizing region. Firstly, key species for urban ecological corridors were identified and Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) was applied to identify core areas and established corridors in the city, which was then integrated with NDVI and InVEST to construct resistance surfaces. Potential corridor paths were identified and graded for importance by Linkage Mapper. Finally, our research established a metric and indicators system, four indicators were set in this framework: the suitable width for animal migration, the maximum cost-weighted distances animals can migrate, areas with high mobility potential, and areas with greatest restoration opportunities. A total of 33 urban ecological sources and 63 ecological corridors were identified. The corridor is only 10 m wide at its narrowest point and 100 mat its widest point. Delimiting the appropriate areas of ecological corridors can provide spatial guidance for the implementation of corridors and ensuring ecological security in densely populated areas.

AB  - Urbanization disrupts landscapes and ecosystem functions, which poses threats to biodiversity, social systems, and human health, particularly among vulnerable populations. Urban land-use planners are faced with competing demands for housing, safety, transportation, and economic development and often lack tools to integrate these with protecting environmental functions. We identify three major barriers to integrating the benefits that flow with connected, functioning ecosystems into land-use planning. The lack of a shared language among planners and stakeholders poses a barrier to the restoration and preservation of ecological features. Methods of incorporating the benefits from connectivity are not standardized because values are not readily available or lack credibility. Ecological restoration tends to be poorly coordinated at broad scales, and thus often fails to achieve landscape-level objectives. To address these challenges, we developed a novel integrated framework, the Connectivity Benefits Framework (CBF), which combines the benefits from three categories of ecosystem connectivity with benefit-and risk-relevant indicators, enabling both monetary and non-monetary valuation of benefits. Moreover, it provides a method to identify and visualize the multiple and overlapping benefits from management actions to aid in prioritizing initiatives that support ecosystem functions. Unlike software tools that incorporate generalized values of ecosystem services at a landscape level, the CBF guides a systematic approach to community-engaged land-use planning that prioritizes localized societal needs while protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function for more equitable, resilient cities. We demonstrate the potential for multiple overlapping benefits from actions that restore and protect ecosystem connectivity by applying the framework to a transit planning project in Portland, Oregon.

AB  - Context Conversion of land cover by urban expansion is typically thought to reduce functional diversity by homogenizing species composition, at least in well-studied temperate locations. Studies of highly diverse and disturbance-sensitive tropical ecosystems remain rare. Objectives By exhaustively surveying resident forest bird communities across an urbanizing Neotropical region we aimed to: (1) assess the patterns and landscape-level correlates of species occurrences in forest habitat; (2) identify trait predictors of species occurrences in urban forest patches; and (3) evaluate the associations between urbanization and phylogenetic and functional diversity. Methods We inventoried forest bird communities along the Panama Canal, an area characterized by a strong urbanization gradient from remnant patches surrounded by a densely populated metropolis (Panama City) to extensive tracts of protected rainforest in National Parks. We determined associations of community composition, species traits, and functional and phylogenetic diversity with landscape-level attributes. Results In contrast to most previous studies reporting community homogenization, forest patches in urbanized central Panama contained different subsets of resident bird species. Species in forests within in the most urbanized subregions generally were those with strong dispersal abilities, short developmental periods, and recent evolutionary histories. Although species identities varied among urban patches, functional and phylogenetic diversity were similar. Conclusions Our results are best characterized by community "simplification"-a loss of species without loss of functional or phylogenetic representation. The dissimilarity of bird community composition among forest patches in urbanized regions appears to be a unique outcome and could be influenced by patch-specific attributes.

AB  - Simple Summary The continuous intensification of urbanisation has led to severe degradation and loss of bird habitats, directly affecting the diversity of birds. In this study, we focused on seven representative river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) to analyse the impact of urbanisation on bird diversity. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. Urbanisation was an important driving factor that changed land use types near rivers and the structure of bird communities. The response model of river ecological indicators to the intensity of urbanisation shows a negative exponential correlation between the waterbird diversity index and the urbanisation intensity. Our research is of great significance for future urban landscape planning and bird community diversity protection. Urbanisation is known to result in 'urban stream syndrome', which poses a huge threat to the river health. Birds, which are an important part of the river ecosystem, are sensitive to environmental changes in the basin. The ratio of the impervious surface area is a macroscopic indicator of urbanisation intensity in river basins. In this study, we combined the results of a year-round field survey of seven river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) with satellite remote sensing image data from the same period. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. The waterbird diversity index declined exponentially with increases in the intensity of urbanisation. The changes in the land use patterns around river wetlands associated with urbanisation resulted in the loss of food resources and habitats. Therefore, the intensity of urbanisation was an important driving factor that leads to changes in the bird community structure of river wetlands, so it had a significant impact on the diversity of river wetland birds in all four seasons combined with a variety of influencing factors. Our research could be a guide for urban landscape planning and bird diversity protection. For example, the results suggested that it is necessary to identify river wetlands as an important part of the urban ecosystem, reduced building area, increased vegetation coverage, and retained slope protection and river beach land.

AB  - A national green planning strategy has recently been introduced in the Italian urban planning sector, aimed at making all local initiatives undertaken nationwide consistent with each other. At a regional level, Friuli Venezia-Giulia has recently implemented a Landscaping Plan, which is of an urban planning and ecological nature at an intermediate level between national and local. This article describes the local green plan of Latisana, which has been titled Ecopolitana, given that it represents the experimental phase, at a regional level, of the possibilities offered by landscape planning and design. Specifically, it outlines the multi-disciplinary approach used, demonstrating how landscape planning can be compared to the sustainable development of cities, with specific regard to the agricultural sector. In this regard, a low-intensity cropping model is also suggested, based on the principles of agroecology and landscape ecology, which has already been implemented in the historical rural landscape of Plasencis (UD) and investigated through GIS analysis and remote sensing processes. Its aim is to be the starting point for the achievement of the goals set in the 2030 Agenda, especially Goals 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land), given the current scarcity of agroecological infrastructures in the area of Latisana (UD) and the high percentage of soil used for intensive cropping.

AB  - Longitudinal environmental heterogeneity and directionality of the water movement are key features that may exert contrasting forces on riverine plankton assembly. Directionality strengthens dispersal-driven assembly, but this can be masked by urbanization-induced environmental heterogeneity along the river continuum. In the light of this contrast, we aimed at delineating the relative importance of assembly processes generating distribution patterns of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton communities in a river draining an urbanizing watershed in Southeast China. We applied variation partitioning analysis, neutral community model, and quantitative process estimate on molecular and morphological plankton data obtained over the years 2012-2016. Despite a relatively short distance between sampling sites (< 20 km), plankton community similarity decreased with increasing distance from the upstream pristine site toward the downstream urban area, and formed clusters that roughly corresponded to five habitat patches, predefined based on hydrology and longitudinal landscape change. These distribution patterns were predominantly driven by deterministic and stochastic processes for phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, respectively, indicating a balance between dispersal due to fluvial connectivity and local selective pressures. Considering the global loss of river connectivity due to downstream fragmentation and flow regulation, our findings imply that plankton-based ecological approaches could be useful to hedge against an uncertain future of rivers draining urbanizing watersheds in an ecologically sustainable way.

AB  - Given that rates of urbanization are rising globally, the need to maintain and enhance urban biodiversity has become important. This study examines the relative influence of different land-use types as well as environmental resources (trees, flowering trees, fruiting trees, shrubs, telecommunication mast, pylons, electric poles, buildings) on bird diversity indicators in a rapidly developing urban settlement in Ghana. Remote sensing was used to estimate the extent of conversion of natural habitats into urban settlements. Using point count surveys, bird species were recorded and compared in randomly selected plots of four land-use types of farmlands, remnant forest, residential and commercial areas. We further evaluated the relative influence of habitat resources on bird diversity indicators. We found a significant expansion of built-up areas into natural habitats in the study area. Also, there has been a significant increase in sparse vegetation coupled with a drop in the area covered by dense vegetation over the last three decades. Avifauna diversity indicators differ significantly across the four land-use types with urban farmlands being the most species diverse, followed by urban remnant forests, then residential and finally commercial areas. Our findings suggest that avian species diversity indicators decreased significantly with increasing land-use intensity and revealed that the study area still possesses significant conservation potentials for urban birds and by extension biological diversity as long as vegetation fragments are maintained within a sustained urban expansion framework. We propose increasing the quantity and complexity of the vegetation cover in residential areas by supporting citizens to establish private yards to increase the city's green network.

AB  - Dung beetles are important actors in the self-regulation of ecosystems by driving nutrient cycling, bioturbation, and pest suppression. Urbanization and the sprawl of agricultural areas, however, destroy natural habitats and may threaten dung beetle diversity. In addition, climate change may cause shifts in geographical distribution and community composition. We used a space-for-time approach to test the effects of land use and climate on alpha-diversity, local community specialization (H-2 ') on dung resources, and gamma-diversity of dung-visiting beetles. For this, we used pitfall traps baited with four different dung types at 115 study sites, distributed over a spatial extent of 300 km x 300 km and 1000 m in elevation. Study sites were established in four local land-use types: forests, grasslands, arable sites, and settlements, embedded in near-natural, agricultural, or urban landscapes. Our results show that abundance and species density of dung-visiting beetles were negatively affected by agricultural land use at both spatial scales, whereas gamma-diversity at the local scale was negatively affected by settlements and on a landscape scale equally by agricultural and urban land use. Increasing precipitation diminished dung-visiting beetle abundance, and higher temperatures reduced community specialization on dung types and gamma-diversity. These results indicate that intensive land use and high temperatures may cause a loss in dung-visiting beetle diversity and alter community networks. A decrease in dung-visiting beetle diversity may disturb decomposition processes at both local and landscape scales and alter ecosystem functioning, which may lead to drastic ecological and economic damage.

AB  - Habitat deterioration and biodiversity decline is progressing worldwide. However, these effects may be somewhat mitigated in urban areas, which are strongly exposed to anthropogenic pressure. The protected sites may here impede habitat loss and serve as effective tool of biodiversity conservation. The aim of this study was to test if location (inside/outside Natura 2000 sites) and size of habitat fragments affect the habitat loss and population trends in metapopulations of three Phengaris butterflies exposed to urbanization pressure. Across 20 years of study the number of habitat patches decreased by half, mainly outside N2000 sites. Total area of available habitat decreased by 13% for P. teleius and P. nausithous butterflies, and by 21% for P. alcon. Negative population trends were observed for all three species at small and medium-size habitat patches located outside N2000 sites as well as at small patches inside N2000 sites. The existing populations appear to be vulnerable outside N2000 sites. Our findings indicate that N2000 sites fulfill their protective function in halting population loss of species of high conservation interest and effective protection of intact habitats may support urban biodiversity. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to expand the existing protected areas in order to save remnant local populations from their imminent extinctions in near future, as the species legal protection is not effective beyond N2000 sites. As meadow habitats serve a whole range of ecosystem services, their remnants deserve to be effectively protected in urbanized areas.

AB  - constitute one of the richest and most endangered groups in Mexico; however, their diversity and threat factors at the regional level remain little known in many parts of the country, including in protected areas. We analyzed amphibian diversity of the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Mexico, 40% of which occurs within the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera La Sepultura, or REBISE). We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Inter-transect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health.

AB  - This article combines stated preference methods and graph-based landscape approaches to assess the possible synergy existing between households' residential preferences and biodiversity conservation in urban areas. We start by estimating household's residential preferences regarding different landscape attributes (i.e. green spaces and compactness of the neighbourhood) of chosen urban contexts applying the choice experiment method. Then, by integrating ecological indicators obtained by using a graph-based approach in our valuation model, we study the impact of the residential choice on biodiversity conservation. Our results suggest that the preferred neighbourhood also have landscape structure that are in favour of biodiversity conservation. The preference heterogeneity for green spaces and compactness will induce landscape-based sorting. Household's residential location choices affect biodiversity conservation differently which depend on their socio-demographic characteristics.

AB  - US Corn Belt landscapes are heavily anthropogenic, consisting of a vast agricultural matrix with embedded urban areas. Little non-agricultural vegetated land remains in this region. Vegetation and vegetated areas in urban settings may thus be key to supporting this region's wildlife. We sought to assess relationships between mesopredator (mid-sized mammalian omnivores and carnivores) distributions and landscape structure and composition in a Corn Belt city, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. Using data from a network of motion-triggered cameras, we constructed multi-season occupancy models for five mesopredator species to identify occupancy patterns and their relationship to vegetated and built land cover and landscape structure within species-specific home range buffers. Species with larger home ranges, red fox and coyote, were more likely to colonize sites with greater amounts of forested land cover, more streams, and more cohesive patches of non-agricultural vegetation, and less likely to colonize sites with more impervious surfaces. Once established at sites, opossum and coyote were unlikely to disappear from sites regardless of landscape composition and structure. However, red fox was less likely to go extinct from sites with more impervious land cover while domestic cats were more likely to go extinct from sites with greater extents of and more cohesive natural land covers. These findings, by highlighting key landscape aspects driving occupancy dynamics for these species, could support mesopredator conservation in cities in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Planning and policy are best done through integrated approaches that holistically address multiple sustainability issues. Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most significant issues facing our planet. Accordingly, advancements in integrated sustainability planning and policy require a means for examining how certain strategies and actions may align or conflict with these sustainability imperatives. Here, we enhance the knowledge of integrated approaches for addressing sustainability challenges by developing and applying a framework for examining different planning and policy areas in the context of climate action and biodiversity conservation. As a case study, we used wildlife crossing planning and landscape connectivity policy in Canada, which is currently piecemeal, fragmented, and could benefit from an integrated approach. The study was conducted in two stages. First, we developed an analytical framework for examining issues in the context of climate action and biodiversity conservation co-benefits and trade-offs. Then, we applied the framework to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity issues to elucidate opportunities and challenges for integrated planning and policy. We used a literature review to develop an integrated climate-biodiversity framework (ICBF). ICBF was subsequently applied to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity planning and policies in Canada. ICBF maps relationships between climate action and biodiversity conservation co-benefits and trade-offs and is organized into six themes: green space, transportation, green infrastructure, food and agriculture, energy, and land management. Applying ICBF to participant interview data produced insights into opportunities and challenges for integrated approaches to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity by elucidating potential co-benefits and trade-offs such as alignments between stormwater management and aquatic crossings (i.e., co-benefits) and potential issues related to energy development and habitat fragmentation (i.e., trade-offs). ICBF has application beyond wildlife crossings, and its continual use and refinement will result in a better understanding of how to effectively implement integrated approaches and transition toward sustainable development paths.

AB  - The main tool for biodiversity conservation at the European level is the Natura 2000 network. The identification of Natura 2000 as an "ecological network spread over the entire European Union territory" is the symbolic image launched by the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) even though many considerations focused on the contradiction between the shared model of the ecological network-based on spatial continuity-and the fragmented geographical configuration of the Natura 2000 sites. Currently, it stretches across all 28 European countries, both on land and at sea, and it is made up of over 27,000 sites for a total extension of approximately 1,150,000 km(2). The land area covered by N2000 corresponds to approximately 18% of the total EU, with the national coverage ratio ranging from a minimum of 9% to a maximum of 38% in the various European countries. The aim of this study was to determine the degree of landscape fragmentation caused by the urban areas towards the Natura 2000 network, with the aim of analyzing how the current urban settlements' geography could compromise their functionality. The proximity analysis carried out provides the necessary information to achieve full efficiency in the connections between the different habitats. In addition, these results give indications on which planning scale is most appropriate to intervene to reduce environmental fragmentation.

AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, construction land is gradually expanding, leading to a loss of ecological land. This is increasing the risk of connectivity loss between important natural habitats. In this study, potential ecological corridors and stepping stones under ecological security patterns with different connectivity levels were identified according to the important habitats and resistance surfaces. We analyzed the development potential, vulnerability, and connectivity loss of a fragmented landscape using a support vector machine (SVM), a circuit theory model, and the "exposure-vulnerability-potential loss" framework. Four types of stepping stones that require protection were defined according to the risk structure and level. The results showed that there are 40 important habitats and 50 potential ecological corridors in the ecological security pattern. The SVM results indicated that the possibility of patch development is most sensitive to protection status (-0.923), followed by the slope (-0.770), and distance from the city (-0.210) and roads (-0.147). Additionally, the impact of railways (0.056) and night-time light (0.092) was limited. Elevation (0.267) had a positive effect on development. With an increased security level, the proportion of middle- and high-risk stepping stones gradually decreased, which means that the risk of connectivity loss under urban development can be reduced by creating a security pattern with a higher level and including more stepping-stone patches. Connectivity loss risk management can provide a reference for ecological control line revision and land use planning.

AB  - Urban parks can provide a resource for maintaining and increasing bird biodiversity. However, little research has been conducted to show the differences in bird community diversity between parks adjacent to mountains and rivers in the city center of highly urbanized areas. This study analysed whether the bird composition and species diversity differed between parks adjacent to Baiyun Mountain (hillside parks) and Pearl River (riverside parks) in Guangzhou, South China. From January 2018 to December 2020, 137927 birds representing 206 species were recorded. The results indicated that the number of species and individuals of birds were higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in each season. The number of species and individuals was also higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in different functional groups according to bird food type, residential type, and ecological type. The number of species shared by the two types of parks was 120. The unique birds' species number in hillside and riverside parks were 67 and 19, respectively. Bird diversity in terms of richness and Shannon index was higher significantly in hillside parks than in riverside parks in summer. Principal component analysis of environmental traits of 18 parks showed that plant traits in parks have relatively high and positive contribution. Correlation analysis indicated that bird diversity was positively affected by water area, the highest altitude, habitats diversity and tree evenness in park, while negatively regulated by building coverage around each park. The top 20 most abundant bird species accounted for 87.5% of the total birds in the study period. Nycticorax nycticorax, Urocissa erythroryncha and Podiceps ruficollis were observed more frequently in hillside parks, while Pycnonotus aurigaster, Passer montanus, Acridotheres cristatellus were observed more frequently in riverside parks. Principal coordinates analysis also indicated that bird communities significantly differed between hillside parks and riverside parks. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of conserving mountains and rivers as buffer zones for serious anthropogenic disturbance in the city center. We propose that the conservation of hillside parks is a priority strategy for enhancing urban birds biodiversity.

AB  - Urban landscapes contain many barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow, particularly for large terrestrial mammals with extensive natural home ranges. Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (HE: 0.224 & ndash;0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region (Ne = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane (Ne = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity (HE: 0.188 & ndash; 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo pop-ulations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity. We emphasise that for the conservation of local and global biodiversity, it is imperative to assess baseline genetic status of both common and threatened species, particularly when declines and extirpations are occurring across these species & rsquo; ranges.

AB  - Context Cities are heterogeneous landscapes, composed of different urban uses with diverse histories. A thorough description of these urban landscapes is required to understand ecological patterns, particularly concerning high-stakes species such as invasive alien plants (IAP) which are abundant in cities. Objectives We assessed the effects of urban uses and linear structural elements on the distributions of seven IAP in a medium-sized French city (Blois). We examined how the relative contributions of these variables vary between three spatial scales of analysis (100 m, 200 m and 400 m) and three urban classifications. Methods We characterized the use and age of urban neighborhoods through three classifications with different levels of details and described road and rail networks of Blois. We analyzed their effects on the distribution of seven invasive plants recorded throughout the whole city using GLM models. Results Urban use was the most significant variable in explaining IAP distribution. This variable was especially important at the finest spatial scale which allowed a detailed urban classification. Individual residential neighborhoods of different ages explained the distribution of Buddleja davidii, Berberis aquifolium and Acer negundo, whereas industrial areas explained Ailanthus altissima distribution. The effects of linear structural elements were lower and differed between species. Conclusions We show that combining fine-scale spatial analyses with detailed characterization of urban use diversity is critical to understanding ecological patterns at the city scale. Investigating planting choices and dispersal process of IAP could complete our results. Urban descriptions based on explicit urban forms could also contribute to understanding species distribution in cities.

AB  - Urban green corridors are the vital link connecting urban blue-green space and provide ecosystem services. Although numerous studies have been carried out to identify urban green corridors, few studies have focused on the demand of both urban residents and species for blue-green space from the perspective of daily life circles, which are the basic unit of requirements in city area. In this study, we proposed an improved method that considered three types of daily life circles and further integrated the socioeconomic factors in daily life circles that affect the stability of green spaces into the construction of green corridors. We adopted the city central area of Wuhan as a case study to apply the evaluation method. The results indicated that the three types of daily life circles were close to the practical life. Socioeconomic factors in the daily life circles affected the stability of blue-green space; thus, it is necessary to integrate them into the green corridor construction. Accordingly, we improved a strategy to construct green corridors based on daily life circle theory. Our method extends the green corridor construction methodology, and the research results can provide a significant reference for urban planning to build more reasonable green corridors to move toward both biodiversity and satisfy the demand of residents and species for blue-green space.

AB  - Destruction of natural habitat, land-use changes and biological invasion are some of the major threats to biodiversity. Both habitat alteration and biological invasions can have impacts on pollinator communities and pollination network structures. This study aims to examine the effect of an invasive plant, praxelis (Praxelis clematidea; Asteraceae), and land-use types on pollinator communities and the structure of pollination networks. We conducted the study in smallholder orchards which are either invaded or non-invaded by P. clematidea. We estimated the pollinator richness, visitation rates, and pollinator diversity and evaluated the network structures from 18 smallholder orchards in Northeastern Thailand. The effect of landscape structure in the vicinity of the orchards was investigated, with the proportion of agricultural, forest, and urban landscape within a 3 km radius analyzed. The invasive species and land-use disturbance influence the pollinator communities and pollination network structure at species level was affected by the presence of P. clematidea. Bees were the most important pollinator group for pollinator communities and pollination networks of both invaded or non-invaded plots, as bees are a generalist species, they provide the coherence of both the network and its own module. The urban landscape had a strong negative influence on pollinator richness, while the proportions of agriculture and forest landscape positively affected the pollinator community.

AB  - The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area urban agglomeration is an urban agglomeration with some of the most intensive urbanization since 1980s. A large amount of cultivated land, forest land, water bodies and other land types in the region has been occupied by construction land, resulting in fragmented ecological landscapes and biodiversity in the region and causing many other ecological problems. Based on this, this paper takes the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as a case study, constructs an ecological network of the dispersion scale of five species from 1990 to 2020 based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method, identifies the ecological groups in the network and uses the core node-based community evolution path tracking algorithm to analyze the ecological groups in order to explore the changes of ecological network connectivity at different scales in the region and to reveal the overall and local characteristics and changes of the migratory space of terrestrial mammals with different dispersion capabilities. The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region. (2) There are obvious differences between the overall and local changes in the connectivity trends of multi-scale regional ecological networks. On the whole, the overall ecological connectivity of the ecological network at each scale showed a gradual upward trend, and the overall connectivity index IIC and the possible connectivity index PC gradually increased with the increase of the maximum dispersal distance of species. From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small. Small-scale (3 km), mesoscale (10 km) and large-scale (30 km) core nodes of ecological groups show a gradual increase trend, and the overall connectivity of ecological groups has improved. However, the core nodes of the extra-large-scale (60 km) and ultra-large-scale (100 km) ecological groups show a trend of decreasing fluctuations, and the overall connectivity within the ecological group has declined. This study is helpful to clarify the structural characteristics of regional ecological space and provide a theoretical basis for regional ecological planning.

AB  - Urbanization drastically alters landscapes in ways that can threaten local biodiversity. Although species loss has been well documented in urban habitats, why some species persist and not others, and how species interactions change remain poorly understood, especially for species with specialized niche requirements. Here, we test the hypothesis that urbanization disrupts specialized plant-herbivore interactions, and these effects vary according to the characteristics of both cities and the features of the organisms themselves. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed milkweed specialist herbivore communities in the early and late growing season of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) across six cities that varied in size by two orders of magnitude. Four results are most important to answering our research questions: (1) the abundance of herbivore species was higher in urban than in rural habitats, whereas leaf herbivory was higher in rural than in urban habitats, and these effects varied between seasons and among cities; (2) the higher species diversity and abundance are likely due to a few species being more associated with rural habitats and other species more common in urban habitats, and thus, urbanization alters insect community composition; (3) the species with the lowest dispersal abilities, Rhyssomatus lineaticollis and Liriomyza asclepiadis, were those that were most strongly affected by urbanization, with R. lineaticollis less abundant and L. asclepiadis more abundant in urban areas; and (4) urbanization influenced plant-herbivore interactions by reducing herbivory, but it did not alter species interactions among herbivorous insects. Biodiversity loss, particularly declines of habitat and host specialists, in urban areas remains a critical concern for conservation. Our results indicate that at least some specialist herbivores are more abundant in urban areas than in rural areas and that species interactions remain intact.

AB  - Under the COVID-19 epidemic, the structural resilience of urban networks has become an important guarantee for social and economic stability and recovery. In this study, population mobility data and freight demand information are selected to construct urban networks. The complex network is used to describe the development level from five aspects of diversity, equilibrium, reciprocity, assortativity and transmission of network structure. And the entropy weight TOPSIS method is used to calculate the structural resilience of urban network based on the description of development level. We find that as the epidemic increases, the structure of population mobility network and freight demand network shows an evolutionary trend from 'single-center' to 'dual-center', and then to 'polycentric'. Meanwhile, a flat network structure is conducive to higher structural resilience. Because the impact of diversity on the structural resilience of population mobility network and freight demand network is respectively 0.541 and 0.142, while the impact of equilibrium is respectively 0.440 and 0.769. The network with high diversity and equilibrium tends to form flat structure and show stronger resilience. Besides, the 'long-range link' in the population mobility network and the phenomenon of 'imbalance transfer' in the freight demand network can also help to improve the structural resilience of the network. Therefore, cities can establish a flat network through polycentric construction and cross-regional cooperation, while improving the heterogeneity of the urban network, they should also promote all-round and multi-faceted development of the network.

AB  - Urbanization exerts many pressures on species, yet little is known about how these pressures impact species interactions. Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and a green corridor influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban-rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the complexity with which urbanization, a green corridor, and pollinator communities can shape the reproductive investment and fitness of native plant populations.

AB  - The woody plant communities found on residential properties constitute an integral component of cities' green infrastructure and serve as a nexus between urban residents and the natural world. Despite this importance, residential landscapes are infrequently designed with principles of sustainability in mind, resulting in the extensive use of pesticides to suppress a diverse array of plant pests. In this study, we ask whether ecological theory can inform the sustainable design and management of woody plant communities on urban residential properties. The associational resistance and dilution effect hypotheses are analogous hypotheses, which posit that increasing biodiversity can inhibit the abundance of herbivores and pathogens, respectively. Importantly, theory suggests that it might not just be diversity that matters, but the right kind of diversity (i.e., community composition). Previous studies have demonstrated that herbivore abundance can be greater on native plants compared to exotic plants in residential landscapes. However, little is known regarding whether this translates into greater numbers of interventions to reduce damage associated with plant pests on native plants. To test these hypotheses, we utilized a multi-year, commercial plant health care program dataset. We examined, at the residential property scale, the relationships between woody plant diversity, the percentage of plants that were native, and pest management interventions. We found that the number of pest management interventions targeting phytophagous arthropods, but not plant pathogens, was negatively related to woody plant biodiversity. The percentage of native plants on a property had no relationship with the number of pest management interventions that occurred. Consequently, efforts to increase woody plant biodiversity in residential landscapes could result in increased phytophagous arthropod pest suppression, thereby reducing the need for pesticide applications and their associated adverse effects.

AB  - Human development and roads threaten wildlife through distinct mechanisms and understanding the influence of these elements can better inform mitigation and conservation strategies. We used camera traps to quantify the effects of major roads, environmental factors, and human development on the mammalian community composition between sites north and south of a major interstate highway in northern Utah, USA. We found no significant differences in species richness nor community similarity across the north-south divide of the highway. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we compared the effects of the distance to the highway, housing and human population density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the human footprint index to changes in mammalian community composition and species-specific habitat usage. Community occupancy response, similarity, and species richness were negatively affected by increased housing and human population densities and positively affected by increased NDVI and decreased human footprint, whereas their response to the highway was more inconclusive. We conclude that mammalian community composition in our study area is influenced by both environmental conditions and human development while the effect of the highway was more nuanced, possibly due to the presence of a newly constructed wildlife overpass. Taken together, the lack of differences in species richness or community composition across the highway suggests that it may not currently exacerbate the effects of other anthropogenic sources of habitat fragmentation and highlights the need for additional research into human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and ecological connectivity. Green infrastructure (GI) networks and corridors are promoted as a way to preserve habitat connectivity even in the context of urbani-sation. Yet, previous research has a primary focus on the ecological benefits that may be provided by GI networks without also valuing other potential ecosystem services. There has also been a lack of research into how the design of urban developments, including the potential of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), may contribute to such networks. Using a case study region in south-east England, different development scenarios and urban designs were assessed under metrics quantifying four aspects of GI provision - ecological services, ecological status, ecological connectivity, and proximity to the population. These were then combined into a single score to compare the overall spatiality of GI potential across the region under the different design and development approaches. Three key considerations for planners were found: first, the positive role urban spaces can play, even without SuDS or considering the proximity to the population, in contributing to GI potentials; second, the bal-ance required between different development approaches to manage the trade-offs between each; and third, the range of positive and negative impacts different SuDS infrastructure have on GI potentials under different urban designs.

AB  - Carbon sequestration (CS) and habitat provisioning (HP) through building-integrated vegetation are interlinked approaches that could potentially reduce climate change and biodiversity loss attributed to the built environment. However, a practical approach is required to integrate CS and HP into building design. A two-stage approach was undertaken in this research; firstly, preparing a conceptual framework from an extensive literature review and, secondly, gauging the perspective of building industry experts on that framework through a survey. The survey was designed to determine expert opinion related to establishing the data gathering approaches, progressing to identifying strategies and methods to quantify them, and finally, monitoring performance indicators for achieving CS and HP goals. The results of descriptive analyses performed after data collection indicate a notable difference in opinions between built environment professionals (group A) and environmental scientists and researchers (group B). The findings indicate that respondents emphasized maintaining vegetation in order to maximize CS rates and biodiversity levels. Moreover, spatial ecology considerations, including landscape-level parameters (vegetative area coverage, habitat availability, quality, and connectivity) and species-specific parameters (species selection based on their CS rates and habitat requirements for keystone species), must be analyzed while designing buildings for vegetation-based CS and HP.

AB  - Scientific understanding of biotic effects on the water trophic level is lacking for urban lakes during algal bloom development stage. Based on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multiple statistical analyses, we estimated distribution patterns and ecological roles of planktonic bacteria and eukaryotes in urban lakes during algal bloom development stage (i.e., April, May, and June). Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta mainly dominated algal blooms. Bacteria exhibited significantly higher absolute abundance and community diversity than eukaryotes, whereas abundance and diversity of eukaryotic rather than bacterial community relate closely to the water trophic level. Multinutrient cycling (MNC) index was significantly correlated with eukaryotic diversity rather than bacterial diversity. Stronger species replacement, broader environmental breadth, and stronger phylogenetic signal were found for eukaryotic community than for bacterial community. In contrast, bacterial community displayed stronger community stability and environmental constraint than eukaryotic community. Stochastic and differentiating processes contributed more to community assemblies of bacteria and eukaryotes. Our results emphasized that a strong linkage between planktonic diversity and MNC ensured a close relationship between planktonic diversity and the water trophic level of urban lakes. Our findings could be useful to guide the formulation and implementation of environmental lake protection measures.

AB  - Along with accelerating urbanization and associated anthropogenic disturbance, the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems worldwide are substantially damaged. To improve ecosystem health, and thus enhance the ecosystem security of the urban ecosystem, numbers of management approaches and engineering projects have been applied to mitigate the degradation of freshwaters. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic research on the ecological corridor restoration of freshwater ecosystems; especially for Suzhou Grand Canal, one section of the world's longest and ancient Grand Canal which is inclined to severe ecosystem degradation. Through investigating the adjacent land use characteristics, habitat quality, vegetation cover, instream water quality, and habitat composition, we aimed to: (i) assess the water quality of the Suzhou Grand Canal; (ii) evaluate the ecological characteristics of the canal ecosystem; (iii) develop strategic countermeasures to restore the ecological corridors for the mitigation of ecological problems. The results demonstrated: a large built area, a smaller ecological zone, a low habitat quality and habitat connectivity, and a high degree of habitat fragmentation within the canal corridor, also a simplified instream habitat composition, and greater nutrient and COD concentrations in the surface water-especially in the upstream and midstream canal. All urbanization-induced multiple stressors, such as land use changes, altered hydrology, and the simplified riparian zone et al., contributed synergistically to the degradation of the canal ecosystem. To alleviate the ecosystem deterioration, three aspects of recommendations were proposed: water pollution control, watershed ecosystem restoration, and ecological network construction. Basically, building a comprehensive watershed ecological network-on the basis of associated ecosystem restoration, and the connection of multi-dimensional ecological corridors-would dramatically increase the maintenance of aquatic-terrestrial system biodiversity, and improve the regional ecological security pattern and watershed resilience toward stochastic future disturbances. This study contributes to the understanding of the ecological challenges and related causes of the canal ecosystem. The integrated strategy introduced in this study provides policymakers, water resource managers, and planners with comprehensive guidelines to restore and manage the ecological corridor of the canal ecosystem. This can be used as a reference in freshwater ecosystems elsewhere, to improve ecosystem stability for supporting the sustainable development of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization caused by intensive land-use change is the main driving force of environment degradation. The development and protection of ecological corridors to connect green natural features has been recognized as an effective means for improving the resilience of cities. It is especially important for the cities which are in the rapid urbanizing process. In this paper, we used high-resolution spatial data to extract the distribution of ecological corridors by using the Least Cost Path model for the city of Taiyuan, China. Then, a prediction of the urban area for the year 2035 was achieved by using the SLEUTH model. Finally, we analyzed the negative impact of urban expansion on the corridors under current urbanization trends. Our results show that the regional corridors are mostly distributed in the western mountainous area, connecting large natural areas. There are also three ecological corridors crossing the city from the east to west. According to our prediction, Taiyuan will mainly grow southward along the urban edge and road network. As a result, two ecological corridors in the central and southern parts of Taiyuan will be largely occupied, especially the corridors in Xiaodian district which account for 72.51% of the total occupied corridor area. To avoid further conflict, the urbanization intensity along the sides of the corridors should be restricted to maintain corridors of a certain width. Our research findings can provide urban planners insightful suggestions for conservation and restoration of ecological networks and assist in spatial planning.

AB  - While it is appreciated that the biodiversity within vegetated green infrastructure generates ecosystem services that improve the well-being of urban residents, advances in urban sustainability are hindered because we lack a solid mechanistic understanding of how biodiversity provides these services. Here, we outline a trait-based urban ecology agenda for researching how species' traits provide ecosystem services (trait-service relationships) in tandem with how species with desired service-providing traits establish in vegetated green infrastructure (community assembly). Because trait-service relationships and community assembly processes can differ in urban versus natural environments, this agenda will fill major knowledge gaps of how biodiversity promotes urban sustainability. Results from our research agenda can be implemented by planners and managers to enhance service provisioning and ultimately improve urban sustainability.

AB  - The use of quantitative analysis and related metrics has traditionally been unusual for assessment of ecological impacts in urban planning. Since 2010, however, quantitative modelling has been increasingly used in such contexts in Sweden to analyze ecological connectivity. The study reviews and analyses 21 connectivity analysis reports (CAR) based on 17 criteria. Despite the use of quantitative analysis, CARs primarily leverage qualitative aspects of modelling results. Most CARs comply with about 50% of the proposed criteria and close to 90% of the reports fail to address some issues related to modelling transparency and therefore jeopardize an adequate ecological interpretation of the results. The results demonstrate that the primary accomplishment during the last decade is an increase in awareness and acceptance of ecological connectivity among practitioners and decisionmakers. Results point to that an increased use of quantitative methods per se will not deliver more sustainable outcomes, and that an increased use of quantitative methods for ecological impact assessment in urban planning needs to be accompanied by guidelines, standards, and a continuous science - practice knowledge exchange.

AB  - Urban forests are responsible for a lot of benefits, and can be used as a tool to ex-situ conservation of native species. Our study investigated a public urban forest aiming to provide subside to management projects in order to allow the accurate fulfillment of social, aesthetic and ecological functions displayed by trees. Our survey was conducted in 6 public squares and 5 gardens in the Jardins neighborhood. We classified the trees according to their phytogeographic origins and seed dispersal habit. The Shannon Weaver (H') index, Simpson's dominance (D') and Pielou's equability (J) were determined. A total of 507 individuals were sampled, located in 12 botanical families and 29 species, and 13 of them were classified as native and 16 as exotic. The family with higher species richness and number of species was Fabaceae (36%). Regarding the seed dispersal syndrome, the most representative was zoochory (52%). The ecological index showed medium species diversity (H'=2.2284), high dominance (D'=0.7899) and medium number of individuals (J) 0.6552. Although the Jardins neighborhood was planned, the urban forest in this area still needs improvement; such as incentive measures that can promote biodiversity and the application of ex-situ conservation.

AB  - Ongoing, rapid urbanization accompanied by habitat fragmentation and loss poses great threats to biodiversity and the ecosystem. Maintaining ecological networks (ENs) connectivity provides a powerful landscape strategy to confront these ecological consequences. However, for rapid urbanization contexts, the connectivity of ENs cannot be well maintained by the current protection system under the impacts of continuous land expansion. Although the stepping-stones protection offers feasible connectivity-based schemes, the degree of their availability in dynamic land expansion scenarios is unclear. In this study, we developed a static and dynamic coupling approach that emphasized a comprehensive ENs protection system should be incorporated into future land expansion scenarios. The system included landscape defects identification which can be built as stepping-stones outside the traditional ENs establishment framework for ENs connectivity restoration. Taking Southern Jiangsu as the application case, our results showed that there were 127 existing landscape defects covering a total area of 285.00 km2, in the fragmented regional ENs, constituting the group of stepping-stones that can efficiently improve the ENs connectivity. Meanwhile, we confirmed that these stepping-stones were vulnerable although they were included in the protection system, with 70% of the total would be degraded and 13% lost due to the encroachments caused by future land expansion. Therefore, we proposed an alternative scenario that designated stepping-stones as restricted land expansion areas integrated into the comprehensive ENs protection system to maintain their persistent roles in connectivity. This study highlighted the weakness of traditional ENs establishment for rapid urbanization contexts and provided practical contributions to improving the effect of regional ecological protection and restoration.

AB  - High-intensity urban development and economic exploitation have led to the fragmentation and isolation of regional habitat patches, and biodiversity is under serious threat. Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km(2), 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of "two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes" was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas. This study can provide realistic paths and scientific guidelines for ecological security and high-quality development in the MASHP, and it can also have implications for the construction of ecological networks and comprehensive ecological management in other mountainous areas.

AB  - Connectivity is essential to ensure vegetation conservation and adaptation to climate change. Human actions produce a progressive fragmentation of the vegetation, affecting its quality and persistence. Adequate consideration of this effect in environmental assessment is necessary, but is often lacking; project impacts are frequently considered negligible, despite being cumulative. The aim of this review is to analyse the literature on fragmentation and loss of ecological connectivity in vegetation, to identify the main impacts and how to mitigate them. A novelty is the linking of these impacts to the human actions that generate them, which facilitates their consideration in the environmental assessment. Vegetation clearing results in fragmentation, separating patches whose persistence will depend on their size, shape or isolation. Reduced flow also causes loss of connectivity between rivers and floodplains. Fragmentation and induced connectivity favour the entry of invasive plants. These effects become more significant when threatened species or habitats are affected. Mitigation measures need to be implemented to avoid, minimise, restore and compensate for these impacts; ecological corridors can combine all these types of measures. Monitoring is essential to assess the dynamics of restored areas, and to detect changes in vegetation or the entry of invasive species. Only proper consideration of these impacts in decision-making, and appropriate mitigation, can control the negative cumulative effects that are currently occurring.

AB  - Urban green space designed based on the concept of sponge city is an important sponge carrier. Guided by the theory of landscape ecology, this article introduces the artificial neural network (ANN) model and uses the research method of landscape pattern index to establish a model for the proportion of urban green space types and the characteristics and dynamic changes of landscape spatial pattern. Based on the optimal landscape pattern index, the theoretical value of the optimal proportion of ecological green space, community park, comprehensive park, roadside green space, protective green space, and strip green space is obtained through the model. Based on this proportion value, combined with the ANN model, the reasonable evaluation results of patch density and average perimeter area ratio, spread degree, and diversity index of planned green space are obtained. Then, according to the influence of various green spaces on each landscape index, the development trend of urban green space construction in the future is predicted.

AB  - One of the most populated areas of the world is the Metropolitan Zone of the Mexican Valley, which has serious atmospheric pollution problems. To the north of the Metropolitan Zone is the Protected Natural Area Sierra de Guadalupe (PNASG), an area with a high diversity of birds, close to an industrial zone, and poor air quality (AQ). It is known that a poor AQ affects biodiversity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the AQ using O-3, CO, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 polar graphics atmospheric pollutants (PGAP) and the Integrated Air Quality Index (IAQI) to examine its relationship with the structural diversity (SD) and the functional diversity (FD) of the bird community of the PNASG. In autumn-2019 and winter-2020, bird surveys and the PGAP with the pollutant concentrations were performed using data from Mexico City air quality network. The IAQI, SD and FD were estimated. Autumn-2019 registered the worst IAQI (334), the lowest wind speed (1.5 m/s), and the highest PGAP values (90). These worst AQ and the highest PGAP values were outside the PNASG but into a green urban area. This site also showed the highest SD scores (87), reflecting that the green urban areas function as a refuge for birds. The study sites with the best AQ (130.37), the lowest PGAP values (0.1) and the highest FD (0.7) were inside the PNASG. We conclude that a poor AQ minimizes the FD and that the PNASG is an essential buffer and a biological conservation area. The combined use of an integrated index of air quality with the polar graphics and diversity of birds (SD and FD) allow a better interpretation of air quality. It is necessary to establish mechanisms ensuring the conservation of the protected natural areas and green urban areas to improve air quality and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) has been massively deployed worldwide and has become a major environmental pressure for biodiversity, especially contributing to habitat loss and landscape fragmentation. To mitigate these latter, green and blue infrastructure policies have been developed throughout the world based on the concept of ecological networks, a set of suitable interconnected habitats. However, currently, these nature conservation policies hardly consider the adverse effects of ALAN. Here, we promote the integration of darkness quality within the 'green and blue infrastructure', to implement a 'dark infrastructure'. Dark infrastructure should be identified, preserved and restored at different territorial levels to guarantee ecological continuities where the night and its rhythms are as natural as possible. For this purpose, we propose an operational 4-steps process that includes 1) Mapping of light pollution in all its forms and dimensions in relation to biodiversity, 2) Identifying the dark infrastructure starting or not from the already identified green/blue infrastructure, 3) Planning actions to preserve and restore the dark infrastructure by prioritizing lighting sobriety and not only energy saving, 4) Assessing the effectiveness of the dark infrastructure with appropriate indicators. Dark infrastructure projects have already been created (for example in France and Switzerland) and can serve as case studies for both urban and natural areas. The deployment of dark infrastructure raises many operational and methodological questions and stresses some knowledge gaps that still need to be addressed, such as the exhaustive mapping of light pollution and the characterization of sensitivity thresholds for model species.

AB  - With the implementation of human activities, such as logging, reclamation, and construction, the increasing fragmentation of ecological space and the increasing blockage of biological migration corridors cause many threats to biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the Northwest Beijing Ecological Containment Area as the research area. Based on an integrated circuit theoretical model, we identified functional connectivity networks and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of ecological blockage patterns in the region from 1998-2018 in terms of the landscape connectivity, ecological breakpoints, pinch points, and barriers, respectively. The results show that the average remote sensing ecological index had a trend of decreasing and then increasing, and a total of 33, 34, and 63 habitat core areas and 70, 74, and 152 ecological corridors were identified in 1998, 2010, and 2018, respectively. The regions with high ecological blockage were mainly in the central part of Yanqing District, the southwest corner of the study area, and the eastern urban area. Although the number of potential ecological corridors gradually increases with the probability of migration in the study area, the blockage status and vulnerability of the ecological corridors continue to increase due to the conflict between land uses. The ecological status of the study area reflects the comprehensive effectiveness of the capital's high-quality development under the strategic deployment of ecological civilization. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the effective protection and restoration of the ecological conditions in the ecological function areas is of great importance in guaranteeing the ecological quality and sustainable development of the country.

AB  - Green Infrastructure (GI) connects different types of green features via various scales, thereby supporting urban biodiversity and service provision. This study presents a methodology capable of identifying multiple functions to assess GI in less-developed countries, where such methodologies are lacking. GI was assessed based on a high resolution land use classification using both landscape metrics and spatial data within an urbanized region of San Jose', Costa Rica, at different scales (watershed, neighbourhood, object). Results showed highly fragmented green spaces (often < 10 ha), typically unable to support high levels of biodiversity, along with a low amount of green space per inhabitant (< 7.4 m(2)) within the watershed. Substantially higher tree cover (x6) and tree density (x5) were found in the greenest neighbourhood in comparison to the least green neighbourhood. Potential areas for new GI in the form of green roofs (4.03 ha), permeable pavement (27.3), and potential retention areas (85.3) were determined. Several green spaces (n = 11) were identified as promising GI sites with the potential to increase provision (18.6 m(2)/inhabitant). The adopted methodology demonstrates the potential of GI for increasing recreational green space access, runoff reduction, and flood retentions while supporting biodiversity, validating its utility in guiding decision-making and policy generation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Accelerated intensification/disintensification and urbanization are changing agricultural systems and propel the need for spatial approaches to understand sustainability-enhancing resilience. Landscapes are key to this understanding though little is known of the broad-scale, cross-landscape connectivity of social-ecological factors amid changing agricultural systems.OBJECTIVE: This study's goals are to identify broad-scale types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that are associated with intensification/disintensification and urbanization and then to use case studies to assess the types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity. It examines the social-ecological connectivity of environmental resources, resource users, and governance. The overarching purpose is to improve the understanding of socialecological connectivity in strengthening the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural landscapes amid global agri-food changes.METHODS: To pursue these goals, we conducted a structured literature review of publications to identify major types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that reflect intensification/disintensification and urbanization trends. Case studies of agricultural landscapes and connectivity were undertaken in the Madrid and Granada regions. These case studies used a structured interview with experienced professional experts in fields of social-ecological sustainability and agricultural landscapes in each region. Analyses including Latent Block Modelling were applied to interview results on types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity in both conventional and alternative agriculture.RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The structured literature review identified the predominance of three types of broad-scale agricultural landscapes in Spain: intensive, "traditional" rural, and peri-urban/urban. Analysis of case-study results revealed variation of the extent and structure of connectivity among clusters of landscape interactions and social-ecological factors. Landscape-level connectivity created both negative agricultural impacts (e.g., extensive water transfers and nutrient pollution in conventional agriculture) and positive impacts (e. g., knowledge system and seed exchanges in alternative agriculture). Interactions of alternative agricultural systems in peri-urban/urban and "traditional" rural landscapes have benefitted from cross-landscape connectivity amid accelerated agricultural change.SIGNIFICANCE: Research and policy on the landscape-level connectivity of agricultural systems are needed to strengthen sustainability-enhancing resilience of both conventional and alternative agriculture. This study's approach and results are a strategic complement to existing emphasis on within-landscape cycles of socialecological factors in alternative agriculture. This study's insights are important in the transition phases of alternative agriculture and associated food systems amid changes due to agricultural intensification/disintensification and urbanization. Understanding selective cross-landscape connectivity is important for spatial approaches to strengthen the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural systems.

AB  - Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential pollinators) are increasingly being used in studies of the structure and function of these ecological interactions. Whilst they hold much promise in understanding the ecology of plant-pollinator networks and how this may be altered by environmental perturbations, like land-use change and invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting plant-pollinator networks.

AB  - The Ecological Green Integration Demonstration Zone (EGIDZ) is in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the fastest growing regions in China. With ongoing rapid urbanization, the unique green-blue structure of water townships in the area has experienced severe human disturbance, which has resulted in habitat fragmentation, water pollution, ecosystem function decline, and biodiversity loss. The monofunctional municipal infrastructure lacks ecological efficacy, while the traditional concept of green infrastructure faces many limitations and adaptability in dealing with complex urban environments. In this context, we introduce the emerging concept of landscape infrastructure (LI), a soft engineered social-ecological-infrastructural system, as a wealth of inspiration and multiangle design solutions to address this challenge. As a performative structure medium, LI has the potential to incorporate all infrastructures (e.g., green and gray) across the spectrum of the urban territory. The study was carried out mainly through remote sensing and GIS technology. In the research process, (i) the ecological sources were identified based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity, (ii) a resistance model, minimum ecological cost path, and gravity model were used to develop ecological corridors and the green infrastructure network, and (iii) green infrastructure networks were integrated with sociocultural factors to form hybrid multifunctional LI networks. The results mainly show that (i) the green infrastructure network layout is based on ecological sources, especially those extremely important and important cores, and they are mainly located in the western, northern, and central parts of the study area; (ii) the LI network was constructed based on the green infrastructure network by combining sociocultural factors, such as human flows, roads, factories and residential heatmaps; and (iii) through the combination of macroscale planning and microscale design, we propose a multiscale and multifunctional LI network in the EGIDZ. We then put forward a new development model of the New Jiangnan Watertown Urbanism, which consists of the 'Watertown unit' and 'Watertown cluster' that subsequently forms a resilient water-based robust and productive canvas of 'Produc-tivity, Livelihood, and Ecology'. This research provides a basis for future explorations of the sustainable development of a new green-blue system and for context-responsive solutions to these wet and fertile lowlands.

AB  - The study of the urban heat island (UHI) is of great importance in the context of climate change, where increasingly frequent and intense extreme thermal events will generate lethal effects in cities. In this work, we characterize the UHI of the urban area of Zaragoza (Spain) using a thermohygrometric network of hourly observatories composed of 21 sensors, from March 2015 to February 2021. Due to the diversity of urban spaces and the high volume of information (approximate to 995,000 observations), we performed an exhaustive quality control. Incorporating a synoptic analysis to better identify atmospheric situations not recorded by sensors. The results indicate that 1.6% of observations are removed, mainly due to outliers and hourly variability. We demonstrate that the UHI displays the classical center-periphery pattern with intensity values around 2 degrees C, but with variations due to the urban structure. We also observe seasonal UHI variations that intensify, especially in winter and autumn nights. Finally, this characterization confirms the differences in UHI intensity are due to their structural and climatic characteristics, which can ultimately guide the logical urban planning design of Zaragoza, and other Mediterranean-like cities with a similar urban environment.

AB  - Vegetated roofs are human-manufactured ecosystems and potentially promising conservation tools for various taxa and habitats. Focussing on arthropods, we conducted a 3 year study on newly constructed vegetated roofs with shallow substrates (up to 10 cm) and vegetation established with pre-grown mats, plug plants and seeds to describe pioneer arthropod communities on roofs and to compare them with ground level communities. We vacuum sampled arthropods from the roofs and nearby ground level sites with low, open vegetation, i.e., potential source habitats. We showed that the roofs and ground sites resembled each other for ordinal species richness but differed in community composition: with time the roofs started to resemble each other rather than their closest ground level habitats. Species richness increased with time on roofs and at ground level, but the roofs had consistently less species than the ground sites and only a few species were unique to the roofs. Also, the proportion of predators increased on roofs, while not at ground level. We conclude that vegetated roofs established with similar substrates and vegetation, filter arthropods in a way that produces novel communities that are different from those at ground level but similar to one another. The role of these insular communities in species networks and ecosystem function remains to be investigated.

AB  - Well-functioning ecological corridors are critical for conserving biodiversity in areas undergoing increasing habitat losses and ecosystem fragmentation. Although it is essential to rebuild broken corridors by land use adjustments, related discussions of spatially explicit delineations of to-be-adjusted lands and quantitative adjustment costs are rare. Based on a widely adopted minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, we simulated the potential ecological processes and identified ecological corridors in a rapidly urbanized city, namely, Nanjing, in eastern China. We then analysed the corresponding land use and cover changes (LUCCs) from 2000 to 2015 and quantitatively calculated the costs of rebuilding the indicated corridors based on the indication of the amount/spatial distribution of to-be-adjusted lands and their different standards of related adjustment. The results indicated that most obtained corridors were along continuous waters, but LUCCs still occurred within them; the spatial expansion of urban lands dominated, especially in the suburban areas and outer buffers of the ecological corridors. The rebuilding costs increased significantly, and urban land adjustments dominated these increases. Spatially, most costs were associated with suburban areas, and the costs increased obviously as the corridor width increased. Based on the comprehensive consideration of ecological suitability and economic rationality, we found that 200 m was the most appropriate width for rebuilding ecological corridors, as it can both meet the demands of local species and balance the local public budget. We explored methodologies used to identify potential ecological corridors and quantitatively evaluate the costs of rebuilding them, thus providing a basis for implementing practical and feasible land use adjustments addressing ecological suitability and economic rationality.

AB  - Nowadays, Australian state and local governments consider Green Infrastructure (GI) planning as a mitigation and adaptation approach to make cities more resilient. Moreover, decision-makers have acknowledged and addressed social values, biodiversity, and habitat connectivity in policy documents. Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), is a unique Australian city since it is totally designed as the National Capital of Australia and is built on a grassland plain, inspired by the Garden City concept. The green and open spaces have a symbolic value, representing Canberra as the national capital. However, Canberra is experiencing increasing urban development pressure, which threatens its green and open spaces. Thus, it is critical to explore the GI status in governance and decision-making in Canberra to guide its future planning. This research explores ten policy documents using a reflexive analysis to interpretatively critique policy documents and to diagnose the existing opportunities and constraints in Canberra's GI planning. The documents were selected from 4 main defined scopes, Australian Government land-use responsibilities, ACT Government land-use planning and strategy, ACT Government greenspace planning, and Tree management regulations and mechanisms. This research identified dual governance (national/territory) and dual nature character (native/exotic) in the policy documents, which has intensified the complexity of GI planning. Another constraint was the lack of district level planning and a structured bottom-up approach. More flexibility in governance and collaboration between different governance levels and agencies is needed to make a more effective GI network, using the existing opportunities such as open space systems. Although GI principles have been addressed at Canberra's strategic level, more comprehensive GI planning is needed to address all types of greenspaces.

AB  - Cities are fundamentally changing the environment that plants inhabit, most notably through habitat fragmentation. Urban plant habitat patches are separated by impervious surfaces like buildings and roads and may vary from small, isolated green spaces to large green spaces like parks. Understanding the consequences of this urban fragmentation on seed dispersal is essential to both maintain urban biodiversity and mitigate the spread of unwanted weeds or invasive species but we currently lack enough empirical data to draw generalities. Theoretical reasoning (via both verbal and mathematical models) is well positioned to contribute to this knowledge gap in dispersal by providing useful predictions when empirical data are lacking. Variation in dispersal can easily be captured by models by incorporating different dispersal kernel shapes, and multiple habitat configurations can be examined. Urban environments are rarely considered by mathematical models, and our literature review indicates that most models that include dispersal variation via a dispersal kernel use only one or two shapes, suggesting a gap in the theoretical literature as well. We present a proof-of-concept model of fragmentation in an urban environment illustrating how varying habitat width can lead to different outcomes depending on the dispersal kernel. We also provide some thoughts for future directions on the application of mathematical models in urban areas.

AB  - Urban remnant forests are biodiversity hotspots in cities, and a better understanding of the plant response in remnant forests to urbanization can promote biodiversity conservation. To explore the relationships between plant ecological strategies in remnant forests and urbanization, we used Guiyang, China, as the study case location and measured the seed mass, maximum height and specific leaf area of woody plant species in 72 survey plots in nine remnant forest patches. We positioned the woody plant species in the eight quadrants of a three-dimensional plot based on the three functional traits presented above and explored their ecological strategies. The abundance of each trait group was calculated in the edge and interior habitats under different levels of urbanization (the percentage of impervious surfaces <20 %, 20 %-50 %, >50 %), and differences were exam-ined. We found that high levels of urbanization decreased tree species with the ecological strategies of slow growth, high resource conservation, strong survivability and high competitiveness but increased the abundance of shrub species with the traits of long-distance dispersal, widespread distribution and competitiveness. These results suggest that the high intensity of human interference threatens the preservation of postsuccessional plant species with resource conservation traits. Urbanization drove the shifts in plant strategies to adapt to distur-bances and habitat fragmentation. We recommend that further urban expansion surrounding remnant forest patches should be controlled to protect postsuccessional species.

AB  - China's rapid urbanization has been accompanied by serious urban sprawl. Instead of measuring the physical urban boundaries (PUBs), most of existing studies in China rely on yearbook statistics to describe the growth of urbanized area; therefore, the understanding of the actual form and quantity of urban sprawl are restrained. As the statistical unit is generally at or above the county level, these studies tend to omit the lower-level "larger towns". This paper discusses the measurement of urban sprawl and compactness using multi-source data on the GIS platform through the case study of the Wen-Tai region in China. GlobeLand30 remote sensing image data, vector road network data, NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data, and points of interest (POIs) data are adopted. The new method enhances the identification of built-up areas in larger towns. Besides, the 2020s' PUBs of this region, data for 2010 and 2000 are retraced to assess the urban expansion rate, and two approaches are used to discuss the urban growth pattern. Additionally, a compactness model is constructed from four dimensions, i.e., the compactness of external contour, accessibility of road network, land-use intensity, and functional diversity, by which a high-resolution visual analysis tool is created for the provincial government to monitor urban sprawl.

AB  - The new urbanism movement has repeatedly stressed the importance of dimensions such as density, land use and passive solar design in urban sustainability. However, little is known about lay people's conception of these constructs. If the urban environment is to be designed to prioritise people, understanding how they conceive of sustainability becomes important. The present study investigated lay people's conceptions of sustainable urban design by asking them to build their own cities with the urban simulation Sim City. In a balanced within-subjects design, participants were asked to create both the least and the most sustainable city they could imagine, whilst expressing their thought processes in a recorded think-aloud protocol. Transcripts were subsequently analysed for common themes which allowed for a comparison between participants' notions of sustainable urban design features and those identified by experts (Jabareen, 2006). This is the first time lay concepts of sustainability have been assessed this way. Participants showed awareness of several urban form factors including compactness, diversity, density, sustainable energy and transport, as well as greenery and mixed land use. The results further suggested that laypeople place particular emphasis on urban design aspects such as energy and transport. A key novel finding was that laypeople also include non-urban design aspects, such as education about the environment, in their notions of sustainability. These findings suggest there might be both mismatches and overlaps between expert and lay concepts of what a sustainable city entails, which in turn might help explain certain failures to engage with sustainable built environments.

AB  - A large number of trees have been planted in built-up areas to improve the urban environment, but the effects of tree cover on spontaneous understory herbs are not yet well understood. This study surveyed spontaneous herbs in two kinds of habitats (habitats with and without tree cover) in the built-up area of the small city Junlian in Sichuan Province, China. A total of 222 species of spontaneous herbaceous plants in 180 genera of 71 families were recorded, including a vulnerable species and six species endemic to China. Although the overall species richness values were similar in the two kinds of habitat, the average species richness per quadrat of all plants, perennials, plants with the dwarf growth form, and animal-dispersed plants was significantly higher in the habitats with tree cover than in those without tree cover. The overall species association was significantly positive in the habitats with tree cover (VR = 1.51, p < 0.05) and neural (VR = 0.86) in the habitats without tree cover. Among the top 25 frequently recorded species in each kind of habitat, the species association of plants with the same trait combination type differed greatly in the two kinds of habitats. For the species association between annuals, only 13.33% of species pairs were significantly associated in the habitats with tree cover, while 22.22% of the species pairs were significantly negatively associated in the habitats without tree cover. For the species association between plants with tall growth forms, the proportion of significant positive associations in the habitats with tree cover was approximately twice than in the habitats without tree cover. For the species association between plants with the dwarf growth form, the proportion of negative associations in the habitats without tree cover was approximately twice that in the habitats with tree cover. Species with the same dispersal mode generally had a very low proportion of negative interspecific associations or a high proportion of positive interspecific associations in habitats unfavorable to their establishment. Our findings suggest that tree cover can improve the species richness of the spontaneous herbaceous species beneath them and profoundly influence interspecific coexistence relationships in a built-up area.

AB  - Cities and towns can be conceptualized as invasion hotspots. The connections created by roads or highways facilitate the mobility of these species, expanding their range of distribution and contributing to their expansion through the landscape to other urban areas or nearby natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Here we describe the actual distribution of invasive plants in a region of Colombia and determine the role that urban centers, road edges, and rivers have in shaping their distribution. We mapped-at high resolution-the distribution of exotic species in the Alto Ricaurte region (Boyaca, Colombia), specifically in the towns of Villa de Leyva, Sachica, Sutamarchan, and Arcabuco and connecting roads. Initially, a list of 40 exotic plant species with invasive potential was assembled: 26 of which were mapped in the region. Then, we used Poisson models to test whether invasive species appear more frequently near cities, roads, and riverbanks. We found that roadside and riverbank areas host more exotic species than more distant zones. Our findings suggest that roads and rivers are efficient dispersal corridors connecting different invasive hotspots with other landscape elements. Urban centers act as islands of invasion and roads and rivers as corridors for species dispersal. This invasion scenario is already causing economic and ecological damage: roads are heavily deteriorated byR. communis, K. densiflora, and C. jubata, while P. aquilinum and M. minutiflora may increase the occurrence of fires in the region.

AB  - Three forest fragments located along a gradient from the central area of the city (an urban historical park) to increasingly peripheral areas (a suburban nature reserve, an extraurban nature reserve) were identified in the western sectors of the Metropolitan City of Capital Rome administrative district and its surroundings (Central Italy). With the aims to describe the structural parameters of Chilopod assemblages in these forest fragments for determine their status of conservation and to evaluate the effects of some environmental variables (coverage of the canopy layer, shrub layer, herb layer, litter layer) on selected species, sampling took place by pitfall traps from June 2015 to June 2016. The relevance of these kind of studies is in precisely identifying the areas of greatest conservation value; the purpose is to provide guidelines for the planning of the ecological network of the city of Rome towards the protection of the areas inhabited by more sensitive fauna and flora elements rather than protecting as many areas as possible. Chilopods are strictly forest arthropods, therefore they are considered useful biondicators of these ecosystems. The centipede assemblage of suburban forest fragment is characterized by a greater complexity and stability compared to the centipede assemblages of central and extraurban forest fragments, both apparently in a typical state of successional stages. The distribution pattern of the centipede diversity of the study area seems to deviate from the usual patterns found in other European cities for other arthropod assemblages as well as for the centipedes, as the greater biodiversity has been recorded in the suburban forest fragment, not in the extraurban one. The suburban forest fragment is moreover characterized by a higher degree of stratification and structural complexity than the other two forest fragments, with a largest number of forest species, some of these absent both in the urban and the extraurban fragments.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The plants sold in nurseries directly influence urban landscapes by providing habitat that supports humans and other organisms and indirectly influence the natural landscape by acting as a major source of invasive species. We analyzed the ornamental plants sold in US nurseries from 1719 to 1946 and found broad patterns of increasing diversity occurring in step with an increase in species relatedness, a switch from native to alien species, and a decrease in regional distinctness. Patterns like these, which have been observed recently in urban areas, thus have a basis in cultivation/horticultural history. Summary center dot Cultivated plants are foundational species in urban areas, where they simultaneously provide essential ecosystem services while posing a risk of invasion into natural communities. We sought to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of cultivated plants using historical data to better understand the origins of the patterns of diversity observed in present-day human-dominated landscapes. center dot Using records of 5098 ornamental vascular plant species available in 319 US nursery catalogs published from 1719 to 1946, we quantified the taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha$$ \alpha $$-diversity, phylogenetic structure, and beta$$ \beta $$-diversity of the historical US nursery flora in cultural regions, biomes, latitudinal bands, and longitudinal zones. center dot We showed a peaked increase in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the US nursery flora over time, concurrent with the proliferation of nurseries and the addition of new species to nursery offerings. However, standardized phylogenetic diversity showed a convex pattern, with a trough during a time of peak growth and connectivity in the nursery industry, and diversity actually decreased at the end of the time series. We also showed a pattern of increasing homogenization of regional nursery floras, as well as a shift from offering predominately native to predominately alien species. center dot Echos of the history of the US nursery industry can be found today in patterns with great ecological relevance. Previous reports of high alien plant diversity in urban areas, phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion among naturalized alien plants, and homogenization of urban plant communities are all consistent with the historical availability of these plants in the nursery flora. 10.1002/(ISSN)2572-2611Kinlock et al.

AB  - Since 2005, Chinese transit authorities have made substantial investments in high-speed rail (HSR) infrastructure, driven by the ambition to connect all cities with over half a million people. This study estimates the impact of HSR network expansion on agricultural land conversion using a panel dataset for 171 Chinese cities that developed HSR infrastructure between 2005 and 2012. Structural equation modeling (SEM) estimation results show that HSR contributed indirectly to arable land requisition but directly to agricultural land converted for urban uses. At the same time, real-estate investments are driving agricultural land depletion in the process of China's urbanization. In addition, HSR network expansion exhibits a geographical pattern where the effect on agricultural land conversion was considerably stronger in the western region than among eastern cities, suggesting that HSR-driven land conversion was more likely to occur in less developed places.

AB  - Plant communities in urban gardens consist of cultivated species, including ornamentals and food crops, and wild growing species. Yet it remains unclear what significance urban gardens have for the plant diversity in cities and how the diversity of cultivated and wild plants depends on the level of urbanization. We sampled plants growing within 18 community gardens in Berlin, Germany to investigate the species diversity of cultivated and wild plants. We tested species diversity in relation to local and landscape-scale imperviousness as a measure of urbanity, and we investigated the relationship between cultivated and wild plant species within the gardens. We found that numbers of wild and cultivated plant species in gardens are high - especially of wild plant species - independent of landscape-scale imperviousness. This suggests that all community gardens, regardless of their urban contexts, can be important habitats for plant diversity along with their role in urban food provision. However, the number of all species was negatively predicted by local garden scale imperviousness, suggesting an opportunity to reduce imperviousness and create more habitats for plants at the garden scale. Finally, we found a positive relationship between the number of cultivated and wild growing species, which emphasizes that community gardens present a unique urban ecosystem where land sharing between cultivated and wild flora can transpire. As the urban agriculture movement is flourishing worldwide with gardens continuously and spontaneously arising and dissipating due to urban densification, such botanical investigations can support the argument that gardens are places for the reconciliation of plant conservation and food production.

AB  - The southern side of the Daba Mountain area is a hotspot of global biodiversity and an essential barrier promoting ecological security. However, knowledge about the distribution status and transmission pathways of invasive alien species (IAS) in this area is limited. We counted the IAS on the southern side of the Daba Mountain area through sample transects and analyzed the factors affecting their spatial distribution. We also assessed IAS risk using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which found 64 IAS belonging to 23 families and 53 genera. Around rivers and roads, the results showed a vertical two-way dispersal pattern. Human and environmental factors, such as a very dense transportation network, can affect the distribution pattern of IAS. AHP assessed 43 IAS (67.19%), primarily distributed in villages and towns, as being of high or medium risk. High- and medium-risk IAS should be the focus of invasion prevention and control, and priority should be given to controlling the spread of IAS around rivers and roads.

AB  - This paper describes a new approach in urban ecological design, referred to as social- ecological urbanism (SEU). It draws from research in resilience thinking and space syntax in the analysis of relationships between urban processes and urban form at the microlevel of cities, where social and ecological services are directly experienced by urban dwellers. The paper elaborates on three types of media for urban designers to intervene in urban systems, including urban form, institutions, and discourse, that together function as a significant enabler of urban change. The paper ends by presenting four future research frontiers with a potential to advance the field of social-ecological urbanism: (1) urban density and critical biodiversity thresholds, (2) human and non-human movement in urban space, (3) the retrofitting of urban design, and (4) reversing the trend of urban ecological illiteracy through affordance designs that connect people with nature and with each other.

AB  - The COVID-19 health emergency has impacted multiple dimensions of the complex physical, social, functional and economic structure of cities. This research encompasses a comparative diagnosis of some of the changes and transformations that have occurred in the urban environment due to the crisis and are reflected in geolocalised social network data. For this purpose, data from Google Places and Twitter are adopted as the main source of information. A mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology is proposed to analyse the increase and loss of economic activity (Google Places) and human presence (Twitter) in two periods: pre-and post-pandemic. As a case study, two areas with very different socio-economic conditions are analysed in three cities located in countries that adopted different pandemic restrictions measures -Valencia in Spain, Mexico City in Mexico and Gothenburg in Sweden. The diagnosis reported by these social networks is of great use in formulating useful strategies both for identifying the changes that have been taking place and for dealing with future disruptive scenarios.

AB  - During 1995-2010, a comparison of the comprehensive effects of four different types of urban roads on landscape diversity in Shanghai was performed. Remote sensing images from 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 and the transfer matrix mathematical model were used to conduct the research, which focused on studying the rule of land use change in the study area over the past 15 years. Seven different landscape indices (SHDI, SHEI, ED, NP, TE, AWMSI, and MSI) were also selected to analyze the landscape pattern of Shanghai in three different periods and to explore the regularity of its dynamic changes and influential factors. Buffer analysis and statistical analyses were applied to represent the relationship between the distance from different roads quantitatively (e.g., railway, highway, national highway, and provincial highway) and a series of landscape pattern metrics (e.g., SHDI, PD, ED, and IJI) thus exploring the influence of transportation routes on the surrounding ecological environment. The results showed that (1) each type of landscape in the study area changed considerably during the research periods, a great amount of cultivated land was transformed into construction land, and the water area largely decreased. (2) The transportation routes exerted different impacts on the road landscape during different periods, and the effects were more obvious at the early stage of road construction. (3) The national way and the highway influenced the patch density (PD) index and edge density (ED) index more clearly, while the national way and the railway had greater effects on the landscape diversity indices. This study presents an approach that can be applied to quantitatively describe the impacts of transportation routes on landscape patterns and has the potential to facilitate route network planning.

AB  - Natural habitats on private lands are potentially important components of national biodiversity conservation strategies, yet they are being rapidly lost to development. Conservation easements and other means of protecting these habitats have expanded in use and will be most effective if they target private lands of highest biodiversity value and risk of loss. We developed a Biodiversity Conservation Priority Index (BCPI) based on ecological value and risk of habitat loss for remaining areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) in the northwestern United States and addressed two questions: (1) Which remaining NVC on private lands is the highest priority for biodiversity conservation based on ecological value and risk of development? And (2) are conservation easements in NVC placed preferentially in locations of high biodiversity conservation priority? Drawing on the concept of ecological integrity, we integrated five metrics of ecological structure, function, and composition to quantify ecological value of NVC. These included net primary productivity, species richness, ecosystem type representation, imperiled species range rarity, and connectivity among "Greater Wildland Ecosystems." Risk of habitat loss was derived from analysis of biophysical and sociodemographic predictors of NVC loss. Ecological value and risk of loss were combined into the BCPI. We then analyzed spatial patterns of BCPI to identify the NVC highest in biodiversity conservation priority and examined the relationship between BCPI and conservation easement status. We found that BCPI varied spatially across the study area and was highest in western and southern portions of the study area. High BCPI was associated with suburban and rural development, roads, urban proximity, valley bottom landforms, and low intensity of current development. Existing conservation easements were distributed more towards lower BCPI values than unprotected NVC at both the study area and region scales. The BCPI can be used to better inform land use decision making at local, regional, and potentially national scales in order to better achieve biodiversity goals.

AB  - Urban expansion is a severe threat to biodiversity. In the UK, bats are protected meaning new developments need to be surveyed, potential impacts assessed, and appropriate mitigation action taken. However, efforts to minimise effects of urbanisation on bats are hampered by a lack of data for many species making it difficult to implement effective conservation measures. Here we explore whether citizen science data on bat activity via a passive acoustic network can be used to produce maps of high risk areas to bats from urbanisation and areas with the best opportunities for habitat mitigation. We combine the passive acoustic dataset with fine-scale habitat data and use models to quantify the effect of increasing urban areas or increasing suitable habitat (woodland, wetland, or grass and heathland). Passive acoustic detection can provide a high volume of data and large area of coverage, which is vital to the success of this modelling approach, but the data quality is dependent on accurate species classification. Therefore, we also assess the effect of identification uncertainty on the accuracy of the risk and opportunity maps. We found agreement between results accounting for species uncertainty and those that did not was high, although approximately 15% of high-risk areas would have been missed, and about 23% of habitat creation opportunities falsely prioritised. This modelling and mapping approach has great potential for use in the planning process to reduce impacts on the most important habitat features in the landscape and enable targeted habitat creation.

AB  - Urbanization is restructuring ecosystems at an unprecedented pace, with complex and profound consequences for life on Earth. One of the hypothesized trajectories of urban ecosystems and species communities is biotic homogenization, possibly leading to very similar species assemblages in cities across the globe. Urbanization can, however, also have the opposite effect: biotic diversification, with cities, at least at the local scale, becoming biologically more diverse, mainly as a consequence of high species introduction rates and habitat diversification. Applying the hierarchy-of-hypotheses approach, we systematically map and structure the comprehensive body of literature on the urban biotic homogenization (UBH) hypothesis, comprising 225 individual studies (i.e., tests of the hypothesis) retrieved from 145 publications. The UBH hypothesis is studied at multiple levels with a multitude of approaches and underlying assumptions. We show that UBH is generally used with two very different connotations: about half of the studies investigated a potential increase in community similarity across cities, whereas the other half investigated biotic homogenization within cities, the latter being supported more frequently. We also found strong research biases: (1) a taxonomic bias towards birds and plants, (2) a bias towards small and medium distances (<5000 km) in comparisons across cities, (3) a dominance of studies substituting space for time versus true temporal studies, (4) a strong focus on terrestrial versus aquatic systems, (5) more extraurban (including periurban) areas than natural or rural ecosystems for comparison to urban systems, (6) a bias towards taxonomic versus functional, phylogenetic, and temporal homogenization, and (7) more studies undertaken in Europe and North America than in other continents. The overall level of empirical support for the UBH hypothesis was mixed, with 55% of the studies reporting supporting evidence. Results significantly differed when a natural/nature reserve, an extraurban, or rural/agricultural area served as reference to infer biotic homogenization, with homogenization being detected least frequently when urban systems were compared to agricultural, i.e., other anthropogenically influenced, study sites. We provide an evidence map and a bibliographic network and identify key references on UBH with the goal to enhance accessibility and orientation for future research on this topic.

AB  - Community composition in a given landscape is a complex product of the constituent species' niche requirements, geographic connectivity, environmental properties, species interactions and drift. In this study, we examined niche use of 16 cladoceran species in 81 zooplankton communities that inhabit environmentally variable sites along a strong urbanization gradient. We tested to what extent niche shifts occurred along the urbanization gradient. We also quantified to what extent niche overlap can explain co-occurrence patterns and tested whether alternative processes such as dispersal limitation or environmental heterogeneity impact co-occurrence patterns. Niche use in the study region was size-mediated, with larger species preferring nutrient-rich environments while smaller species were more specialized on distinct niche axes. Our analyses also revealed that mainly generalist species were able to establish in urban sites. While the average niche position for most species was conserved from rural to urban sites, the niches of those species occurring in both rural and urban areas remain partly unfilled in the urban populations. We observed that a relatively small proportion (13%) of species pairs co-occurred more or less often than expected by chance, but also that niche overlap was the only predictor that was strongly and significantly associated with co-occurrence scores in our study. While most of these species pairs showed evidence for a role of environmental filtering, a few common, generalist species pairs displayed segregated co-occurrence patterns and high niche overlap, suggesting a role of limiting similarity relationships as well. Our study highlights the damaging effects on biodiversity of urbanization through biotic homogenization benefitting generalist species, as well as the difficulty species may face in occupying available niche space in urbanized habitats.

AB  - As urbanization proceeds, natural ecosystems surrounding cities are transformed, but usually some elements persist, notably trees from forest ecosystems. However, it is still unknown the extent to which isolated trees, immersed in an urban matrix, maintain their interactions with insects that feed on their seeds. In this work we analyzed pre-dispersal seed predation by the two main groups of insects, weevils (Coleoptera; Curculionidae) and moths (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), whose larvae feed on the acorns of two oak species (Quercus rugosa and Q. castanea). We compared these interactions between trees located in a protected forested area and trees isolated in an urban matrix. Our hypothesis was that, since pre-dispersal seed predation depends on insect dispersal, acorns from isolated trees would have lower predation levels than acorns from trees in the forest. A second hypothesis, based on reports that moths exhibit larger dispersal distances than weevils, was that isolated trees would have higher predation levels from moths than from weevils compared to their respective proportions in forest trees. Finally, we expected that moth predation would increase with seed size, as it does in weevils. We collected 1200 acorns of the two oak species (ten trees per species) in a protected oak forest and a nearby highway in southern Mexico City. From the whole sample, 17.3% of the acorns were predated by weevils and 3.8% by moths. The probability of predation was larger in acorns from trees in the forest (0.30) than in those from isolated trees (0.07), which confirmed the first hypothesis; tree species identity did not have a significant effect on the proportion of predated acorns. When only predated acorns were analyzed, predation by weevil larvae was larger than predation by moths in both oak species, although the probability of predation by weevils was higher in the oak species having large acorns (Q. rugosa, 0.93), than in the species with small acorns (Q. castanea, 0.63). Inversely, predation by moths was higher in Q. castanea (0.37) than in Q. rugosa (0.07). Seed predation decreased similarly for weevils and moths in isolated trees, so we failed to find support for our second hypothesis. A positive relationship between seed predation by weevils and seed size was found in Q. rugosa but not in Q. castanea; seed size did not affect predation by moth larvae. Therefore, although isolated trees in the urban matrix harbor smaller populations of pre-dispersal seed predators than forest trees, their interactions with the two main groups of insects feeding on acorns are maintained, which points to their importance for the conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to deteriorated wetland water quality, reduced biodiversity, and fragmented wetland landscapes, which seriously threaten the sustainable development of regional ecology. Based on land use data of Dongying City, Shandong Province, in 2020, this study selected the landscape disturbance degree and landscape fragility index to construct a landscape ecological risk evaluation model and to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk in Dongying City in 2020. The MSPA-Conefor-MCR model was used to extract the ecological network of wetlands in Dongying City, and the topological structure indices were quantitatively analyzed. Combined with the actual situation within the study area, the source sites to be optimized were identified by risk zoning and source importance; the ecological resistance surface was modified using landscape ecological risk, and the ecological network was optimized by simulating edge increase in order to evaluate the robustness of the ecological network before and after optimization and to verify the edge increase effect. The results show that the ecological risk in Dongying is high, mainly distributed in the central region and extending to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A total of 131 ecological source sites (6 core and 125 resting-stone source sites) and 180 ecological corridors were extracted, and the whole ecological network was found to be less stable and to have stronger network heterogeneity using a topological analysis. By simulating 11 additional edges, the robustness of the optimized ecological network was significantly improved. Optimizing the simulated-edge increase can enhance the smoothness of ecological energy flow, which can provide a scientific basis for the construction of the ecological security pattern of wetlands in Dongying City.

AB  - We studied the diversity and abundance of the airborne fungal spores in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, for two consecutive years. Air samples were collected at one rooftop station (at 30 m) and six near-ground stations (at 1.5 m) that differed in the size and composition of adjacent green spaces. The effects of meteorological factors on airborne fungal spore concentrations were also explored. Cladosporium spores were dominant everywhere in the air of the city. The total concentration of the airborne fungal spores at 30 m was 10 times lower than near the ground. Differences in concentration and composition were far less pronounced among near-ground stations. The attributes of the fungal spore season did not change in a consistent way among stations and years. Concentrations at the near-ground stations matched the grouping of the latter into stations of high, intermediate, and low urban green space. Minimum air temperature was the primary meteorological factor affecting spore abundance, followed by relative humidity. Airborne fungal spores are more homogeneously distributed in the air of the city, but their concentrations decrease more rapidly with height than pollen.

AB  - Urbanization has been a global phenomenon producing great environmental and ecological challenges including species composition shifts in urban areas. To evaluate the interaction networks of the inhabitant metacommunities in urban parks, we applied the nestedness analysis using ecological survey data of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies among 16 parks in Taipei City of Taiwan and identified critical environmental factors for biodiversity conservation. Results found significant nestedness of the metacommunities among these parks, which indicated strong interaction networks and the importance of urban parks for sustaining these metacommunities. In addition, various types of land use had different effects on the species incidence of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies. It demonstrates that landscape design should consider the taxonomic differences in the development of conservation guidelines. Results also showed that the area of parks and the area of woodlot in the park were critical elements for the nested structure. Nonetheless, abundant bird generalists were found to be highly related to the area of buildings within parks, distance to forests, rivers, and the neighbouring parks. Moreover, the exotic species were found to affect the interaction networks of native species. However, based on the current information, we cannot confirm the actual effects of the exotic species on the native biotasassemblages. Reptiles and frogs appeared to be more easily threatened by land development and habitat fragmentation due to their lower vagility. In this regard, we suggest that conservation action should focus on preserving green space with large areas and constructing green corridors, creating crucial elements, and increasing the vertical complexity in the parks for species with various vagilities. We believe these strategies can help reduce the impact of urbanization to retain healthy interactions and connections of metacommunities among habitats for effective biodiversity conservation in urban areas.

AB  - Non-native plants spread to recipient areas via natural or human-mediated modes of dispersal, and, if the non-native species are invasive, introduction potentially causes impacts on native plants and local ecosystems as well as economic losses. Therefore, we studied the diversity and distributional patterns of non-native plant species diversity in the tropical island province of Hainan, China and its relationships with environmental and socioeconomic factors by generating a checklist of species and subsequently performing an analysis of phylogenetic diversity. To generate the checklist, we began with the available, relevant literature representing 19 administrative units of Hainan and determined the casual, naturalized, or invasive status of each species by conducting field surveys within 14 administrative units. We found that non-native plants of Hainan comprise 77 casual species, 42 naturalized species, and 63 invasive species. Moreover, we found that non-native plant species had diverse origins from North and South America, Africa, and Asia and that the most common species across administrative areas belong to the plant families Asteraceae and Fabaceae. Moreover, the numbers of non-native species distributed in the areas of Hainan bording the coast arer greater than those within interior areas of the province. Among the coastal areas, Haikou has the highest species richness and, simultaneously, the highest values for significantly, positively correlated predictor variables, population and GDP (R-2 = 0.60, P < 0.01; R-2 = 0.64, P < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, the landlocked administrative units of Tunchang and Ding'an have the smallest number of non-native species, while their populations are less than a quarter of that of Haikou and their GDP less than one tenth. Among natural environmental variables, we determined that the number of non-native species had the strongest correlation with the minimum temperature in the coldest month, which predicts a smaller number of non-native species. Additionally, non-native species are primarily distributed in urban and rural built-up areas and agricultural areas; areas that are dominated by human activities. Overall, our study provides a working checklist of the non-native plants of Hainan as well as a theoretical framework and reference for the control of invasive plants of the province.

AB  - The Upper Chattahoochee Watershed supplies most of the drinking water to the Atlanta Metropolitan Area, a region with one of the fastest urban growth rates in the United States. Smart conservation planning is necessary to conciliate urban development and the provision of critical ecosystem services (ESs) such as water quality, carbon storage, and wildlife habitat. We employed optimization models to compare the value of the ESs provided by alternative allocations of land parcels for conservation. We adopted boundary penalties to determine the trade-offs of choosing higher connectivity among parcels regarding economic values provided by carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and water quality. We used InVEST models to quantify and map ESs and value transfer to assign economic values to them. We set low and high ESs economic value bounds and discounted their values to perpetuity using 3% and 7% discount rates. Our results indicate that incorporating boundary penalties results in solutions with larger, fewer, and more connected parcels but yields lower economic benefits than unconstrained models. However, these differences are relatively small (between 2.6% and 7.3% loss in economic value). Additional transaction costs of purchasing more parcels and improving ecological networks provided by larger forest patches might justify the selection of solutions with higher connectivity. Decision-makers can use the developed models for estimating the economic cost of selecting connected parcels for conservation purposes at the landscape level.

AB  - The benefits of green infrastructure on human well-being in urban areas are already well-established, with strong evidence of the positive effects of the amount and proximity to green areas. However, the understanding of how the spatial distribution and type of green areas affect health is still an open question. Here, through a land sharing and sparing framework, we explore how different spatial configurations of green and built-up areas and how different types of green areas can affect cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. Sharing/sparing indicators were selected as the main explanatory factors in the control of all groups of diseases. Land sharing appeared as a favourable spatial condition to prevent cardiovascular hospitalization, while land sparing and arboreal vegetation were relevant to reduce hospitalization by lower respiratory diseases. For upper respiratory diseases, forests seem to provide a disservice, once they were associated with increased rates of hospitalization by respiratory allergies causes. Considering that hospitalization rates and severity of cardiovascular diseases are substantially higher than those of upper respiratory ones, dense vegetation tends to provide more services than disservices. The land sharing configuration, which is characterized by green areas spread throughout the urban network (in streets, gardens, small squares or parks), should lead to higher exposure and use of the benefits of green areas, which may then explain the greater prevention of cardiovascular diseases. These novel results indicate that a more balanced distribution of green areas across built-up areas creates healthier urban spaces, and thus can be used as an urban planning strategy to leverage the health benefits provided by green infrastructure. Policy implications. Aiming to reduce hospitalizations by cardiovascular and pulmonary causes, urban planning should promote the spreading of green areas across the cities, in order to increase daily contact with natural attributes, giving preference to distribution over total quantity of green in urban landscape.

AB  - Animal seed dispersal processes are an important aspect of ecosystem services, as they shape the survival of seed dispersers and the balanced distribution of propagules for many plant communities. Several studies within tropical wild ecosystems have generally shown that seed dispersal processes are highly generalised and robust to extinction. Studies examining seed dispersal networks in highly built-up urban ecosystems and their robustness to species loss or extinction are rare. We examined avian seed dispersal networks across an urban ecosystem characterised by a high human settlement and infrastructure of the built environment in Zambia to determine their network specialisation, interaction evenness and interaction diversity, as these three parameters are critical in driving the resilience of these mutualisms' interactions against extinction. A total of 405 individuals representing 11 species of birds were observed and recorded feeding on a total of 11 focal fleshy-fruiting plant species. Network specialisation was generally low and remained similar across study areas. Interaction evenness and interaction diversity were not only high but also remained similar across study areas. Low specialisation and high interaction evenness and diversity show that mutualistic interactions in these networks are equally highly generalised, suggesting a stable and robust coexistence of species in plant-frugivore communities within urban ecosystems. Generally, our results seem to broadly suggest that opportunities for conservation still exist in these ecosystems provided urbanisation is accompanied by promoting either the management of remnant fruiting plants or the cultivation of new ones to support the avian communities existing in these areas.

AB  - Constructing ecological networks (ENs) is an essential means to set up ecological cities and deliver sustainable development. However, there is a pressing need to address the lack of linkage between ENs at different administrative levels. Therefore, this paper takes Ningbo city as the study area and constructs ENs at the city and county levels with different indices and research methods. It explores the linkages between ecological source areas and corridors at various administrative levels, finally forming an EN that links multiple levels. The results of the study show that 19 ecological source areas of approximately 1534.18 km(2) and 22 ecological corridors of 455.85 km were identified in the city of Ningbo. Furthermore, 12 ecological source areas, 16 natural ecological corridors, and 10 cultural landscape corridors were identified in Ningbo's Zhenhai District. After the super-position of municipal ecological sources, Zhenhai's ecological source areas increased in the west, north and southeast, adding approximately 12.81 km(2). Based on the comprehensive resistance surface, 18 composite ecological corridors were extracted, occupying approximately 74.21 km. After joining different administrative levels, the overall connectivity increased, promoting the circulation of ecosystem services. This study can accurately identify the spaces with critical ecological roles at different administrative levels and provide a reference for designing the whole ecological space and carrying out top-down ecological restoration projects.

AB  - Loss of green space habitats and landscape fragmentation are important reasons for the decline in environmental quality, degradation of ecosystem functions, and decline in biodiversity. Quantifying the spatio-temporal characteristics of landscape fragmentation of green space and its relationship with urban expansion mode is an important basis for improving urban development mode and enhancing urban ecological functions. For this paper, we took the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the research object, a typical rapidly urbanizing area. Through multi-scale landscape pattern analysis and statistical analysis, the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of green space fragmentation in the BTH urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2020 and the influence of urban expansion were analyzed, and the land-use situation in 2030 was predicted by the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The main conclusions are as follows: The BTH urban agglomeration has developed rapidly in the last 20 years, showing the characteristics of diffusion and corridor development. The intensity and pattern of urban expansion have significantly affected the pattern of green space, leading to the intensification of domestic green space fragmentation. Among them, urban expansion exerts most severe effects on the fragmentation of farmland, followed by grassland and water. The influence of urban expansion on the scale and fragmentation of forestland is limited. The forecast results in 2030 show that built-up areas may continue to occupy green space. The rate of occupation of farmland will slow down while that of grassland will intensify.

AB  - Background Invasive reptiles pose a serious threat to global biodiversity, but early detection of individuals in an incipient population is often hindered by their cryptic nature, sporadic movements, and variation among individuals. Little is known about the mechanisms that affect the movement of these species, which limits our understanding of their dispersal. Our aim was to determine whether translocation or small-scale landscape features affect movement patterns of brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis), a destructive invasive predator on the island of Guam. Methods We conducted a field experiment to compare the movements of resident (control) snakes to those of snakes translocated from forests and urban areas into new urban habitats. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze snake movement mechanisms and account for attributes unique to invasive reptiles by incorporating multiple behavioral states and individual heterogeneity in movement parameters. Results We did not observe strong differences in mechanistic movement parameters (turning angle or step length) among experimental treatment groups. We found some evidence that translocated snakes from both forests and urban areas made longer movements than resident snakes, but variation among individuals within treatment groups weakened this effect. Snakes translocated from forests moved more frequently from pavement than those translocated from urban areas. Snakes translocated from urban areas moved less frequently from buildings than resident snakes. Resident snakes had high individual heterogeneity in movement probability. Conclusions Our approach to modeling movement improved our understanding of invasive reptile dispersal by allowing us to examine the mechanisms that influence their movement. We also demonstrated the importance of accounting for individual heterogeneity in population-level analyses, especially when management goals involve eradication of an invasive species.

AB  - Cities and urban environments can do peculiar things to biodiversity that shares them with us. How cities affect their invited and uninvited inhabitants has become an increasingly important question. More than half of the world's population dwells in urban areas, and these environments will keep expanding considerably. Understanding how this relatively recent, rapid, and pervasive form of landscape modification influences the ecology and evolution of organisms that cannot escape, or may benefit from it, is an emerging field of biology. Although we are aware of how some birds, mammals or plants respond to urban environments, less is known about insects and invertebrates in general. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Blumenfeld et al. (2022) bring new remarkable insights into how a common ant species adjusts to urban settings across the United States by changing its social structure and behaviour. Using a large-scale molecular, chemical and behavioural dataset, they document how the odorous house ant Tapinoma sessile differs in its colony organisation and dispersal strategy between rural and urban habitats. In each of the study regions and continent-wide, rural and urban colonies are genetically and chemically differentiated, suggesting that urban settings act as potent agents of selection and isolation. The novelty and importance of this study are that it documents multiple independent transitions toward the same social organisation and the apparent effect of habitat on the life history of a eusocial insect species.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is undergoing alarming deforestation, land overexploitation, and unregulated occupation. The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species. Implications for insect conservation Our findings suggest an alarming trend toward species extinction in the near future, highlighting the need for specific conservation actions to protect Restinga biodiversity.

AB  - As landscapes are increasingly modified due to anthropogenic processes such as urbanisation or development for agriculture, the need to understand wildlife habitat requirements is imperative. This is particularly pertinent for species that are threatened, or apex predators with specific nest, den, or food requirements. Identifying responses to habitat with thresholds can provide an understanding of what resources species are using or avoiding, and their interactions with the surrounding environment. In this research we investigated space use and habitat requirements of the threatened apex predator, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) in Greater Melbourne, Australia. We deployed GPS devices to 21 urban powerful owls over five years and found owls had an average home range size of 397 ha, and an average core-range of 84 ha. Home range size and positioning was driven by tree cover and urban land cover, while core ranges were restricted to treed environments with a limited area of impervious surfaces and housing. We used thresholds to identify-three priorities for powerful owl conservation in Mel-bourne. Priority 1: Ensuring river corridors and public open spaces are adequately protected. Priority 2: Limit property densities near rivers and protected areas. Priority 3: Finding opportunities for revegetation to expand and enhance habitat over time. Our research demonstrates how species-specific thresholds can inform land use planning to ensure wildlife species are maintained within highly modified environments.

AB  - The microbial communities associated with microplastics (MPs) and their ambient environments have received wide attention. Although previous studies have reported the differences of microbial communities between MPs and natural environment or substrates, the effects of MPs on microbial balance and functions in ambient water remain unclear, particularly for aquaculture water. Here, we investigated the MPs pollution in farm ponds of grass carp located in the Foshan City of Guangdong Province and reported the distinction of bacterial structures, functions, and complexity between microbiota on MPs and in water. MPs with an average abundance of 288.53 +/- 74.27 items/L in pond water were mostly fibers and cellulose, mainly transparent and in size of 0.5-1mm. Structures and functions of bacterial communities on MPs significantly differed from that in pond water. A large number of enriched or depleted OTUs on MPs compared with water belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, the predominant phylum in microbial communities on MPs and in water. Some species included in the phylum Proteobacteria have been shown to be cellulose-degrading and pathogenic. Microbiota on MPs exhibited higher species richness and diversity as well as a more complex network than that in water, illustrating MPs as a distinct habitat in the aquaculture system.

AB  - The components of a traditional Iranian city include harmonious and cohesive structures arising from different concepts. The network of passages is one of the most significant communicative elements in these cities, which in addition to connecting different parts of the context, have contributed to the presence and various activities of the residents of the neighborhood and have had an important place in the public domain of the city. The exposure of the space organization and current life in these passages to the content and physical transformation of cities is a significant issue. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to scrutinize the position of historical passages in the structural system of public spaces of the city and to extract the factors affecting the position. To this end, this study examined to see how this element works in the public and collective domains of today's cities. This research employed a qualitative approach and a descriptive and analytical method, and it examined the concept and characteristics of historical passages and the components of public space related to them through bibliographic and document studies. These components included access and movement, hierarchy, stillness, contrast and divergence, mobility and diversity, land-use intermixture, spatial flexibility, and continuity. This study used spatial physical analysis to examine the interaction of factors in the study area of Dar-Khoungah passage. The analysis was based on visual evidence and field observations. Due to the formation of the public space of Dar-Khoungah passage based on the organization system of neighborhood centers and the existence of evident characteristics such as historical buildings, spatial openings, old land-uses, and their arrangements, this study analyzed this passage from different perspectives such as urban space organization, part-whole relationship, joint communications, and component analysis and explained its effective qualities on the public space of the city. Analysis of the data shows that these qualities include physical connection and semantic relation of the public space, identification of the public space, balancing the public space, and the function of physical elements of the passage in explaining the public space, which can be a basis for future development of the passage, promotion of activities, social interactions and solving its physical issues and problems.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate assemblages often remain depauperate in physically restored urban streams despite efforts to improve habitat conditions and increase species abundance and diversity. The lack of biological recovery may be due to a lack of a natural, nearby source of colonists, and this has inspired researchers and practitioners to reintroduce macroinvertebrates in otherwise restored urban streams to jump start the recovery process. However, without standardized guidelines that describe reintroduction best practices, some reintroduction programs may create additional problems (e.g., disease spread, genetic homogenization, population loss). To reduce these risks and limit a potential waste of resources, a cautionary approach is warranted. In this paper we summarize current stream reintroduction knowledge and detail best practices for aquatic macroinvertebrate reintroduction in restored urban streams. We provide criteria that managers can use to determine whether reintroduction is appropriate and demonstrate how researchers can use reintroduction as a tool to test hypotheses regarding factors limiting recolonization. We provide guidance for how to set clear reintroduction goals, select donor sites, determine the number of organisms required, establish reintroduction frequency and timing, and overcome challenges associated with monitoring. This framework can help managers create more successful reintroduction programs that can benefit urban stream restoration.

AB  - As cities continue to grow, the functions of urban areas change and problems arise from previously constructed urban planning schemes. Hence, the actual distribution of urban functional areas needs to be confirmed. POI data, as a representation of urban facilities, can be used to mine the spatial correlation within the city. Therefore it has been widely used for urban functional area extraction. Previous studies are mostly devoted to mining POI linear location relationships and do not comprehensively mine POI spatial information, such as spatial interaction information. This results in less accurate modeling of the relationship between POI-based and urban function types. In addition, they all use Euclidean distance for proximity assessment, which is not realistic. This paper proposes an urban functional area identification method that considers the nonlinear spatial relationship between POIs. First, POI adjacency is determined according to road network constraints, which forms the basis of a co-occurrence matrix. Then, a Global Vectors (GloVe) model is used to train POI category vectors and the feature vectors for each basic research unit are obtained using weighted averages. This is followed by clustering analysis, which is realized by a K-Means++ algorithm. Lastly, the functional areas are labeled according to the POI category ratio, enrichment factors, and mobile phone signal heat data. The model was tested experimentally, using core areas of Zhengzhou City in China as an example. When the results were compared with a Baidu map, we confirmed that making full use of nonlinear spatial relationships between POIs delivers high levels of identification accuracy for urban functional areas.

AB  - The landscape is a complex mosaic of physical and biological patches with infrastructures, cultivable lands, protected ecosystems, water bodies, and many other landforms. Varying land-use changes are vulnerable to the world and need the mitigation and management of landforms to achieve sustainable development, which without proper oversight, may lead to habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. In this study, we quantify the land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes using downscaled satellite imagery and assess their effects on ecosystem services (ES) and economic values in Ningxia Province, China. Various landscape metrics are derived to study the pattern and spatial configuration over 15 years (2005-2020), in which the landscapes are evolving. The impact of LULC change in various ES is analyzed using ecosystem service values (ESV) and validated with a sensitivity index. Finally, the level of urban sprawl (US) due to overpopulation is established using Renyi's entropy. Using Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) datasets, we downscaled the MODIS data of 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 to prepare the LULC map through a rotation forest algorithm. Results demonstrate that water bodies, woodlands, and built-up landscapes increased in their spatial distribution over time and that there was a decrease in farmlands. Results further suggest that the connectivity and uniformity of the landscape pattern improved in the later period due to several plans formulated by the government with a slight improvement in landscape diversity. Overall ESV get improved, while LULC classes such as farmland and water bodies have decreased and increased ESV, respectively, and a sensitivity analysis is used to test the reliability of ESV on LULC classes. The level of US is 0.91 in terms of Renyi's entropy, which reveals the presence of a dispersion of settlements in urban fringes. The simulated US for 2025 shows urbanization is more severe over a prolonged time and finally the impacts of the US in ESV are analyzed. Using an interdisciplinary approach, several recommendations are formulated to maintain the ESV despite rapid LULC changes and to achieve sustainable development globally.

AB  - Land use modification is a notable cause of biodiversity loss in streams. However, the impacts of anthropogenic forest conversion on beta-diversity are difficult to forecast, especially in Afrotropical stream ecosystem, mainly because: 1) empirical research is scant, and; 2) the few available studies provide conflicting findings. In our study, we used techniques of decomposing beta-diversity to evaluate the influence of land use changes on macroinvertebrates beta-diversity of 66 stream sites in an Afrotropical Anthropocene. We also evaluated the potential exclusive and shared contributions of ecological drivers of community composition and beta-diversity. Our total beta-diversity for both forested and modified streams was driven mainly by the turnover component, while the nestedness-resultant component was negligible. The dominance of turnover in both forested and modified streams in our systems stresses the urgency to protect many sites in order to conserve gamma-diversity. While beta-diversity diminished in our urban + agric streams in relation to our forest streams, leading to a process of biotic homogenization, beta-diversity of our forest streams was similar to that of the urban streams, implying that land use does not necessarily lead to a process of biotic homogenization. The contrasting findings about relationships between land use and beta-diversity in our study showed that the effects of land use on beta-diversity can be variable and context-dependent. Larger parts of variation in community composition and beta-diversity were accounted for by the local environmental conditions (through environmental filtering) and land use, while geographical spatial factors (through dispersal limitation) explained little part of variation in our system-highlighting the importance of species sorting (environmental filtering) over dispersal-related processes in metacommunity organization.

AB  - Urbanization alters components of natural ecosystems which can affect tick abundance and tick-borne disease prevalence. Likely due to these changes, tick-borne pathogen prevalence has increased in many U.S. urban areas. Despite the growing public health importance of tick-borne diseases, little is known about how they are influenced by urbanization in North America, especially in the central U.S. where several pathogens occur at or near their highest levels of incidence nationally. To determine whether urban development influences tick infection with bacteria and protozoa, we collected ticks at 16 parks across a gradient of urbanization intensity in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA and tested them using a variety of PCR assays. Adult ticks tested positive for Rickettsia parkeri, R. amblyommatis, R. rhiphicephali, 'Candidatus R. andeanae', Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii, Panola Mountain Ehrlichia, 'Borrelia lonestari', Theileria cervi, Babesia spp. Coco, and Cytauxzoon felis. These results indicate the presence of a high diversity of tick-borne bacteria and protozoa across an expanding urban area in the U.S. Great Plains. Although there appeared to be some risk of encountering tick-borne microorganisms across the entire urbanization gradient, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, and T. cervi-infected ticks and microbe diversity decreased with increasing urbanization intensity. We identified a low rate of coinfection between different microorganisms, with coinfected ticks mainly collected from sites in the least-urbanized areas. This study suggests the need for awareness of tick-borne disease risk throughout urban areas in the central U.S., and highlights a need for studies of tick host habitat use and movement in cities.

AB  - An urban centre acts as the interface of economic activities and people and represents diversity, which can grow or decline over time. Here, we review the literature to explain the factors supporting and obstructing urbanisation based on three theories on urban morphology: theory of natural movement, theory of movement economy and theory of spatial centrality. Two research questions were then formulated to explain the morphological logic of urbanisation and the influence of the global movement grid on local natural movement, which are key factors supporting the growth and decline of each local neighbourhood within the city. The selected case study was Nakhon Si Thammarat Old Town at the global and local levels and the space syntax theory was chosen for analysis. The results indicated that the spatial configuration of the global movement grid influence urbanisation and local natural movement the most. Therefore, local public spaces must be designed to support the global movement grid, which is fed by natural movement and influenced by the global morphological structure.

AB  - At present, the sharp decline in urban biodiversity worldwide is severe. Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.

AB  - In Rome, the intertwining of natural and built environments is structural, and has consolidated over the centuries. In the contemporary fabric, the overabundant presence of archaeology, always in symbiosis with vegetation, plays an important role for the image of the city and has helped maintain the alternation of voids and solids. Porosity can be seen therefore as a permanent morphological urban character of the city, particularly significant nowadays for environmental considerations. Ruins, which only a few years ago were perceived more as a brake to urban transformation, in recent years are emerging as an interesting potential in terms of biodiversity spots and social catalysts to implement more sustainable development. Out of the concept of sustainability, we can in fact recognize new and more cutting-edge ways of planning and designing heritage territory. This article describes a different approach to the enhancement of archaeological areas, through three case studies-The Appian Way Park, Rome's City Walls and ArchaeoGRAB-that consider heritage as a sustainable integrated system. These projects present, through a holistic and multidisciplinary perspective, possible ways in which landscape design can contribute to the preservation of natural and heritage environments, as well as the development of healthier lifestyles and strengthening of local culture for the communities that dwell therein.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are crucial to the survival and development of human societies. Urbanization is expected to impact forest landscape patterns and consequently the supply of forest ecosystem services. However, the specific ways by which such impacts manifest are unclear. Therefore, to discuss the relationship between them is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development. Here, we quantitatively assess the intensity of forest ecosystem service functions and forest landscape patterns in Renqiu City of China's Hebei Province in 2019 using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS. We characterize the relationships between forest ecosystem service capacity and landscape patterns, and identify strategies for the spatial optimization of forests. We find that the ecosystem service intensity of forests are significantly correlated with their spatial distribution, forest area ratio, and landscape patterns. Specifically, the percentage of landscape (PLAND) index, landscape shape index (LSI), and contagion (CONTAG) index indices display second-order polynomial relationships with various forest ecosystem service functions, with critical values of 80, 5, and 70, respectively. We propose that forest ecosystem functions can be optimized by optimizing forest landscape patterns. Specifically, to maximize the function of forest ecosystem services, managers should consider the integrity of forest ecosystems, optimize their ability to self-succession, repair service functions of key nodes within forests, enhance forests' structural stability, optimize forest quality and community structure, and strengthen the efficiency of functional transformation per unit area. Finally, we propose a strategy for the spatial optimization of forests in Renqiu to optimize their associated ecosystem services. This involves protecting important areas for forest ecosystems, rationally organizing different ecological patches such as forests and water bodies to maximize their functions, strengthening the connectivity of scattered forests, and supplementing woodland areas.

AB  - With the growth of the world population, cities expand and encroach on forests and plants, causing many environmental problems. Digital Twin, as the rapidly developing technique in recent years, provides the opportunity to implement the specific situation of forests and plants at present or in the future, which has great performance on predictive analysis and optimization. From the consideration of plants and forests, this study provides a comprehensive case study to research the relationship between urban development boundary and natural environment in a natural preserve in a coastal city. Multispectral data of the study area is collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), combining satellite remote sensing (RS) historical data and geographic data to establish the digital twin model for plant identification. In conjunction with local Master planning of land use, the results of modeling are used to analyze the influences of urban construction on the natural environment, and the inappropriate aspects of the planning are discovered and summarized. In addition, 6 suggestions for effective management and planning strategies are presented. As plants and forests are effective factors of natural conditions, this study offered an objective assessment for the sustainability and rationality of urban planning with some guidance and bases.

AB  - The soils of urban areas were belatedly discovered as a research subject, becoming popular for study in the 1970s. With the growth of cities, there were increased requirements for urban soil information to assure the urban quality of life. Thus, the WG Urban Soils (AKS [Arbeitskreis Stadtboeden], today AGUB) within the German Soil Science Society (DBG) was established in 1987. This paper outlines the national and international achievements of AKS/AGUB and the initiated international urban soil network. Particular attention is given to soil mapping and research in Germany. The foundation of AKS/AGUB initiated a high scientific response on the new research field of urban soils. A soil mapping instruction was established. According to the German concept of soil unit "soil form" from the substrate and soil formation, much attention was given to soil material of natural and technic origin, as well as structure and profile composition. The focus of soil formation is on the young age, the effect of artificial landscape construction, and the speed of soil development. For surveying areas of high soil diversity, conceptual maps were developed. A great number of cities were mapped. As in Germany, urban soils were included in several national soil classification systems. Those of Germany, the United States, Russia, France, and the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) are compared. A great number of tasks of urban administration concern soil problems, such as pollution, soil sealing, urban greening, stormwater infiltration, heating, dust, and carbon sequestration, so soils were relevant in city government work. Internationally, the WG SUITMA of International Union of Soil Science and the US WG INCOMANTH were dedicated to urban soils. The AKS/AGUB could contribute to the European Commission with concepts of soil functions and soil evaluation and the introduction of Technosols to the WRB. Important future aspects will be the competition of intense rising soil consumption by building activities, and the availability and quality of soils for a sustainable urban life.

AB  - As elsewhere in Europe, cities in Denmark have witnessed a surge in civic urban nature engagement, such as place- and practice-based initiatives (e.g., public-access community gardens, organic food collectives, and grazing associations that enhance biodiversity). While this expansion of urban green communities, as we call them, is widely noted in the literature, less attention has been paid to the comparative variability of their local civic expression. In this article, we use digital methods to map out the group styles, the spatial intergroup networks, and the cultural-political value landscapes of 130 urban green communities across the four largest cities in Denmark. To compare results, we develop the concept of "civic engagement scenes" as a way of responding to recent developments in cultural and political sociology. Overall, we show how this notion allows for interpreting civic greening groups: they are neither neighborhood-based endeavors nor hubs of social movement mobilization, but rather geographies of co-engagement that span cities while also forge new senses and practices of place.

AB  - Invasive alien plant species (IAPS) in urban ecosystems can significantly impact ecosystems and human wellbeing. However, our knowledge on the IAPS in urban ecosystems are limited due to the small number of studies. In this study, we examined features of the invasion process of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) by using a comparative study approach and genetic population methods. We conducted field surveys in 19 prefecture-level cities in East China and collected samples of 37 urban and 18 non-urban populations in 16 cities. Using information from six microsatellite loci and two chloroplast spacers extracted from the samples, we tested hypotheses on the source, genetic diversity, and genetic patterns of urban populations of common ragweed. We found that urban populations of common ragweed had more modern and diverse invasion sources than that of non-urban populations. Also, urban populations had more complex genetic patterns than non-urban populations as we identified seven genetic clusters in urban populations and four genetic clusters in non-urban populations. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the genetic diversity of urban and non-urban populations. In addition, we observed a significant isolation by distance (IBD) pattern in non-urban populations (Mantel test, R2 =0.160, p-value=0.001) but not in urban populations (R2 =0.003, p-value=0.253). The patterns may be shaped by the long-distance dispersal of seeds of common ragweed in urban environments through human activities such as transportation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the invasion process of IAPS in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPUA) can play a fundamental role in producing Ecosystem Services (ES) ES at the local level improving sustainability of urban / rural relations. Referring to the peri-urban areas surrounding Municipality of Prato (Tuscany -Italy), we assessed the potential of urban and peri-urban agricultural areas in providing some key ES: food supply, CO2 storage and biodiversity / connectivity. We also analysed the planning tools operating in the area to foster the enhancement of the UPUA area within the planning processes. The study was conducted using the scenario method by comparing the current situation with an agroecological scenario and verifying the change in the delivery of these three ES. The results show an increase of CO2 storage capacity and ecological connectivity with tolerable repercussions on food provision. Indeed, results highlights the potential of the UPUA in satisfying the food needs of almost 87.9% of the inhabitants of Prato for cereals and 27.9% for legumes whereas, in the agroecological scenario, these produce decrease by about 23% and 11%. Finally, the study suggests the need to integrate governance and territorial planning tools to promote and enhance the role of ES provided by UPUAs on an urban and peri-urban scale.

AB  - Vagility, ecological requirements, and forest patches can all influence gene flow among populations. These aspects are critical for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Ectophylla alba is a fruit bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae with specialized feeding and habitat requirements. Studies examining population genetics in this specialist bat are lacking. In this study, ten microsatellite loci were used to evaluate the current genetic structure of this bat species. Six localities in Costa Rica were evaluated. These localities are included in a landscape with remnants of lowland forests surrounded by cattle pastures, plantations, urban areas, and roads. Our results suggest a genetic population with moderate genetic diversity that was observed at most studied loci, with a statistically non-significant difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity. Most of the genetic variation was observed within rather than among sampled populations. The Mantel test showed a non-significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance. These results suggest that E. alba populations have not shown an effect of habitat fragmentation in the studied area. We argue that the increase of forest patches is too recent to alter genetic diversity among sampled localities. Current migration among populations appears to be high enough to balance allele frequencies among localities.

AB  - In the era of globalisation, when the whole planet is urbanised and planners debate "planetary urbanization", economists discuss "global cities", ecologists describe the planet's biodiversity hotspot connections, and climate change warns of a "global" crisis, it might be necessary to shift the paradigm of the landscape planning scale from local and regional scale to an adequate scale of challenges-planetary scale. The era of holistic approaches necessitates a review in local landscape planning in line with global drivers, and that is why most schools of thought have moved towards "planetary visions" to resolve the global challenges. In prospect for the planet's future, with the bourgeoning of the next billion people, under the pressure of climate change and implosion/explosion of planetary urbanisation, shortage of land is one of the hot topics, as well as humanity's attempt to manage the planet as a "whole" system to guarantee the economic resources and protect the biodiversity. Concerning some global landscape connectivity projects, the paper focuses on the importance of "planetary scale" to guarantee the proper understanding of relationships between landscape design, urbanization and ecological advocacy.

AB  - With the accelerated urbanization and frequent occurrence of climate extremes, the regional ecosystem service level has ushered in a great challenge, and the resilience of the ecological network has gradually weakened, leading to lower ecological benefits and production levels. As a core ecologically sensitive area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan metropolitan area has been expanding outward with rapid urbanization, crowding out surrounding arable and ecological land, and facing serious challenges to the sustainable development of the national space, while current cross-regional ecological protection measures need to be strengthened urgently, and exploring the structural resilience of its ecological network is of great significance to promote regional stability. In this study, Wuhan metropolitan area is taken as an example, and we explore the evolution and laws of ecological network structure from the perspective of network analysis by constructing ecological networks in Wuhan metropolitan area in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Firstly, we select regions from the ecological control line developed in China as ecological source sites, and also select multivariate data to supplement them. Then, the ecological network was established using the MCR model. Finally, network analysis was applied to discuss the evolution of network structure under multiple times and propose corresponding conservation strategies. The results show that (1) the major ecological resistance of Wuhan urban area has increased by 5.24% in 20 years. (2) The centrality and connectivity of the network nodes have increased over the 20-year period, and the overall structure of the network has stabilized and the resilience of the network has increased. (3) There is a strong link between changes in the network as a whole and local resilience. The results of the study will help analyze the relationship between the network as a whole and the region, and provide reference for optimizing the ecological network and constructing the systematic management of ecological security pattern.

AB  - Compound failures occur when urban flooding coincides with traffic congestion, and their impact on network connectivity is poorly understood. Firstly, either three-dimensional road networks or the traffic on the roads has been considered, but not both. Secondly, we lack network science frameworks to consider compound failures in infrastructure networks. Here we present a network-theory-based framework that bridges this gap by considering compound structural, functional, and topological failures. We analyze high-resolution traffic data using network percolation theory to study the response of the transportation network in Harris County, Texas, US to Hurricane Harvey in 2017. We find that 2.2% of flood-induced compound failure may lead to a reduction in the size of the largest cluster where network connectivity exists, the giant component, 17.7%. We conclude that indirect effects, such as changes in traffic patterns, must be accounted for when assessing the impacts of flooding on transportation network connectivity and functioning.
   Flood impacts on the functioning of a transport network are substantially exacerbated by indirect effects such as congestion due to changing traffic patterns, suggests an analysis of the impact of Hurricane Harvey on transport in Harris County, Texas using network percolation theory.

AB  - The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape's complexity and the landscape pattern's fragmentation showed a decreasing-increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.

AB  - Genetic connectivity lies at the heart of evolutionary theory, and landscape genetics has rapidly advanced to understand how gene flow can be impacted by the environment. Isolation by landscape resistance, often inferred through the use of circuit theory, is increasingly identified as being critical for predicting genetic connectivity across complex landscapes. Yet landscape impediments to migration can arise from fundamentally different processes, such as landscape gradients causing directional migration and mortality during migration, which can be challenging to address. Spatial absorbing Markov chains (SAMC) have been introduced to understand and predict these (and other) processes affecting connectivity in ecological settings, but the relationship of this framework to landscape genetics remains unclear. Here, we relate the SAMC to population genetics theory, provide simulations to interpret the extent to which the SAMC can predict genetic metrics and demonstrate how the SAMC can be applied to genomic data using an example with an endangered species, the Panama City crayfish Procambarus econfinae, where directional migration is hypothesized to occur. The use of the SAMC for landscape genetics can be justified based on similar grounds to using circuit theory, as we show how circuit theory is a special case of this framework. The SAMC can extend circuit-theoretic connectivity modelling by quantifying both directional resistance to migration and acknowledging the difference between migration mortality and resistance to migration. Our empirical example highlights that the SAMC better predicts population structure than circuit theory and least-cost analysis by acknowledging asymmetric environmental gradients (i.e. slope) and migration mortality in this species. These results provide a foundation for applying the SAMC to landscape genetics. This framework extends isolation-by-resistance modelling to account for some common processes that can impact gene flow, which can improve predicting genetic connectivity across complex landscapes.

AB  - Landscape visual quality (LVQ) relates to a landscape's spatial, functional and visual structure at a given time, which can affect the senses and experience of the person using or viewing the landscape. A holistic LVQ assessment can be undertaken by using two complementary approaches. The first uses visual quality assessment tools to measure a person's perceptive responses to landscapes; the second, the focus of our study, is based on the quantitative assessment of the physical attributes of landscapes. The physical attributes of landscapes refer to their spatial configuration and composition, and have conventionally been characterised using 2D or 2.5D metrics. The use of 3D attributes is an emerging field, but there is scant information on the range of 3D metrics that can describe the physical attributes of landscapes and which relate to the perception of landscape quality. This study develops 3D spatial metrics to describe landscapes' structures and spatial characteristics grounded on landscape visualization theory. These metrics are derived from point clouds and describe 3D attributes of volume and area, landscape diversity, shape, connectivity, colour, topography, and openness. The effectiveness of the 3D spatial metrics to quantify LVQ was verified using a set of urban landscapes in the high-rise, compact environment of our study sites. The results show that 3D spatial metrics can successfully detect the differences among landscapes in the dimensions of naturalness, complexity, coherence and visual scale. For example, landscapes with a random distribution and irregular shapes had high values in horizontal, vertical, and distance diversity (HVDD) and the shape index, respectively, indicating their high spatial and shape diversities. Our study highlights the potential of using 3D spatial metrics derived from point clouds for a more holistic and objective LVQ assessment.

AB  - The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran's I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran's I| < 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran's I value, and high-high and low-high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.

AB  - The first inventory of the flora of Appia Antica Regional Park (Italy), one of the largest protected urban areas in Europe (4580 ha), its biological, ecological and biogeographical composition, and notes of the vegetation physiognomies and landscape are presented; physical characteristics of the territory (geomorphology, lithotypes, and phytoclimate) are also given. The landscape is defined by an agricultural matrix with natural and seminatural areas as patches, and riparian vegetation communities as corridors. The vegetation physiognomies are represented by types linked to the Mediterranean climate (mixed, Mediterranean, and riparian forests; scrubby, rocky, aquatic, and helophytic vegetation; anthropogenic communities). The floristic list includes 714 taxa (104 families and 403 genera). Therophytes prevail over hemicryptophytes; woody flora comprises about 30% of alien species. As regards chorotypes, together with a considerable number of Mediterranean species, there are many exotic species with wide distribution areas testifying to a long-lasting anthropic impact. Floristic novelties (european, national, and regional levels) for 21 taxa are reported. The extraordinary species diversity discovered (43% of flora of Rome and 20% of regional flora) is linked to the landscape heterogeneity, the characteristics of which are: (1) persistence of residual natural patches, (2) occurrence of quite well-preserved aquatic habitats and humid meadows, (3) a rich anthropogenic flora, (4) an interesting flora of archeological sites, (5) occurrence of species not common in Latium, (6) occurrence of populations of aliens in crops (which cause economic impact), (7) presence of aliens on archeological ruins (which cause economic-social impacts). The extensive set of data provided represents a general base framework for guiding future research efforts and landscape action plans consistent with environmental sustainability.

AB  - Urban areas, characterized by impervious surfaces, produce storm water runoff which during unexpected heavy rainfall exceeds the carrying capacity of the storm water drainage system causing urban flooding. Transport expressways are massive hard-scaped surfaces generating large amounts of polluted surface run-off during the rains. In the case of the Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises (NICE) Expressway at Bengaluru, India, which is also a tolled road, the demonstration is about using the surface run-off or stormwater as a resource for developing urban green infrastructure complementing the transport grey infrastructure. The functions of urban green infrastructure include air quality improvement, microclimate modification, storm water management, biodiversity, recreational opportunities and visual aesthetics. Here we show, that the surface runoff or stormwater is effectively channelled to the areas around, to mark the beginning of a well-planned and executed drainage system, maintenance-free landscape and technically a sound, urban green infrastructure in the form of site-specific models of Rain Gardens. The same models can be used in other transport expressways as they are the indicators of economic growth and connectivity although would require to be customized as per the city and its climatic conditions. This paper explores three different scenarios with a typical model of development of green infrastructure along the transport expressway tailormade for each of the situations. While in the first and the second models, the Central Rain Garden and the Edge Rain Garden have been respectively proposed, the third model explores a comparatively complex scenario in the form of an Intersection Rain Garden.

AB  - Urban green spaces, and green infrastructure more generally, provide multiple benefits that can enhance urban livability and sustainability. These range from the mitigation of air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effect, to multi-dimensional benefits to human wellbeing and biodiversity. However, the expansion of urban green spaces is not always feasible in many cities. In such urban contexts, there have been proposals to utilize rooftops as green roofs in order to gain some of these benefits. This study spatially identifies areas where roofs have the potential to provide different types of benefits associated with urban green spaces if they are retrofitted with green roofs. Through a GIS-based approach we catalogue available roof space in Sumida ward in Tokyo for green roof implementation, and subsequenlty evaluate the potential of each roof patch to offer four types of benefits if retrofitted with a green roof, namely UHI effect mitigation, air pollution mitigation, and benefits to subjective wellbeing and biodiversity. Approximately 25% of the total roof surface in Sumida ward can potentially be used for green roof implementation. Furthermore, about 5.2% and 59% of this area has a respectively high and moderate potential to provide all four benefits if retrofitted with green roofs. This could increase the extent of green spaces by 10% and 120% respectively across the Sumida ward. In this sense, green roofs can become a major element of green infrastructure with ripple positive effects for urban livability and sustainability through the provision of UHI effect and air pollution mitigation, and benefits to subjective wellbeing and biodiversity.

AB  - Plant functional traits can greatly influence invasion success on islands. However, interrelationships between traits and invasion success are rarely integrated with the island biogeography theory. Here, we explored relations between functional traits and plant distributions to assess which traits are associated with invasion success (i.e. high island occupancy), test whether non-native richness and seed mass of species with distinct growth forms and dispersal modes vary differently with island characteristics (e.g. area, isolation, exposure to ocean-borne disturbances, distance from the nearest urban area, and whether islands were managed for conservation), and whether results differ from native species. We assembled a database of 264 northern New Zealand offshore islands, amalgamating species lists from field surveys and previously published data, and comprising 822 native and 855 non-native species. Non-native graminoids occurred on islands more frequently than forbs and woody species, and long-distance dispersal modes (wind, animal, unspecialized) more than species with short-distance dispersal modes. Most differences among trait categories of non-native species were associated with human-related variables (i.e. distance from the nearest urban area, and whether islands were conservation areas). Non-native plant species with high island occupancy were less commonly associated with human-related variables than non-native species with low island occupancy. Instead, they were more similar in their distributional patterns to native species within the same trait category, suggesting comparable processes regulate both sets of species. Our results illustrate that integrating trait-based approaches in the island biogeography framework can be a useful tool in understanding and predicting plant invasions.

AB  - is among the leading causes of amphibian declines worldwide. Urban open spaces, such as golf courses and parks, can potentially provide suitable habitat to amphibians within urbanized matrices. During the spring and summer of 2018, we conducted active call surveys to determine the relative abundance of anurans at 51 wetlands within the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, USA. Approximately one third of these wetlands were located within urban open spaces, while the remainder were situated along a gradient of development. We evaluated species-specific relative abundances as a function of the presence or absence of urban open space, several within-wetland covariates, and two landscape-scale covariates. We also tested the hypothesis that open spaces mitigate the influence of high development, as measured by percent impervious surface around the wetland. Road length within a buffer around the wetland negatively affected all species, and this effect remained even for urban open space wetlands. Roads negatively impact anurans through direct mortality, dispersal limitations, and habitat fragmentation. Conservation efforts conducted within open spaces should attempt to focus on issues not only at an individual wetland scale, but also at scales outside of the open spaces themselves. Understanding how urbanization at various spatial scales effects anuran species can inform efforts to bolster amphibian conservation efforts in urban matrices.

AB  - To accommodate an ever-increasing human population, agriculture is rapidly intensifying at the expense of natural habitat, with negative and widely reported effects on biodiversity in general and on wild bee abundance and diversity in particular. Cities are similarly increasing in area, though the impact of urbanisation on wild bees is more equivocal and potentially positive in northern temperate regions. Yet agriculture and urbanisation both lead to the loss and alteration of natural habitat, its fragmentation, a potential reduction in floral availability, and warmer temperatures, factors thought to be drivers of wild bee decline. They have also been shown to be factors to which wild bee populations respond through morphological change. Body size is one such trait that, because of its relation to individual fitness, has received growing attention as a morphological feature that responds to human induced modification in land use. Here, we investigated the change in body size of two sympatric orchid bee species on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in response to urbanization and agricultural intensification. By measuring 540 male individuals sampled from overall 24 sites, we found that Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima were on average smaller in urban and agricultural habitats than in natural ones. We discuss the potential role of reduced availability of resources in driving the observed body size shifts. Agricultural and urban land management in tropical regions might benefit wild bees if it encompassed the planting of flowering herbs and trees to enhance their conservation.

AB  - Confrontations between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government and civil society regarding the demolition of historical sites across the city have been occurring since the mid-2000s. These clashes have been interpreted as the consequence of exclusionary heritage governance practices; postcolonial identity anxieties; and popular dissatisfaction toward economic injustices in the city. This essay argues that heritage mobilizations also arise from the competing meanings and expectations the SAR government and civil society have attached to notions of "urban heritage," especially in relation to urban liveability discourses. Using documentary and ethnographic data, this essay provides an overview of Hong Kong's heritage landscape before examining approaches by both government and civil society toward heritage conservation-reflecting their respective understandings as to what urban heritage entails for urban life. This essay finds the SAR government position heritage as being secondary to urban redevelopment, a means of establishing urban liveability in economic terms. In contrast, civil society actors frame heritage as integral to redevelopment, producing a liveable city through enriching social conviviality. By delineating the disparate ways urban heritage is valued in Hong Kong, this essay offers broader insights on the conflict regarding how present and future urban life is envisioned in Asian cities.

AB  - Critical infrastructures serve human activities and play an essential role in societies. Infrastructural systems are not isolated but are interdependent with regard to social systems, including those of public health and economic and sustainable development. In recent years, both social and infrastructural systems have frequently been in dysfunction due to increasing natural or human-made disasters and due to the internal and external dependencies between system components. The interconnectedness between social-infrastructural systems (socio-economic systems and technical-infrastructural systems), implies that the damage to one single system can extend beyond its scope. For that reason, cascading dysfunction can occur and increase system vulnerability. This article aims to study the functional interdependencies between social-infrastructural systems and to propose a methodology to analyse and improve the resilience of these systems. Combining Actor Network Theory and the Functional Models approach, the social-infrastructural Interdependence Resilience (SIIR) framework was proposed. To assess the applicability of the approach, the framework was applied to study the interdependence of a social-infrastructural system in the Nantes Metropolis. The studied system was composed of the local Highway Infrastructure (an infrastructural system) and the Emergency Medical Service (a social system). The results (1) show the feasibility of SIIR for investigating the interdependencies of two urban systems, and (2) provide a guideline for decision-makers to improve the functional interdependencies of urban systems.

AB  - Accurate assessment of Trees outside forest (TOF) is an essential input for the management and preservation of these vast resources, due to their importance in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Many studies have demonstrated the use of High-resolution satellite (HRS) imageries for mapping and monitoring of TOF in urban and rural landscapes. The conventional per-pixel classifier is not a suitable option for HRS data classification, owing to inherent high intra-class variability and high interclass similarity. In the present study, a convolution neural network-based approach was employed for TOF mapping using HRS images, predominantly in the urban landscape of Bengaluru city, India. We developed a semi-automated procedure for the generation of labelled training samples using object-based image analysis (OBIA), minimizing time requirement for input training data preparation for deep learning (DL) model development. These inputs were utilized to develop a DL model for the classification of TOF using U-Net, which is a semantic segmentation-based DL architecture. The results indicated that the model performed well for the classification of urban TOF with an overall classification accuracy of 89.65 percent and an F1 score of 93.03 percent, in comparison with OBIA (overall accuracy of 80.73 percent & F1 score of 86.44 percent). We demonstrated utilisation of a developed methodology for the assessment of TOF in a distinctive urban landscape, which can be extended to agriculture dominated regions in diverse landscapes.

AB  - As an interdisciplinary topic, landscape ecology has great potential in providing knowledge for landscape planning. However, previous studies have not been reviewed by multidisciplinary journals. There has not yet been a thorough analysis of these studies, and it is unclear how different points of view have evolved. In this study, CiteSpace software is used to analyze the evolution and current state of LEP research from several perspectives, which also identifies research hotspots and future research trends. The main findings are as follows: (i) There are three phases in LEP research: preparation, rising, and prosperity. LEP research is gradually shifting from concentrated ecological or environmental science to multidisciplinary fields, and there are significant opportunities for LEP research to build global collaborative networks. (ii) The focus of this research has gradually shifted from quantifying environmental impact to analyzing the internal process of the urban system. (iii) Future research will concentrate on a spatial model of landscape system analysis, landscape ecological resilience research, and LEP research in "urban agglomeration" with the hope of increasing the ability to realize sustainable space development.

AB  - The Natura 2000 network, the pillar of biodiversity conservation in Europe, still shows some knowledge gaps after almost 30 years since its implementation. As birds are a taxonomic group that is underrepresented in the literature related to Natura 2000 compared to their importance in the EU Directives, this review investigated the characteristics of the scientific research dedicated to birds in relation to Natura 2000. This review focused on 169 peer-reviewed articles covering a period of 25 years (1995-2019). Most studies were set within single Natura 2000 site or regions within countries, and concerned terrestrial habitats, particularly wetlands. The terrestrial Mediterranean biogeographical region and marine Atlantic region had the greatest number of publications, while Spain, Italy, and France were the countries with the highest number of reviewed articles. The number of publications was correlated to Natura 2000 coverage at both country and biogeographical region level. Bird species were studied mainly at a community or single-species level and most publications studied distribution and occurrence of the bird species of interest, while very few assessed the conservation status of the species. Only a few articles set within Natura 2000 sites addressed the issues of habitat suitability for birds or the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Both Annex I and non-Annex I bird species were examined in the literature, with most species having decreasing population trends at the European scale. Future research on bird conservation and Natura 2000 should focus on marine ecosystems as well as habitats that have received less attention despite their important role in a changing future (alpine and urban types). Moreover, future studies should encompass larger spatial scales and those species for which status and trends are still not thoroughly investigated. Finally, it would be important to enhance research efforts on the conservation status and effectiveness in relation to the network.

AB  - The present study provides new insight into suitable microsporidian-host associations. It relates regional and continental-wide host specialization in microsporidians infecting amphipods to degraded and recovering habitats across 2 German river catchments. It provides a unique opportunity to infer the persistence of parasites following anthropogenic disturbance and their establishment in restored rivers. Amphipods were collected in 31 sampling sites with differing degradation and restoration gradients. Specimens were morphologically (hosts) and molecularly identified (host and parasites). Amphipod diversity and abundance, microsporidian diversity, host phylogenetic specificity and continental-wide beta-specificity were investigated and related to each other and/or environmental variables. Fourteen microsporidian molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), mainly generalist parasites, infecting 6 amphipod MOTUs were detected, expanding the current knowledge on the host range by 17 interactions. There was no difference in microsporidian diversity and host specificity among restored and near-natural streams (Boye) or between those located in urban and rural areas (Kinzig). Similarly, microsporidian diversity was generally not influenced by water parameters. In the Boye catchment, host densities did not influence microsporidian MOTU richness across restored and near-natural sites. High host turnover across the geographical range suggests that neither environmental conditions nor host diversity plays a significant role in the establishment into restored areas. Host diversity and environmental parameters do not indicate the persistence and dispersal of phylogenetic host generalist microsporidians in environments that experienced anthropogenic disturbance. Instead, these might depend on more complex mechanisms such as the production of resistant spores, host switching and host dispersal acting individually or conjointly.

AB  - Walking is undoubtedly a sustainable and healthy mode of transport. However, the decision to walk is influenced by many built environment and streetscape attributes. Specifically, the term walkability is used to describe the extent to which the urban environment is pedestrian-friendly, usually by quantifying multiple built environment attributes at the neighbourhood scale. The present study adopts a qualitative approach to evaluate perceived walkability. Based on a questionnaire (n = 1438) administered in the cities of Bologna and Porto, this paper analyses how respondents perceived and evaluated 19 built environment and streetscape attributes. An Exploratory Factor Analysis was carried out to examine the correlations between the various attributes and to identify the underlying walkability determinants. The analysis indicated that 13 attributes were highly correlated, resulting in four determinants: (i) urban ambiance, which includes land use and street design attributes, such as land use mix, enclosure, transparency, and architectural and landscape diversity; (ii) pedestrian infrastructure, which is related to sidewalk conditions; (iii) street connectivity and proximity to community facilities; and iv) access to other modes of transport. In turn, traffic safety and security were not correlated with perceived walkability in both cities. These findings suggest that specific urban design and pedestrian infrastructure attributes should be highly considered when formulating policies aiming to create more pedestrian-friendly cities, as well as in walkability studies and when developing walkability scores and indexes.

AB  - Most studies in the field of ecological restoration have only focused on repairing damaged land and have made no attempt to account for the impact of high-intensity land use on future landscape patterns. The purpose of this study was to propose a framework for evaluating the expected effects of ecological restoration based on land-use change and the ecological security pattern. Therefore, we integrated the PLUS model with the ecological security pattern and used Hefei City as a case study to conduct research. The results showed that from 2020 to 2030, land-use changes would occur primarily in the main urban area of Hefei and along the eastern shore of the Chaohu Lake watershed. Under the ecological protection scenario, arable land would be converted to construction land and woodland. Additionally, there would be an increase in ecological sources and pinch points in the area, and the number and area of the barriers would show a certain degree of reduction. The ecosystem quality, ecological integrity, and landscape connectivity of Hefei would be improved. This study offers a novel perspective for evaluating the expected effects of regional ecological restoration and provides an important reference for the dynamic formulation of multilevel ecological restoration policies.

AB  - Polycentric urban structures are important spatial development strategies in megacities; however, they have decentralized morphologies and functional characteristics that profoundly impact urban space development. Therefore, when promoting sustainable development in urban areas in Shenyang, the only megacity in northeast China, it is important to explore the polycentric spatial development of megacities based on multi-source data, geographic information system spatial analysis, and network model methods. This study was conducted to examine the polycentric structures of the morphological and functional dimensions. The results showed that morphological polycentric space can be defined as "centralized dispersion," with the functional polycentric only comprised "decentralized concentration." Additionally, agglomeration sub-centers of the morphological dimension were all on the periphery of the city, although the three sub-centers within the city (M6, M7, and M8) were diffusion types. In the functional dimension, sub-centers F7 and F6 exhibited high centrality and power for both agglomeration and diffusion. Finally, four-node motifs were more important than three-node motifs in the morphological polycentric micro-networks, but their frequency was low, whereas that of three-node motifs were more important than four-node motifs in functional polycentric micro-networks, and their occurrence frequency was high.

AB  - Social media data has frequently sourced research on topics such as traveller planning or the factors that influence travel decisions. The literature on the location of tourist activities, however, is scarce. The studies in this line that do exist focus mainly on identifying points of interest and rarely on the urban areas that attract tourists. Specifically, as acknowledged in the literature, tourist attractions produce major imbalances with respect to adjacent urban areas. The present study aims to fill this research gap by addressing a twofold objective. The first was to design a methodology allowing to identify the preferred tourist areas based on concentrations of places and activities. The tourist area was delimited using Instasights heatmaps information and the areas of interest were identified by linking data from the location-based social network Foursquare to TripAdvisor's database. The second objective was to delimit areas of interest based on users' existing urban dynamics. The method provides a thorough understanding of functional diversity and the location of a city's different functions. In this way, it contributes to a better understanding of the spatial distribution imbalances of tourist activities. Tourist areas of interest were revealed via the identification of users' preferences and experiences. A novel methodology was thus created that can be used in the design of future tourism strategies or, indeed, in urban planning. The city of Bucharest, Romania, was taken as a case study to develop this exploratory research.

AB  - Remnant habitat patches can provide ideal space for conservation of native flora in agricultural and urban landscapes. Graveyards are ideals for such conservation actions if they are managed scientifically. Present study analyzed current status of the tree diversity and related issues of the graveyards from Tehsil Mansehra for their utilization in native tree conservation. Random sampling was made through 35 vegetation stands covering 35 graveyards occupying 35 Union Councils. Total 56 species including 35 trees and 21 shrubs, belonging to 46 genera and 31 families were documented from study sites including 44 naturally growing and 12 planted species. Total 2645 mature trees and 2532 regenerating trees were counted and 14 tree species shows high rate of regeneration. Presence of noxious invasive tree Broussonetia papyrifera and Ailanthus altissima however stipulated the active management of such remnant habitats because of severe invasion threats. Involvement of the local communities can effectively result in utilization of the graveyards as steppingstones and functional corridors in rapidly intensifying urban areas and agricultural lands. Such approach can be applied to other areas for identification and utilization of remnant habitats in plant conservation.

AB  - The replacement of natural landscapes by anthropic environments has led to habitat loss and consequently, to the decline and extinction of many species populations. Several strategies, such as the creation of protected areas (PAs) and payment for ecosystem services have been adopted to mitigate the consequences of this biodiversity crisis. In Rio Verde, Goias, Brazil, a Water Producer Program (WPP) was established, which provides payment for ecosystem services for the maintenance of riparian vegetation in the region of the Ribeirao Abobora, a river which supplies the city and metropolitan area. In the absence of environmental diagnostic studies in the region, this present study contributes to reducing some knowledge gaps, through the: (i) characterization of the landscape in the WPP area, (ii) characterization of species of fauna (amphibians, birds, fish, and medium and large terrestrial mammals) and woody flora that occur in this area, and (iii) comparison of species diversity (fauna and flora) found in our study area with the diversity observed in the Cerrado protected area network. Our results reveal a low native vegetation cover (similar to 21% of total area), but we recorded 300 total species: 20 species of anuran amphibians, 100 birds, 10 fish, 16 terrestrial mammals (medium and large), and 154 woody plants. Our sample comprises species considered endemic to the Cerrado (e.g.,Anuran -Batycholos terntezi and Mammal - Callithrix penicillata), threatened species (e g , Mammals - Herpailurus yagouctroundi, Mynnecophaga tridactyla and Tapirus terrestris), and exotic invasive species (Mammal - Sus scrofa). The results presented in this study are relevant and may help in the proposal of management actions within the scope of this important program of payment for environmental services.

TI  - Intelligent Design Model of Urban Landscape Space Based on Optimized BP Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA  - English
AB  - Urban landscape space planning is an important application field of landscape ecology. With the continuous development of the field of architectural optimization, more and more optimization methods have sprung up, including various intelligent optimization algorithms. Such intelligent optimization algorithms usually rely on traditional building performance simulation methods to obtain building performance indicators for optimization in the optimization process. However, intelligent optimization algorithms generally require large-scale calculations. At the same time, the time required for building performance simulation is often limited by the complexity of the building model and the configuration of the computer, which leads to too long performance optimization time for designers in the project. With efficient and accurate feedback, building performance optimization methods based on intelligent optimization algorithms are mainly used in scientific research and are difficult to invest in actual projects. Because the traditional BP neural network has its own limitations and its insufficient sample size and weak generalization ability in complex prediction problems, this paper uses the learning algorithm of optimizing the BP neural network to propose an urban landscape space intelligent design model. This article introduces the artificial neural network, a new application technology with the assistance of a geographic information system, and establishes a BP neural network model for urban landscape ecological planning. Seven elements of distance and number of residential points are used as input variables, patch density, fractal dimension, the Shannon diversity index, and aggregation degree are selected as output changes, and 20 samples are carefully collected to train the network. The results show that the network convergence effect is ideal and the generalization ability is strong, which provides a new simulation analysis method for landscape ecological planning.

AB  - Domestic gardens constitute important refuges for biodiversity. However, their typical small size mismatches with the larger scales at which species procure resources from urban areas. Consequently, they lack the capacity to enhance biodiversity at these scales. This could be addressed by aggregating garden resources (e.g. vegetation) and increasing garden connectivity. Specifically, this could involve neighbouring householders removing brick walls and fences that segregate gardens and collectively planting vegetation across garden boundaries. Nevertheless, insufficient research has explored 1) how hard surfacing gardens influences native/non-native vegetation presence, which could influence this action's effectiveness 2) the number of householders willing to undertake such action 3) reasons for unwillingness and how this could be resolved. These research gaps were addressed using an online householder questionnaire distributed weekly to the UK 'followers' of four Facebook pages from January to December 2014. From a total of 276 respondents, 220 (84 %) had gardens with hard surface and this had a significant negative association with native vegetation presence. Only 7 (3%) presently collectively planted vegetation, but 152 (58 %) expressed future willingness. Desires to retain garden control and privacy predominantly underpinned unwillingness. In order to increase the effectiveness and prevalence of collectively planted vegetation, more stringent planning policy is required to restrict hard surfaced gardens. Moreover, desires for garden control and privacy need to be accommodated. This could be principally achieved by 1) communicating that little control would be lost as a result of this action 2) segregating gardens with hedges, which benefit biodiversity and simultaneously provide privacy.

AB  - This work investigates the possibility of using constructed wetland system for the management of municipal wastewaters with reuse strategies for the irrigation of landscapes in Ouled Djellal city of Biskra, Algeria. The design of this system was based on the characteristics (volume and physico-chemical properties) of wastewaters and the urban plan of the studied city. Results showed that studied effluent is easily biodegradable with COD/BOD5 of 1.84 (< 3), BOD5 (325 - 365 mg/L), COD (620-644 mg/L) and TSS (120-250mg/l). The peak of raw wastewater flow was found to be 32.4 m(3)/h, which was used for the calculation of drip network for the landscape irrigation. The selected variant for the configuration of the CW system is HF-VF-HF, which occupies an area of 11.580 m(2) and will reduce significantly the water pollution. The treated wastewater will be reused for the irrigation of landscapes via the dimensioned drip network. Results of this study showed that the proposed design for the system (treatment and reuse) would be effective in reducing pollution in the urban environment by ensuring possibility of the reuse of the treated water for irrigation. This gives also a great opportunity for using this strategy in small neighborhoods in other cities.

AB  - As the main spatial carrier for people's social activities, street space occupies an important position in the urban space. However, under the direction of traffic-driven urban planning, the social function of street space has been neglected, resulting in the gradual loss of vitality. In mountainous cities with rugged terrain, the factors influencing the vitality of streets may be different compared to those in plain areas. In order to explore the influence mechanism of street vitality in mountainous cities, a new quantitative research method based on the new data environment and a Bayesian network is proposed. In this study, Python and GIS are used to obtain spatial data of streets, and Bayesian networks are used to construct street vitality models to identify important influencing factors and causal relationships between influencing factors. The results demonstrate strong causal dependencies between the factors influencing street vitality in mountainous cities. The mechanism of influence of street vitality revolves around functionality and street texture in terms of its own environment and external environment, respectively. The combination of factor group with functional density as the root node achieved the maximum probability of high vitality of the street. The results of this study have implications for community or urban planners with respect to urban regeneration and street vitality promotion.

AB  - The risks of abnormal temperatures and rainfall on urban ecosystems have been assessed. According to urban ecosystems study results, the scale of anthropogenic changes in the functioning of green zones, urban and suburban regional landscape parks is demonstrated. It has been established that negative changes in components' state of landscape systems contribute to the effective manifestation of a number of adverse processes and phenomena (reduction of groundwater levels, intensification of droughts, soil erosion and deflation, their dehumidification, depletion of landscape and biotic diversity, etc.). The SWOT-analysis method demonstrated the positive role of green zones in the functioning of urban ecosystems and its negative effects on the complex green zones. At the basic stage of the study on the example of the Ternopil urban system the dynamics of the temperatures and precipitation during 60-year period has been demonstrated, the differences in the temperature indicators of the surfaces of different districts of the city have been clarified. It is established that industrial, residential neighborhoods, shopping centers, transport infrastructure experience the greatest temperature fluctuations. The morphology of the earth's surface, the presence of depressions, significant angles of earth's surface inclination, the ratio of green zones with built-up and covered with asphalt, pavement, concrete and road network systems and storm sewers, etc. is an important factor in the intensification of slope water runoff in urban systems. The vulnerability of Ternopil urban system to climate change has been analyzed. Temperature calculations of various city surfaces have been done. The features of moisture circulation on artificial and natural surfaces of urban system have been shown schematically. The flooding regular risk places of the lowered parts of the city territory have been revealed. The runoff coefficients and the combined runoff coefficient for different surfaces of the city have been calculated. Based on these data, the surface runoff volumes in case of heavy rain have been calculated. It has been proven that in the event of torrential rains, the existing rainwater drainage system will not cope with the volume of runoff, causing flooding and inundation of urban zones. A set of measures aimed at preventing flooding of buildings, communications and streets, increasing the rate of safe removal of surface runoff from places of its concentration in the urban system has been proposed.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, confinement and mobility restrictions gave rise to different questions regarding the use and perceptions on public space, where the relational and contextual properties of this space may cause a diversity of emotions. We use machine learning and social network analysis to explore emotions in relation to the public space, based on attributes extracted from photos of the city of Quito, Ecuador, taken between April and June 2020. Our results show that an attribute of the urban landscape can be associated with positive and negative emotions, and that opposite attributes of the images (i.e., glossy and dirty) can both influence positive emotions regarding public space. This research inaugurates a new field of study in Latin America regarding urban emotions, and also supports a better understanding of citizen perceptions of the public space during the pandemic crisis.

AB  - In general, cities are developed in one of two ways: there are cities that are founded in old towns, such as Rome (Italy), and other cities which have evolved from villages, such as Paris, Beijing, or Hanoi. Despite the fact that village spaces are thought to be spontaneously arranged, it is apparent that there is still order in these places, and some settlements are organized in a regular manner. The authors of this research want to provide a picture of how a typical peri-urban hamlets in the Red River Delta operate. For example, a village's transportation network or "spontaneous" space is advanced: different architectural structures, landscape elements, etc. These characteristics provide evidence for agricultural or non-agricultural society's social, economic, and cultural choices, aswell as inherited cultures, in a technological environment with food demand, limitations, and bio-climatemeasurements. It is also known as an historical stamp of the wet rice civilization. Researching and analyzing traditional village spaces in the Red River Delta's peri-urban zones objectively gives a viewpoint on the challenge to adapt to changing climatic circumstances and indigenous cultures. Especially in today's setting, uncontrolled urbanization around large cities occurs simultaneously to with the negative effects of climate change. These conditions make building and village spatial organization experience increasingly valuable. Today, these qualities might be assessed and used in urban development planning projects.

AB  - Context Zoos are a unique landscape with fascinating connections to the principles of landscape ecology. These 'zooscapes' have a focus on managing wild species. Objectives This article examines the multiple scales of zoos as urban green spaces, exhibit landscapes, and resources for resilience. I identify that landscape ecology can inform zoo evolution and note how zoos may provide a novel research site for landscape ecology. Methods I provide a brief history of American zoos and insight into lingering questions within zoos, including their representations of animals and humans. Additionally, I note conceptual overlap between zoo design/function and landscape ecology literature. Results Zoos provide habitat for native species and valued cultural ecosystem services. Zoo exhibits developed a landscape focus as modern landscape ecology emerged in the 1980s. Patches, corridors, and matrices exist within a zoo, and these facilities have value for the genetic support of fragmented populations. Zoos' strategies for disease management are increasingly relevant for global health. Simultaneously, zoos must exhibit sustainable landscapes, not just ecological simulacrums for threatened species. Conclusions Zoos must promote humanity's continued coexistence with other species. A landscape view is essential to achieving this goal. Zoos need to model sustainable landscapes of our present and future.

AB  - With little consideration of both natural and social disturbance in previous studies on Ecological security patterns (ESPs), the identification of conservation priority areas is not accurate enough to enhance the structure and quality of the ecosystem for regional ecological security. To address this gap, this study developed a novel framework of "importance-connectivity-disturbance " to identify ESPs, selecting the Pearl River Delta (PRD) as the study area. Ecological sources were identified by combing ecological importance and landscape connectivity. A more integrated ecological resistance was developed to represent natural and social disturbance, and applied to obtain levels of regional ecological security. Ecological corridors were then extracted and classified using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and gravity model. The results showed that 9645.77 km(2) of ecological sources and 72 potential ecological corridors were determined, and the region with the higher security grade accounted for 19.18% of the entire area. The optimized ESPs of "one ring, two cores, three zones, and four axes " was developed based on key components of ESPs and local socioeconomic conditions. This study provides a novel perspective on the methodology of identifying ESPs and an essential reference for ecological protection and regional development planning in urban agglomerations.

AB  - Aim. To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network and the ecological stability of the region.Material and Methods. Based on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was analyzed.Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and 11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and 66%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol.Conclusions. The creation of new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity of the region.

AB  - With the expansion of economic activities in cities, the function of the urban system is complex and the ecological environment is destructed gradually. Urban planning is one of the important means to solve the above issues. In order to make the city develop sustainably through urban planning, scientific prediction and assess-ment of future ecological risks under different scenarios are the basis for all measures. This paper uses the PLUS model to simulate the land use data of Nanjing in 2025 under four scenarios that are Business As Usual (BAU), Rapid Economic Development (RED), Ecological Land Protection (ELP), and Ecological and Economic Balance (EEB). Then, the changes in various types of land and land transfer under each scenario are analyzed. Moreover, the assessment index considering urban expansion pressure, landscape ecological risk, grain reserve pressure, and ecological degradation pressure is used to analyze the ecological risk of land use under each scenario. The study found that the expansion intensity of built-up land is relatively strong under the RED scenario, followed by the EEB scenario, while the proportion of land with high ecological benefits such as woodland and grassland is higher under the ELP and EEB scenarios. The overall ecological risk level of the city under the ELP scenario is lowest, while the ecological risk under the RED scenario is highest. Therefore, in the region with a high popu-lation density and concentrated built-up land, attention should be paid to the protection of the ecological environment, and large-scale built-up land should be avoided by building ecological corridors. The ecological risk of the EEB scenario in the local area is lower than that of the ELP scenario. Therefore, due to the diversity of each municipal district of Nanjing city, individualized planning should be carried out according to the regional characteristics.

AB  - Despite urbanization's general erosion of biodiversity, towns and cities provide novel opportunities for some species. During the 20th century, gulls (Laridae) colonized urban areas around the world where they flourished. At the same time, some coastal populations declined. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood, partly because little is known about any ecological differences between urban and non-urban gulls, such as their foraging ecology. Here we compare the movement ecology and habitat selection of Lesser Black-backed Gulls Larus fuscus graellsii breeding at two neighbouring colonies - one urban and one coastal - in north-west England. We used bird-borne GPS loggers to first compare colony-level movement behaviour and habitat selection and then investigated individual-level habitat use. We observed clear colony-level habitat segregation: urban breeders preferentially foraged in urban areas whereas coastal breeders foraged primarily in coastal habitats and avoided urban areas. Coastal breeders also had larger core and home-ranges than urban breeders, possibly due to differences in colony size. However, we also found inter-individual differences in habitat use, which may have important management implications. These findings suggest a link between nesting and foraging ecology, and thus management or environmental change altering food availability will impact gulls at the coastal and urban sites differently.

AB  - The intra- and interdomain phyllosphere microbiome features of Quercus ilex L. in a Mediterranean context is reported. We hypothesized that the main driver of the phyllosphere microbiome might be the season and that atmospheric pollutants might have a co-effect. Hence, we investigated the composition of epiphytic bacteria and fungi of leaves sampled in urban and natural areas (in Southern Italy) in summer and winter, using microscopy and metagenomic analysis. To assess possible co-effects on the composition of the phyllosphere microbiome, concentrations of particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined from sampled leaves. We found that environmental factors had a significative influence on the phyllosphere biodiversity, altering the taxa relative abundances. Ascomycota and Firmicutes were higher in summer and in urban areas, whereas a significant increase in Proteobacteria was observed in the winter season, with higher abundance in natural areas. Network analysis suggested that OTUs belonging to Acidobacteria, Cytophagia, unkn. Firmicutes(p), Actinobacteria are keystone of the Q. ilex phyllosphere microbiome. In addition, 83 genes coding for 5 enzymes involved in PAH degradation pathways were identified. Given that the phyllosphere microbiome can be considered an extension of the ecosystem services offered by trees, our results can be exploited in the framework of Next-Generation Biomonitoring.

AB  - Assessing the road effects on biodiversity is challenging because impacts may depend on both wildlife responses to roads and on the spatial arrangement of roads. We questioned whether an increase in road encroachment leads to significant changes in species occurrence and community composition. Using a large citizen-science dataset of point-counts performed throughout Iberian Peninsula, we modelled the effect of road density on the occurrence of common birds (n = 78 species), while accounting for potential confounding effects of environment and survey effort. We then tested if species' occurrence patterns would be linked to specific traits related to the ability to cope with human presence. Finally, we assessed how road density affects the community compositional dissimilarity. We estimated 36 (46%) and 18 (23%) species to be negatively and positively affected by roads, respectively. Increased road encroachment was positively related with urban dwelling and fecundity, and negatively related with nesting on the ground. Furthermore, increasing road density translated into an increasing community compositional dissimilarity, mostly due to species turnover. Overall, we found that different species specific responses to roads translate into changes at the community level. Landscape and road-network management should be conceived acknowledging that roads are contributing to biodiversity changes. As so, building upon the concepts of land sharing/land sparing, conservation actions should be tailored according to the different species responses e.g., road verge management targeting species having a positive relation with road density; and compensation actions targeting species showing a negative response toward roads.

AB  - As in many other parts of the world, the urban areas of the South Asian region are increasingly expanding. While cities today are the heart of commercial, technological and social development, they are also vulnerable to a variety of natural and anthropogenic threats. The complex urban infrastructure, and the ever-expanding population in cities, exacerbate the impacts of climate change and increase the risk of natural hazards. Throughout history, various hydrological disasters including floods, tidal surges, and droughts, and non-hydrological disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, and storms have led to catastrophic social, economic and environmental impacts in numerous South Asian cities. Disaster risk reduction is therefore central to ensure sustainability in urban areas. Although Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are identified as a promising strategy to reduce risk and increase resilience, there appears to be a lack of evidence-based approaches. NbS are measures that can be practiced to obtain benefits of nature for the environmental and community development through conserving, managing, and restoring ecosystems. Against this backdrop, the South Asian cities provide opportunities to evaluate capacities for achieving Nature-based Resilience (NbR) through NbS. This study documents insights from five cities of five different countries of the South Asian region which are subjected to a wide array of disasters: Barishal (Bangladesh), Phuentsholing (Bhutan), Gurugram (India), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Colombo (Sri Lanka). The primary objective of this study is to provide evidence on how NbS are being practiced. Thus, some success stories in cities under consideration are highlighted: restoration of natural canals through integrated development plans and community participation (Barishal), concepts of Gross National Happiness (GNH) and minimal nature interventions (Phuentsholing), "Greening cities'' including eco-corridors, vegetation belts, biodiversity parks (Gurugram), proper land use planning aims at different disasters (Kathmandu), and wetland restoration and management with multiple benefits (Colombo). These cases could therefore, act as a "proxy" for learning from each other to prepare for and recover from future disasters while building NbR.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the major drivers of biotic homogenization (i.e., decrease in beta diversity) in freshwater systems. However, only a few studies have simultaneously examined how urbanization affects multiple facets (i. e., taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) of beta diversity and its underlying ecological drivers in urban river macroinvertebrates. Here, we distinguished the patterns and ecological mechanisms of multiple facets of macroinvertebrate beta diversity weighted by incidence and abundance data in a subtropical river system with a distinct urbanization gradient. We also investigated how total beta diversity patterns stem from replacement versus richness difference among sites. Our results showed that taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversities weighted by incidence data were primarily driven by replacement of taxa, whereas the richness difference contributed more to multiple facets of beta diversity based on abundance data. Furthermore, multiple facets of beta diversity decreased with urbanization for both incidence-weighted and abundance-weighted data, but the former showed more substantial decreases. Both replacement and richness difference components contributed roughly equally to the decline of incidence-weighted beta diversity. In contrast, the losses of abundanceweighted beta diversity were mainly associated with replacement of taxa. Variation partitioning results revealed that all beta diversity measures based on incidence data were governed primarily by local and land-use variables, whereas spatial variables were more relevant in driving beta diversity weighted by abundance data. Overall, by comparing different facets and components of beta diversity weighted by incidence versus abundance data, we suggest that incidence-weighted data may be more sensitive in portraying the impacts of urbanization on macroinvertebrate diversity. This likely resulted from the fact that incidence-weighted data shows the importance of rare taxa in shaping homogenization induced by urbanization.

AB  - Estuarine wetlands provide a wide range of ecosystem functions, including carbon storage, biodiversity maintenance, and shoreline protection, and have human recreational value. In recent years, over half of China's estuarine wetlands have been lost due to natural or anthropogenic stresses. Estuarine wetlands are facing great challenges regarding their protection, restoration and management. China's 18,436 km of coastline support nearly half of its human population and 45 of its 60 major cities. It sustains over 28,000 species, and processes the outflow from seven of its nine major rivers. Rapid economic development in China is a cause of coastal degradation. In an attempt to mitigate habitat loss, over 1000 coastal restoration projects have been conducted in China in the past few decades. Great achievements have been made in the wetland restoration projects. In the future, biological combined restoration technology will become increasingly popular in China.

AB  - We used stable isotopes to help assess ecohydrological partitioning in different types of urban green space in the city of Berlin. We focused particularly on the role of the near-surface of soils as a crucial interface that determines shallow subsurface ( "non-Hortonian ") flows and water cycling in cities. Grassland soils tended to be wetter than soils under continuous urban tree cover, and areas around individual trees in parks or on streets. This is consistent with greater interception losses and transpiration from trees. Soil water isotopes showed distinct seasonality in response to precipitation inputs, mixing with resident soil water and the effects of evaporative fractionation. Effects of fractionation were most marked under individual trees and grasslands, where the effects of evaporation on the isotopic composition of percolating water from the upper 0.1 m of the soil was also most pronounced. Isotope dynamics showed that under all land covers, the upper soils had rapid water turnover and were dominated by younger water (< 2 months old). At depths of 0.4 m, more damping was evident with water being ~ 6 months old. Isotopes in plant water also show seasonal variations which were more marked in grasses than trees. Mixing models revealed that grass most likely recycled shallow, younger soil water in transpiration, whilst trees were more dependent on deeper, older sub-soil and groundwater sources. These preliminary results highlight the urgent need for a much greater understanding of water movement and cycling in the shallow critical zone of urban green spaces. This is essential to manage future resilience to climate change and understand the trade-offs between partitioning urban water between evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge.

AB  - Constructing an ecological security pattern is vital to guaranteeing regional ecological security. The terrain and geomorphology of the alpine valley are complex and sensitive, meaning it is difficult to construct ecological security patterns. Therefore, the study takes Nujiang Prefecture as the study area and builds an "Importance-Sensitivity-Connectivity" (Importance of ecosystem service, eco-environmental sensitivity, and landscape connectivity) framework to carry on the comprehensive evaluation of the ecological security and identification of ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed an ecological resistance surface using land-use type. Using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, the study identifies the ecological corridors and nodes to build ecological security patterns to optimize the ecological spatial structure of Nujiang Prefecture. The results showed that (1) the importance of ecosystem services was higher in the west and lower in the east. The high-sensitive areas of the ecological environment were distributed discontinuously along the banks of the Nujiang and the Lantsang River, and the areas with high landscape connectivity were distributed in patches in the Gaoligong Mountain Nature Reserve and the Biluo Snow Mountain. (2) The overall ecological security was in a good state, and the ecologically insecure areas were primarily distributed in Lanping County and the southeast region of Lushui City. (3) The primary ecological source area was identified to be 3281.35 km(2) and the secondary ecological source area to be 4224.64 km(2). (4) In total, 26 primary ecological corridors, 39 secondary ecological corridors, and 82 ecological nodes were identified.

AB  - Interaction between animals and plants is an important way to maintain terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem function, but little is known about the structure of reciprocal networks between fruit plants and frugivore birds in urban habitats. To explore the characteristics of the plant-frugivore network and network roles of species, we observed the fruit ripening phenology of 21 species of fruit plants and the interactions between these plants and 39 species of frugivore birds during the whole year in a large urban park. Then, we assessed the characteristics of the total plant-frugivore and seasonal networks, and analyzed the network roles of species and the relationship between their network roles and ecological traits. Fruit ripened mainly in autumn and winter, and interaction connections in the two seasons contributed 39.68% and 44.83% to the total network, respectively. The specialization (H-2 & PRIME;), connectance (C), nestedness, and interaction evenness (e(H2)) of the network were lower in autumn and winter, while the interaction diversity was higher. Compared with the networks (N = 1000) generated by the null model, the observed network exhibited higher nestedness and interaction diversity (E-2) and lower specialization (H-2 & PRIME;), connectance (C), and interaction evenness (e(H2)). A correlation analysis combining ecological traits and network roles showed that plants with black fruit had higher effective partners and partner diversity, while other traits of plants and birds were not significantly correlated with their network parameters. The important plants (N = 6) and birds (N = 3) contributed to 71.78% and 67.55% of the total network connection, they were mainly evergreen plants with black and red drupes and omnivorous generalist birds with medium and large sizes. Our research highlighted the seasonal differences in urban plant-frugivore network and the value of important species in maintaining network structures and providing ecosystem services.

AB  - Accurate quantification of urban soil organic carbon (SOC) is essential for understanding anthropogenic changes and further guiding effective city managements. Visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy can monitor the SOC content in a time-and cost-effective manner. However, processes and mechanisms dominating the re-lationships between SOC and spectral data in urban soils remain unknown. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate whether multiple stratification strategies (i.e., based on land-use/land-cover [LULC], pH, and spectral clustering) resulted in better predicted performance for SOC compared to the non-stratified (global) models. Results showed that regarding the non-stratified models, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model exhibited the best performance (validation R2 = 0.73), followed by Cubist (validation R2 = 0.66) and memory-based learning (validation R2 = 0.65). After LULC stratification, Cubist model achieved the best prediction (validation R2 = 0.76), improving the value of ratio of performance to interquartile distance by 0.11 compared to the global CNN model. Areas with high SOC values were mainly located in the city center. Stratification by LULC class is a promising strategy for addressing the impact of the soil-landscape diversity and complexity on vis-NIR spectral estimation of SOC in urban soil spectral library.

AB  - Accelerated urbanization has promoted urban watersheds as important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs); yet the biogeographical patterns and driving mechanisms of ARGs at the watershed scale remain unclear. Here, we examined the dynamic distribution of ARGs in a human-intensive watershed (including city, river and lake systems) over different seasons in a temperate region, as well as revealed the key factors shaping ARGs dynamics through structural equation models (SEMs). High diversity and abundance of ARGs were detected in sediments and surface water, with aminoglycoside, beta-lactamase and multidrug resistance genes dominating. PCoA showed distinct ARGs variations between the two phases. Seasonal changes and regional functions had significant impacts on the distribution patterns of ARGs. More diverse ARGs were detected in winter, while higher ARGs abundances were observed in spring and summer. The city system showed the highest level of ARGs contamination and was mainly derived from wastewater and human/animal feces based on SourceTracker analysis and ARGs indicators. Notably, watershed restoration could significantly mitigate the ARGs pollution status and improve biodiversity in the aquatic environment. Network analysis identified several hub ARGs and bacterial genera, which helped to infer potential bacterial hosts carrying ARGs. Furthermore, ARGs indicators provided insights to trace ARGs sources. SEMs indicated that bioavailable heavy metals and nutrients can greatly shape ARGs dynamics in regions with high-intensity human activities, while the microbial community and MGEs dominate the fate of ARGs in less human-impacted regions. More attention should be given to control heavy metals and nutrients to curb the spread of ARGs. Overall, this study highlights the environmental fate of ARGs and provides novel strategies to mitigate ARGs pollution in the human-intensive watershed.

AB  - Wetlands contain a large number of spontaneous plants, and the ecological value of such plants should not be underestimated. However, the influence of the surrounding environment on the composition of spontaneous plants in wetlands is still unclear. Hangzhou Jiangyangfan Ecological Park, built more than 20 years ago, is the first ecological park in China based on the "wild state" concept. The wetland in the park was taken as a study case, and we investigated some of the ecological factors affecting the diversity and distribution pattern of spontaneous plants in wetland habitats after natural succession. A total of 100 species of spontaneous plants were recorded, belonging to 93 genera and 48 families, with native species accounting for approximately 78% of the total. We found significant differences in the species diversity and distribution patterns of spontaneous plants in different habitats and microhabitats. According to the biological characteristics of spontaneous plants, the fruit types were mostly achenes and capsules, and the seed dispersal mode was mainly animal dispersal. Different fruit types and dispersal modes affected the composition and distribution of spontaneous plants. In terms of environmental factors, the water depth and slope aspect were the key factors determining the diversity and distribution pattern of spontaneous plants. It was also found that the clustering degree of cultivated plants had an effect on the composition of spontaneous plants. To form a more natural wetland landscape, it is necessary to provide a variety of growing environments for spontaneous plants. We suggest allocating appropriate habitat types in wetlands and reducing human intervention to increase biodiversity.

AB  - The hypotelminorheic is a groundwater-fed shallow subterranean habitat, occurring a few metres below the surface and emerging at a seepage spring. Little is known about the habitat requirements for the amphipods and isopods that live there, and forest quality and other surface parameters have been largely unexplored. Urban parks, encompassing protected lands from ballfields to forests, are not necessarily secure sites, because of non-compatible uses and changing park boundaries. Almost all records for this fauna in the study area are in parks. Using data from sampling in parklands of south-east Washington, DC, exploratory analyses were conducted at two spatial scales - the seeps and pervious land patches surrounded by impervious surfaces (which range from 0.59 to 231 ha). Habitat quality, fragmentation and geological variables were calculated, and exploratory logistic regression models were fitted to predict occupancy. Hypotelminorheic macroinvertebrates were found at 66 of 207 seeps and 15 of 27 patches. Five species were collected, three of which were uncommon. Only patches containing three or more seeps and >7.6 ha were inhabited. Occurrence of one or more species in seeps was associated with distance inside the forest, taller tree canopy, elevation and geological formation. There is a threshold amount of habitat below which a population can no longer exist. Few patches of forest remain that are sufficiently large for habitation, and conservation actions should prioritize forested patches with three or more seeps. In addition, the development of forested corridors to enhance connectivity among populations, education of the public about the value of the hypotelminorheic, and development of field methods to detect habitats is recommended. Urban parklands can be important reservoirs for species of conservation concern.

AB  - Urban freshwater ecosystems have important ecosystem functions, provide habitats for diverse microbial communities and are susceptible to multiple interconnected factors such as environmental pollution. Despite the ecological significance of bacteria and microeukaryotes, little is known about how their community assembly responds to various environmental factors across water and sediment habitats and ecological processes shaping them. Here, environmental DNA-based approaches were used to investigate the community assembly processes of bacteria and microeukaryotes (including habitat generalists and specialists) in urban water and sediment across an urban-pollution gradient in Wuhan, central China. The diversity, community composition and potential function of bacteria and microeukaryotes showed significantly stronger variation between water and sediment than across an urban pollution gradient. Although, bacterial and microeukaryotic community assemblies were dominated by strong selection processes in both water and sediment habitats, but a contrasting community assembly mechanism was identified between habitat generalists and specialists. Bacterial and microeukaryotic communities showed a greater response to physicochemical variability in water, while a strong distance-decay relationship was found in sediment. Further, cross-kingdom microbial network analysis revealed strong modular associations of bacteria and microeukaryotes, meanwhile, microeukaryotic habitat specialists might be keystone, but generalists have higher proportion of connections in the networks. This study provides significant insights into the response of bacteria and microeukaryotes to different urban pollutions between water and sediment, and the ecological processes structuring microbial community dynamics across habitat types under anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - As a representative indicator for the level and sustainability of urban development, urban vitality has been widely used to assess the quality of urban development. However, urban vitality is too blurry to be accurately quantified and is often limited to a particular type of expression of vitality. Current regression models often fail to accurately express the spatial heterogeneity of vibrancy and drivers. Therefore, this paper took Nanjing as the study area and quantified the social, cultural, and economic vitality indicators based on mobile phone data, POI data, and night-light remote sensing data. We also mapped the spatial distribution of comprehensive urban vitality using an improved entropy method and analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of urban vitality and its influencing factors using a plot boundary-based neural network weighted regression (PBNNWR). The results show: (1) The comprehensive vitality in Nanjing is distributed in a "three-center" pattern with one large and two small centers; (2) PBNNWR can be used to investigate the local regression relationships among the driving factors and urban vitality, and the fitting accuracy (95.6%) of comprehensive vitality in weekdays is higher than that of ordinary least squares regression (OLS) (65.9%), geographically weighted regression (GWR) (89.9%), and geographic neural network weighted regression (GNNWR) (89.5%) models; (3) House price, functional diversity, building density, metro station accessibility, and residential facility density are factors that significantly affect urban vitality. The study's findings can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the urban spatial layout, resource allocation, and targeted planning strategies for areas with different vitality values.

AB  - The Chinese Plan has provided an important model for the global fight against COVID-19 since its outbreak. The present study describes the structural characteristics of China's COVID-19 patent cooperation network at the province, city, and applicant levels by using social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent database since 2020, which helps to clarify the current technology accumulation in this field in China, and provide patent information support for the scientific efforts to fight against COVID-19. The findings are as follows: First, the inter-regional cooperation level in China's COVID-19 patent cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to central to western regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation level, kinship-based cooperation is the strongest, business-based cooperation has the widest scope, while proximity-based cooperation exists throughout these two main models of cooperation. Second, coastal provinces and cities occupy a core position in the network, and play an important role in utilizing structural holes and bridging. Patent applicants with high centrality are mostly firms. Research institutes and universities mainly play the role of bridges. Third and lastly, there is no large number of cliques at the province and city levels. However, there is a tendency for cliques to develop at the applicant level. Hence, actions are needed to prevent the development of information barriers.

AB  - Globally with the human population increase, urban expansion has increased, impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Visitation of fruiting trees by vertebrate frugivores can influence the persistence of fleshy fruited trees and so further maintain frugivore communities in transformed landscapes. Figs (Ficus spp.) have been recognised as keystone plant resources that support diverse frugivorous vertebrate communities. Our main objective was to identify the frugivorous vertebrates visiting fruiting Ficus trees in an urban mosaic landscape of Durban, Ethekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using camera traps focused on focal fig trees. We quantified the diurnal and nocturnal frugivore visitation rates and levels of interactions. We analysed frugivore visits to 12 individual trees of five Ficus species between 2019 and 2020. During 3888 h, we recorded a total of 4,071 videos from camera traps with 10,016 visits and levels of interactions of three main vertebrate taxa (8958 fruit bat visits, 808 bird visits and 250 monkey visits). These were in five Ficus species (F. buriei, F. lutea, F. natalensis, F. sur and F. sycomorus). Of the bird species visiting, we identified a total of 34 species, but some species were unidentified. We recorded a total of 8958 visits by Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bats Epomophorus wahlbergi, and 250 visits by vervet monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus. The latter tended to stay for prolonged periods in the trees feeding. Our data showed the importance of fruiting fig trees for vertebrate frugivores in the urban mosaic landscape. This highlights the conservation implications of figs as keystone resources in the urban mosaic landscape. Our findings support the planting and conservation of native Ficus tree species in transformed urban mosaic landscapes for the persistence of forest species biodiversity.

AB  - Structural response recovery and prediction technologies are required for long-term structural health monitoring (SHM). In this study, a structural response prediction method was proposed to evaluate the long-term safety of structures in which SHM system failure occurred by constructing a safety network of buildings in a given region. In this method, the correlation is defined by machine learning between the dynamic structural response of nearby buildings that are under the same load effects. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network was introduced in which the structural response correlation between two nearby buildings in a region is defined as a safety network. The safety network can be individually applied to multiple buildings, resulting in multiple networks that can be expanded to construct an urban safety network. To examine the applicability of the proposed technique, a safety network was constructed between two nearby buildings to predict the structural response of the target building.

AB  - Evaluating the influences of LUCC (Land Use/Land Cover Change) on landscape pattern is significant for understanding and improving ecological environment system management. This study used landscape pattern as an important indicator to estimate the impacts of the LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin from 2001 to 2019. Based on the remote sensing images of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) in the Yangtze River Basin in 2001-2019, the dynamic attitude and transfer matrix of LULC, and landscape pattern indices were employed to analyze the LUCC and the impact of LULC on the landscape pattern of the Yangtze River Basin. The results of LUCC show that the main LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2019 is mainly manifested by the increase of water body, forest, wetland, crop/natural vegetation mosaic (NVM) and urban, among which the forest increased the most by 62,635 km2. The areas of grassland and cropland are decreasing, with the grassland decreasing the most. Forest, crop/NVM and cropland are transformed into grassland, which complements the lack of grassland to some extent. LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin is most intense between grassland and forest. Landscape pattern shows: Grassland occupies an important advantage in the whole landscape structure. Forest, grassland and urban landscapes are seriously fragmented, and their LSI (Landscape Shape Index) is more complex than others. The connectivity between various landscape types is weakened, and the degree of landscape fragmentation is increased, but the LULC structure is becoming more and more abundant. The areas with high landscape fragmentation value have richer landscape diversity and diverse LULC types. There is a strong correlation between grassland and the four landscape pattern indices. The change of landscape pattern in the Yangtze River Basin is influenced by natural factors and LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin, and the change caused by human activities is the main driving factor of LUCC.

AB  - The ecological security pattern (ESP) focuses on key ecological elements in ecosystems by identifying, combining, and evaluating these elements. This study attempts to identify the ESP of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and provide suggestions for optimization. Ecosystem services were calculated and applied to construct the ecological resistance surface; morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity analysis were used to identify ecological sources; and minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model was applied to extract ecological corridors and ecological nodes. The results show that during 1995 to 2015, the main landscape transformation occurred between forest, cropland, and urban land, and the location of the transformation was mainly in the central part of the study area. Regarding the ESP, the average resistance value increased from 0.30 to 0.33; the area of ecological sources decreased by 5.12%; the ratio of total cumulative resistance to the length of the corridors increased by 14.82%; and the number of ecological nodes increased from 71 to 99. For the ESP optimization, based on the correction of the resistance surface, 1348 km blue corridors and 61 blue nodes were extracted. Based on hot spot analysis, nine stepping stones were identified. This optimization compensates for the lack of ecological elements in the center of the study area, enhances weaker corridors, and improves the connectivity of the ESP, thus making the ESP more stable and complete. The ESP constructed and optimized in this paper holds great significance and serves as a valuable reference for ecological protection and environmental management.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused drastic changes in urban ecosystems, resulting in various urgent management needs from mitigating biodiversity loss to preventing human-wildlife conflicts. Using species distribution modeling to understand urban species??? distributional patterns and predict their future changes is thus important to support decision-making. Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) that previously inhabited Shanghai had been extirpated from the metropolitan area but recently returned to and expanded in almost all districts, causing hundreds of human-raccoon dog conflicts. In this study, we initiated a citizen science project, identified factors associated with raccoon dog habitat selection, and predicted its current suitable habitat as well as potential future ranges under different city development scenarios. By constructing an ensemble modeling using data from camera trap surveys, interviews and rescuing records, we found that raccoon dog distribution was positively associated with several anthropogenic factors including nighttime light, human population, and percentage area of buildings. We predicted a 156,024 ha suitable habitat for raccoon dogs throughout Shanghai, among which only 5,811 ha (3.72 %) was currently occupied. Our results indicated considerable potential of raccoon dogs??? future expansion, which had been consistently ignored in previous management plans. To alleviate the increasing human-raccoon dog conflicts, we found strategies to slow down raccoon dog movement effective tools, and suggest adaptive management to provide fast response and flexible solutions. This is the first study to investigate human-wildlife conflict in China???s urban environment, and our approach has substantial implications for Shanghai as well as other regions where urban species are undergoing rapid expansion.

AB  - In bygone days, the way to deal with traditional villages in developing new cities in China was often to overturn them and replace the original environment with the built-up urban environment, causing constructive destruction to the traditions and cultures. According to the new village transformation requirements, the planning and construction of villages must be shaped with their own cultural and humanistic characteristics of the habitat requirements. It does not favor demolishing large constructions by implementing a different environment. A traditional village is an essential spatial framework to retain the "mark" of the local characteristics of the new city. It can be an essential element in shaping the individual characteristics of the village by realizing the diversity of spatial forms and regional cultural connotations of the new village. Therefore, this paper proposes a new village transformation model based on traditional villages' social, economic, and spatial patterns, combined with a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm named multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The model transforms the village based on the required optimum resource allocation with the global solution. The experiment shows that the proposed model suits village renovation and modernization. The work is a step toward the advancements and betterment of rural development.

AB  - Invertebrates comprise the most diversified animal group on Earth. Due to their long evolutionary history and small size, invertebrates occupy a remarkable range of ecological niches, and play an important role as "ecosystem engineers" by structuring networks of mutualistic and antagonistic ecological interactions in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Urban forests provide critical ecosystem services to humans, and, as in other systems, invertebrates are central to structuring and maintaining the functioning of urban forests. Identifying the role of invertebrates in urban forests can help elucidate their importance to practitioners and the public, not only to preserve biodiversity in urban environments, but also to make the public aware of their functional importance in maintaining healthy greenspaces. In this review, we examine the multiple functional roles that invertebrates play in urban forests that contribute to ecosystem service provisioning, including pollination, predation, herbivory, seed and microorganism dispersal and organic matter decomposition, but also those that lead to disservices, primarily from a public health perspective, e.g., transmission of invertebrate-borne diseases. We then identify a number of ecological filters that structure urban forest invertebrate communities, such as changes in habitat structure, increased landscape imperviousness, microclimatic changes and pollution. We also discuss the complexity of ways that forest invertebrates respond to urbanisation, including acclimation, local extinction and evolution. Finally, we present management recommendations to support and conserve viable and diverse urban forest invertebrate populations into the future.

AB  - This study aimed to explore why urban exodus occurred in Tokyo during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using panel-level data from 203 municipalities, we estimated the impact of epidemic, medical, economic, and industrial factors on the movement of people across cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area during the pandemic. We found that fear of infection was one of the main factors driving the urban exodus in Tokyo and that people chose to live in reasonably priced habitable areas during the pandemic. We also found that the population increased when the municipality had an essential sector in which remote work was difficult but decreased when it had an industry in which remote work was relatively feasible. However, medical factors had contrasting effects on out-migration and in-migration in each municipality. Increases in hospitals and medical doctors may not have increased the attractiveness of the city because of the malfunctioning of the healthcare system during the pandemic.

AB  - This article investigates why popular support for neighborhood schools does not translate into stronger multi-racial and multi-class coalitions for neighborhood schools in the face of school choice systems and school closures. Using a critical place perspective, this article illustrates how place-based urban inequities facilitate fragmented resistances to school choice. Racialized dispossession, the post-Civil Rights abandonment of poor and working-class Black political interests, and a broader strategy to bring affluent populations to the city core are all hallmarks of neoliberal urban development. These contexts shape and fatigue small-scale, ephemeral, and fragmented movements for neighborhood schools, inhibiting the formation of movement coalitions.

AB  - Cities are patchworks of urban catchments divided into functional units according to their commercial, residential and industrial activities, and socio-urbanistic patterns. The hypothesis of city surface microbiomes being structured by socio-urbanistic variables leading to an emergence of synurbic taxa was tested. According to the r/K microbial ecology theory, a gradient of well-adapted synurbic K-strategists and of opportunistic -r-strategists should occur over city surfaces. K-strategists would be core components while runes would be transiently detected. To resolve these patterns, sub-catchments (n = 21) of an area of high commercial and industrial activities were investigated over three time periods covering one year. The sub-catchments land use patterns and associated human behaviors were converted into socio-urbanistic variables and groupings. Bacterial cells mobilized by runoffs per sub-catchment were recovered, and analyzed by classical approaches, microbial source tracking DNA assays and DNA meta-barcoding approaches. Relationships between these datasets, the runoff physico-chemical properties, and descriptors of the socio-urbanistic groupings were investigated. 16S rRNA meta-barcoding analyses showed evidence of the occurrence of K- and r-like strategists. Twenty-eight core genera were identified, and correlation networks revealed large bacterial modules organized around actinobacterial taxa involved in hydrocarbon degradation processes. Other bacterial networks were related to the occurrences of hygienic wastes, and involved bacteria originating 1min fecal contaminations. Several r-strategists like Sulfurospirillum were recorded and found associated to point source pollutions. The tpm-metabarcoding approach deciphered these r / K strategists at the species level among more than ten genera. Nine core K-like Pseudomomas species were identified. The P. aeruginosa human opportunistic pathogen and P. syringae phytopathogens were part of these K-strategists. Other tpm-harboring bacterial pathogens showed r-like opportunistic distribution patterns. Correlation network analyses indicated a strong incidence of hygienic wastes and hydrocarbon-pollutions on tpm-harboring bacteria. These analyses demonstrated the occurrence of core synurbic bacterial K-strategists over city surfaces.

AB  - Factors affecting the choice of breeding and non-breeding grounds in migratory birds are important in order to understand the mechanism determining their distribution areas and climate adaptations. The rook, Corvus frugilegus (Passeriformes: Corvidae), predominantly resides in Europe but exhibits migratory habits in the eastern Palearctic region. East Asian populations of rook migrate from breeding grounds in the Eurasian continent around the Amur river basin to wintering grounds in central and south China, the Korean peninsula, and Japan. In Japan, the wintering grounds of C. frugilegus have been gradually expanding since the 1980s. In addition, rook populations that have previously roosted in secondary forests have recently moved to urban areas in several cities, resulting in urban fecal pollution. To clarify the wintering ecology of rooks roosting in urban areas in northern Kyushu, we surveyed seasonal trends in abundance, daily behavior, and dietary habit of rooks in two cities, Saga and Kumamoto. Wintering rooks gradually increased from November to December and decreased from January to March. In the daytime, the rooks foraged at croplands at mean distances of 6.3 and 9.7 km from the roosts, in groups averaging approximately 150 and 90 individuals in Saga and Kumamoto, respectively. Examinations of regurgitation pellets and stomach contents revealed the rooks fed mainly on spilled rice grains, supplemented with wheat and barley grains, Toxicodendron succedaneum and Triadica sebifera fruits, insects (beetles), and the apple snail. The rooks formed communal roosts with carrion crows and large-billed crows in both cities by joining their autumn communal roosts.

AB  - The phylogeographic structure of Cricetus cricetus is described across the whole range of the species for the first time. The modern phylogenetic structure was formed 70-45 kyr BP. The most favorable conditions for the species are those of interglacial periods rather than of the periods of glaciations. Earlier an opposite hypothesis was suggested. Thus, the present period is generally favorable for the species' existence. The observed decrease in its abundance and fragmentation of its range in natural habitats are clear evidence of the leading role of anthropogenic factors in this process.

AB  - Establishing a sustainable landscape pattern to cope with worsening ecological problems is an internationally recognized practice. However, previous studies have not considered the joint supply equilibrium of ecosystem services (ESs) and coupling with social systems. In this study, we propose an ecological security pattern framework composed of multi-level ecological elements, based on ESs, human impacts, and improved connec-tivity. The ordered weighted averaging decision model was used to analyze the four types of ESs specified by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and extract core patches. Based on potential corridors extracted by the minimum cumulative resistance model, ecological corridors were further classified by improved connectivity analysis coupled with the human modification index. The approach was tested using data from Dalian, Liaoning Province, China. The results show that the most service capabilities declined to varying degrees over the past 10 years. Forests, arable land, and grasslands had relatively high levels of comprehensive ecological services. Regulating services showed a significant decline in three or more land types. The principle of landscape ecology promotes the establishment of a buffer zone. In Dalian, the areas of the ecological core patch and buffer zone were 2,167.88 and 5,377.38 km(2), respectively. The three levels of potential ecological corridors totaled 1079.78 km. The ecological elements and ESs assessment results obtained using the proposed method provide spatial guidance for ecological management, thereby ensuring the sustainable development of large cities.

AB  - Human developments have detrimental effects on wildlife populations globally with carnivores being particularly sensitive. The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is often considered an adaptable mesocarnivore that occurs throughout varied landcover types within its wide distribution and may be less susceptible to the negative effects of development. Our objectives were to investigate the landscape occupancy dynamics of bobcats in a highly developed and densely populated region of the northeastern United States to evaluate the sensitivity of bobcat occurrence to natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We established a large-scale camera trapping survey throughout Rhode Island, USA, sampling from 2018 to 2020. Using dynamic occupancy models, we found initial site occupancy was positively influenced by the amount of forested wetland habitat, while increasing road density and shrub cover negatively influenced the probability of site colonization. Surprisingly, we found no hypothesized variables to influence site-level extirpation probability, or any seasonal effects on dynamic parameters. Lastly, we found that forest cover and road density negatively influenced the probability of detection. The probability of occupancy was high, >0.8, throughout much of the study area (49%), but we also found relatively high site transients, with the probability a site would change occurrence status from season to season at approximate to 0.27 in the majority of the study area (70%). Our results show that although bobcats can persist in human-dominated landscapes, they require contiguous natural areas to do so. Future expansion of road infrastructure may reduce habitat connectivity and increase road mortalities, thus jeopardizing the population.

AB  - We describe the first dense real-time urban seismic-accelerometric network in Italy, named OSU-CT, located in the historic center of Catania. The city lies in the region with the greatest danger, vulnerability, and earthquake exposure in the entire Italian territory. OSU-CT was planned and realized within the project called EWAS "an Early WArning System for cultural heritage", aimed at the rapid assessment of earthquake-induced damage and the testing of an on-site earthquake early warning system. OSU-CT is mainly based on low-cost instrumentation realized ad hoc by using cutting-edge technologies and digital MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) triaxial accelerometers with excellent resolution and low noise. Twenty of the forty scheduled stations have already been set up on the ground floor of significant historic public buildings. In order to assess the performance of an earthquake early warning (EEW) on-site system, we also installed wide-band velocimeters (ETL3D/5s) in three edifices chosen as test sites, which will be instrumented for a structural health monitoring (SHM). In addition to several laboratory and field validation tests on the developed instruments, an effective operational test of OSU-CT was the M-w 4.3 earthquake occurring on 23 December 2021, 16 km west, south-west of Catania. Peak ground accelerations (4.956 gal to 39.360 gal) recorded by the network allowed obtaining a first urban shakemap and determining a reliable distribution of ground motion in the historical center of the city, useful for the vulnerability studies of the historical edifices.

AB  - In this article, the authors experiment with data-ing as a methodology, and wonder how three researchers-two in Oslo (Norway) and one in Melbourne (Australia)-can come closer to-with the research material by following and buggy-walking a young wayfarer in urban spaces and places. The ideas of not knowing and experimenting, making-with urban landscapes, transportation, materials, sounds, surfaces, bodily movements, minor gestures, and haptic engagement, transform their thinking about data-ing as research-creation while traveling and walking the city with a buggy and a young way-farer's adventure. Their experimental method uses smartphones and digital technology, and the methodological contours in this article are attuned to and engage in and with multiple surfaces of an urban city landscape. Lines and threads transform into traces and create surfaces, and lines transforming into threads dissolve surfaces. The authors create city maps and investigate what digital tools, social media, and a chat service can generate and unfold when wayfaring locally and talking and writing across continents. Their project follows two layers-doing data-ing as research-creation and wayfaring. To do data-ing as collective open-ended productions among researchers invites one to ask what happened and what might occur temporally in cities as minor gestures here and there. The bodily movement offered by an urban wayfarer invites the authors to speculate with what the phenomenon of an investigator, an artist, a maker, a runner, or an activist can unfold in the moments to come.

AB  - Introduction: Seed removal by ants is an interaction that may greatly affect the dynamic and structure of the vegetation. This aspect is well known for granivorous ants; however, there is little information on the effect of omnivorous ants. Objective: To assess the potential impact of the omnivorous ant Dorymyrmex insanus on vegetation. Methods: In the Pedregal Reserve, Mexico City, we identified the items in the refuse piles of ten ant colonies, for one year, covering the rainy and dry seasons. For each season we calculated seed diversity and analyzed the possible relationship between seed size and their abundance in the refuse piles, with regression models. We also did germination tests with seeds of Tagetes micrantha, comparing seeds from piles and from plants. Results: D. insanus removed seeds of 19 plant species as well as plant remains (such as leaves, twigs, roots), and remains of insects. Seed diversity was higher in the rainy season but the greatest abundance was in the dry season. When analyzing the relationship between seed length and abundance in the refuse piles, we found that the ants preferred seeds of around 10 mm. We also found that more seeds of T. micrantha germinated when they were previously handled by ants. Conclusions: The ant D. insanus actively participates in the removal of seeds from several species, favoring germination, and seasonality affects the selectivity of resources.

AB  - Stormwater management ponds, which are constructed to retain excess runoff and pollutants from traffic, play an important role in the freshwater biodiversity in highly modified areas. However, their roles in agricultural and semi natural landscapes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we used Odonata as a bioindicator to compare a set of highway stormwater ponds and surrounding ponds within an agricultural and semi-natural landscape to examine the extent to which stormwater ponds act as biodiversity refuges. We analyzed the differences in environmental parameters and the richness, compositions, and conservation values of the odonate communities of stormwater and surrounding ponds. We also examined the factors controlling the differences in the communities of both pond types. The stormwater ponds were smaller, less eutrophicated, less shaded by trees, less stocked with fish, and less connected with other waterbodies than the surrounding ponds. However, they had a higher plant diversity and pH values and were more densely overgrown with vegetation. Compared with surrounding ponds, stormwater ponds had a higher Odonata richness and beta-diversity, but their taxonomic distinctness was significantly lower. Therefore, stormwater ponds hosted more variable communities but their assemblages were taxonomically similar. Indicator species were only identified in stormwater ponds. Furthermore, stormwater ponds harbored more species with higher conservation values. The most important factors affecting the differences between stormwater and surrounding ponds were the trophic state, relative tree shading, and fish stocking intensity. With their increase, the richness and rarity decreased. Our results highlight the potential of stormwater ponds to enhance the biodiversity outside urban areas by providing specific habitat conditions that are unique to the surrounding agricultural landscape. In addition, we suggest management practices that can be used to enhance their biodiversity conservation function.

AB  - The impact of ponds by urbanization has been widely discussed on the landscape scale. However, relatively few studies have explored the spatial differentiation of pond landscapes across urban-rural gradients in rapidly urbanising areas. In this study, we applied the DeepLabv3+ network to perform a semantic segmentation on Google Map images to extract ponds in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China; then we employed geographic information systems to analyse the ponds changes in 665 towns along an urban-rural gradient in the PRD. Results indicate that there are clear differences in landscapes between the urban core, urban, peri-urban, agricultural, and forested zone in terms of pond area and size. In total, 57.84% and 31.33% of the ponds are distributed in the peri-urban and agricultural zone, respectively; fewer ponds are present at either end of the urban-rural gradient. Owing to the legacy effects of historical land use and river systems, urban and peri-urban zone in the central and western parts of the PRD are still rich in ponds. We propose that management measures should be implemented according to the characteristics of different pond landscapes.

AB  - Exploring the impacts of landscape pattern on ecosystem services (ESs) and their trade-offs could provide a new way to improve ESs without largely altering land use types. Using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningixa (CBYN) as a case study, we quantified five critical ESs (one provision service of crop production, three regulating services of carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and sand fixation, and one cultural service of recreational opportunity) in 1989-2019 through CASA model, InVEST model and empirical equations. Then we calculated landscape pattern metrics at landscape and class level through Fragstats 4.3 across multiple scales and quantified their impacts on each ES and ES trade-offs through random forest analysis, self-organizing mapping analysis and multivariable regression tree. The results suggested that 3 km is more suitable for analyzing the impacts of landscape pattern on ESs in the CBYN. The nonlinear relations between landscape pattern metrics and each ES were fitted with adjusted R2 ranging from 0.26 to 0.51, indicating the significant but limited impacts of landscape pattern on ESs. Specially, landscape-level metrics of CONTAG, SHDI and FRACMN have higher impacts on ESs than class-level ones. Significant synergies existed among agricultural production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, except in mountain region with higher or lower fragmentation. Sand fixation has synergy relations with the former three ESs, which would be altered in situations with higher or lower diversity. Our results provide a new direction for land use management to achieve high-quality development without largely altering existing land use situation.

AB  - Animal species living in small populations with small ranges may be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. We investigated genetic population structure of the camas pocket gopher (Thomomys bul-bivorus), a species endemic to the Willamette Valley, Oregon, an area strongly affected by human development. Pocket gophers collected across much of the range of the species were analyzed for genetic structure, diversity, and influences of landscape on gene flow using microsatellite markers identified in closely related gopher species. We used k-means clustering to group individuals into genetically similar clusters based on their locations along principal component axes, and we evaluated the strength of evidence for this clustering using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). We used mixed-effects modeling to evaluate the influence of rivers and hills (represented by slopes) as explana-tory variables for pairwise individual genetic distances along principal component axes. Results supported a clinal, isola-tion-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance model, with greater genetic diversity near the central portion of the range. A model with both rivers and slopes was best supported, compared to either variable alone or a simple distance model. The Willamette River, which divides the range of the camas pocket gopher, appeared to have some restrictive effect on gene flow but was not a complete barrier. In population-level analyses, we observed strong genetic differentiation as well as persistent Wahlund effects, suggesting that complex genetic structure exists within a population connected across gradients of distance, rivers, and hills. The camas pocket gopher has persisted despite persecution as an agricul-tural pest and intensive habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, but the future may hold new conservation challenges as human population and urban development increase in the limited range of this endemic Oregon species.

AB  - Based on the DEM (digital elevation model) data and land use data from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of habitat quality in Hubei Province were evaluated by the InVEST model (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) and GIS (Geographic Information System) spatial analysis method, and the topographic gradient effect on habitat quality was analyzed by regression analysis and terrain index. The spatial distribution of habitat quality in Hubei Province was quite different, and the overall level was high. High-quality habitats were mainly located in hilly regions and water areas, while low-level habitats are mainly distributed in agricultural areas and urban areas. From 2000 to 2020, the high-level habitats in Hubei Province tended to degenerate to low-level habitats, and the average habitat quality decreased slightly. The habitat quality in most areas of Hubei Province had no obvious change from 2000 to 2020, and the overall spatial features were "rising in the southeast and decreasing in the middle". With the elevation of the terrain grade, the number of county-level units with high-level habitat quality increased gradually, and the average habitat quality increased accordingly. From 2000 to 2020, the habitat quality of the first-class terrain improved, while the habitat quality of the other class terrain showed a downward trend. The results are helpful to discover the spatiotemporal change process of habitat quality in Hubei Province, and provide theoretical support for biodiversity conservation and land use planning in Hubei Province.

AB  - Impervious surfaces (IPS) are the major source of urban heat island effect (UHI), and the relationships between IPS and land surface temperature (LST) have been widely studied. However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran's I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran's I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces.

AB  - Portraying functional urban areas provides useful insights for understanding complex urban systems and formulating rational urban plans. Mobile phone user trajectory data are often used to infer the individual activity patterns of people and for functional area identification, but they are difficult to obtain because of personal privacy issues and have the drawback of a sparse spatial and temporal distribution. Deep learning models have been widely utilized in functional area recognition but are limited by the difficulty of acquiring training samples with large data volumes. This paper aims to achieve a fast and automatic identification of large-scale urban functional areas without prior knowledge. This paper uses Nanjing city as a test area, and a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network model based on an improved dynamic time warping (Ndim-DTW) distance is used to automatically identify the function of each building using mobile phone aggregated data containing work and residence attributes. The results show that the recognition accuracy reaches 88.7%, which is 12.4% higher than that of the K-medoids method based on the DTW distance using a single attribute and 7.8% higher than that of the K-medoids method based on the Ndim-DTW distance with multiple attributes, confirming the effectiveness of the multi-attribute mobile phone aggregated data and the SOM model based on the Ndim-DTW distance. Furthermore, at the traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level, this paper detects that Nanjing has seven functional area hotspots with a high degree of mixing. The results can provide a data basis for urban studies on, for example, the urban spatial structure, the separation of occupations and residences, and environmental suitability evaluation.

AB  - Epi- and endozoochory are well explored phenomena that contribute to the distribution patterns of plant seeds, spores or fruits by vertebrates. It is less known how soil algae may be redistributed due to analogous interactions. We describe the participation of saprophage Rossiulus kessleri (Julidae, Diplopoda) in soil algae redistribution. The research was carried out in a park area of a large industrial megacity in the Dnipro steppe region (Ukrainian North Steppe subzone), Dnipro city. Research material was collected according to zoological and algological methods. The leaf litter of tree species (ash maple Acer negundo, Italian poplar Populus deltoides, locust Robinia pseudoacacia, European white elm Ulmus laevis, Norway maple Acer platanoides) and living diplopods were collected within 1 m(2) quadrats along transects. Millipedes were maintained without feeding for five days, after which they were fed with the litter collected previously. Identification of algoflora was conducted in washes from the surface of diplopods' bodies, its gut washes, in diplopods' excretions and leaf litter washes. In the leaf litter, as R. kessleri's feeding base, 14 soil algae species were identified-Nostoc punctiforme, Bracteacoccus minor, Mychonastes homosphaera, Neospongiococcum sp., Chlamydomonas sp., Chlorella vulgaris, Stichococcus bacillaris, Pseudococcomyxa simplex, Desmococcus olivaceus, Trebouxia spp., Klebsormidium flaccidum, Nephrodiella phaseolus, Navicula pelliculosa and Vischeria magna. In body surface washes, five soil algae species were identified, in gut washes seven algae species were found, while in excretions, just four were observed. It was established that not all algae species from the gut washes of R. kessleri were present in excretions. The presence of some representatives of soil algae, for example, Chlorella vulgaris and Vischeria magna, in natural park litter, body surface washes, gut washes and in excretions of R. kessleri, suggests that the given species pass through the diplopod's gut and stay undamaged. This indicates that soil saprophage R. kessleri contributes to the dispersal of some soil algae representatives through epi- and endozoochory. Our results represent novel contributions to the knowledge of zoochory. It was shown that animals can be involved in dispersal of not only plant parts but also entire organisms, although it is unknown at what scale diplopods contribute to the diversity and dispersal of algae.

AB  - The transportation system is often considered a critical infrastructure as the failure of its components can have a substantial impact on the economy and social well-being of a country. Extreme weather events such as urban flooding disrupt transportation networks with delays, diversions, and partial or full closure of roads and, thereby, influence human movement patterns. Most studies in the field of transportation network failure due to urban flooding are focused only on micro-scale, in-situ approaches rather than referring to the holistic impact on the entire transportation system. Moreover, such approaches are failed to address the changes in travel behaviour concerning their trip purpose, mode choice, and income which can be changed due to inundation. Hence, this study presents a novel approach to assess the entire transportation system failure due to urban flooding. Consequently, the impact of urban flooding on human movement patterns was assessed. The proposed framework is developed based on the network centrality measures, namely, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. The study is predominantly based on Open-Source GIS tools and the case study is carried out in Colombo, Sri Lanka which has the highest concentration of population and transportation network. The hotspots of the failure of the network were statistically and spatially illustrated. The study revealed three key findings; (a) the fragmented network due to inundated road segments triggers the spatial changes in the accessibility, particularly decreasing the accessibility in most of the core areas whereas increasing the accessibility in some peripheral areas which are not significant under the baseline condition (2) the functional changes of the entire transport network occurs due to flooding events (3) the considerable changes in the trip length occurs due to the disruption of transport network links and the impact is mostly notable in long-distance trips compared to short distance trips. The proposed framework can be utilized as a planning tool for both disaster practitioners and infrastructure operators in identifying the flood risk; and prioritizing flood mitigation investments, thereby, making the transportation system more robust to extreme flooding.

AB  - Open-cast coal mining in China has developed rapidly due to its obvious advantages over underground mining. However, it may have negative ecological effects, such as biodiversity loss, water shortage, and soil erosion. Identifying and protecting the key areas with high importance for ecological sustainability are great challenges. The construction of an ecological security pattern (ESP) can improve landscape connectivity and reduce the fragmentation of ecological patches. Thus, it can be seen as an effective measure to protect regional ecological sustainability. In this study, taking the Pingshuo open-cast mining area as a case study area, ecological sources are identified through ecosystem structure and function, and corridors are extracted by constructing an ecological resistance surface, thus forming a valid ecological network. The results show that in 2018, the ESP in the study area included 11 sources with an area of 147.74 km(2) and 17 corridors with a length of 92.11 km. Specifically, the ecological sources are mainly distributed in Taocun Township, Jingping Township, and Xiangyangbao Township. Among these 11 sources, sources 7 and 8 are reclaimed waste dump land, meaning that the land reclamation work in Pingshuo greatly promotes connectivity. Furthermore, dump 1 can be restored in the future by constructing three new corridors, which will greatly improve the landscape connectivity of Yuling Township. Overall, this study not only provides an effective framework for constructing and optimizing ESPs in ecologically fragile coal mining areas, but it also adds new insights to the concept of land reclamation in these areas.

AB  - Refueling performance is the primary currency of a successful migration as birds must maintain energy stores to achieve an optimal travel schedule. Migrating birds can anticipate heightened energy demand, not to mention increased uncertainty that energy demands will be satisfied, especially within an urbanizing landscape following long-distance flights. We tested the expectation that refueling performance of songbirds is reduced as densities increase at stopover sites in an urbanizing coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. We measured the density of migrating birds, their refueling performance, and arthropod abundance in two large tracts of contiguous forest paired with two small isolated patches embedded within residential settings throughout spring migration over the course of 2 years. Refueling performance declined with increasing migrant densities, even though the overall daily densities of birds stopping in these landscapes were relatively low and arthropod densities were low throughout. Habitat patch size alone did not account for differences in refueling performance, but smaller habitat patches more often concentrated migrants in higher densities where they experienced reduced refueling performance. We found support for density-dependent refueling performance during spring migration through a region where overall passage and stopover densities are low; suggesting that larger contiguous forest tracks within urban landscapes provide higher quality habitat for refueling and that effect is likely even more pronounced in landscapes within higher density migratory corridors. The nutritional challenges encountered during migration influence the overall pace of migration and changes in access to food resources due to increasing urbanization may ultimately impact optimal travel schedules.

AB  - Urban forest parks play a crucial role in contributing to the urban environment, residential well-being, and social welfare. Visitors' perception of multi-sensory interactive experiences in urban forest parks is an important source of information for landscape planning. Whilst data elicited from visitors via questionnaires are temporally and spatially restricted, online media provide a public platform for the direct and comprehensive expression of park experiences beyond such restrictions. To look into visitors' multi-sensory interactive experiences in an urban forest park in China, a total of 7447 reviews of such were collected from four authoritative online platforms using Python, and the ROSTCM tool was used to generate semantic and social networks out of the data set. The results showed that urban forest park visitors' sensory experiences are dominated by visual and olfactory perceptions, followed by audio-visual and visual-tactile interactions. Among them, visual perception displays the highest degree of specificity and diversity, while tactile and gustatory perceptions are relatively infrequent and singular. The landscapes that affect visitors' perceptual preferences mainly include floriculture, green vegetation, soundscapes, and sanitation utilities. Moreover, both the fresh air and the agreeable environment have a significant positive impact on visitors' perceptions. The above findings not only have practical implications for the landscape planning and design of urban forest parks, but also provide theoretical insights into the evaluation of natural landscapes in urban forest parks from the perspective of tourists' multi-sensory experiences.

AB  - Urbanization may significantly alter the abundance, composition and phenology of natural communities of plants and pollinators. However, how such alterations eventually affect the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks is still poorly known. Here, we investigate how the structure of plant-pollinator networks changes along an urbanization gradient, which coincides with a phenological mismatch between plants and pollinators. We examined changes in plant-pollinator network structure in 12 sites sown with standardized native flower mixes along an urbanization gradient in a metropolis in Northern France. We used network-level metrics in combination with more detailed methodologies to identify changes in network structure, species clustering, and species roles through urban clas-ses and time. We also evaluated the temporal trajectories of alpha- and beta-diversity of species and interactions along the gradient. Network-level metrics showed limited spatial-temporal variability in the connectance, distribution of interactions and network-level specialization. Finer-scale analyses showed that generalist plant and pollinator species with long phenology were the most central and played key roles in defining the composition of cohesive groups of interacting species in all networks. Network motifs and species positions showed higher temporal variability in less urbanized areas, and interactions were more dissimilar between ur-banization classes earlier in the season. We showed evidence of alterations in plant-pollinator network structure across space and time along an urbanization gradient, likely driven by the significant advancement in flowering phenology observed in the more urbanized areas. Our results emphasize the importance of targeted measures to maintain functional plant-pollinator communities, especially early in the season in highly urbanized areas.

AB  - Over approximately 100 years, the Australian capital, Canberra, has evolved in association with the predominant values, vision and cultural relationships of people to the area. The location and design of the city derived from a formal intention to integrate nature and culture for the benefit and edification of residents and in symbolisation of the city's importance as the seat of national decision-making and legislature. Established on a native grassland surrounded by wooded hills and ridges, and with nearby confluences of rivers as security of water supply, the city's landscape was transformed through centralised planning and implementation of Garden City and City Beautiful constructs to become one of the world's most liveable regions. Twentieth-century expansion of the city's suburbs, tree streetscapes and gardens progressed with varying emphasis on exotic versus native species, and contemporary programs aim to increase urban tree canopy cover to 30%. Yet, there is increasing acknowledgement of the landscape's rich history of culture-nature interactions extending back at least 25,000 years. Indicators are evident in human modification of tree-dominated ecosystems, the overlapping ways in which people related to elemental landscape features, and a continuity of valuing particular sites for ceremonies, social activities and human movement. With projected steady population growth, climate change, and associated impacts on the environment and natural resources, contemporary planning must be innovative and integrative to ensure ecologically sustainable development. Strong visionary leadership is needed to develop a landscape policy that encompasses key natural assets including threatened woodlands and mature native trees for their intrinsic values and as habitat for threatened fauna, cultural landscape values such as forested montane and ridge areas, and heritage and protected trees. From pre-European to current times, planning, modification and management of environmental and ecosystem values has been integral to enabling local people to sustain themselves. The next challenge is to create clarity about the future of this cultural landscape and enhance the community's attachment to and stewardship of the city and its landscape.

AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and four-channel red, green, blue, and near-infrared (RGBI) remote sensed imageries allow an accurate quantification and contiguous measurement of vegetation characteristics and forest structures. This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation charac-teristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape. Indeed, habitat improvement for PW in the study area could be achieved by conserving riparian corridors and promoting riparian forest succession along major rivers in Hamilton County.

AB  - Traditional information fusion model has the problem of low efficiency in urban landscape design. In addition, using the current method to design urban commercial landscape public facilities, there are problems of large regional space occupation and unsatisfactory design effect. This paper designs a new modular information fusion model for urban landscape design process in view of genetic back propagation. On the basis of preprocessing sensor images, a digital elevation model is created using an ordered numerical sequence. Then, the stereo orthophoto image pair is obtained through the artificial parallax assistance mechanism, and the 3D garden landscape is generated by combining with the ant colony algorithm. The positive feedback mechanism of the ant colony algorithm is used to make the processing process converge continuously, and the optimal 3D garden landscape is finally generated by obtaining stereo orthophoto pairs through the artificial parallax-assisted mechanism. At the same time, the strong robustness and fault tolerance of neural network and parallel processing mechanism are utilized for fast information fusion. The scale and resources of garden design are described by the process dimension and the context dimension, and a modular garden landscape with distinct main body is built. Finally, the initial weight is optimized in the genetic real number coding algorithm, and the appropriate learning factor is selected to train the neural network so as to make the information fusion task. Experimental results show that the above model fusion process has good stability and low energy consumption for information fusion, which can promote the efficient construction of garden landscapes.

AB  - The evaluation of habitat quality and its genesis is of great significance to ecological protection of the watershed. Based on land use data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and road network data and population data, the Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model and InVEST model were used to analyzed the land use change in the Wanhe Watershed, predicting the land use in 2025. Based on this, the degree of the habitat degradation and habitat quality in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025 were predicted and analyzed, and combined with the particularity of the terrain in the study area, the topography was introduced. Landform relief gradient was used to discuss the relationship between habitat quality and topographic factors in the Wanhe Watershed, and to reveal the distribution law. The result shows that from 2000 to 2025, farmland and forestland are the main land use types in the study area, and the main change is due to the expansion of the construction land, whereby the area increased by 62.86 km(2), with an increase of 34.41%, mainly from farmland and forestland. From 2000 to 2020, mainly due to the expansion in urban land and the reduction in forestland, the habitat degradation tends to be serious, and the habitat quality generally shows a downward trend, with areas with low habitat quality having had the largest increase from 452.67 km(2) in 2000 to 526.15 km(2) in 2025. The topography of the study area affects the distribution of natural landscapes and the intensity of human activities, resulting in significant differences in the landscape pattern of habitat degradation and habitat quality. The western mountains are relatively better. After 2020, due to the implementation of environmental protection policies, the habitat quality has tended to improve. This study can promote the adjustment of land use planning policies in the study area, maintain the biodiversity in the watershed, and realize the coordinated development of environmental benefits and social and economic development. The research results have theoretical significance and practical value for ecological environmental protection and land use layout in Wanhe Watershed.

AB  - Objectives: To analyze the mitochondrial diversity in three admixed populations and evaluate the historical migration effect of native southern population movement to Santiago (capital of Chile). The intensity of migration was quantified using three mitochondrial lineages restricted to South-Central native groups.
   Methods: D-loop sequences were genotyped in 550 unrelated individuals from San Felipe-Los Andes (n = 108), Santiago (n = 217), and Concepcion (n = 225). Sequence processing, alignment, and haplogroup inference were carried out, and different genetic structure analyses were performed for haplogroup frequencies and D-loop sequences.
   Results: The Native lineages B2i2, C1b13, and D1g were the most frequent haplogroups, especially in Santiago (71.8%). Despite the distance, this city showed a high-genetic affinity with southern populations, including Concepcion (similar to 500 km distant) and native groups, rather than with those from San Felipe-Los Andes (<100 km distant). In fact, there was a negative correlation between geographical and genetic distance among these cities (r corr = -0.5593, p value = 0.8387). Network analysis revealed shared haplotypes between Santiago, Concepcion, and other southern populations. Finally, we found lineages from Concepcion acting as ancestral nodes in the northern clade.
   Conclusions: Considering the geographic distances from these cities, the results were not consistent with a model of genetic isolation by geographic distance, revealing the effects of a historical migration process from the south to the capital. We also show evidence of possible north-to-south migration during admixture onset in Concepcion and in addition, we were able to identify previously unreported mitochondrial diversity in urban populations that became lost in Native groups post-European contact.

AB  - Rapid developments associated with large-scale transport infrastructure have exacerbated ecological risks, posing major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Construction of ecological security patterns (ESPs) can effectively mitigate this threat, but existing construction of ESPs lacks consideration of the risk to landscape connectivity and resilience, as well as zoning optimization at a finer resolution. This study focused on the region along the China-Laos Railway to evaluate the landscape ecological risk (LER) based on the potential -connectedness-resilience framework and extracted ESP elements according to the LER evaluation. Clustering of LER and ecological quality index was introduced to facilitate more targeted management of ESP. We found that the regional LER was most likely elevated because the proportion of LER at the medium level and above was close to 50 %. Moreover, the segmentation and penetration of high-risk areas into low-risk areas was prominent. The distribution of low LER areas was notably shaped by regional resilience, while road expansion would create many medium and higher risk areas, and the development of industrial parks would generate high risks in urban peripheries. 2,615.88 km of ecological corridors enabled the 17,362.08 km2 ecological sources to be effectively connected. 33 ecological nodes and 115 stepping stones were extracted as valid complements to key areas of weak connectivity. Priority treatment of specific sources (4.88 %) and ecological corridors (29.93 %) enhances the resilience of ESP. Our study provides a method for integrating the assessment of ecological risks arising from future regional development with the construction and optimization of ESPs, which can be promoted in ecological conservation planning in developing countries driven by infrastructure and industrial parks.

AB  - The urban greenway has been increasingly recognised as an important type of green infrastructure especially for land-scarce, densely-populated cities to efficiently provide their residents with continuous public spaces close to nature for recreation. Nevertheless, empirical studies on urban greenways and their recreational use rarely focus on high-density environment. Moreover, most research endeavours in this field are also largely confined to the subtropical climate, whereas much of the world's future urban growth is projected to occur in the form of high -density mega-cities in much of tropical South and Southeast Asia. In view of these gaps, this study proposes a new approach that employs Computer Vision tools to examine the effects of the greenway's physical environment on recreational activities, taking tropical Singapore as the test bed. The semantic segmentation model, PSPNet and the action detection model, ACAM are adapted and applied in conjunction with geographical information system tools to measure the greenway's physical environment and people's recreational activity at the human scale, and analyse their relationships. The result reveals a pattern that sees the clustering of different types of recreational activities at different time periods. It also reveals the relationships between recreational activities and specific environmental features, which were observed to have influenced the overall spatial distributions of the recre-ational activities. The finding also corroborates the design strategies for Singapore's future urban greenways and offers a reference for engaging community groups to participate in the maintenance of urban greenways.

AB  - Riparian zones provide many ecosystem services and are a frequently found type of green area in urban ecosystems; these areas increase the aesthetic value of urban landscapes. The aim of this 17-year study was to assess the applicability of passive vegetation restoration of the gravel/sand bars that emerged after a devastating flood along the river in the city of Prague. The number of species and the sum of their coverages rapidly increased for the initial six years. After the twelfth year, the vegetation composition gradually began to stabilize. Species diversity increased for seven years after the beginning of the succession and then remained essentially unchanged. The diversity values were lower on finer substrates with higher proportions of dust and clay particles. The neophytes, i.e. species introduced after the year 1500, established with more successful on substrates with greater soil skeleton proportions. Finer substrates were preferred by graminoids; among them, the invasive Arrhenatherum elatius was the most abundant. The share of invasive species in the total vegetation cover initially fluctuated at approximately 40%; after eight years, it stabilized at approximately 10%. The proportion of naturalized alien species stabilized within the range of 20-30%. The results show that a new type of species-rich vegetation spontaneously emerged on gravel/sand bars. The vegetation consisted mainly of native and naturalized non-invasive alien species. However, attention needs to be given to potential alien plant invasions.

AB  - Environmental degradation, over the years, has drastically changed landscapes in the Amazon. At the same time, discussion, knowledge, and actions on the conservation of forest remnants and restoration of degraded environments have increased worldwide. The present study, carried out in Paragominas (Brazilian Amazon), aimed: (1) to evaluate the process of landscape change over the last 36 years (1984-2020); (2) to identify degraded environments within legally established permanent preservation areas (PPAs); and (3) to map environmental liabilities in degraded rural properties which, according to environmental regulations, must be recovered. The priority areas for restoration were defined considering (a) the environmental liabilities of each rural property; (b) the remnant forest in each rural property; (c) the rural properties' boundaries; and (d) the degraded PPAs in each rural property. Deforestation followed by land use change in Paragominas' territory increased from 12% (2336 km(2)) in 1984-45% (8783 km(2)) in 2020. The municipality presented 4416 km of rivers and c.a 6157 springs under pressure (i.e. agriculture, pasture, urban areas and deforested areas). The environmental liabilities identified summed 638.85 km(2), which, according to environmental regulations, must be recovered. It is important to consider that when producers protect PPAs in their properties, they also conserve soil and water resources as well as contribute to biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - Global change, including urbanisation, threatens many of the >1400 bat species. Nevertheless, certain areas within highly urbanised cities may be suitable to harbour bat populations. Thus, managing urban habitats could contribute to bat conservation. Here, we wanted to establish evidence-based recommendations on how to improve urban spaces for the protection of bats. In a team effort with >200 citizen scientists, we recorded bat vocalisations up to six times over the course of 2 years at each of 600 predefined sites in the Berlin metropolitan area. For each species we identified the preferred and non-preferred landscape features. Our results show that artificial light at night (ALAN) had a negative impact on all species. For soprano pipistrelles and mouse-eared bats ALAN had the largest effect sizes among all environmental predictors. Canopy cover and open water were especially important for bat species that forage along vegetation edges and for trawling bats, respectively. Occurrence probability of species foraging in open space decreased with increasing distance to water bodies. On a larger scale, impervious surfaces tended to have positive effects on some species that are specialised on foraging along edge structures. Our study constitutes an important contribution to the growing body of literature showing that despite the many negative impacts of urbanisation on wildlife, urban environments can harbour bat populations if certain conditions are met, such as access to vegetation and water bodies and low levels of ALAN. Our findings are of high relevance for urban planners and conservationists, as they allow inferences on how to manage urban spaces in a bat-friendly way. We recommend limiting ALAN to the minimum necessary and maintaining and creating uninterrupted vegetated corridors between areas with high levels of canopy cover and water bodies, in which ALAN should be entirely avoided.

AB  - Peri-urban areas support a broad range of multifunctional demands for public goods. In northwest Europe, peri-urban areas tend to overlap with intensive agricultural land, resulting in conflicts between agricultural use and the public good demands of residents. Sustainable intensification (SI) of agriculture might help reconcile agricultural and well-being goals, but it is unclear how the mix of actors in a peri-urban setting can trigger or restrain SI. In a Dutch case study, we explored how SI of agriculture can contribute to making peri-urban areas more sustainable, and which actors are key enabling factors for implementing SI. We used interviews, surveys, workshops, and empirical analysis to obtain insight into the stakeholder's vision of a sustainable future for the case study area, the farming system and actor network. We integrated these insights in a Bayesian Belief Network, where we linked the actor network to implementation of three SI measures (farm-level efficiency measures, small landscape elements, and direct sales), and used sensitivity analysis to model effects of support for implementation by different groups of actors. The case study has a dense stakeholder network, where, dependent on the SI measure, farmers are triggered by all actors to implement SI, or have a stronger role in uptake themselves. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the future preferred by the stakeholders requires broad support of all actors involved, with local actors without a formal role being essential for uptake. Overall, trade-offs among public goods are almost inevitable when taking up SI measures.

AB  - Considerable studies have been conducted to quantify and examine free cyanophage particles across a wide range of aquatic systems, but few studies have analyzed the dynamics of host cell fraction cyanophages, and even less is known about tropical freshwater cyanophages. Here, we employed qPCR to examine the abundances of four ecologically relevant novel cyanophages (PA-SR01, S-SRP01, S-SRP02 and S-SRM01) in a tropical urban lake in Singapore from July to November 2019. Besides quantifying the extracellular free cyanophage particles, host cell fraction cyanophage were also examined to represent the abundance of intracellular and attached phages. Our study revealed differing fate and dynamics of each cyanophage target. Host cell fraction phage abundance was found to be more abundant than free phage abundance, indicating high level of infection and rapid dispersal of phage particles upon lysis. By further investigating the correlations between free phage particle abundance and numerous biotic (total cyanobacteria, Microcystis abundances, etc) as well as abiotic (nutrients and physi-ochemical water quality) variables, multiple correlations across different sampling sites were obtained, sug-gesting pH and rainfall to be potential key factors driving shifts in both cyanophage and cyanobacteria population. This study demonstrated the ecological importance and key roles of the cyanophage PA-SR01, S-SRP01, S-SRP02 and S-SRM01 in tropical freshwater lakes not only as regulators of the cyanobacterial com-munity, but also as promoters of certain cyanotoxin production.

AB  - Despite the rise of social media as a major factor in protests since the early 2010s, scholars have documented the continued importance of urban space and "place-based networks" for social movements. However, the 2019-2020 Hong Kong Anti-ELAB protests saw a shift from occupying symbolic public space to a more variegated use of urban spaces in the city. Combining network analysis of Telegram channels and georeferencing of protest events, this study shows how new digital media platforms such as Telegram enabled a diverse array of protest activities, as well as a shift from formal centrally located civic spaces to a wider range of everyday spaces including malls, offices, and industrial buildings. This study also asks why this occurred, situating the shifting geography of protests as a response to several factors: new social media technologies, strengthening of state surveillance of physical and digital space, and collective learning from the perceived failures of past movements. The implications of these shifts for the future of urban social movements and the "public sphere" are discussed.

AB  - Patterns of genetic differentiation within and among animal populations might vary due to the simple effect of distance or landscape features hindering gene flow. An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation-by-Distance (IBD), Isolation-by-Barrier (IBB), and Isolation-by-Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human-transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large-sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia.

AB  - The rising nationwide concerns about violence targeting Asians have highlighted the scant research on Asian American police officers. This article aims to (re)introduce this important dialogue and calls for a commitment from other race and social equity scholars to extend the discourse on racial diversity in policing. Using data on race and ethnicity compiled by the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey, this article compares data from the largest 100 cities ranked by their respective Asian population percentage with the percentage of Asian police officers from those same cities to examine Asian diversity in policing. Analysis reveals that all the cities with the exception of five were underrepresented by Asian police officers, and that more work needs to be done by these police departments if they hope to reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.

AB  - In the context of urbanization, due to lack of the unified planning of land use for representative ecological indicators, the sustainable wildlife existence in urban ecosystems is emerging as a burning issue. A new descriptive method is proposed to establish the sustainable conservation strategy of protected wildlife in the current urbanization scenario. We use the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST-HQ), straightforward construction package of complex ecological niche Ecological Niche Modeling at The MetaLand EcologyLab (ENMTML) and ecological corridors construction model Species Distribution Model toolbox (SDMtoolbox) to distinguish the priority protected areas (PAs) and construct the ecological corridors of Gallinula chloropus (G. chloropus) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China in 2018. The results show that the PAs are fragmented and only occupy 0.05% of total area in BTH region, which indicate an urgent conservation issue in highly urbanization area. For the sustainable conservation strategy of protected G. chloropus, 25 ecological corridors comprised 2790.8 km are required to construct, mainly distributed in Beijing and Tianjin city. Ecological corridors are also distributed close to the border of southeast, southwest and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. In order to optimize the ecological corridors, 9 important ecological corridors comprised 813.4 km are suggested to build firstly, which are mainly distributed in the central and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. Our combined modeling (ENMTML-InVEST-HQ) indicate that based on actual species occurrence data and land uses, it can successfully generate the PAs which should be paid more attention. Furthermore, concrete measures to build ecological corridors which connect PAs in BTH region are proposed. In order to well-targeted organized planning in highly urbanized areas, measures to protect key habitats of wildlife need to be defined and this research provides a reference for sustainable protection and management of wildlife.

AB  - Simple Summary Feral pigeon is one of the most common urban species worldwide. Living free in urban areas, pigeons have found a favorable environment with the conditions to have a high fertility, thus leading to overcrowding, which causes thousands of millions in damages yearly. The management of overpopulated pigeon colonies presents numerous challenges, and several methods have been proposed and used. In recent decades, the concern in the society about animal welfare has grown, and now demands non-lethal methods in the management of wildlife, especially in cities. The management of feral pigeons in Barcelona, Spain, used to be carried out, like in many cities, by capture and elimination. However, as this method has been proven to be ineffective and the public concern about animal welfare has increased, in 2016, the Barcelona City Council decided to change the management towards a fertility control method. This study describes and evaluates, during three years, an efficient fertility control protocol that is able to reduce the number of pigeons in the treated colonies by 55.26% at the end of the study. The results of this study provide animal management administrations and companies with a non-lethal protocol to control pigeon populations while respecting animal welfare. This study describes a three-year evaluation (2017-2019) of a fertility control protocol using nicarbazin (Ovistop(R)) to reduce the abundance of the most conflictive colonies of feral pigeon, Columba livia var. domestica, in Barcelona, Spain, as a long-term strategy based on animal welfare. The treatment was supplied to 34 pigeon colonies by automatic hopper feeders installed in public areas. A superiority study and a population monitoring study were carried out to evaluate differences in the abundance of the colonies, as well as the proportion of juveniles, the possible intake of nicarbazin by non-target species and the movement of individuals among colonies. The results showed statistical differences in the population trends between the test (-22.03%) and control (+12.86%) groups, and a significant steady decreasing trend in the pigeon abundance (-55.26%) was registered until the end of 2019. The proportion of juveniles was significatively lower in the test colonies, and a non-target species (Eurasian collared doves, Streptopelia decaocto) was observed consuming in a residual form. The protocol using nicarbazin is able to both control the abundance of pigeons, with no impact over non-target species, and respond to the public interest about animal welfare by providing an ethical method to manage overabundant and/or conflictive populations.

AB  - Urban rivers are hotspots of regional nitrogen (N) pollution and N transformations. Previous studies have reported that the microbial community of urban rivers was different from that of natural rivers. However, how microbial community affects N transformations in the urban rivers is still unclear. In this study, we employed N nutrients-related isotope technology (includes natural-abundance isotopes survey and isotope-labeling method) and bioinformatics methods (includes 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis) to investigate the major N transformations, microbial communities as well as functional gene abundances in a metropolitan river network. Our results suggested that the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness, less complexity and increased abundances of nitrification and denitrifying bacterium compared to those in the suburban rivers. These differences were mainly caused by high sewage discharge and N loadings. In addition, the abundances of nitrifier gene (amoA) and denitrifier genes (nirK and nirS) were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers (2.36 x 103, 7.43 x 107 and 2.28 x 107 copies center dot mL-1) than that in the suburban rivers (0.43 x 103, 2.18 x 107 and 0.99 x 107 copies center dot mL-1). These changes in microbes have accelerated nitrification-denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers as compared to those in the suburban rivers, which was evidenced by environmental isotopes and the rates of nitrification (10.52 vs. 0.03 nmol center dot L-1 center dot h-1) and denitrification (83.31 vs. 22.49 nmol center dot g- 1 center dot h-1). Overall, this study concluded that the excess exogenous N has significantly shaped the specific aquatic bacterial communities, which had a potential for enhancing nitrification-denitrification processes in the highly urbanized river network. This study provides a further understanding of microbial N cycling in urban river ecosystems and expands the combined application of isotopic technology and bioinformatics methods in studying biogeochemical cycling.

AB  - Metaphire remanens sp. nov. is widely distributed throughout Hunan Province, China. We sequenced the mitochondrial DNA to investigate its population genetic structure and genetic diversity, including cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, 12S ribosomal (r)RNA, 16S rRNA, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1, derived from 39 individuals from seven geographic locations in Hunan Province. The genetic diversity indices showed that populations of M. remanens have a strong genetic structure and obvious dispersal histories. M. remanens did not experience population expansion, except in Xiangtan City. This may be because of its evolution toward parthenogenesis. The divergence time estimates indicated that M. remanens originated at 19.2055 Ma and then generated two main lineages at 1.7334 Ma (Quaternary glaciation). These results indicate that glaciation, geographic isolation, and dispersal ability are significant factors that influence the differentiation and dispersal of M. remanens. In this study, we describe Metaphire remanens sp. nov. in morphology.

AB  - Long-distance pollen dispersal is critical for gene flow in plant populations, yet pollen dispersal patterns in urban habitats such as green roofs have not been extensively studied. Pollen dispersal patterns typically are assessed either by fitting non-linear models to the relationship between the degree of pollen dispersal and distance to the pollen source (i.e., curve fitting), or by fitting probability density functions (PDFs) to pollen dispersal probability histograms (i.e., PDF fitting). Studies using curve fitting typically report exponential decay patterns in pollen dispersal. However, PDF fitting typically produces more fat-tailed distributions, suggesting the exponential decay may not be the best fitting model. Because the two approaches may yield conflicting results, we used both approaches to examine pollen dispersal patterns in the wind-pollinated Amaranthus tuberculatus and the insect-pollinated Solanum lycopersicum at two green roof and two ground-level sites in the New York (NY, United States) metropolitan area. For the curve fitting analyses, the exponential decay and inverse power curves provided good fits to pollen dispersal patterns across both green roof and ground-level sites for both species. Similar patterns were observed with the PDF fitting analyses, where the exponential or inverse Gaussian were the top PDF at most sites for both species. While the curve fitting results are consistent with other studies, the results differ from most studies using PDF fitting, where long-distance pollen dispersal is more common than we observed. These results highlight the need for further research to compare curve and PDF fitting for predicting pollen dispersal patterns. And, critically, while long-distance pollen dispersal may be an important component of overall pollen dispersal for A. tuberculatus and S. lycopersicum in both urban green roof and ground-level sites, our results suggest it potentially may occur to a lesser extent compared with plants in less-urban areas.

AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosy stem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of Sao Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, Sao Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in Sao Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of Sao Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several "savanna-dwelling" species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Bracket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirao Preto and Jundiai. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity.

AB  - Urban river catchments are often severely affected by human activities but may still retain significant biodiversity. Surprisingly little is known about the behaviour of urban fishes, even those popular with anglers. Key environmental variables that trigger fish behaviour, such as river flow, are highly affected by instream structures including weirs and changes in the natural flow regime. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to examine the movements of Australian bass in a river located in suburban Sydney, Australia. We found that fish tended to be nocturnally active, however, small-scale movements were highly idiosyncratic and less associated with river flow than other factors. Larger-scale movements associated with spawning migrations were strongly correlated with winter floods. Half of the tagged fish migrated to the confluence of the river with Sydney Harbour to breed. Their return migration was hampered by a weir, but the provision of a new fish way facilitated successful return to freshwater at high tide. Despite occupying a highly affected, urban catchment fish behaviour showed similarity to those occupying more natural drainages. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining natural river flows in urban catchments and sustaining fish movement and migration capabilities through the installation of appropriate fish passage devices.

AB  - The objective of this study is to understand the impact of a variety of factors on the frequency and severity of pedestrian-vehicle collisions that involve pedestrian spatial violations at mid-blocks. To that end, the historical collision records of the City of Hamilton between 2010 and 2017 were obtained, and collisions that had occurred at mid-blocks were filtered out. A Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM) framework was developed to investigate the impact of a wide range of factors on such collisions. First, a classical SEM was developed to group the different factors into sets of latent variables. Four latent variables were defined, including location amenities and attractions, pedestrian/road network characteristics, exposure parameters, and location/collision-specific factors. The Bayesian SEM was then implemented to investigate the relationship between the latent variables and collisions. The results showed that the amenities and attractions of a location (e.g., parks, schools, bike-share stations, and bus stops) were the most influential factor on the frequency of collisions that involve spatial violation, followed by pedestrian network characteristics. Pedestrian network characteristics and location/collision-specific factors were found to be the most influential factors on the severity of collisions. The location of bike-share stations, pedestrian network connectivity, exposure to walkers, and the number of lanes were the four observed variables that explained the highest percentage of the variance in each latent group, respectively. The results of this study should assist engineers and planners to develop better design concepts to mitigate collisions that are caused by pedestrian spatial violations in urban areas.

AB  - Many crafts in premodern Europe depended on migratory journeymen. Little is known about these workers, or how craft guilds and urban authorities affected their movement. By employing novel data on thousands of journeymen from different crafts and cities in Holland, we provide the first systematic overview of journeymen migration and settlement patterns in The Dutch Republic. We find that migration and settlement patterns differed significantly by occupational sector, marital status, and skill level. The stance of urban authorities towards migrants significantly affected settlement patterns as well. This interrelation of group-level characteristics, craft guilds, and urban regulation demonstrates the significance of examining these elements in tandem.

AB  - Urban forests are important and highly valuable natural elements of urban green infrastructure (GI). The tightening of developed areas in the vicinity of urban forests results in negative changes in water relations, the disruption of the continuity of wildlife corridors, and the growing number of users, which has an impact on the degradation of urban forest ecosystems. This study, conducted in Pozna??, Poland, provides an analysis of urban forest buffer zones regarding land use type, the high greenery ratio, and the planning decisions that could serve as a nature???based solution (NbS). The study shows a significant change in developed land area in the urban forest buffer zones with the width of 500 m and 100 m. That change occurred between 1997 and 2019 and should be a matter of concern. Coverage of the buffer zones with high greenery, which turned out to be very diverse, could be treated as a forest extension and an element mitigating the negative transition between the forest and the city. Different land use types were taken into consideration, especially in developed areas. The buffer zones of urban forests should be devel??? oped with spatial planning tools like data management and decision???making to mitigate the negative impact of the developed areas on the forests. The development of the concept of sup??? porting green infrastructure in urban forest buffer zones, regardless of land use type was also part of the study.

AB  - Aim The global shipping fleet, the primary means of transporting goods among countries, also serves as a major dispersal mechanism for marine invasive species. To date, researchers have primarily focussed on the role of ships in transferring marine macrofauna, often overlooking transfers of associated parasites, which can have larger impacts on naive host individuals and populations. Here, we re-examine three previously published metabarcode datasets targeting zooplankton and protists in ships' ballast water to assess the diversity of parasites across life stages arriving to three major US ports. Location Port of Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia; Ports of Texas City, Houston and Bayport in Galveston Bay, Texas; and Port of Valdez in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Methods We selected all known parasitic taxa, using sequences generated from the small subunit gene (SSU) from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplified from (1) zooplankton collected from plankton tows (35 and 80 mu m datasets) and (2) eukaryotes collected from samples of ships' ballast water (3 mu m dataset). Results In all three datasets, we found a broad range of parasitic taxa, including many protistan and metazoan parasites, that infect a wide range of hosts, from teleost fish to dinoflagellates. Parasite richness was highest in the 3 mu m dataset and relatively uniform across arrival regions. Several parasite taxa were found in high relative abundance (based on number of sequences recovered) either in ships entering a single or across multiple regions. Main Conclusions The ubiquity, diversity and relative abundance of parasites detected demonstrate ships are a potent vector for spreading marine parasites across the world's oceans, potentially contributing to reported increases in outbreaks of marine diseases. Future research is urgently needed to evaluate the fate of parasites upon arrival and the efficacy of ballast water treatment systems to reduce future transfers and colonization.

AB  - Brown carbon (BrC) constitutes a large fraction of organic carbon and exhibits strong light absorption properties, thus affecting the global radiation budget. In this study, we investigated the light absorption properties, chemical functional bonds, and sources of BrC in six megacities in China, namely Beijing, Harbin, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. The average values of the BrC light absorption coefficient and the mass absorption efficiency at 365 nm in northern cities were higher than those in southern cities by 2.5 and 1.8 times, respectively, demonstrating the abundance of BrC present in northern China's megacities. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra revealed sharp and intense peaks at 1640, 1458-1385, and 1090-1030 cm-1, which were ascribed to aromatic phenols, confirming the contribution of primary emission sources (e.g., biomass burning and coal combustion) to BrC. In addition, we noted peaks at 860, 1280-1260, and 1640 cm(-1), which were attributed to organonitrate and oxygenated phenolic groups, indicating that secondary BrC also existed in the six megacities. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) coupled with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network analysis was used to apportion the sources of BrC light absorption. The results showed that primary emissions (e.g., biomass burning, tailpipe emissions, and coal combustion) made a major contribution to BrC in the six megacities. However, secondary formation processes made a greater contribution to light absorption in the southern cities (17.9 %-21.2 %) than in the northern cities (2.1 %-10.2 %). These results can provide a basis for the more effective control of BrC to reduce its impacts on regional climates and human health.

AB  - Inland rivers are hotspots of anthropogenic indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the underlying microbial processes remain poorly understood. This study measured N2O fluxes from agricultural and urban rivers in Taihu watershed and investigated the microbial processes driving N2O production and consumption. The N2O fluxes were significantly higher in agricultural rivers (140.1 +/- 89.1 mu mol m-2 d-1) than in urban rivers (25.1 +/- 27.0 mu mol m-2 d-1) (p < 0.001). All wind-based models significantly underestimated N2O flux in urban rivers (p < 0.05) when using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change method because they underestimated the N2O emission factor (EF5r). Wind speed and nitrate were the key factors affecting N2O fluxes in agricultural and urban rivers, respectively. NirK-type denitrifiers produced N2O in urban river water, while nirS-type denitrifiers consumed N2O in the sediments of all rivers. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated organics from Microcystis served as electron donors for denitrifiers (dominated by Flavobacterium) in water, while direct interspecies electron transfer between Thiobacillus and methanogens and between Dechloromonas and sulfate-reducing bacteria enhanced N2O reduction in sediments. This study advances our knowledge on the distinctive microbial processes that determine N2O emissions in inland rivers and illustrates the need to revise EF5r for N2O estimation in urban rivers.

AB  - Unusual movements of an animal can potentially represent a dispersal event A higher frequency of young males dispersing is a pattern observed for most part of polygynous or promiscuous mammals with these dispersion events occurring, mainly, before or at the beginning of the breeding season. The water opossum (Chironectes minimus), the only marsupial adapted for semi-aquatic life, occurs from Mexico to Argentina and it has been mostly described as a sensitive species to river and riparian vegetation degradation, occurring exclusively near water curses. Here we describe the first record of long-distance movement of a water opossum not associated with riverine vegetation through dry land. We captured a healthy adult male of C. minimus in July 2012 beside of a highway (DF-001) located 1,100 m from nearest gallery forest in the Federal District. The region is characterized by urban and suburban residential, small fragments of typical savanna and degraded gallery forests. Our unique record could be an event of dispersion through degraded dry lands as observed for other semi-aquatic mammals and also suggests that this species is more resistant to anthropogenic disturbances than previously described. Also, information about dispersal patterns of water opossum is scarce and may contributes to a deeper understanding of ecological requirements of this species.

AB  - With the gradual improvement of the quality of life, taste, and ecological and environmental awareness of urban residents in China, the environmental landscape of residential areas has gradually become a hot spot. At present, the level of the residential environmental landscape has become a necessary means for real estate developers to publicize products and improve economic benefits. Although many residential areas have invested a high cost in constructing environmental landscapes, there are always some deficiencies and defects in the design and implementation of environmental landscapes in residential areas due to various reasons. Therefore, to ameliorate the low efficiency and high cost of manual processing of landscape images, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model based on the traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed for semantic segmentation of landscape images to deal with the excessive amount of landscape elements in landscape image processing. The deconvolution method is utilized to realize pixel-level semantic segmentation. Besides, the image preprocessing method enhances the data to prevent overfitting from commonly occurring in FCN. Moreover, the model two-stage training method ameliorates long training time and complex convergence in deep learning. Finally, three upsampling network structures, i.e., FCN-32s, FCN-16s, and FCN-8s, are selected for a comparative experiment to determine the most suitable network. The experimental results demonstrate that the FCN-8s upsampling network structure is the most prominent; it attains a pixel accuracy of more than 90%, an average accuracy of 88%, and an average Image Understanding of 75%. The three values are the highest among the three upsampling structures, indicating that the FCN-8s can realize accurate landscape image processing. Besides, the recognition accuracy of FCN for landscape elements reaches 90%, 25% higher than that of CNN. This method is effective and accurate in classifying landscape elements, improves the classification accuracy intelligently, and significantly reduces the cost of landscape element classification, which is feasible.

AB  - A considerable proportion of tropical protected areas are Sustainable Use Reserves (SURs), where sociobiodiversity protection and sustainable resource extraction are the main goals. Subsistence hunting is the most widespread form of subcanopy forest resource extraction, and often depletes game populations within SURs, but the degree to which these extractive activities are sustainable remains questionable. To assess patterns of hunting sustainability within SURs, we systematically examined the local ecological knowledge of 211 resident hunters living in 93 communities located within and immediately outside nine SURs of Brazilian Amazonia. We used mixed models to assess the effects of settlement features (distance to reserve boundaries, size, age, distance to urban centers, and extent of floodplain areas) on local perceptions of game abundance, the prey profile of the most consumed game species, and overall levels of local game depletion. Hunters consistently reported that game populations were less impacted within communal catchment areas containing larger amounts of floodplain habitat and farther from urban centers. In these areas the overall game abundance was perceived to be higher, low-fecundity species were most consumed, and harvest-sensitive species were least depleted. Local SUR communities within this context accrued higher benefits from higher wild-meat availability, but settlement age and size had no effects on hunted species. Evidence-based conservation management plans in tropical protected areas should focus on reducing wild meat demand in urban areas and managing both, the local aquatic animal protein in floodplain areas to relieve pressure on terrestrial game species, and the offtake of game populations at inland sites lacking access to aquatic animal protein.

AB  - There are many challenges in biodiversity conservation, especially for migratory waterbirds because their survival depends on the availability of a suite of interconnected sites at different stages of their annual cycle. Due to habitat loss and degradation, the population of Baer's Pochard (Aythya baeri), a migratory diving-duck, has declined to an extent that it has been listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN Red List. To better understand the habitat requirements of this threatened waterbird for its effective conservation, we conducted seven years of field surveys within its historical distribution range in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway including China and neighbouring countries, covering 563 observation sites at 185 locations. Twelve new locations were identified as habitats for this species. By combining our surveys with literature and citizen science birding records, 171 Baer's Pochard's presence sites have classified as migratory stopovers, wintering grounds and breeding and potential breeding habitats. We then used Maxent model to estimate the potential distribution range and updated and refined the current IUCN distribution map. Finally, we identified the key conservation gaps by overlaying the distribution with a recent remotely acquired global landcover map. Our results show that: (1) The southernmost breeding site is about 1400 km south of its current IUCN breeding range; (2) the northern most wintering site is 800 km north of the IUCN wintering range; (3) Six newly discovered sites in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, China are confirmed to be used all year round; (4) Most sites (81.8%) are not located in protected areas (PAs), and the majority of the suitable habitats (90%) are not protected by the current PA network. Our findings reveal that great changes have taken place in the distribution of Baer's Pochard and that there are many distribution overlaps throughout its annual migration circle (e.g., many historical stopover sites become breeding habitats). Moreover, the key habitats have retreated into eastern Asia, and most of the habitats overlap with urban developed areas and are outside of current PA network. Our study suggests that the existing PA network may be less effective for the conservation of this critically endangered species under predicted global climate change, and other effective area-based conservation measures should be part of the conservation strategy. More importantly, as the distribution of Baer's Pochard covers at least 15 countries, closely coordinated cross-border cooperation would be critical for its future survival.

AB  - Community and composition of dust-borne microbes would affect human health and are regulated by microbial community assembly. The dust in kindergarten is always collected to evaluate the microbial exposure of children, yet the microbial assembly, their interactions, and potential pathogens in kindergarten dust remain unclear. Here, we aim to investigate the microbial community assembly and structures, and potential bacterial pathogens in outdoor dust of kindergartens, and reveal the factors influencing the assembly and composition of microbial community. A total of 118 urban dust samples were collected on the outdoor impervious surfaces of 59 kin-dergartens from different districts of Xiamen in January and June 2020. We extracted microbial genomic DNA in these dusts and characterized the microbial (i.e., bacteria and fungi) community compositions and diversities using target gene-based (16S rRNA genes for bacterial community and ITS 2 regions for fungal community) high -throughput sequencing. Potential bacterial pathogens were identified and the interactions between microbes were determined through a co-occurrence network analysis. Our results showed the predominance of Actino-bacteria and alpha-Proteobacteria in bacterial communities and Capnodiales in fungal communities. Season altered microbial assembly, composition, and interactions, with both bacterial and fungal communities exhibiting a higher heterogeneity in summer than those in winter. Although stochastic processes predominated in bacterial and fungal community assembly, the season-depended environmental factors (e.g., temperature) and interactions between microbes play important roles in dust microbial community assembly. Potential bacterial pathogens were detected in all urban dust, with significantly higher relative abundance in summer than that in winter. These results indicated that season exerted more profound effects on microbial community composition, as-sembly, and interactions, and suggested the seasonal changes of potential risk of microbes in urban dust. Our findings provide new insights into microbial community, community assembly, and interactions between mi-crobes in the urban dust, and indicate that taxa containing opportunistic pathogens occur commonly in urban dust.

AB  - Understanding future landscape risk pattern change (FLRPC) scenarios will help people manage and utilize natural resources. In this study, we have selected a variety of landscape and anthropogenic factors as risk parameters for FLRPC assessment. Land use/cover change (LUCC) and land surface temperature (LST) are regarded as significant factors that have resulted in large-scale environmental changes. Result analysis of the previous LUCC from 1985 to 2020 showed that construction land and water body (WB) increased by 669.09 and 183.16 km(2), respectively. The study continues to predict future LUCC from 2030 to 2050, in which the result has shown that a large land use conversion occurred during the future prediction period. In addition, the LST forecasting analysis illustrated that the previous LST maximum and minimum are 38 degrees C and 15 degrees C, which will be increased to 40.83 degrees C and 26.25 degrees C in the future, respectively. Finally, the study used the weighted overlay method for the FLRPC analysis, which applies analytic hierarchy process techniques for risk evaluation. The FLRPC result demonstrated that Baghdad City is in the low-risk and medium-risk to high-risk categories from 2020 to 2050, while AL and BL are in the very-high-risk categories. Meanwhile, WB and NG have always been safe, falling into the very-low-risk and low-risk categories from 2020 to 2050. Therefore, this study has successfully assessed the Baghdad metropolitan area and made recommendations for future urban development for a more safe, resilient, and sustainable development.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created unforeseen effects in public transport and the mobility of people in cities globally. Johannesburg, being a developing city in one of the most affected countries in Africa during the pandemic, has experienced severe changes in traffic management and travel patterns as a result of the restrictions imposed on movement. Hence, this study examined the spatial variations in traffic during the pandemic. The study utilized data obtained from the TomTom Traffic Index for the city of Johannesburg from 2019 to 2021, with 2019 representing the period pre-COVID-19 with no lockdown restrictions, 2020 representing the period with restricted movement to limit spread of COVID-19, and 2021 representing a period of relaxed and minimized restrictions on movement. Our findings revealed that there was a variation in congestion levels between 2019-2021 with year 2020 having the least congestion from the beginning of the COVID-19 restrictions due to regulations enforced in movement and reduced travel. Our findings further revealed that traffic congestion was higher during weekdays than weekends during the three periods, with mini-bus taxis as the major contributors to congestion. Consequently, there is a need to discourage the use of single occupancy vehicles and invest in more sustainable means of transportation to ease the mobility of people and reduce traffic on major roads.

AB  - Urban scenes consist of visual and semantic features and exhibit spatial relationships among land-use types (e.g. industrial areas are far away from the residential zones). This study applied a graph convolutional network with neighborhood information (henceforth, named the neighbour supporting graph convolutional neural network), to learn spatial relationships for urban scene classification. Furthermore, a co-occurrence analysis with visual and semantic features proceeded to improve the accuracy of urban scene classification. We tested the proposed method with the fifth ring road of Beijing with an overall classification accuracy of 0.827 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.769. In comparison with other methods, such as support vector machine, random forest, and general graph convolutional network, the case study showed that the proposed method improved about 10% in urban scene classification.

AB  - Deep vertical rotary tillage (DVRT) is a novel technique; however, its influence on soil bacterial diversity and community structure remains unclear. Herein, it was hypothesized that this tillage method significantly improves the bacterial diversity and alters the bacterial community structure and therefore it supports enhanced soil ecosystem functions in cultivated land. We investigated the soil bacterial communities and performed molecular ecological network analysis of cultivated land soils under different tillage regimes using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. Soil samples were collected from the experimental field under 2 treatments: DVRT and conventional rotary tillage (CT) in Shizuishan City, Ningxia, China, in a 2-year field experiment. The alpha-diversity indices showed that DVRT resulted in higher bacterial diversity. In addition, the principal coordinate analysis results revealed a clear separation among the groups of cultivated land soils under the 2 treatment regimes. The key physicochemical factors that significantly influenced bacterial diversity and community structure were pH and total potassium concentration. The network analysis indicated that the bacterial network of DVRT soils consisted of more functionally interrelated bacterial modules than that of soils under CT, and the topological roles of characteristic bacteria and key bacteria were also different. In relation to CT, the relative abundances of organisms belonging to the functional groups of "Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism", "Signal transduction", and "Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins" were significantly increased in cultivated land soils under DVRT. It was concluded that DVRT treatment could improve bacterial diversity, alter the bacterial network structure, and enhance potential ecosystem functions in soils of cultivated land.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance has become a major Global Health concern and a better understanding on the global spread mechanisms of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and intercontinental ARB exchange is needed. We measured atmospheric depositions of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by quantitative (q)PCR in rain/snow collected fortnightly along 4 y. at a remote high mountain LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) site located above the atmospheric boundary layer (free troposphere). Bacterial composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and air mass provenances were determined by modelled back trajectories and rain/snow chemical composition. We hypothesize that the free troposphere may act as permanent reservoir and vector for ARB and ARGs global dispersal. We aimed to i) determine whether ARGs are long-range intercontinental and persistently dispersed through aerosols, ii) assess ARGs long-term atmospheric deposition dynamics in a remote high mountain area, and iii) unveil potential diffuse ARGs pollution sources. We showed that the ARGs sul1 (resistance to sulfonamides), tetO (resistance to tetracyclines), and intl1 (a proxy for horizontal gene transfer and anthropogenic pollution) were long-range and persistently dispersed in free troposphere aerosols. Major depositions of tetracyclines resistance matched with intensification of African dust outbreaks. Potential ARB mostly traced their origin back into agricultural soils. Our study unveils that air masses pathways are shaping ARGs intercontinental dispersal and global spread of antibiotic resistances, with potential predictability for interannual variability and remote deposition rates. Because climate regulates aerosolization and long-range air masses movement patterns, we call for a more careful evaluation of the connections between land use, climate change and ARB long-range intercontinental dispersal.

AB  - Green roofs are unique ecosystems combining two major community assembly filters, namely stress and spatial isolation. As such, they represent an interesting model ecosystem in community ecology. In this study, we characterized the microbiome structure on 19 green roofs and 5 urban parks as a benchmark comparison (i.e. non-isolated, non-stressful habitats). Green roofs were not species depauperate, showing similar alpha-diversity compared to surrounding parks. We also did not find an overrepresentation of bacterial phyla typically recognized as oligotrophs, which calls into question the notion of green roofs as highly stressful habitats for bacteria, and/or the conservatism of nutritional ecophysiology at the phylum level. The geographical position of a roof, or its degree of spatial isolation (assessed through its height and area) were not important predictors of microbiome diversity and structure, suggesting that dispersal limitations impose little constraints on green roof microbiome assembly. Finally, key microbial groups (e.g. archaeal nitrifiers, Actinobacteria) were much less frequent and/or abundant on green roofs, which may have important implications for nutrient cycling and urban biogeochemistry. More work will be required to phenotype the microorganisms overrepresented on green roofs and specifically measure key soil processes in these unique urban ecosystems.

AB  - Simple Summary Spirobolus bungii plays a key role in soil ecolsystems, but there are few studies on this species, especially regarding genetics. In this study, 166 S. bungii individuals were collected from two cities in China (Nanjing and Tianjin), and COX2 and Cytb gene sequences of mitochondrial DNA and 18S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced. We conducted a population genetic analysis based on mtDNA sequences, revealing the population genetic diversity and genetic structure of S. bungii in the two cities, and confirming the hindering effect of geographical barriers on the gene flow of the populations. Soil macrofauna, such as Spirobolus bungii, are an important component of ecosystems. However, systematic studies of the genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and the potential factors affecting the genetic differentiation of S. bungii are lacking. We performed a population genetic study of 166 individuals from the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River, north of the Yangtze River in Nanjing city, and near Tianjin city, in order to investigate the correlations between geographical distance and genetic diversity. A total of 1182 bp of COX2 and Cytb gene sequences of mitochondrial DNA, and 700 bp of the 18S rRNA gene sequence were analyzed. There were two haplotypes and one variable site in the 18S rRNA gene, and 28 haplotypes and 78 variable sites in the COX2 and Cytb genes. In this study, the 18S rRNA gene was used for species identification, and mtDNA (concatenated sequences with Cytb and COX2) was used for population genetic analysis. Structure cluster analysis indicated that the genetic structures of the different populations of S. bungii tended to be consistent at small geographical scales. Phylogenetic trees revealed that the haplotypes were clearly divided into three branches: the area south of the Yangtze River, the area to the north of the Yangtze River in Nanjing, and the area in Tianjin. Large geographical barriers and long geographical distance significantly blocked gene flow between populations of S. bungii. Our results provide a basic theoretical basis for subsequent studies of millipede taxonomy and population genetic evolution.

AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001-2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

AB  - Background: Aedes albopictus is an indigenous primary vector of dengue and Zika viruses in China. Wolbachia is a gram-negative and common intracellular bacteria, which is maternally inherited endosymbionts and could expand their propagation in host populations by means of various manipulations. Compared with research on the dispersion of Ae. albopictus at the macrospatial level (mainly at the country or continent level), little is known about its variation and Wolbachia infection at the microspatial level, which is essential for its management. Meanwhile, no local cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the history of Nanjing, which implies that few adulticides have been applied in the city. Thus, the present study examines how the Ae. albopictus population varies and the Wolbachia infection status of each population among microspatial regions of Nanjing City. Methods: The genetic structure of 17 Aedes albopictus populations collected from urban, urban fringe, and rural regions of Nanjing City was investigated based on 9 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial coxI gene. The Wolbachia infection status of each population was also assessed with Wolbachia A- and Wolbachia B-specific primers. Results: Nine out of 58 tested pairs of microsatellite markers were highly polymorphic, with a mean PIC value of 0.560, and these markers were therefore chosen for microsatellite genotyping analysis. The Na value of each Ae. albopictus population was very high, and the urban area populations (7.353 +/- 4.975) showed a lower mean value than the urban fringe region populations (7.866 +/- 5.010). A total of 19 coxI haplotypes were observed among 329 Ae. albopictus individuals via haplotype genotyping, with the highest diversity observed among the urban fringe Ae. albopictus populations (Hd = 0.456) and the lowest among the urban populations (Hd = 0.277). Each Ae. albopictus population showed significant departure from HWE, and significant population expansion was observed in only three populations from the urban (ZSL), urban fringe (HAJY), and rural areas (HSZY) (p < 0.05). Combined with DAPC analysis, all the Ae. albopictus populations were adequately allocated to two clades with significant genetic differences according to population structure analysis, and the best K value was equal to two. AMOVA results showed that most (96.18%) of the genetic variation detected in Ae. albopictus occurred within individuals (F-IT = 0.22238, p < 0.0001), while no significant positive correlation was observed via isolation by distance (IBD) analysis (R (2) = 0.03262, p = 0.584). The TCS network of all haplotypes showed that haplotype 1 (H1) and haplotype 4 (H4) were the most frequent haplotypes among all populations, and the haplotype frequency significantly increased from urban regions (36.84%) to rural regions (68.42%). Frequent migration was observed among Ae. albopictus populations from rural to urban regions via the urban fringe region, with four direct migration routes between rural and urban regions. Furthermore, Wolbachia genotyping results showed that most of the individuals of each population were coinfected with Wolbachia A and Wolbachia B. The independent infection rate of Wolbachia A was slightly higher than that of Wolbachia B, and no significant differences were observed among different regions. Conclusion: In the microspatial environment of Nanjing City, the urban fringe region is an important region for the dispersion of Ae.
   albopictus populations between rural and urban areas, and Wolbachia A and Wolbachia B coinfection is the most common Wolbachia infection status in all Ae. albopictus populations among different regions.

While their individual effects are well-documented, how the combined effect of urbanization and climate change can synergistically affect species' success as well as ecosystem function is less understood. Advancing our understanding of their potential synergistic effects is crucial for mitigating their consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Here, we developed a stock and flow model to quantify the effects of urbanization and climate change on avian seed dispersal of poison ivy fruits using parameters estimated in the field. We simulated fruit fate in urban and natural sites and calculated overall seed germination success as our estimation of plant fitness. Our model predicted the general dynamics of fruit ripening, fruit loss (fall to ground), and fruit consumption by birds and forecasted lower germination success at urban sites that generally have higher fruit production. Different climate change scenarios predicted different degrees of phenological mismatch between plants and the seed dispersing birds resulting in significant decreases in fitness (germination success). More importantly, the negative effects of climate change are predicted to be more detrimental in urban (i.e., synergistic effects) compared to natural areas. Our study emphasizes the need to evaluate synergistic effects of human disturbances in order to better predict and mitigate its effects on species interactions and ecosystem function.

AB  - We present a novel approach for estimating the proportional distributions of function types (i.e. functional distributions) in an urban area through learning semantics preserved embeddings of points-of-interest (POIs). Specifically, we represent POIs as low-dimensional vectors to capture (1) the spatial co-occurrence patterns of POIs and (2) the semantics conveyed by the POI hierarchical categories (i.e. categorical semantics). The proposed approach utilizes spatially explicit random walks in a POI network to learn spatial co-occurrence patterns, and a manifold learning algorithm to capture categorical semantics. The learned POI vector embeddings are then aggregated to generate regional embeddings with long short-term memory (LSTM) and attention mechanisms, to take account of the different levels of importance among the POIs in a region. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) maps regional embeddings to functional distributions. A case study in Xiamen Island, China implements and evaluates the proposed approach. The results indicate that our approach outperforms several competitive baseline models in all evaluation measures, and yields a relatively high consistency between the estimation and ground truth. In addition, a comprehensive error analysis unveils several intrinsic limitations of POI data for this task, e.g. ambiguous linkage between POIs and functions.

AB  - Imposed changes in social conduct and the dynamics of living in cities, during COVID-19 pandemic, triggered an increase in the demand, availability, and accessibility of open public spaces. This has put forward questions of the relationship between open public spaces and disease transmission, as well as how planning and design strategies might be used to improve resilience in the face of future pandemics. Within this academic framework, this study focuses on object detection and human movement prediction in open public spaces, using the city of Sarajevo as a case study. Video recordings of parks and squares in morning, afternoon and evening are utilized to detect humans and predict their movements. Frame differentiation method proved to be the best for object detection and their motion. Linear regression is used on a dataset collected using the space syntax observation technique gate method. The best R-2 values, 0.97 and 0.61, are achieved for weekdays, for both parks and squares. Authors associated it with the dynamics of space use and frequency of space occupancy, which can be related to physical conditions and activity content of selected locations. The results of study provide an insight into analysis and prediction of direction, as well as density of pedestrian movement, which could be used in decision making directed towards more efficient and health oriented urban planning.

AB  - Throughout history, the public space of towns and cities has been characterized by favoring cultural encounters and exchanges and revolutions and social changes. In the case of the West, these have fostered the territorial expansion of democracy. But what happens when some citizens occupy squares and streets to reverse all the democratic advances achieved? This article, the demands for independence of part the Basque society in urban environments during 1969-2011, is analyzed. To do this, a methodology of bibliographic review of the actions carried out through artistic manifestations related to Basque independence and terrorism movement in urban areas. Consequently, these actions reduced the neutrality of public space until appropriating it. In this way, the evolution of Basque independence and terrorism movements was exposed through citizen perspectives through its graffiti, murals and posters.

AB  - The Feng-Sang River is a metropolitan river in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. In this study, Feng-Sang River sediments were analyzed to investigate the distributions and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), potentially carcinogenic PAHs (TEQ(carc)), and toxic equivalence quotient (TEQ) were applied to evaluate influences of PAHs on ecosystems and microbial diversities. Results indicate that PAHs concentrations varied between seasons and locations. The concentrations of n-ary sumation (16)PAHs ranged from 73.6 to 603.8 ng/kg in dry seasons and from 2.3 to 199.3 ng/kg in wet seasons. This could be because of the flushing effect during wet seasons, which caused the movement and dilution of the PAH-contaminated sediments. Diagnostic ratio analysis infers that high PAHs levels were generated by combustion processes and vehicle traffic, and results from multivariate descriptive statistical analysis also demonstrate that the vehicular traffic pollution could be the major emission source of PAHs contamination. Comparisons of PAHs with SQGs indicate that PAHs concentrations in sediment were below the effects range low (ERL) values, and thus, the immediate threat to organisms might not be significant. The diagnostic ratio analyses are effective methods for PAH source appointment. The metagenomic assay results imply that sediments contained essential microbial species with eminent diversity. The detected PAH-degrading bacteria (Desulfatiglans, Dechloromonas, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Rhodobacter, Clostridium, and Exiguobacterium) played a key role in PAHs biotransformation, and Dechloromonas and Rhodobacter had a higher relative abundance. Results of microbial diversity analyses indicate that the contaminated environment induced the changes of governing microbial groups in sediments. Practitioner Points Diagnostic ratio analyses are effective methods for PAHs source appointment.Microbial composition in sediments are highly affected by anthropogenic pollution.Combustion and vehicle traffic contribute to urban river sediments pollution by PAHs.Dechloromonas and Rhodobacter are dominant PAHs-degrading bacteria in sediments.

AB  - We attempt to identify and measure knowledge spillovers in the French urban transport sector, which is strongly regulated and where a few large industrial groups are in charge of operating several urban networks. We build and estimate a structural cost model where the service is regulated by a local government and is provided by a single operator. Knowledge spillovers are directly linked to the know-how of a specific group, but they also depend on the incentive power of the regulatory contract which shapes the effort of the local managers. Exerting an effort in a specific network allows a cost reduction in this network, but it also benefits other networks that are members of the same group. We find that diversity of knowledge across operators of the same group improves absorptive capacity and increases the flow of spillovers. Simulation exercises provide evidence of significant reductions in total operating costs following the enlargement of industrial groups. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on a summer observational experiment and the meteorological data from 2009 to 2018, this paper investigated the local climate effects of representative 1 Level One and 2 Level Two wind corridors (LOC and LTCs, respectively) in the central urban area (CUA) of Beijing by introducing the wind speed ratio (WsR) and urban heat island (UHI) intensity indices. In addition, the impacts on the ventilation of wind corridors from the 8 spatial landscape parameters were analyzed. The results indicated that LOC and LTCs have significant ventilation benefit and certain UHI mitigation benefit varying with season, day and night and weather, which were able to accelerate winds when wind speeds exceed 0.57 m/s and 0.75 m/s, respectively. The most important influencing parameters on the ventilation capability were frontal area index and roughness length. The multiyear average WsRs of the LOC and LTCs were 57% and 31% higher than that of the CUA, respectively. The UHI reduction did not occur along the whole corridor or throughout the whole day. The maximum seasonal mean UHI reduction of the LOC during daytime and nighttime were 0.89 ? and 0.75 ?, respectively. The LTCs mainly reduced UHI during daytime with the maximum reduction of 0.30 ?.

AB  - The contradiction of land use is becoming more and more fierce in China, which poses a serious threat to the structural integrity and quantity of ecological land, the uncontrolled expansion of urban construction land, the imbalance between the spatial structure of agricultural land and ecological land, and the unreasonable spatial structure of various types of land within the city. This study mainly discusses the risk measurement and early warning of spatial conflict based on network information processing. In this study, GIS technology is used to deal with the risk of spatial conflict. Spatial conflict, in essence, is an objective geographical phenomenon arising from the competition for spatial resources in the process of human-land relations and is the result of the interaction between natural geographical factors and human factors, and natural geographical processes and human processes, and is a key factor affecting the sustainable development of the region. The logical network attack path composed of IP sequence captured by the space conflict network early warning and emergency response system is transformed into the attack path composed of a corresponding physical address sequence, which is directly displayed on the electronic map. At the same time, the attributes related to the spatial conflict events in the research area are also displayed in the form of a list. When the macro network early warning and emergency response system detect the occurrence of space conflict events in the study area, its emergency response subsystem queries the strategy database and outputs the emergency strategy in real-time by inputting the warning information analyzed by the early warning information analysis subsystem. Finally, the system realizes the functions of network node information visualization processing, network early warning and emergency response information visualization processing, and electronic layer basic operation. It is found that the industrial added value of the study area of ABC urban agglomeration has reached 283.140 billion yuan in recent three years, accounting for 60.25% of the industrial added value of the three cities and 30.98% of the whole province. The results show that the improper spatial regional combination has an important impact on the spatial conflict, and the improper spatial regional combination will significantly improve the level of spatial conflict.

AB  - Rockweeds can dominate temperate rocky intertidal habitats and support a diversity of flora and fauna that find refuge underneath the canopy-forming seaweed. Pelvetiopsis californica is an upper intertidal rockweed endemic to California (USA) and Baja California (MEX) with little known about its distribution and abundance, nor its ecological role as a habitat former. We examined long-term changes in the abundance and distribution of P. californica and its effects on the upper shore community, along the coast of California. Similar to patterns observed in other rockweeds globally, P. californica has declined over the past several decades, including extirpation at 30% of sites sampled, clustered around urban centers of southern California, and a large decline in abundance at most sites from a long-term (similar to 20 + years) monitoring program. Currently, P. californica exhibits a patchy distribution, particularly in southern California where it is absent from long stretches of shoreline. In community surveys across a large geographic scale (32 degrees-36 degrees latitude), high zone community composition was significantly different at sites where P. californica was present, even at relatively low cover, than when the alga was absent. Within-site community surveys also showed that communities associated with P. californica were different than when the rockweed was absent, highlighted by a higher diversity of algae and invertebrates. Probable stressors, such as trampling and climate change, are likely to worsen in the future, further reducing P. californica populations. Due to limited reproductive dispersal capabilities and fragmented populations, natural recovery seems unlikely and active restoration may be necessary.

AB  - The terrestrial environment is an important contributor of microplastics (MPs) to the oceans. Urban streams, strictly interwoven in the city network and to the MPs' terrestrial source, have a relevant impact on the MP budget of large rivers and, in turn, marine areas. We investigated the fluxes (items/day) of MPs and natural fibers of Mugnone Creek, a small stream crossing the highly urbanized landscape of Florence (Italy) and ending in the Arno River (and eventually to the Tyrrhenian Sea). Measurements were done in dry and wet seasons for two years (2019-2020); stream sediments were also collected in 2019. The highest loads of anthropogenic particles were observed in the 2019 wet season (10(9) items/day) at the creek outlet. The number of items in sediments increased from upstream (500 items/kg) to urban sites (1540 items/kg). Fibers were the dominant shape class; they were mostly cellulosic in composition. Among synthetic items, fragments of butadiene-styrene (SBR), indicative of tire wear, were observed. Domestic wastewater discharge and vehicular traffic are important sources of pollution for Mugnone Creek, especially during rain events. The study of small creeks is of pivotal importance to limit the availability of MPs in the environment.

AB  - The glossophagine Pallas's long-tongued bat (Glossophaga soricina) fares well in urban environments across its range. In addition to roost sites, there are nectar and fruit sources available in diverse situations across the urban gradient. Phyllostomid bats that thrive in urbanized situations are behaviorally plastic generalists and rely on patches of ornamental or feral plants as food sources. Herein we report on G. soricina and its food sources at an urbanized site in Southeastern Brazil. This small phyllostomid bat consumes nectar from landscaping ornamental plants, besides consuming the soft pulp along with the tiny seeds of pioneer trees and shrubs. In addition to these natural sources, the bat exploits hummingbird feeders to consume the sugared water. Ingested small seeds are defecated in flight, the bat acting as a disperser of pioneer plants that favor cleared areas. Glossophaga soricina role as flower-pollinator and seed-disperser at Neotropical urban areas merits further attention due both to the maintenance of urban biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - Research on the evolution and driving forces of landscape patterns can provide important support for ecological governance decision-making. However, the heterogeneity of landscape patterns at the microscale (grain size and extent) and the enforceability of the zoning scale at the macroscale deserve more attention. The optimal grain size (30 x30 m) and the extent (500 m) for landscape pattern research were obtained by analyzing the fluctuation of landscape metrics and semivariogram models in this study. The research area was divided into environmental functional regions (EFRs), which were defined according to the main ecological functions and protection objectives of each region. The analysis results of land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) showed that land use transfer in the past 20 years occurred mainly between woodland and cultivated land at the county scale, but this was not always the case in EFRs. The results of the landscape pattern analysis showed that landscape fragmentation, aggregation, and heterogeneity increased at the county scale during 1999-2020. Moreover, except within agricultural environmental protection areas (AEP) and living environment guaranteed areas (LEG), the degree and the speed of landscape damage decreased by 2020, and the turning point occurred in 2006-2013. The analysis results of geographical detectors showed that the digital elevation mode (DEM) and GDP were the main driving factors in most regions. At the county scale, the average explanatory power of the selected factors increased by 13.27% and 16.16% in 2006-2013 and 2013-2020, respectively. Furthermore, the study area was divided into three categories according to the intensity of human disturbance. The areas with high human disturbance need to focus on increasing land-use intensification and strengthening the development in low-slope hill regions. The areas of moderate human disturbance need to focus on improving the connectivity of ecological patches and optimizing industrial structures. Attention should be given to the monitoring of natural drivers and policy support for ecological governance in low human disturbance areas. The methods and findings in this study can provide a reference for decision-makers to formulate land-use policies, especially for integration into relevant urban planning, such as the spatial planning of national land that is being widely implemented in China.

AB  - This article investigates the destruction of the Beaver Avenue commercial corridor and removal of 954 families in Pittsburgh's Manchester neighborhood to create a 164-acre industrial park during the early 1960s. Known at the time as the Chateau West Redevelopment Project, the massive undertaking occurred in the context of national highway construction and industrial park development. These trends fueled a growing African American rebellion in Pittsburgh during the 1960s. With more than 5,700 families relocated throughout the city for fourteen urban renewal projects underway in 1963, the turmoil impacted a disproportionate number of low-income and Black residents. While the renewal story of Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District and East Liberty neighborhoods is more familiar, there is little detailed research about Chateau West. This investigation discusses more fully the relationship between planned industrial districts and highway development to the emerging civil rights movement of the 1960s.

AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of species extinction in the twentyfirst-century. Here, we (1) quantify potential changes in species' bioclimatic area of habitat (BAH) of 135 native potential agroforestry species from the Brazilian flora, using two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and dispersal scenarios, where species have no ability to disperse and reach new areas (non-dispersal) and where species can migrate within the estimated BAH (full dispersal) for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. We then (2) assess the preliminary conservation status of each species based on IUCN criteria. Current and future potential habitats for species were predicted using MaxEnt, a machine-learning algorithm used to estimate species' probability distribution. Future climate is predicted to trigger a mean decline in BAH between 38.5-56.3% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 22.3-41.9% under the full dispersal scenario for 135 native potential agroforestry species. Additionally, we found that only 4.3% of the studied species could be threatened under the IUCN Red List criteria B1 and B2. However, when considering the predicted quantitative habitat loss due to climate change (A3c criterion) the percentages increased between 68.8-84.4% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 40.7-64.4% under the full dispersal scenario. To lessen such threats, we argue that encouraging the use of these species in rural and peri-urban agroecosystems are promising, complementary strategies for their long-term conservation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging has highlighted connections between patterns of brain activity and variability in behavior. We aimed to characterize the associations between imaging markers of cSVD, dynamic connectivity, and cognitive impairment.METHODS: We obtained magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from the population-based Hamburg City Health Study. cSVD was quantified by white matter hyperintensities and peak-width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD). Resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent signals were clustered into discrete brain states, for which fractional occupancies (%) and dwell times (seconds) were computed. Cognition in multiple domains was assessed using validated tests. Regression analysis was used to quantify associations between white matter damage, spatial coactivation patterns, and cognitive function.RESULTS: Data were available for 979 participants (ages 45-74 years, median white matter hyperintensity volume 0.96 mL). Clustering identified five brain states with the most time spent in states characterized by activation (+) or suppression (-) of the default mode network (DMN) (fractional occupancy: DMN+ = 25.1 & PLUSMN; 7.2%, DMN-= 25.5 & PLUSMN; 7.2%). Every 4.7-fold increase in white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with a 0.95-times reduction of the odds of occupying DMN+ or DMN-. Time spent in DMN-related brain states was associated with executive function.CONCLUSIONS: Associations between white matter damage, whole-brain spatial coactivation patterns, and cognition suggest equalization of time spent in different brain states as a marker for cSVD-associated cognitive decline. Reduced gradients between brain states in association with brain damage and cognitive impairment reflect the dedifferentiation hypothesis of neurocognitive aging in a network-theoretical context.

AB  - Social-economic development and urbanization greatly modify landscape patterns and their associated ecological processes at regional scales, resulting in serious landscape ecological risk (LER). Effectively evaluating the LER is the basis for sustainable land use and development of regions. Because of the uncertainties in future socioeconomic development, precisely projecting future LER distribution is still challenging. To overcome this weakness, by using the Fujian Delta region as a case study, we employed patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model coupled with multiple linear regression and a Markov chain model to project the landscape patterns in 2050. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were selected as the scenario framework. Thus, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern changes and LER from 2000 to 2020 and the projections for 2050 under different localized SSPs scenarios were explored. The results show that the cropland and water areas changed remarkably during 2000-2020. The PLUS model based on the couple of multiple linear regression and Markov chain model has higher prediction accuracy (FoM = 0.244) than that without the multiple linear regression (FoM = 0.146). The simulation results show that the urban land continued to expand westward and northward in 2050. Large amounts of cropland will be transformed into urban land in the eastern part. The conversion area is the largest under the SSP2 scenario, and the smallest area occurs under the SSP4 scenario. From 2000 to 2020, the LER exhibited the characteristics of an east-west polarized spatial distribution, and the LER gradually increased. The localized SSP4 scenario is projected to have the largest LER, and the smallest LER occurs under the SSP1 scenario. The conversions from cropland to urban land will lead to the most significant increases in LER, followed by the conversion of grassland to urban land.

AB  - The urbanization of riverine landscapes is an increasing threat to river ecosystems. However, it is unclear which metrics can best assess the response of macroinvertebrates to the conversion of forested lands to urban and agricultural lands. The main goal of this study is to examine whether trait-based approaches are more sensitive than taxonomic approaches in distinguishing macroinvertebrate responses to different land use types in a highly urbanized area of northern China. Results based on 14 environmental variables showed a significant difference across a human-induced environmental gradient. The results showed that no significant differences were observed in terms of taxonomic diversity indices between the different land use types. Functional evenness (FEve) and Rao's quadratic entropy decreased with the increase in urban area caused by the intensification of human activity, demonstrating that functional diversity is more sensitive than taxonomic diversity in discriminating between different land use types. In addition, the results based on RLQ (physical-chemical variables (R), macroinvertebrate taxa (L), and species traits (Q)) and fourth-corner analyses indicated that the trait states of bi- or multivoltine, high dispersal capacity, and not-streamlined body shape were much higher in the agricultural area and positively related to farmland percentage. Taxa with large body size were dominant in urban areas and were positively correlated with EC. Overall, the observed responses of traits to environmental variables suggest that trait-based approaches should be incorporated into land use management for river restoration.

AB  - In the previous chapter of this series (Remesar 2021) we analysed how, over time, the functional and social complexity that cities are acquiring it is translated into a trend towards polycentrality. If in some moments 'the centre' concentrated the functions linked to power - worldly and religious - and to the economy, since the Late Middle Ages we can observe a trend towards polycentrality marked by the segregation of the economic and social centre- in the context of the appearance of the commercial bourgeoisie and of the guild structure of production - from the centres of religious and/or political power. The commercial cities-many of them port cities- will segregate the commercial centre from the religious centre, but given their status as "free cities" this commercial centre will remain linked to the centre of local political decisions. The central square of the city (cities in Northern Europe and Italy) or the riverside space, in the case of port cities such as Naples or Lisbon, will become the 'centre' of the city.
   As we will see in this issue, the multiplication of centres will take a particular form in the case of Lisbon, when the political-administrative centre of the King will be located in the space of the economic and commercial centre, splitting it from the religious centre for a period, but grouping this religious centre with the site of the royal power: the palace.
   This movement of centres presupposes both a physical reorganization of the old ones - with practices of creative destruction - and the construction of new ones, with the consequent displacement and sharing of the primary elements of urbanization (Rossi 1968). In any case, in a structurally religious society, the Church is present in the new centres with the construction of monuments, convents, churches and cathedrals.
   The organization models of the city, the models about the form of its layout, come both from the classical era -reworked by Scholasticism- and from the practices linked to the different processes of colonization and settlement that occur throughout Europe, as well as the gradual introduction of Renaissance thought.

AB  - During the first semester of 2021, all of Brazil has suffered an intense wave of COVID- 19 associated with the Gamma variant. In July, the first cases of Delta variant were detected in the state of Rio de Janeiro. In this work, we have employed phylodynamic methods to analyse more than 1 600 genomic sequences of Delta variant collected until September in Rio de Janeiro to recon-struct how this variant has surpassed Gamma and dispersed throughout the state. After the introduction of Delta, it has initially spread mostly in the homonymous city of Rio de Janeiro, the most populous of the state. In a second stage, dispersal occurred to mid-and long -range cities, which acted as new close -range hubs for spread. We observed that the substitution of Gamma by Delta was possibly caused by its higher viral load, a proxy for transmissibility. This variant turnover prompted a new surge in cases, but with lower lethality than was observed during the peak caused by Gamma. We reason that high vaccination rates in the state of Rio de Janeiro were possibly what prevented a higher number of deaths.

AB  - Shopping malls are important equipment that influence the redefinition of centralities and the spatial logic of sociability and contemporary urban conflicts. In this sense, this article aims to discuss and analyze socio-spatial conflicts produced by the implementation of a shopping mall in the Juiz de Fora (MG), located near a neighborhood formed by the quilombola community, where a social movement was organized that challenged actions of the Independencia Shopping. We opted for a methodology with interviews and research from secondary sources, with emphasis on social networks (Facebook) and corporate websites. It was concluded that the polycentric city increases the complexity in the reproduction of spaces and enhances the occurrence of conflicts by spatially expanding the interest of capitalist agents in the urban production, with the shopping mall as one of the central elements.

AB  - Sylvain George is one of the most interesting French filmmakers working today. He has made a series of poetic, experimental documentaries about migrants and refugees around Calais and has brought together migrant figures and Occupy movements in his two 'city symphonies', Vers Madrid (The Burning Bright) (2012) and Paris est une fete (2018). The principal theoretical influence on George's cinema is the work of Walter Benjamin. This article shows how certain essential Benjaminian concepts can help us understand George's films as they seek productive alignments and collisions between contemporary mobilisations and the history embedded in urban spaces. But it also argues that, even as they point towards a renewal of fundamental European political traditions, they show that a politics no longer limited by national belonging remains to be found.

AB  - Green infrastructure is presented as a novel and innovative approach in the current environmental planning discourse, but how new is it really? An historical overview of planning ideas in both the urban and the rural contexts indicates that the concept, if not the term, "green infrastructure" has a very long and distinguished pedigree in the field of landscape and open space planning. To determine how far the concept is indeed new, definitions of green infrastructure from the literature are examined. While "green" has long been loosely used as a synonym for natural features and vegetation in the planning context, "infrastructure" is the part of the term which is really novel. Infrastructure is otherwise understood as being either "technical" or "social", and the common features of these otherwise very different forms are considered in order to gain a better understanding of how they might also relate to a new interpretation of green infrastructure. A number of international case studies of different "green infrastructure" projects are then presented, again to better understand their common features and potential relationship to other infrastructure types. Finally, the necessity to consider green and blue areas together and to take them as seriously as other forms of infrastructure is emphasized. The developing climate and biodiversity crises underline the urgency of implementing a flexible and multifunctional green-blue infrastructure system. This must be carefully integrated into the existing fabric of both urban and rural landscapes and will require an appropriately resourced administration and management system, reflecting its beneficial impacts.

AB  - Over the recent two decades, land use/land cover (LULC) drastically changed in Estonia. Even though the population decreased by 11%, noticeable agricultural and forest land areas were turned into urban land. In this work, we analyzed those LULC changes by mapping the spatial characteristics of LULC and urban expansion in the years 2000-2019 in Estonia. Moreover, using the revealed spatiotemporal transitions of LULC, we simulated LULC and urban expansion for 2030. Landsat 5 and 8 data were used to estimate 147 spectral-textural indices in the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. After that, 19 selected indices were used to model LULC changes by applying the hybrid artificial neural network, cellular automata, and Markov chain analysis (ANN-CA-MCA). While determining spectral-textural indices is quite common for LULC classifications, utilization of these continues indices in LULC change detection and examining these indices at the landscape scale is still in infancy. This country-wide modeling approach provided the first comprehensive projection of future LULC utilizing spectral-textural indices. In this work, we utilized the hybrid ANN-CA-MCA model for predicting LULC in Estonia for 2030; we revealed that the predicted changes in LULC from 2019 to 2030 were similar to the observed changes from 2011 to 2019. The predicted change in the area of artificial surfaces was an increased rate of 1.33% to reach 787.04 km(2) in total by 2030. Between 2019 and 2030, the other significant changes were the decrease of 34.57 km(2) of forest lands and the increase of agricultural lands by 14.90 km(2) and wetlands by 9.31 km(2). These findings can develop a proper course of action for long-term spatial planning in Estonia. Therefore, a key policy priority should be to plan for the stable care of forest lands to maintain biodiversity.

AB  - German cockroaches (Blattella germanica L.) harbor and disperse medically important pathogens and are a source of allergens that impact human health and wellbeing. Management of this pest requires an understanding of their distribution and dispersal. In this study, we collected German cockroaches from three apartment buildings in New Jersey, USA. We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from DNA extractions using next generation sequencing. We analyzed the SNPs and characterized cockroach population genetic structure using F-st, principal component, phylogenetic, and STRUCTURE analyses. We found significant differences in German cockroach population structure among the buildings. Within buildings, we found variable population structure that may be evidence for multiple colonization events. This study shows that SNPs derived from next generation sequencing provide a powerful tool for analyzing the genetic population structure of these medically important pests.

AB  - This study investigates microplastic contamination in the midstream to downstream of the Cisadane River and its confluence with the Java Sea. The abundance ranged between 13.33 and 113.33 particles mxe213; 3 in surface water samples. Microplastic abundance in the downstream area was higher than midstream. We discovered 11 microplastic polymer types, with polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene dominating (>70%) the chemical composition study result, which we hypothesized was owing to their ubiquitous use in daily household and industrial activities. Microplastic fragments with a diameter of 500-1000 m predominated in surface water samples. This study identifies possible microplastics pollution hotspots throughout the Cisadane rivers and selects sites that require additional sampling. Runoff from cities and landfills has the potential to have a significant impact on the accumulation and movement of microplastics from the inland to the Cisadane estuarine area. Additional research is necessary to determine how and where these microplastics particles enter rivers.

AB  - The suburbs around Shanghai have a complex river network and a unique Chinese water-town culture. The riparian landscape in the rural Qingxi area has important regional, ecological, and social significance; it serves as an important part of the local bioclimate, but the existing studies on river vegetation did not pay enough attention to the riparian landscape in the countryside around the metropolis. The goal of this study was to examine a comprehensive evaluation model for the river plant landscape in the countryside surrounding a high-density metropolis such as Shanghai in the face of the national policy of rural revitalization and the low-carbon development problem, and to propose optimization strategies accordingly. Therefore, in this study, we selected 91 rivers in the Qingxi area and investigated their plant communities. According to the characteristics of the riparian landscape and its relationship with the river environment and local bioclimate, we classified the 91 riparian landscapes into four types of quadrats: natural landscape, residential recreation, roadside linear landscape, and agricultural landscape. In addition, based on the 13 indicator layers under the categories of ecological carrying capacity, landscape beauty, and social service, we calculated the comprehensive evaluation value (CEV) and comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) of 91 river quadrants using specific formulas to scientifically evaluate the riparian landscape in the rural Qingxi area of Shanghai. Finally, based on the existing problems summarized through data analysis, the researchers proposed five optimization directions: (1) increasing vegetation diversity, (2) choosing native and culturally representative species, (3) improving waterfront planting design, (4) achieving ecological riverbank construction, and (5) building greenway systems and recreational spaces. This study proposed an innovative evaluation model for the riparian vegetation landscape and tested its feasibility by site survey, which provided new visions for future rural landscape research.

AB  - This paper uses spatial statistical techniques to reflect on geographies of COVID-19 infections in metropolitan Melbourne. We argue that the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has become widespread since early 2020 in Melbourne, typically proceeds through multiple built environment attributes - diversity, destination accessibility, distance to transit, design, and density. The spread of the contagion is institutionalised within local communities and postcodes, and reshapes movement practices, discourses, and structures of administrative politics. We demonstrate how a focus on spatial patterns of the built environment can inform scholarship on the spread of infections associated with COVID-19 pandemic and geographies of infections more broadly, by highlighting the consistency of built environment influences on COVID-19 infections across three waves of outbreaks. A focus on the built environment influence seeks to enact visions of the future as new variants emerge, illustrating the importance of understanding geographies of infections as global cities adapt to 'COVID-normal' living. We argue that understanding geographies of infections within cities could be a springboard for pursuing sustainable urban development via inclusive compact, mixed-use development and safe public transport.

AB  - Measurement of restoration success is a challenge, especially in multiple-stressed urban systems. Standard indicators for ecological assessment may be too robust to indicate small but continuous improvements. Thus, a standardized method of the European Water Framework Directive (EU WFD) is extended by additional samplings of macroinvertebrates in the urban Emscher catchment. The aim is to prove whether additional sampling adds value to interpretate restoration success. According to the EU WFD, the Emscher's ecological status and potential are mainly identified as good to moderate regarding biological components of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates, whereas bad regarding fish communities. The additional sampling improves the quality of the biological dataset, because twice as many species of macroinvertebrates are found compared to the WFD method. Hence, the additional sampling allows a stronger indication for community ordination, and community metrics describing diversity, dispersal, and feeding preferences as well as by disentangling the roles of environmental variables. Nevertheless, it is concluded that the standardized and simple WFD method is sufficient to capture the most relevant effects. However, if the budget is allowed and information on the species pool, nature conservation, or aspects of early indication are needed, it may be useful to implement an additional sampling of macroinvertebrates.

AB  - Phytolacca is the largest genus of Phytolaccaceae. Owing to interspecific hybridization, infraspecific variation, and apparent weak genetic control of many qualitative characters, which have obscured boundaries between species, the classification and phylogenetic relationships of this genus are unclear. Native Phytolacca is disjunctly distributed in America, eastern Asia, and Africa, and the biogeographic history of the genus remained unresolved. In this study, we used the whole chloroplast genome and three markers (nrDNA, rbcL, and matK) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within Phytolacca, analyze divergence times, and infer biogeographic histories. The phylogenetic results indicate that Phytolacca is monophyletic, which is inconsistent with the infrageneric classification based on morphology. According to the divergence time estimation, Phytolacca began to diversify at approximately 20.30 Ma during the early Miocene. Central America, including Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia, is the center of species diversity. Biogeographical analysis indicated five main dispersal events and Phytolacca originated from Central and South America. Birds may be the primary agents of dispersal because of the fleshy fruiting of Phytolacca. This study extended sampling and added more genetic characteristics to infer the evolutionary history of Phytolacca, providing new insights for resolving the classification and elucidating the dispersal events of Phytolacca.

AB  - This paper analyzes and studies the structure and parameters of the VGGNet network model and selects the most commonly used and efficient VGG-16 as the prototype of the improved model. A multiscale sampling layer is added at the end of the VGG-16 convolution part so that the model can input images of any size for training and testing while reducing the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. This improves the training speed of the model under the premise of ensuring the accuracy. This paper uses multisource street spatial data combined with geographic information spatial analysis technology to measure and evaluate the spatial quality of streets in the main urban area. From the three dimensions of vitality, safety, and greenness of urban street space quality, a systematic structure for evaluation and analysis of street space quality is constructed. Street vitality includes eight index factors: entrance and exit density, street furniture density, street sketch density, street characteristic landscape density, POI density, POI diversity, commercial POI ratio, and street population density. There are five index factors: degree, roadside parking occupancy ratio, traffic signal system density, sidewalk width proportion, and street facility density. We use ArcGIS to build an index factor information database for statistical analysis and visualization. According to the natural discontinuous point classification method, the safety level of urban street public space is divided into five grades. The sample size of the first four grades has a small fluctuation range. The sample sizes are 153, 172, 153, and 158, respectively, accounting for 21%, 23%, 21%, and 21% of the total street samples, of which the first two grades occupy a total of 44%, so 44% of the streets in the main urban area have a low-quality level of street space. Level 5 has a sample of 102 streets, accounting for 14%, with an average street space quality value of 0.43.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding biological invasion mechanisms is crucial to design effective management strategies preventing their impacts on ecosystems. If the role of long-distance dispersal and age-dependent fecundity in plant invasion speed has been characterized in theory, empirical support is still rare given the difficulty to jointly fit demographic and spread parameters of dynamic models to available data. We proposed a statistical model to fit such parameters to heterogeneous observations collected across space and time. We can directly test hypotheses on the importance of various mechanisms in a past invasion. We demonstrated the potential of this method by determining the roles of human-mediated long-distance dispersal and age-dependent fecundity in the invasion of the shrub Plectranthus barbatus in South Africa. Our model revealed a massive wave of spread driven by human-mediated long-distance dispersal and originating from the cities of first introduction. The species completed its invasion of all favorable areas a few years after, in the mid-1990s. Without human-mediated long-distance dispersal, the maximum population would have been obly 30% of the current population. The delayed reproductive maturity explained the invasion lag phase. It highlights the importance of early eradication of weedy horticultural alien plants around urban areas to hamper the invasive spread. Plant invasions generate massive ecological and economic costs worldwide. Predicting their spatial dynamics is crucial to the design of effective management strategies and the prevention of invasions. Earlier studies highlighted the crucial role of long-distance dispersal in explaining the speed of many invasions. In addition, invasion speed depends highly on the duration of its lag phase, which may depend on the scaling of fecundity with age, especially for woody plants, even though empirical proof is still rare. Bayesian dynamic species distribution models enable the fitting of process-based models to partial and heterogeneous observations using a state-space modeling approach, thus offering a tool to test such hypotheses on past invasions over large spatial scales. We use such a model to explore the roles of long-distance dispersal and age-structured fecundity in the transient invasion dynamics of Plectranthus barbatus, a woody plant invader in South Africa. Our lattice-based model accounts for both short and human-mediated long-distance dispersal, as well as age-structured fecundity. We fitted our model on opportunistic occurrences, accounting for the spatio-temporal variations of the sampling effort and the variable detection rates across datasets. The Bayesian framework enables us to integrate a priori knowledge on demographic parameters and control identifiability issues. The model revealed a massive wave of spatial spread driven by human-mediated long-distance dispersal during the first decade and a subsequent drastic population growth, leading to a global equilibrium in the mid-1990s. Without long-distance dispersal, the maximum population would have been equivalent to 30% of the current equilibrium population. We further identified the reproductive maturity at three years old, which contributed to the lag phase before the final wave of population growth. Our results highlighted the importance of the early eradication of weedy horticultural alien plants around urban areas to hamper and delay the invasive spread.

AB  - After 1990, population movements in the U.S. experienced significant shifts as immigrants settled in new destination cities, wealthier residents moved into city centers, and suburbs experienced increased racial diversity and poverty. The American South, with its sprawling suburban landscape, stands at the confluence of these trends as migrants flocked to its metro areas. Still, it remains a region that is under researched. To better understand the conditions of the growing population of color in the South, this work asks three questions: (1) from 1990 to 2019 where did populations live? (2) Where were they growing? And (3) how did this changed over time? To examine the residential patterns of Whites, Blacks, Asians, and Latinxs in the Atlanta metro area, this work contributes a spatial stock-flow model. I add an intrinsic conditional autoregressive spatial parameter (Besag et al Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics 43(1):1-20, 1991) to a stock-flow framework examined across three time periods: 2000, 2010, 2015-2019. This work finds that the racial-ethnic composition within the City of Atlanta boundaries remains one that is predominantly Black and White as Asians and Latinx largely settle outside of city boundaries alongside expressways. However, the Bayesian models also demonstrate that populations of color also have the highest growth rates in Whiter neighborhoods though growth in these neighborhoods do not necessarily point to increases in neighborhood education and income. And rather than inner-city gentrification or White flight into inner-suburbs, there is a movement of Whites to the outskirts of metro Atlanta. For all models, there remains a persistent positive effect of new housing for population growth and concentration across all racial-ethnic groups.

AB  - The rapid increase in deportations during the last decade has provided multiple avenues to analyze the experiences of deportees immediately after deportation. More than 90% of the deportations to Mexico occur in border cities. Deporting people to the border is problematic since most of these deportees are not familiar with the area and do not have a social support network. On top of that, Mexican border cities are experiencing a growing spiral of violence due to the aftermath effects of the "Mexican drug war." Within this context, migrant shelters have become one of the few survival resources for deportees. Using an ethnographic approach, in this study, I investigate how violence is not singular but multiple and multilayered by inspecting deportation policies and practices as the junction where migrant shelters interact with cartel forces and state-made violence to support deported migrants. The paper demonstrates how deportation policies produce or perpetuate various forms of violence toward Mexican deportees in already hyper-violent border cities in Tamaulipas. The empirical findings shed light on how violence against migrants is not exclusively about cartel forces. It is a matter of institutional and structural violence coming from US deportation policies and practices that migrant shelters can hardly handle. Therefore, in this paper, I approach violence not exclusively as direct violence that inflicts physical pain but as a complex process that uncovers other more subtle forms of structural and symbolic violence, carrying nonphysical injuries that can be more enduring and traumatic than those caused by physical pain.

AB  - Glyphosate contamination in waters is becoming a major health problem that needs to be urgently addressed, as accidental spraying, drift, or leakage of this highly water-soluble herbicide can impact aquatic ecosystems. Researchers are increasingly concerned about exposure to glyphosate and the risks its poses to human health, since it may cause substantial damage, even in small doses. The detection of glyphosate residues in waters is not a simple task, as it requires complex and expensive equipment and qualified personnel. New technological tools need to be designed and developed, based on proven, but also cost-efficient, agile, and user-friendly, analytical techniques, which can be used in the field and in the lab, enabled by connectivity and multiplatform software applications. This article presents the design, development, and testing of an innovative low-cost visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectrometer (called SpectroGLY), based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which allows potential glyphosate contamination in waters to be detected. SpectroGLY combines the functional concept of a traditional lab spectrometer with the IoT technological concept, enabling the integration of several connectivity options for rural and urban settings and digital visualization and monitoring platforms (Mobile App and Dashboard Web). Thanks to its portability, it can be used in any context and provides results in 10 min. Additionally, it is unnecessary to transfer the sample to a laboratory (optimizing time, costs, and the capacity for corrective actions by the authorities). In short, this article proposes an innovative, low-cost, agile, and highly promising solution to avoid potential intoxications that may occur due to ingestion of water contaminated by this herbicide.

AB  - Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is a major mosquito-borne viral disease. Studies have reported a strong correlation between weather, the abundance of Aedes aegypti, the vector of DHF virus, and dengue incidence. However, this conclusion has been based on the general climate pattern of wide regions. In general, however, the human population, level of infrastructure, and land-use change in rural and urban areas often produce localized climate patterns that may influence the interaction between climate, vector abundance, and dengue incidence. Thoroughly understanding this correlation will allow the development of a customized and precise local early warning system. To achieve this purpose, we conducted a cohort study, during January-December 2017, in 16 districts in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. In the selected areas, local weather stations and modified light mosquito traps were set up to obtain data regarding daily weather and the abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti. A generalized linear model was applied to analyze the effect of local weather and female adult Ae. aegypti on the number of dengue cases. The result showed a significant non-linear correlation among mosquito abundance, maximum temperature, and dengue cases. Using our model, the data showed that the addition of a single adult Ae. aegypti mosquito increased the risk of dengue infection by 1.8%, while increasing the maximum temperature by one degree decreased the risk by 17%. This finding suggests specific actionable insights needed to supplement existing mosquito eradication programs.

AB  - Studying the characteristics of microorganisms in mine reclamation sites can provide a scientific reference basis for mine land reclamation. Soils in the plough layer (0-20 cm) of the bauxite mine plots in Pingguo city, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, with different reclamation years were used as the research objects. The community structure of soil bacteria was analyzed with high-throughput sequencing technology. The results show the following: (1) Reclamation significantly increased the contents of soil nutrients (p < 0.05). (2) The relative abundances of Proteobacteria were high (22.90 similar to 41.56%) in all plots, and reclamation significantly reduced the relative abundances of Firmicutes (3.42-10.77%) compared to that in the control plot (24.74%) (p < 0.05). The relative abundances of oc-proteobacteria generally increased while the reclamation year increased. The relative abundances of oc-proteobacteria and y-proteobacteria showed significant positive correlations with soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus nutrients (p < 0.01). The relative abundance of Acidobacteria Group 6 showed significant positive correlations with soil exchangeable Ca and Mg (p < 0.01). (3) Bacterial co-occurrence network showed more Copresence interactions in all plots (50.81-58.39%). The reclaimed plots had more nodes, higher modularity, and longer characteristic path length than the control plot, and the keystone taxa changed in different plots. (4) The chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy were the most abundant functional groups in all plots (35.66-48.26%), while reclamation reduced the relative abundance of fermentation groups (1.75-11.21%). The above findings indicated that reclamation improved soil nutrients, changed the bacterial community structure and potential functions, and accelerated the microbial stabilization of the reclaimed soil.

AB  - Antarctica, an isolated and long considered pristine wilderness, is becoming increasingly exposed to the negative effects of ship-borne human activity, and especially the introduction of invasive species. Here, we provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of ship movements into Antarctic waters and a spatially explicit assessment of introduction risk for nonnative marine species in all Antarctic waters. We show that vessels traverse Antarctica's isolating natural barriers, connecting it directly via an extensive network of ship activity to all global regions, especially South Atlantic and European ports. Ship visits are more than seven times higher to the Antarctic Peninsula (especially east of Anvers Island) and the South Shetland Islands than elsewhere around Antarctica, together accounting for 88% of visits to Southern Ocean ecoregions. Contrary to expectations, we show that while the five recognized "Antarctic Gateway cities" are important last ports of call, especially for research and tourism vessels, an additional 53 ports had vessels directly departing to Antarctica from 2014 to 2018. We identify ports outside Antarctica where biosecurity interventions could be most effectively implemented and the most vulnerable Antarctic locations where monitoring programs for high-risk invaders should be established.

AB  - The Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) is one of the most endangered marsupials in Australia. Its known distribution is an approximately 120 km strip of fragmented coastal woodland in north-east Queensland, from north of Townsville to the Tully area. Records are clustered in a number of well-surveyed areas, with significant areas of lowland habitat unsurveyed. Around 30% of historic records fall in areas that were subsequently cleared for farmland, and ongoing clearing and fragmentation of lowland sclerophyll forest continues within the potential distribution. Resolving the distribution is an urgent requirement to guide conservation but Mahogany Gliders are difficult to detect in the field. Species distribution modelling offers a technique for estimating the fine-scale distribution and for targeting further field survey and conservation efforts. We used known occurrence records (N = 481) to predict the distribution of Mahogany Gliders across the Wet Tropics bioregion. We used climatic, topographic and other environmental predictors to generate distribution models using Maxent and Random Forest algorithms, each with two bias correction methods. The predictions revealed that many unknown populations may exist within the currently defined distribution and in important areas beyond this (e.g. Hinchinbrook Island). There was reasonable congruence between models, and we include syntheses of the models to present the most likely current distribution. The most important predictor variables across the models were precipitation seasonality (high seasonality), elevation (generally <100 m), soil type (hydrosols) and vegetation type (including Eucalyptus and Melaleuca woodlands). Our results identify core habitat and reveal key areas that require targeted field surveys. Importantly, the predicted suitable habitat is highly fragmented and ongoing conservation efforts need to improve habitat connectivity and limit further fragmentation.

AB  - When a seismic event occurs, transportation networks play a critical role in undertaking emergency activities such as evacuation and relief supply. Accordingly, to secure their functionality, it is essential to accurately assess their resilience. In particular, this study performs a rigorous probabilistic analysis on the seismic resilience of a transportation network in Istanbul, Turkey. The analysis accuracy is enhanced by considering, along with the structural damage of roadways, the additional disruption mode of network performance caused by the debris falling from damaged objects in their vicinity. Moreover, we obtain the results as a map of resilience measure, which enables us to investigate the disruption inequality across the study area and identify critical factors that govern the system resilience. To enable such sophisticated probabilistic analysis, a Bayesian network (BN) model is developed that involves various types of information from the hazard process to the performance of structures and systems. Then, the BN is quantified by identifying and compiling a comprehensive list of datasets. Thereby, this study analyses large-scale systems involving thousands of structures, while providing general probabilistic models and data schema that can be employed for other transportation networks.

AB  - Gentrification is happening in cities all across the United States. Consequently, some Black communities that were intentionally segregated and under-resourced are experiencing capital investments and demographic changes. These gentrification-induced racial and socioeconomic shifts impact many local institutions, namely school districts. Given this, there is an emerging body of research on schools and gentrification. However, less research has examined the actions of school districts as institutional actors in gentrification. This study examines how two school districts' actions mediate school gentrification. Using a theorization of gentrification as a process of racial capitalism, we draw on interviews with 26 principals across both districts. Our findings suggest that districts' actions influence school gentrification by mediating the movement of Black and other youth of color to various schools through cycles of differential investments across the districts. We conclude with implications for future research.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to determine whether and how the fruit-foraging behaviors of two frugivorous carnivorans, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and Japanese badger (Meles anakuma), are influenced by the presence of humans. In the first investigation, we contrasted the frequency and duration of foraging visits to fruit-bearing trees in an urban forest and a mountain forest. In the second investigation, we employed a modeling approach to ascertain whether the degree of shelter affected tree selection in the urban forest by these frugivorous species. The results of the first investigation showed that both species foraged almost solely at night in the urban forest and had significantly shorter visit times in the urban forest than in the mountain forest. The second investigation revealed that both species selected to forage in sheltered places where the forest floor was covered with vegetation. We found that fruit production did not affect tree choice in these places, indicating that the mammals prioritize avoiding humans over effective foraging in places with more plentiful fruits. These tendencies to forage at night and in areas with adequate shelter indicate that these species have adapted their behaviors to avoid humans in urban environments.

AB  - Simple Summary The free-ranging unowned domestic cat (unowned-not under human control with respect to movement and sexual behaviour), living in the Anthropocene, can live a strictly solitary life or in socially structured groups, depending on environmental conditions. This paper explores the evidence for evolution of new traits (behavioural, morphological, physiological, immunological) in domestic cats, to adapt to the variety of ecosystems they now successfully inhabit. While the domestic cat ancestor lived a strictly solitary life, unowned free-ranging cats today may live in multi-male/multi-female colonies in urban city centres, where they are dependent on food provided by people. Urban free-ranging cats are now more social, which has been reflected in different breeding patterns, lower infanticide, more frequent affiliative interactions in general, and different spatial groupings. This means there is a potential for domestic cat behaviour to be 'misunderstood'. Recognising that negative impacts of free-ranging domestic cats in urban fringe areas must be mitigated, we discuss how understanding behavioural plasticity and other recently evolved traits of domestic cats may lead to management strategies that maximise health and welfare of cats, wildlife, and humans. Welfare and management decisions for unowned free-ranging cats in urban environments should no longer be based on knowledge about behavioural ecology of solitary cats living and breeding in more natural 'wild' environments. We provide evidence that urban free-ranging domestic cats in the Anthropocene have responded to rapidly changing environments, such as abundance of food and higher population densities of conspecifics by adapting their behaviour (behavioural plasticity-the ability of a genotype (individual) to express different behaviours according to its environment) and social organisation to living in complex social groups, especially those living in colonies. Urban free-ranging cats are now more social, as demonstrated by different breeding patterns, lower infanticide, more frequent affiliative interactions in general, and different spatial groupings. We argue that this knowledge should be disseminated widely, and inform future research and strategies used to manage free-ranging cats across environments. Understanding behavioural plasticity and other recently evolved traits of domestic cats may lead to management strategies that maximise health and welfare of cats, wildlife, and humans-otherwise domestic cat behaviour may be 'misunderstood'. Importantly, interdisciplinary research using expertise from biological and social sciences, and engaging human communities, should evaluate these management strategies to ensure they maintain optimal welfare of free-ranging domestic cats while preserving biodiversity and protecting wildcats.

AB  - Although it is generally accepted that wetlands in drylands are subject to higher fire frequencies than wetlands in humid regions, little is known about how wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings mediate runoff and material fluxes in the post-fire catchment landscape. This paper evaluates the intermediary role of wetlands in water and sediment dispersal through a wet season that followed the March 2015 wildfire in the Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town. Field and laboratory analyses of the development and dynamics of soil water repellency were conducted across terrestrial hillslope, river riparian zone and hillslope seepage wetland sites. The latter two sites had significantly lower soil water repellency than the terrestrial site immediately preceding the first large rainfall event, and soil moisture emerged as a significant predictor of soil water repellency, consistent with previous research. Remote sensing analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery revealed that the first emergence of new vegetation occurred within wetlands and other moisture-rich areas across the catchment, likely associated with intact rhizome networks of the predominant sprouting vegetation in these areas. This post-fire green flush could have served to enhance post-fire infiltration due to macropore flow along rhizome networks, and to reduce early wet season runoff and erosion due to the rapid establishment of rainfall-intercepting leaf and stem structures. Longitudinal investigations of post-fire river channel and bed sediment characteristics detected a transition in bed composition from gravel to sand through hillslope-channel coupling and channel bank erosion, and effective conveyance of sand through the catchment to a constructed wetland at the catchment outlet. Suspended sediment sampling upstream, within and downstream of this wetland suggested a relative sediment trap efficiency of similar to 87 to 99%, supporting previous observations of post construction aggradation at the head of the wetland, with serious implications for long term wetland maintenance and management. Insights from field and remote sensing studies were used to develop a conceptual geospatial model of the role of wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings in post-fire catchment sediment (dis)connectivity. Hillslope seepage wetlands located across the burned region of the catchment were shown to play an important role in hillslope surface sediment trapping and erosion control, contrary to common assumptions, and sediment connectivity modelling is recommended as a tool for further research aimed at understanding the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in material fluxes in post-fire landscapes.

AB  - Data of particulate matter (PM) of particle size 2.5 (PM2.5) obtained from September 2017 to December 2019 using 247 low-cost PM2.5 sensors were analyzed to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 in Changwon City, South Korea. The highest average PM2.5 concentration (33 mu g/m3) was observed in winter (November to March); the lowest average concentration (18.60 mu g/m3) was measured in summer (June to October). The PM2.5 concentrations were the highest (31.81 mu g/m3) during the morning rush hour (06:00 to 09:00 h) and lowest (23.82 mu g/m3) in the afternoon (15:00 to 18:00 h). In agricultural areas, the highest average PM2.5 concentrations (37.26 and 34.01 mu g/m3) were observed in February from 06:00 to 09:00 h. High PM2.5 concentrations were recorded at similar times in agricultural areas. This finding was because activities generating PM2.5, such as illegal incineration, occur in these areas. These high concentrations could cause damage to nearby vulnerable groups, such as elderly people. The results of this study could be useful for urban and environmental planning, reducing PM2.5 concentrations, and promoting sustainable development in urban areas.

AB  - This paper investigates how the prefiguration of an alternative future by social movements produces new space through a processual dynamic. A case study of the Indignados movement in Barcelona shows how mobilizations evolved from symbolizing an alternative future in the square to constructing alternatives in the city in the post-encampment period. In the alternative projects forged during the post-square period, activists re-appropriated urban spaces and transformed them, wanting to live differently and to produce a radically different city, now. We conceptualize these new spaces as 'prefigurative territories', integrating the seemingly divergent anarchist-inspired theory of prefiguration with Lefebvre's Marxist theory of space production. This integration helps to capture how participants strategized the type of evolution of the movement after the square as well as the type of space being produced. While the square's encampment was a detournement of a capitalist space with limited spatial creativeness, in post-square counter-spaces the prefiguration of a different society takes an offensive stance, setting concrete objectives to counter-plan the state's organization of space. Counter-spaces arise through a dialectical movement that preserves the first two dimensions of prefiguration, a consistency between means and ends and a proleptic foretaste of the future society, that realize and become the third dimension of created alternatives. This dialectical movement unfolds through three processes: experimentation, demonstration, and proliferation through 'open prefiguration'. Prefigurative territories, we argue, signal strategic horizons, but members struggle with conflicts when opening up.

AB  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) make up the majority of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses among young people in China. Understanding HIV transmission dynamics among the MSM population is, therefore, crucial for the control and prevention of HIV infections, especially for some newly reported genotypes of HIV. This study presents a metapopulation model considering the impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to investigate the geographical spread of a hypothetically new genotype of HIV among MSM in Guangdong, China. We use multiple data sources to construct this model to characterize the behavioural dynamics underlying the spread of HIV within and between 21 prefecture-level cities (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, etc.) in Guangdong province: the online social network via a gay social networking app, the offline human mobility network via the Baidu mobility website, and self-reported sexual behaviours among MSM. Results show that PrEP initiation exponentially delays the occurrence of the virus for the rest of the cities transmitted from the initial outbreak city; hubs on the movement network, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan are at a higher risk of 'earliest' exposure to the new HIV genotype; most cities acquire the virus directly from the initial outbreak city while others acquire the virus from cities that are not initial outbreak locations and have relatively high betweenness centralities, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shantou. This study provides insights in predicting the geographical spread of a new genotype of HIV among an MSM population from different regions and assessing the importance of prefecture-level cities in the control and prevention of HIV in Guangdong province. This article is part of the theme issue 'Data science approach to infectious disease surveillance'.

AB  - Context. Domestic cats (Fells catus) hold an important place in human society but can negatively impact ecosystems when roaming freely outdoors. Aims. Specific research goals included identifying factors associated with cat abundance over the year. Methods. We deployed trail cameras in Wellington County, Ontario, Canada to estimate what habitat characteristics were associated with cats in the spring/summer and the fall/winter. Within a subset of our study area, we also compared these findings to a previous study that used walking surveys. Key results. In the spring/summer, cat abundance was positively related to proximity to buildings and negatively related to distance to agriculture. In the fall/winter, cat abundance was negatively related to the presence of coyotes (Canis latrans) and positively related to proximity to major roads. Overall, cat abundance was higher in urban than rural locations, and higher in spring/summer compared to fall/winter. Both our results from trail cameras and walking surveys from a previous study identified that median income, woodlots, and major roads were important habitat characteristics associated with cats during the summer, and we discuss the costs and benefits associated with both approaches. Conclusions. Free-roaming cats are associated with different habitat characteristics in spring/summer versus fall/winter and vary in abundance across landscape type and season.

AB  - Mudeungsan National Park is a tall mountain located in the middle of Gwangju City. It is a UNESCO Global Geopark recognised as a rich repository of biological resources with high plant species diversity. However, hiking trails created around the exposed bedrock on the slopes around the mountain's summit cause soil loss and habitat destruction. To conserve the plant ecosystem of Mudeungsan National Park sustainably, the present study was conducted to find a species that could indicate the conservation status of the ecosystem. We the sociological relationships between plants with the aim of restoring habitats and species diversity around the summit bedrock at Mudeungsan National Park. In particular, our goal was to provide basic data for projects aimed at improving future hiking trails in national parks by analysing the sociological relationships between Potentilla ancistrifolia var. dickinsii, which is a phytogeographically important plant, and its companion plants. Findings showed high centrality of Miscanthus Sinensis, Lespedeza bicolor, Rhododendron schlippenbachii, Carex lanceolate, Arundinella hirta, and Rubus crataegifolius in the plant social network on the summit ridge of Mudeungsan. The analysis of the plant social network around P. ancistrifolia var. dickinsii showed that the extent of destruction of the ridge ecosystem could be determined by the changes in P. ancistriflolia. var. dickinsii cover, indicating that this species could be used as an indicator species.

AB  - The Canadian urban agriculture movement marks a change in urban land-use policies that includes a greater diversity of gardeners as views on sustainable agriculture promotes local food movements. Benefits of urban agriculture are well documented in the social science, environmental and health literature. Much of the literature on urban food-gardens in Canada focuses on community gardens and school gardens and gardening programmes, while there has been little attempt to gather and synthesise this research with a focus on the governance and management of grassroots urban agri-food organisations. We have undertaken through a systematic scoping review to reveal the extent of the current body of knowledge surrounding urban grassroots agri-food organisations in Canada, as well as governance and management paradigms and challenges. Of the Canadian studies, 15 were qualitative case studies (surveys, observations, etc.), 11 were exploration/analysis papers (analysis of primary research collected elsewhere), one was a literature review and 1 was a quantitative analysis. Significant challenges in grassroots food-gardening are explored. We found that for greater success of urban agriculture, municipal policymakers need to intentionally and radically shift policy to plan for and integrate urban agriculture networks into the urban environment without taking over the networks themselves. We also find that there is a lack of broad research into the influence of gender dynamics on the organisation and management of urban agriculture or community gardens.

AB  - Violent protests and ethno-communal violence in Ethiopia have been on the rise since 2015. Whilst the country's capital has mostly been spared, protests have occurred in areas surrounding the capital, its suburbs and, to a lesser extent, even in its city centre. This article aims to answer how Addis Ababa residents make sense of and (dis)engage from/in violent protests and ethno-communal violence where they occur. The article explores the perceptions and experiences of established middle-class residents in the capital, drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted between June 2020 and May 2021. The article finds that, due to the city's multi-ethnic character and the residents' strong metropolitan identity, ethnic identity has not constituted a powerful tool for political mobilisation of residents within the capital. Claims based on ethnicity made by non-residents towards the capital's resources have largely been rejected by Addis Ababans. Instead, residents have collectively defended their right to the city. The federal state's readiness to intervene in protests in the capital has further discouraged and countered public protests and communal conflicts. The article reveals that, whilst 'exceptional' at the first glance, the peaceful normality of Addis Ababa has relied on ignoring conflicts within Ethiopia's ethnic-based political settlement and has hidden ordinary, everyday forms of structural violence and conflict.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between use and investor diversity, spatial accessibility, and high street retail rents. Spatial quantitative analysis of the high street retail sector remains an underdeveloped area so this paper seeks to bridge this gap and contribute to the debate on the adaptability of urban retailing centres by adopting a spatial fixed-effects panel modelling approach. The empirical findings reveal that diversity and richness in property use tend to have a significant positive impact on retail rental values. The influence of ownership richness on rents is positive implying that rents tend to be higher on streets where there is a greater range in the type of landlords. Walkability, as a measure of spatial accessibility, is found to have a negative relationship with market rents. This is perhaps surprising as it had been expected that the most walkable streets in retailing centres to be the most connected and have the highest rents. This contrary finding may be due to large developments interrupting the street network and restricting the choice and movement of pedestrians. Location on the prime retail pitch has a significant positive relationship with shop rents, whereas proximity to transportation nodes has a less consistent influence.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is an indigenous primary vector of dengue and Zika viruses in China. Understanding the population spatial genetic structure, migration, and gene flow of vector species is critical to effectively preventing and controlling vector-borne diseases. The genetic variation and population structure of Ae. albopictus populations collected from 22 cities along the Yangtze River Basin were investigated with nine microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial CoxI gene. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.534 to 0.871. The observed number of alleles (Na) values ranged from 5.455 to 11.455, and the effective number of alleles (Ne) values ranged from 3.106 to 4.041. The Shannon Index (I) ranged from 1.209 to 1.639. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) values ranged from 0.487 to 0.545. The F-IS value ranged from 0.047 to 0.212. All Ae. albopictus populations were adequately allocated to three clades with significant genetic differences. Haplotype 2 is the most primitive molecular type and forms 26 other haplotypes after one or more site mutations. The rapid expansion of high-speed rail, aircraft routes and highways along the Yangtze River Basin have accelerated the dispersal and communication of mosquitoes, which appears to have contributed to inhibited population differentiation and promoted genetic diversity among Ae. albopictus populations.

AB  - Urban expansion has contributed to the loss of habitat for range restricted species across the globe. Managing wildlife populations within these urban settings presents the challenge of balancing human and wildlife needs. Jollyville Plateau Salamanders (Eurycea tonkawae) are a range restricted, federally threatened, species of neotenic brook salamander endemic to central Texas. Almost the entire geographic range of E. tonkawae is embedded in the Austin, Cedar Park, and Round Rock metropolitan areas of Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. Among E. tonkawae occupied sites, Brushy Creek Spring has experienced some of the most extensive anthropogenic disturbance. Today the site consists of small groundwater outlets that emerge in the seams within a concrete culvert underlying a highway. Salamanders persist within this system though they are rarely detected. Here, we model the occurrence of salamanders within the surface habitat of Brushy Creek Spring using generalized linear models. In the absence of available data regarding the amount of water that is discharged from the spring, we use accumulated rainfall as a proxy for discharge to estimate salamander abundance. Additionally, we present evidence of reproduction, recruitment, and subterranean movement by E. tonkawae throughout this site. Infrastructure maintenance is inevitable at Brushy Creek Spring. We intend for our results to inform when maintenance should occur, i.e., during environmental conditions when salamanders are less likely to be observed in the surface habitat, to avoid unnecessary impacts to this federally threatened species.

AB  - This article begins by tracing the evolution of the imaginary of the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, which over time has become the theater of the representation of power and counter-power. In the twentieth century, the moving image has fixed the different stages of this power struggle. The movement of the "indignados" in 2011 is emblematic of this phenomenon inherited from the audiovisual traces that have constituted a palimpsest of the imaginary of the square, itself synecdoche of the city. Basilio Martin Patino's documentary film, Libre te quiero, shot at the time of the occupation of the square in 2011, puts in scene the recovery of this symbolic space by a people in jubilation.

AB  - Land-Use Cover Changes (LUCCs) are one of the main problems for the preservation of landscapes and natural biodiversity. Protected Areas (PAs) do not escape this threat. Poland is among the European leaders in terms of the variety of landscapes and the share of an area designated as a protected area. However, as many as 78% of the habitats have poor or bad conservation status based on EEA reports. This article analyzes the LUCCs between 2000 and 2018 in various types of the Polish legal forms of nature protection areas and the European Natura 2000 network within the country. The research material was: the data of Corine Land Cover (CLC), the Central Register of Nature Protection Forms, and high-resolution layers, such as HRL and orthophotos. The results were compiled according to the CLC class and forms of protection. The matrix of transformations showed that the most frequently transformed CLC class was 312 (coniferous forest). It was transformed into class 324 (transitional woodland shrubs). The changes in PAs were usually smaller than in the surrounding buffer zones, which may indicate their effectiveness. The exception was the areas of the European Natura 2000 network. The scale of land-cover flows (LCFs) changed within particular forms of protected areas, though afforestation and deforestation predominating in all area types. National reserves and parks were the most stable in terms of land cover structures. However, human settlements increased around the protected areas, potentially increasing threats to their ecological integrity.

AB  - As one of the major bay areas in the world, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) has been experiencing a remarkable urbanization process, accompanied by the deterioration of the thermal environment quality. This study tried to explore how urbanization dynamically and regionally affects the thermal environment, by examining the spatiotemporal variation of the local climate zone (LCZ), the centroid movement of the urban form, and surface urban heat island (SUHI) in GBA during 2013 and 2019. The results revealed that the urban areas have expanded from the central GBA to adjacent cities and the gravity center moved from the urban core to the rural periphery, indicating the ongoing urban expansion in GBA. Meanwhile, the SUHI value was calculated and corresponding spatial association analysis was carried out to clarify the pattern and dynamics of the SUHI spatiotemporal change during the study period. The increased proportion of the slightly high SUHI level and expanded high-high aggregation indicated that the thermal environment of GBA has been heated up. Large increments of SUHI occurred mostly in the areas of non-traditional development and areas with high intensity of urban expansion. These increments were attributed to the land occupation of limited or agricultural development zones for urbanization. This study provides insights into the balance between urban thermal environmental and rapid urbanization. Future researches are recommended to address novel and sustainable urban planning strategies that are able to maintain the required urban growth without deteriorating the thermal environment.

AB  - Soon after seizing power, the Nazi Party launched a variety of building programs intended to transform Germany according to its ideology and ultimately prepare the country for war. Among those initiatives, Nazi officials placed a special emphasis on commissioning monuments, memorials, and other places of memory that indoctrinated the masses into the movement's ideology of racial struggle, sacrifice, and martyrdom on behalf of the party and nation. As the capital city, Berlin occupied a special place in these building programs that would eventually culminate in plans for the construction of massive architectural ensembles of commemorative spaces and places intended to shroud the Nazi movement within notions of the sacred. Although highly critical of traditional established religions and explicitly rejecting cultic associations, the Nazi movement nevertheless drew heavily from ideas of the sacred and sacred places to fashion a political religion that conditioned the masses into unquestioning loyalty and obedience.

AB  - Pedestrian fatality and injury is one of the most concerning issues around the globe. The predictors for such mishaps have been investigated in the developed countries through econometric models and are proven useful techniques. Such studies in the context of developing countries, especially for urban cities, are however still very scarce. Using five years reported pedestrian crash data, this study looks into the performance of three statistical models - Multinomial Logit (MNL), Ordered Logit (OL) and Partial Proportional Odds (PPO) model while examining the impact of various attributes related to pedestrian crashes severity outcomes for Dhaka metropolitan city in Bangladesh. The comparative analysis reveals that the performance of the PPO model is relatively better for the available dataset in terms of identifying critical risk factors. Undivided roadway, heavy vehicles, unfit vehicles, adult drivers with no seat belt use, young and older pedestrians, pedestrian road crossing action are found to be associated with higher probability of fatal injuries. In contrast, one-way traffic movement, daytime, motorcycles and mid-aged pedestrians decrease the likelihood of fatal injury. Based on these identified risk factors, a combined 3-E approach has been suggested to reduce the severity levels of pedestrian in the event of crash occurrence.

AB  - Urban gas pipe network (GPN) is an important infrastructure to guarantee residents' daily life. However, the risk of GPN has become increasingly prominent. Leakage is one of the biggest issues, which is easy to cause fire, explosion, poisoning, and so on. Therefore, the risk assessment of leakage is significant for the safety management of urban GPN. The main idea is to analyze the history accidents and predict the accidents that are happening. This paper explores to construct an integrated assessment model through Bayesian network (BN), Interpretive structural model (ISM), and expert evaluation method. First, the main risk factors of leakage and their coupling relationship are determined to increase the understanding of the complex system. Then, ISM is used to divide the logical network of factors to determine the hierarchical structure of BN. Finally, node probability is evaluated by Expectation-Maximization algorithm with the data collection of 89 real accidents. The model can be used to quantify the coupling strength and influence degree of each factor on the occurrence of leakage (the leakage that can easily lead to accidents, rather than small leaks). Then, the probability of GPN leakage can be predicted under a specific scenario. This study can provide a reference for safety management of GPN to reduce risk and potential loss.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global problem through the cavalier or deliberate disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) by the general public. This has raised concerns that the billions of discarded face masks pose a threat to wildlife through entanglement or, when broken down, through ingestion of derived microplastics. Previous quantitative surveys of the magnitude of such litter have focused on areas where people congregate, such as tourist beaches and large cities. The present survey is the first to provide data on the background level of face mask litter through a landscape of variable land-use. A 250-km transect along an historic road between Montreal and Quebec City (Canada) was surveyed during a walking pilgrimage, revealing an overall density of 0.0001 +/- 0.00006 face masks m(-2). Average densities were significantly higher in areas of human occupation compared to agricultural and forested rural land. However, there was no significant correlation between population size of communities and the number of face masks encountered, nor in litter extent and proximity to municipalities. This may be due to the confounding influence of inter-community differences in scheduled street cleaning operations. Seventy-six percent of face masks were of the disposable surgical variety, with the remaining 24% being reusable cloth masks. This, and the fact that only 10% of the former and none of the latter exhibited broken ear straps, insinuates that the litter could be due to accidental loss rather than inappropriate discarding by individuals en route. Scaling-up these findings in relation to the global road network generates a preliminary background estimate for roadside litter of >17 million face masks. The present study endorses the call made by others to engage citizen scientists in surveying PPE litter, in particular, the thousands who each year walk the medieval pilgrimage routes through the landscape of Europe.

AB  - This article simultaneously analyzes residential relocation, vehicle ownership changes, and travel demand changes while accommodating potential self-selection effects to unravel the causal im-pacts of built environment features on vehicle ownership and travel behavior. Earlier studies on residential mobility have not considered the causal link from objective built environment features to subjective built environment, and rarely control for attitudes and objective built environment features in the empirical analysis. Besides, the literature has not discussed how households perceive neighborhood in terms of children's/women's travel and how that changes by residential relocation and impact mobility decisions. The paper compares built environment impacts on mobility decisions in two adjacent areas in India, Hubli-Dharwad twin cities, that vary by socio-economic and land use contexts. The study notes that Dharwad residents acquired more personal vehicles than Hubli residents, while the proportion of households who relinquished their vehicles is high in Hubli. Post movement, Dharwad residents opted for areas with higher diversity and density than their counterparts in Hubli. In Hubli, households find that their current location does not help their children use active modes to schools, and women find jobs closer to home. The statistical analysis revealed that Hubli residents prefer locations with improved travel conve-niences for women and children. With improvements in the children's travel friendliness, households of both cities decreased vehicle ownership, whereas household vehicle ownership of both cities increased with improvements in women's travel friendliness. In Dharwad, moving to residential areas characterized by high land-use diversity reduces commute travel, while an in-verse association is noted in Hubli. The statistical analysis did not confirm self-selection effects due to travel attitudes. In Dharwad, the latent factor on women's travel friendliness featured in self-selection and shows an independent effect on vehicle ownership. In Hubli, the factor did not have independent effects on vehicle ownership after accommodating travel attitudes and socio-demographics.

AB  - There is a growing need to (1) better understand spaces in which human-animal interactions occur in ways that increase the risk of emerging infectious disease (EID), and (2) identify the opportunities for mitigating EID risk available to urban planning. Peri-urban areas-which are typically under-governed, undergoing significant environmental change and highly susceptible to zoonotic disease transfer-are especially important in this regard. In this research note, we briefly explore how climate change is contributing to both peri-urbanization and EID risk. First, climate change is linked to the displacement of people and other species into peri-urban areas, thereby increasing opportunities for zoonotic disease transfer. Second, whether coastal or inland, peri-urban space, characterized by low resources and inadequate services, is also typically vulnerable to mounting climate impacts including severe weather events, sea level rise, flooding, erosion, drought, salinization and heat waves that create socio-ecological conditions amenable to EID outbreaks. These relationships are particularly alarming given that peri-urban environments abut urban areas creating numerous pathways for the movement of EIDs into larger populations. In this research note, we briefly explore these relationships and illustrate them with a causal loop diagram of climate change-peri-urban displacement-EID interactions based on field work in Malawi. We conclude by emphasizing the need for improved EID risk management and suggest that bringing together the environmental expertise of the conservation community with that of planners through a more convivial urbanism that draws on the concept of working landscape conservation might be a beneficial approach.

AB  - Real-time tracking of video sports targets has been widely used in the sports industry. In order to further improve the accuracy of real-time tracking of sports targets, this paper proposes a real-time tracking method for sports targets in smart cities in the context of Internet+. This method collects data and information on the targets in the sports process, fully considers the diversity of the sports process, and performs real-time tracking and detection of the upgraded sports targets. Finally, the experimental research shows that the method in this paper can track the target accurately and quickly in real time during the movement process, and the accuracy and real-time tracking are relatively better than other tracking methods, which can be used as a powerful tool for subsequent moving target tracking.

AB  - This paper considers how institutions responsible for urban public spaces might promote more equitable access. Focusing on the Gujarati community in Leicester, UK it reveals multiple cultural sensitivities that are often not taken into consideration by institutions, even as they seek to enable participation. The research maps invisible boundaries which prevent ethnic minority communities accessing urban public spaces, including complex dynamics of ethnicity, caste and class. We suggest that considering how residents imagine boundaries traversing the urban environment, and how these bound them from others - including powerful institutions - explains why certain physical spaces and spaces of participation remain inaccessible to them. It finds institutional practices perpetuate these boundaries by not recognising such complexities and how they alter local participation. This research demonstrated that the perception of accessible spaces extends beyond distance and physical accessibility to a desire for power to shape those spaces. By critically examining the factors that delimit movement in space, this article extends understanding of access and participation, highlighting that the two are not in a straightforward linear or hierarchical relationship in which one precedes the other. Rather the two can be sought together, with participation a prerequisite for access. Secondly, effective participation does not just require power to be shared across the boundary between institution and "community" - it should also be distributed across the community, and traverse social boundaries within it.

AB  - Globally, the increased suicide rate of the general population has become a concern not only because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of its associated socioeconomic insecurity, loss of jobs, and economic shocks. This study employed robust fixed-effects panel models to empirically identify the mitigating effects of infectious diseases, via urban parks, on the suicide rate, and to examine gender differences in this regard, based on previous experiences in Seoul, Korea. We found that the differentiating mitigating effect did not significantly affect suicide rates during the 2015 MERS epidemic. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, wherein the number of confirmed cases was very high and diffused nationwide, urban parks significantly reduced the suicide rates for both men and women. The role of parks as a mitigator was more enhanced in cities with a high number of confirmed cases if it was associated with economic shocks. However, this effect was significant only in the suicide rates of men, not women. During a pandemic, urban parks can help maintain social interaction and sustain physical activities (i.e., walking and exercise) while maintaining physical distance. National and local governments should develop urban parks to actively control the suicide rate influenced by movement restriction measures inevitably occurring during the spread of infectious diseases.

AB  - Based on high-resolution underlying surface data and revised urban parameters, a heavy rainfall process that occurred on July 20, 2016 in Beijing was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, version 4.0 (WRF4.0). Sensitivity experiments by changing the land-use type and terrain height, and coupling a slab urban canopy model (UCM) with modified parameters, were carried out to investigate the effects of the urban canopy on this rainstorm process in Beijing. The simulation results confirmed that the urban canopy of Beijing had significant impacts on the heavy rainfall, and its impacts on the rainfall could mainly be attributed to the internal structure and related processes of the urban canopy. The urban canopy increased the convergence of water vapor flux in the urban area, leading to strengthened rainfall in the urban area. In addition, employing the UCM also had an influence. The experiment uncoupled with the UCM suggested that the urban heat island effect of Beijing was relatively weak; its barrier effect of the urban canopy played a leading role that blocked and delayed the movement of rain bands, which divided the airflow and increased the amount of rainfall outside the urban area. The experiment coupled with the UCM took into account the parameters of building height, albedo, and anthropogenic heat, which helped improve the accuracy of rainfall simulation. Its urban heat island phenomenon was obvious, which benefited the convergence and upward movement of urban airflow and promoted the movement of the front and the total rainfall in the urban center.

AB  - Interest in ecoacoustics has resulted in an influx of acoustic data and novel methodologies to classify and relate landscape sound activity to biodiversity and ecosystem health. However, indicators used to summarize sound and quantify the effects of disturbances on biodiversity can be inconsistent when applied across ecological gradients. This study used an acoustic dataset of 487,148 min from 746 sites collected over 4 years across Sonoma County, California, USA, by citizen scientists. We built a custom labeled dataset of soundscape components and applied a deep learning framework to test our ability to predict these soundscape components: human noise (Anthropophony), wildlife vocalizations (Biophony), weather phenomena (Geophony), Quiet periods, and microphone Interference. These soundscape components allowed us to balance predicting variation in environmental recordings and relative time to build a custom labeled dataset. We used these data to quantify soundscape patterns across space and time that could be useful for environmental planning, ecosystem conservation and restoration, and biodiversity monitoring. We describe a pre-trained convolutional neural network, fine-tuned with our sound reference data, with classification achieving an overall F0.75-score of 0.88, precision of 0.94, and recall of 0.80 across the five target soundscape components. We deployed the model to predict soundscape components for all acoustic data and assess their hourly patterns. We noted an increase in Biophony in the early morning and evening, coinciding with peak animal community vocalization (e.g., dawn chorus). Anthropophony increased during morning/daylight hours and was lowest in the evenings, coinciding with diurnal patterns in human activity. Further, we examined soundscape patterns related to geographic properties at recording sites. Anthropophony decreased with increasing distance to major roads, while Quiet increased. Biophony and Quiet were comparable to Anthropophony at more urban/developed and agriculture/barren sites, while Biophony and Quiet were significantly higher than Anthropophony at less-developed shrubland, oak woodland, and conifer forest sites. These results demonstrate that acoustic classification of broad soundscape components is possible with small datasets, and classifications can be applied to a large acoustic dataset to gain ecological knowledge.

AB  - Aim An assessment method that can precisely represent human-vectored long-distance dispersals (HVLDD) is currently in need for the effective management of invasive species. Here, we focussed on HVLDD happening along roads and proposed a path-finding algorithm as a more precise dispersal assessment tool than the most widely used Euclidean distance method by using pine wilt disease (PWD) as a case study. Location Busan Metropolitan City, Republic of Korea. Methods A path-finding algorithm, which calculates distances by considering the spatial distribution of road networks, was tested for its effectiveness in estimating dispersal distances of HVLDD events. To this end, annual HVLDD cases were classified from entire PWD occurrence data from 2016 to 2019, and their dispersal distances were calculated using the path-finding algorithm and the Euclidean distance method. We constructed potential dispersal ranges based on the occurrence points in 2016, 2017 and 2018 using the respective year's mean dispersal distance for both methods, and their performances in accounting for each subsequent year's HVLDD cases were compared to determine which method calculated more precise distances. The information on which road class contributed more to dispersal occurrences and distances was analysed as well using the proposed algorithm. Results The potential dispersal ranges of the path-finding algorithm accounted for more future anthropogenic infection cases than the ones that used the Euclidean distance method, validating its higher functionality. It also revealed that most HVLDDs started and ended on small roads, and large roads constituted the majority of the total dispersal length. Main conclusions The path-finding algorithm has proven to be a more effective dispersal assessment method for HVLDD events. It can help design effective control strategies. Thus, we encourage using the path-finding algorithm for the dispersal assessment of invasive species that move along road networks, and for the development of more powerful HVLDD prediction models.

AB  - Background: Zoonotic spillover from animal reservoirs is responsible for a significant global public health burden, but the processes that promote spillover events are poorly understood in complex urban settings. Endemic transmission of Leptospira, the agent of leptospirosis, in marginalised urban communities occurs through human exposure to an environment contaminated by bacteria shed in the urine of the rat reservoir. However, it is unclear to what extent transmission is driven by variation in the distribution of rats or by the dispersal of bacteria in rainwater runoff and overflow from open sewer systems. Methods: We conducted an eco-epidemiological study in a high-risk community in Salvador, Brazil, by prospectively following a cohort of 1401 residents to ascertain serological evidence for leptospiral infections. A concurrent rat ecology study was used to collect information on the fine-scale spatial distribution of 'rattiness', our proxy for rat abundance and exposure of interest. We developed and applied a novel geostatistical framework for joint spatial modelling of multiple indices of disease reservoir abundance and human infection risk. Results: The estimated infection rate was 51.4 (95%CI 40.4, 64.2) infections per 1000 follow-up events. Infection risk increased with age until 30 years of age and was associated with male gender. Rattiness was positively associated with infection risk for residents across the entire study area, but this effect was stronger in higher elevation areas (OR 3.27 95% CI 1.68, 19.07) than in lower elevation areas (OR 1.14 95% CI 1.05, 1.53). Conclusions: These findings suggest that, while frequent flooding events may disperse bacteria in regions of low elevation, environmental risk in higher elevation areas is more localised and directly driven by the distribution of local rat populations. The modelling framework developed may have broad applications in delineating complex animal-environment-human interactions during zoonotic spillover and identifying opportunities for public health intervention.

AB  - Growth in the number of university students has increased demand for accommodation beyond that which universities themselves can provide, provoking private investor supply-side responses such as houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) and purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA). Such developments can lead to high concentrations of students in areas proximate to university colleges and campuses. The movement of large numbers of transitory students into well-established residential areas in university cities, termed studentification, leads to socioeconomic and physical changes. We deploy a mixed-methods approach to analyze qualitative and quantitative data, exploring the role of market participants and revealing the extent and impact of studentification in Durham, a small historic university city in North East England with a high relative student population. The research confirms that studentification was driven by key actors across two distinct phases: conversion of terraced houses into HMOs by private landlords, subsequently restricted by planning regulations, followed by development of PBSA by institutional investors supported by and in collaboration with the local authority and university. Consequently, studentification in Durham has become more dispersed, resulting in increased house prices, rents and competition for investment opportunities farther afield, causing exclusionary displacement of local residents and reducing the supply of family and social housing. We present a detailed timeline of studentification in Durham and reveal a new geography of studentification that extends to peripheral areas of the city and offer some salutary lessons in respect of planning and housing management policy responses to high demand for student accommodation.

AB  - Background: Adolescence which is a critical stage for growth and development is influenced by various issues along with maternal nutritional knowledge, control over their earnings, freedom of movement, and participation in household decision-making over child's health care. Objective: This study focused on assessing mothers' nutritional knowledge and hygiene practices and their effect on dietary diversity as well as the nutritional status of school-going adolescents of Dhaka city. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted at 44 schools in Dhaka city. A total of 710 school-going adolescents aged 10-17 years were randomly selected and their mothers were interviewed for assessing their knowledge on nutrition and hygiene practices. One-way ANOVA and multivariate linear regression were used to examine the association between dietary diversity and the nutritional status of the adolescents with their mother's nutritional knowledge and hygiene practices. Results: About one-third (35.8%) of the mothers maintained hygiene and sanitation satisfactorily. Although 53.1% of them had satisfactory general knowledge about a healthy diet, only 6.5% showed good knowledge of the nutritional value of food. The prevalence of stunting, thin, and overweight was 8, 4.6, and 5.8%, respectively. Fair hygiene practices were positively associated (P = 0.048) with height for age z-score. Maternal knowledge on the nutritional value of food was positively associated (P = 0.027) with the dietary diversity of the adolescents. Conclusion: Adequate nutritional knowledge and hygiene practices of the mothers have positive effects on children's dietary diversity and nutritional status. Providing nutrition education to mothers would ensure better nutritional status and improved dietary practices for their children.

AB  - The introduction and further spread of many alien species have been a result of trade and transport. Consequently, alien species are often found close to traffic infrastructure and urban areas. To contain and manage the spread of alien species, it is essential to identify and predict major routes of spread, which cannot be obtained by applying common modelling approaches such as species distribution models. Here, we present a new model called CASPIAN to simulate the dispersal of alien species along traffic infrastructure and the establishment of populations along these routes. The model simulates simultaneous spread of species of up to eight different modes of transport along roads, railways and waterways. We calibrated and validated the model using two species that spread within Germany as case studies: the terrestrial plant Senecio inaequidens and the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, and performed a shortest path analysis to quantify the relative importance of individual routes for spread. The application of the model yielded detailed predictions of dispersal and establishment for >600,000 segments of the traffic network throughout Germany. Once calibrated, the model captured the general spread dynamics of the two species with higher accuracy for the freshwater environment due to the higher quality of data available for the aquatic species. The quantification of spread routes using the shortest path analysis revealed a clear backbone of major routes of spread, which varied depending on the type of traffic network and the starting points considered. Major routes of spread aligned with high traffic intensities, but high traffic per se did not necessarily result in high spread intensities. Synthesis and application. By simulating the spreading dynamics of alien species along transport networks across multiple pathways, CASPIAN enables the identification of major spread routes along different dispersal pathways and quantification of their relative importance, which helps prioritising pathways of introduction as required by international biodiversity goals such as the CBD Aichi targets.

AB  - Mexico is the center of origin of maize and one of the phenomena that imperil maize conservation is transgene presence. Although previous studies have documented transgene presence in Mexican landraces, to date there is no countrywide transgene monitoring protocol, nor systematic analyses assessing which factors could be related with transgene presence and dispersal. In this work, we propose a geographically representative sampling protocol and present empirical data from three sampled states: Mexico City, Oaxaca and Chiapas. To further investigate which environmental and social variables could be associated with transgene presence, we carried out a data mining approach. To assess transgene presence in collected maize samples, we used Real-Time PCR, finding that transgenes were widely distributed across sampled localities: 33% of the localities in Chiapas, 25% in Mexico City and 11% in Oaxaca. The data mining approach allowed us to identify state-specific spatial associations in Chiapas and Oaxaca. In Chiapas, a higher probability of transgene presence appeared related to the coexistence of industrialized maize agriculture, while in Oaxaca it was related with seed exchange. We discuss the importance of implementing a national biomonitoring protocol to increase our understanding of the sources that enable transgene presence and dispersal.

AB  - COVID-19 cases continue to increase in Indonesia, with an estimated value of 719,000 and an 8.37% mortality rate, due to the severity and potency of the deadly disease. One of the provinces that mostly contributes to the high mortality rate is Central Java, especially in populous areas like Semarang City. The spread of the virus occurs through direct contact between humans, forcing physical and social distances to become more important, especially in public spaces. Based on these conditions, city planning experts reportedly suggests a public space re-design process, adaptable to the current pandemic conditions, in order to provide a comfortable, safer, and sustainable urban life. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the integration of the mass transportation system (the Bus Trans Semarang) with the readjustment and redesign potentials of pedestrian walkways, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the past two years, the development of pedestrian walkways has become an integral part of the Semarang City Government, in order to realize a sustainable transportation system. Furthermore, the pandemic has presently made pedestrian walkways less functional, due to public concerns on its spread in external areas. The retrieval spatial-based data of this study focused on the bus stops for the Trans Semarang Bus Corridor, which were potential points for the emergence of walking activities. The method used in the measurement of pedestrian activity included behavioral mapping and urban design analysis. This was to identify the pedestrian design indicators that were adaptive to the pandemic conditions. The simulation methods also assisted the data visualization process, by using spatial applications such as ArcGIS and Sketchup. After this, the calculation of the capacity was carried out, to determine the maximum limit of the available spaces. The results were in the form of indicators, such as additional width, lane division, as well as provision of health and hygiene facilities. These were the main recommendations applied on the pedestrian walkways' environmental characteristics, at various points in Semarang City. (C) 2022 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved

AB  - People might get infected by pathogens found in urban recreational waters during water-contact activities, such as swimming, boating, bathing, and yachting. However, the persistence of pathogenic bacteria in those waters was not well documented. In this study, persistence of E. coli O157:H7 (EcO157) in 48 water samples (24 Spring samples and 24 Autumn samples) from the 3 urban recreational waters was investigated. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to correlate survival data with water physicochemical properties and bacterial communities. Our data showed that EcO157 survived longer in Spring samples than in Autumn samples regardless of the lakes. Results revealed that recreational water physicochemical properties and bacterial community in Spring samples were different from those in Autumn samples. Mantel and Partial Mantel tests, as well as co-occurrence network analysis illustrated that EC salinity, TOC, and bacterial community were correlated with survival time (ttd) (p < 0.05). Variation partition analysis (VPA) indicated that bacterial community, EC, TOC, and TN explained about 64.81% of overall ttd variation in Spring samples, and bacterial community, EC, pH, and TP accounted for about 56.59% of overall ttd variation in Autumn samples. Structural equation model (SEM) illustrated that EC indirectly positively affected ttd through bacterial community. The correlation between bacterial community and ttd was negative in Spring samples and positive in Autumn samples. TN appeared a direct positive effect on ttd in Spring samples. TP displayed a direct negative effect on ttd in Autumn samples. Our results concluded that there was seasonal variation in environmental factors that directly or indirectly affected the survival of EcO157 in urban recreational waters.

AB  - Land cover changes threaten biodiversity by impacting the natural habitats and require careful and continuous assessment. The standard approach for assessing these changes is land cover modeling. The present study investigated the spatio-temporal changes in Land Use Land Cover (LULC) in the Gorgan River Basin (GRB) during the 1990-2020 period and predicted the changes by 2040. First, a change analysis employing satellite imagery from 1990 to 2020 was carried out. Then, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) technique was used to predict the transition potential. The accuracy rate, training RMS, and testing RMS of the artificial neural network, MLP, and the transition potential modeling were computed in order to evaluate the results. Utilizing projections for 2020, the prediction of land cover change was made. By contrasting the anticipated land cover map of 2020 with the actual land cover map of 2020, the accuracy of the model was evaluated. The LULC conditions in the future were predicted under two scenarios of the current change trend (scenario 1) and the ecological capability of the land (scenario 2) by 2040. Seven landscape metrics were considered, including Number of Patches, Patch Density, the Largest Patch Index, Edge Density, Landscape Shape Index, Patch Area, and Area-Weighted Mean Shape Index. Based on the Cramer coefficient, the most critical factors affecting LULC change were elevation, distance from forest, and experimental probability of change. For the 1990-2020 period, the LULC change was shown to be influenced by deforestation, reduced rangeland, and expansion of agricultural and residential areas. Based on scenario 1, the area of forest, agriculture, and rangeland would face -0.8, 0.5, and 0.1% changes in the total area, respectively. In scenario 2, the area of forest, agriculture, and rangeland would change by 0.1, -1.3, and 1.3% of the total area, respectively. Landscape metrics results indicated the destructive trend of the landscape during the 1990-2020 period. For improving the natural condition of the GRB, it is suggested to prioritize different areas in need of regeneration due to inappropriate LULC changes and take preventive and protective measures where changes in LULC were predicted in the future, taking into account land management conditions (scenario 2).

AB  - Social movements often attract tourists in their wake. The Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania convened a successful annual meeting in Portland, Oregon, less than a year after passionate protests that attracted national attention in the United States. Concerned city boosters, in response, invited tourists to enjoy Portland's vibrant diversity. That same year, Tulsa (Oklahoma) commemorated a 1921 race massacre with a new museum and events that also invited tourist visits. This brings me to consider the consequences of increasing (pre-Covid-19) tourists on Tanna (Vanuatu). Island entrepreneurs have packaged Tanna's famed John Frum and Prince Philip movements to entice tourists. Touristic attention and resources, however, can spark dispute within local communities, commoditize bits of culture, and reframe island identity and self-conception.

AB  - The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup "weaning" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa.

AB  - Quantifying and mapping cultural ecosystem services are complex because of their intangibility. Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, has been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time-consuming. The potential of deep learning for automating the analysis of crowdsourced social media content is still being explored in CES research. Here, we use a new deep learning model for automating the classification of natural and human elements relevant to CES from Flickr images. This approach applies a convolutional neural network architecture to analyze over 29,000 photographs from the Lithuanian coast and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 37% of the photographs were taken for the landscape appreciation class, and 28% of the photographs were taken of nature, of animals or plants, which represent the nature appreciation class. The main clusters were identified in urban areas, more precisely in the main coastal cities of Lithuania. The distribution of the nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and they were more likely to occur in parks and natural reserves with high levels of vegetation and animal cover. This approach that was developed for clustering the photographs was accurate and saved approximately 100 km of manual work. The method demonstrates how analyzing large numbers of digital photographs expands the analytical toolbox available to researchers and allows the quantification and mapping of CES at large geographical scales. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning and improve nature reserve management.

TI  - An Improved Transition Probability Matrix for Crime Distribution Prediction
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE

KW  - REGRESSION-MODEL
AB  - The occurrence of crime has always been the main problem affecting urban public security and social security environment. Therefore, the prevention and control of crime is the focus of public security work. The traditional police strategy has poor timeliness and cannot respond and adjust in real time with the occurrence of criminal activities, and its deterrence and control of criminal activities are limited. To address the problem of low accuracy of existing crime distribution prediction models, an improved transition probability matrix for crime distribution prediction is proposed in this paper. Based on a large number of trajectory data of criminals, this paper quantitatively describes the temporal and spatial characteristics of crowd movement in different areas of the city by using the temporal and spatial transfer probability. Then, combining Markov chain and Bayes' theorem, the probability model of spatio-temporal transfer of criminal groups in regions is constructed. Finally, the model predicts the number of crimes in urban grid areas.

AB  - Multidimensional approaches examining complex trait-niche relationships are crucial to understand community assembly. This is particularly important across habitat transformation gradients because specialists are progressively substituted by generalists and, despite increasing functional homogenization, in both specialist and generalist communities niche partitioning is apparent. Here, in line with the continuum hypothesis, we expected that divergent trait-niche relationships would arise in passerine assemblages across the natural-to-urban transformation gradient. More specifically, we expected that traits linking form to function would be more important in less transformed habitats, while population density and traits linked to dispersal and dominance would predominate in more transformed habitats. Accordingly, we found that beak length and its interaction with tarsus length correlated significantly with isotopic niches in natural and rural habitats, where specialists predominate. Conversely, body size and aggressiveness only showed significant relationships with isotopic niches with increasing habitat transformation, where generalists prevail. Interestingly, we recorded a mix of these processes in rural habitats, which acted as a frontier between these two domains. Our study is thus important in showing that a complex combination of morphological and behavioral traits determine niche characteristics, and that these relationships are dynamic across habitat transformation gradients.

AB  - Human urbanization has a great impact on the surface ecological environment, and few existing studies have explored the impact of urbanization on regional comfort on a long time scale. This study took Chenggong District, Kunming City, Yunnan Province, China, where urbanization was obvious, as the study area, and used the comfort evaluation model to evaluate the annual summer Discomfort Index (DI) in different periods of urbanization. Meanwhile, the impact strength of each factor characterizing human activities (Impervious surface, Gross National Product, and Total Population) on DI changes was analyzed, and the contribution rate of the main factors was quantified. The experimental results show that (1) over the past 20 years, under the background of the rapid economic development of Chenggong District, the annual average DI in summer showed an upward trend. The growth rate after the completion of University Town (2010-2020, Post-UT) was higher than that before the completion of University Town (2001-2005, Pre-UT). University Town was growing much faster than other regions. The monthly average DI changes were similar to the annual average changes. However, due to the movement of students in University Town during the summer vacation, the growth rate of DI in June was significantly higher than that in other months. (2) In terms of spatial changes, DI in the central and northwestern parts of Chenggong District increased significantly from 2001 to 2020. There were differences in the change rate before and after the completion of University Town. The area occupied by significant growth areas in June was much higher than in other months. It is proved that the economic and social development of Chenggong District would impact the regional human comfort, and the construction of University Town has aggravated the intensity of this impact. (3) In the during-UT, affected by the complex changes in land use types, the DI in Chenggong District showed fluctuations in time, but there was no obvious change in space. (4) The correlation and contribution analysis showed that the annual average DI in summer was closely related to human activities, especially the impervious surface had a strong contribution rate of 52.7%. The research shows that the development of new cities would have a strong impact on regional DI changes. And the obtained results will provide theoretical support for rational planning and management in the process of urban development in the future, thereby promoting the sustainable development of the region.

AB  - This text aims to analyze qualitative data of representational spaces from the Urban Occupations (UOs), specifically the UOs Carolina Maria de Jesus and Nova Canudos, carried out in the first half of 2021 by the Homeless Workers Movement (MTST in Portuguese), in the periphery of the city of Sao Paulo. The concept of "representational spaces" is part of the Henri Lefebvres space production theory,which articulates the concepts of "spatial practices" and "representations of spaces". We use methods to analyze qualitative data (from the text written by Guilherme Boulos and videos about the UOs) to demonstrate socio-political attributes of representational spaces of those UO. These representational spaces express their macro and micro-political struggles which characteristics were systematized and synthesized in a frame based on categories elaborated by Suely Rolnik (2018) as part of her macro and micro-politics insurgencies theory. From the point of view of macro-political struggles, they denounce social inequalities and injustices and demand collective rights. From the point of view of micro-political struggles, they constitute political acts that announce ways of well living apart and together on solidarity bases.

AB  - Although urban green space (UGS) is an important factor in improving the well-being of residents, the problem of green injustice has been proven to be prevalent. Balancing the quantity distribution of UGS is an important way to solve the problem, but the effect is declining owing to many reasons. The general lack of evaluation of UGS quality in accessibility model leads to the insufficient understanding of real inequality and the inability to excavate strategies from the level of quality. Accordingly, this article first established an evaluation system for the serviceability of UGS (including size, outerconnectivity, inner-connectivity, diversity, eco-serviceability, and compactness). Based on the comprehensive floating catchment area method, the spatial distribution patterns and inequality differences of UGS quantity and quality accessibility under three traffic modes are compared. The results show that evaluating the quantity inequality of UGS may lead to overestimation of real inequality, and other functional advantages can offset the quantitative disadvantages. The government-led quality improvement intervention and the policy of enhancing residents' transportation capacity can alleviate green inequality. The finding confirms the significance of serviceability in improving green equity and provides guidance for government leaders and researchers on the development of UGS in the future.

AB  - Urban soils are exposed to transformations of physical properties which are not captured by the conventional approaches due to the presence of impurities that can distort the obtained data. Advanced visualization tech-niques such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) offer new opportunities of exploring heterogeneity of soil properties at horizon or aggregate scales. The studies of the structure and pore space of different types of urban soils formed on chernozems were carried out using a SkyScan 1172G tomograph. The tomographic study was carried out in the humus-accumulative horizons for six main types of urban soils. The volumetric parameters for the pore space were calculated, and pores orientation and shape parameters were calculated in 2D sections. The closed pore value was obtained as the most informative diagnostic indicator of the urban soils structural con-dition. A morphometric analysis of the shape and orientation of fine soil macropores with a diameter of 0.3-2.0 mm also showed significant structural differences between natural soils under woody or grassy vegetation and urban anthropogenically transformed soils. All studied soils at the aggregate scales slightly differ from each other in the value of the internal aggregate tomographic porosity. This shows that the compaction because of anthropogenic transformation occurs due to the interaggregate pore space. At the aggregate porous spaces, no changes can be traced.

AB  - Mangrove forests are distributed in the intertidal zones of tropical and subtropical regions, and have been severely damaged by anthropogenic activities, climate change, and stochastic events. Although much progress has been made in the conservation and restoration of mangroves in China, studies of the genetic diversity of mangroves are lacking, especially for isolated populations, yet such studies are essential for guiding conservation and restoration efforts. Here, we evaluated the genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, and mating system of two mangrove species, Rhizophora apiculata and Avicennia marina, in a heavily disturbed area in Tielu Harbor, Sanya City, Hainan Island, China, using 18 nuclear microsatellite markers. We found that the genetic diversity of R. apiculata, which is classified as 'Vulnerable' in the China Red List categories, was high and similar compared with the genetic diversity estimates of other populations reported in previous studies. In contrast, the genetic diversity of A. marina, which is classified as a species of 'Least Concern', was low compared with the genetic diversity estimates of other populations. We then evaluated the presence of genetic bottlenecks, spatial genetic structure, and the mating system to determine the effects that habitat destruction has had on these two species. Our findings indicate that distinct conservation and restoration approaches are needed for these two species. Generally, our results provide valuable information that will aid the development of conservation and restoration strategies for the mangroves of Tielu Harbor.

AB  - Knowledge of large carnivore population abundance is essential for wildlife management and conservation, but these data are often difficult to obtain in inherently low-density species. In particular, the snow leopard, Panthera uncia, an enigmatic cat occupying remote mountains in Central Asia, has received insufficient assessments of its population abundance because of logistical and methodological challenges. Here, we aimed to develop a robust density estimation of snow leopards based on 81 days of camera trapping within a contiguous and previously unsurveyed 1950 km(2) area of habitat on the Tibetan Plateau (Mayue Township, Shenzha County, Tibet Autonomous Region, China). By applying spatially explicit capture-recapture models, we produced an estimate of 1.40 (95%CI: 1.06-1.84) individuals per 100 km(2). Results also suggested sex-specific variation in the range of movement around activity centers, with male (N = 10, sigma = 4.02) movement considerably greater than female (N = 8, sigma = 1.84) movement. The findings can serve as a reliable baseline reference for assessing the population trends of this endangered felid species with future estimates. This study will provide context to contribute toward a better understanding of ecological factors shaping the distribution and abundance of snow leopards and the related conservation measures needed to sustain their long-term survival on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Space organization and space layout in buildings are complex issues in architectural design. People spend most of their lives in offices, yet office buildings still get little attention. This paper examines the potential role of office space typologies in saving distance and time spent by users communicating between these spaces. The study adopts multiple methodologies to scrutinize users' paths and track their movement. Diversity in methodologies provides a deep understanding of how spatial configurations of these spaces affect users' movement. Three office buildings were selected in Erbil city to represent three different office space typologies. The study revealed the effective role of office space typologies in influencing the level of user satisfaction and comfort, concluding that the most influential factors in providing distances and time are circulation patterns, entry and exit locations that require considering function, organizational and administrative structure of building spaces, and balancing between horizontal and vertical accessibility.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change has become an important research topic for global environmental change and sustainable development. As an important part of worldwide land conservation, sustainable development and management of water resources, developing countries must ensure the use of innovative technology and tools that support their various decision making systems. This study provides the most recent LULC change analysis for the last six years (2015-2021) of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, one of the most important petrochemical cities in the world and host of the ongoing Interoceanic Corridor project. The analysis was carried out using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, ancillary data and ground-based surveys and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify and to ameliorate the discrimination between four main macro-classes and fourteen classes. The LULC classification was performed using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) to produce maps for each year, as it was found to be the best approach when compared to minimum distance (MDM) and spectral angle mapping (SAM) methods. The macro-classes were water, built-up, vegetation and bare soil, whereas the classes were an improved classification within those. Our study achieved both user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) above 90% for the proposed macro-classes and classes. The average Kappa coefficient for macro-classes was 0.93, while for classes it was 0.96, both comparable to previous studies. The results from the LULC analysis show that residential, industry and commercial areas slowed down their growth throughout the study period. These changes were associated with socio-economical drivers such as insecurity and lack of economic investments. Groves and trees presented steady behaviors, with small increments during the five-year period. Swamps, on the other hand, significantly degraded, being about 2% of the study area in 2015 and 0.93% in 2021. Dunes and medium and high vegetation densities (& SIM;80%) transitioned mostly to low vegetation densities. This behavior is associated with rainfall below the annual reference and increments of surface runoff due to the loss of vegetation cover. Lastly, the present study seeks to highlight the importance of remote sensing for a better understanding of the dynamics between human-nature interactions and to provide information to assist planners and decision-makers for more sustainable land development.

AB  - In recent years, urban communities in China have been continuously affected by extreme weather and emergencies, among which the rainstorm and waterlogging disasters pose a great threat to infrastructure and personnel safety. Chinese governments issue a series of waterlogging prevention and control policies, but the waterlogging prevention and mitigation of urban communities still needs to be optimized. The concept of "resilience" has unique advantages in the field of community disaster management, and building resilient communities can effectively make up for the limitations of the traditional top-down disaster management. Therefore, this paper focuses on the pre-disaster prevention and control of waterlogging in urban communities of China, following the idea of "concept analysis-influencing factor identification-evaluation indicators selection-impact mechanism analysis-resilience simulation prediction-empirical research-disaster adaptation strategy formulation". The structural equation model and BP neural network are used by investigating the existing anti-waterlogging capitals of the target community to predict the future waterlogging resilience. Based on this simulation prediction model, and combined with the incentive and restraint mechanisms, suggestions on corrective measures can be put forward before the occurrence of waterlogging.

AB  - It is critical to understand the elements that influence CO2 emissions from commuting to establish low-carbon transportation and land-use regulations. Research attempted to determine the mechanisms by which the built environment (BE) influences commuting-related CO2 emissions. Most research was conducted in developed nations and used traditional modeling to evaluate the relationship between BE and CO2 emissions primarily considering direct consequences related with BE. There is a research vacuum in predicting the total impacts of BE on CO2 emissions from commuting, taking into account the mediating effect of car ownership. This research examines total effects of the built environment (BE) on commuting-related CO2 emissions including both direct and indirect effects. We used 10,592 home-based work trips from Dhaka, a developing city, to create a structural equation model (SEM) for predicting this association. We included car ownership as a mediating variable and treated BE, car ownership, and CO2 emissions as endogenous variables. Both population density and land-use diversity are positively associated with private car ownership. The study shows the built environment plays a different role in explaining CO2 emissions from commuting in developed and developing countries. Population density has a direct positive impact on CO2 emissions, as evidenced by previous research in a developing metropolis. Because of its mediating effect on car ownership, land use diversity has a considerable positive indirect impact on emissions but a negligible overall effect, making it ineffective on its own and necessitating the implementation of complementing Travel Demand Management (TDM) policies. Our modeling results are comparable with those from both developing and developed countries in terms of public transportation accessibility, job accessibility, and road network design. The results might be used to produce policy guidelines to reduce car ownership and CO2 emissions, which would help developing countries in South Asia meet their sustainable development goals.

AB  - Inclusion and diversity have become paramount within the festival sector and beyond, often focusing on bringing together a diverse group of people within one space. Within leisure studies, there has been a longstanding interest in leisure as spaces where people meet "others." Nevertheless, previous research found that physical proximity is often not sufficient to enable social mixing. Adopting a cross-disciplinary approach combining urban planning and design with cultural sociology and leisure studies, this article addresses how music festival organizers produce spaces of encounter within festival spaces. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 31 organizers of music festivals in Rotterdam. Findings indicate that organizers use their knowledge of spatial design and symbolic boundaries to stimulate or block movement of audience groups, which affects segregation and mixing of audience groups within a festival. Spaces of encounter therefore are consciously designed through symbolic and social boundaries that have spatial consequences.

AB  - Urban agriculture can be shortly defined as the growing of plants and/or the livestock husbandry in and around cities. Although it has been a common occupation for the urban population all along, recently there is a growing interest in it both from public bodies and researchers, as well as from ordinary citizens who want to engage in self-cultivation. The modern citizen, though, will hardly find the free time to grow his own vegetables as it is a process that requires, in addition to knowledge and disposition, consistency. Given the above considerations, the purpose of this work was to develop an economic robotic system for the automatic monitoring and management of an urban garden. The robotic system was designed and built entirely from scratch. It had to have suitable dimensions so that it could be placed in a balcony or a terrace, and be able to scout vegetables from planting to harvest and primarily conduct precision irrigation based on the growth stage of each plant. Fertigation and weed control will also follow. For its development, a number of technologies were combined, such as Cartesian robots' motion, machine vision, deep learning for the identification and detection of plants, irrigation dosage and scheduling based on plants' growth stage, and cloud storage. The complete process of software and hardware development to a robust robotic platform is described in detail in the respective sections. The experimental procedure was performed for lettuce plants, with the robotic system providing precise movement of its actuator and applying precision irrigation based on the specific needs of the plants.

AB  - One of the main goals of disaster management planning is to ensure the effectiveness of the emergency measures when a hazard occurs. This happens only if the decision-makers use operational tools considering the structural characteristics of urban systems. Starting from these assumptions, the authors proposed an emergency management method based on the integrated work between two different scientific sectors, the urban planning and construction engineering sectors. The proposed method aims to evaluate the practicability of the strategic road network, as well as defining the emergency rescue routes based on the out-of-plane (OOP) seismic collapse of masonry infills (MIs) in reinforced concrete (RC)-framed buildings. The OOP failure of MIs is predicted according to an innovative MI macro-model. The authors test the method on a geographic area in the municipality of Gioia Tauro (Reggio Calabria, Italy). The results show that due to the collapse of MIs, the functionality of the strategic road network in emergency conditions can be compromised, causing losses of the urban systems' performance. Based on the obtained results, the authors recommend that decision-makers use the proposed methodology to identify the vulnerable rescue paths and to locate the strategic infrastructure while spending the financial resources in a more effective way.

AB  - The international plant trade provides opportunities for the introduction of exotic species into tropical greenhouses around the world. The millipede and centipede fauna of greenhouses is barely known in Switzerland. We conducted a survey in greenhouses of nine botanical gardens and other institutions across Switzerland. We captured and identified 1390 individuals belonging to 14 millipede species and 43 individuals belonging to 9 centipede species. Most millipede individuals recorded (80.3%) were non-native as were the species (8/14). Most centipede individuals (55.3%) were non-native, but not the majority of the species (4/10). The species composition varied strongly among greenhouses with species originating from different parts of the world. Seven species already known from greenhouses in other European countries are reported for the first time in Switzerland. These are the millipedes Cylindrodesmus hirsutus Pocock, 1889, Poratia obliterata (Kraus, 1960), Paraspirobolus lucifugus (Gervais, 1836) and the centipedes Mecistocephalus guildingii Newport, 1843, Tygarrup javanicus Attems, 1929, Lamyctes (Lamyctes) coeculus (Brolemann, 1889b), and Cryptops (Cryptops) doriae Pocock, 1891. The relevance of these findings is discussed.

AB  - We analysed data from the invasion of a city by Aedes aegypti by using a series of models based on Fisher's reaction-diffusion equation with Richard's growth model and Bayesian statistics. The model that best explains the invasion of the city was defined through a step-by-step process of model selection based on a series of candidate models. As explanatory variables, we used the effect of urbanization type and climate variables on the parameters of Fisher's equation: carrying capacity (K), population growth rate (r), and the diffusion coefficient (D). The resulting model is a reaction-diffusion equation with a near-zero shape parameter, similar to a Gompertz-type growth. The population advance rate of 60.19 m/day allowed Aedes aegypti to fully occupy a medium-sized city in 5 months from the estimated date of colonization. We found that the carrying capacity was dependent on temperature and urbanization type. While the results are coherent with existing literature on this species, most of the theory on population dynamics of Aedes aegypti usually assumes a logistic growth instead of Gompertz population dynamics. This type of growth is faster than logistic at densities lower than the inflexion point but slower at higher densities. Therefore, it is possible that in a regime in which the K depends on the climate, Gompertz dynamics could stabilize the population of this species of mosquito faster than assumed by the existing theory.

AB  - Urbanisation adversely affects the abiotic and biotic characteristics of watercourses, includ-ing freshwater streams that support the development of stream-breeding salamanders. We conducted a study over four years on an isolated fire salamander population inhabiting a stream valley northwest of Budapest, Hungary. Our aim was to understand aspects of larval development and habitat usage within this population. The maximum number of larvae was observed in April and the first weeks of May. Due to drifting caused by heavy rainfall, there was a mean decrease of 63.3% in the number of larvae. The abundance of larval salamanders within 16 stream segments showed strong temporal and spatial vari-ation, and there was a strong relationship between larval abundance and the % cover of fine gravel substrate. Some of the larvae could escape drift by entering pools with slower water flow and shelter. Larvae were predominantly solitary in smaller pools but occasion-ally aggregated in high numbers in some segments. The first larvae with yellow spots (indicative of metamorphosis) appeared in June, and by early September, all larvae were metamorphosing. Our results show that in this urbanised environment, larval develop-ment through to metamorphosis is occurring, but increasing urbanisation and alterations to stream flow threaten the persistence of the local population.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antimicrobial resistance elements (AMR) are novel environmental contaminants that pose a significant risk to human health globally. Freshwater contains a variety of microorganisms that might affect human health; its quality must be assessed before use. However, the dynamics of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and ARG propagation in freshwater have rarely been studied in Singapore. Therefore, this study used metagenomics to compare diversity, virulence factor composition, and ARG and MGE co-occurrence with bacterial communities in paired (n = 8) environmental freshwater samples. KneadData, FMAP, and Kraken2 were used for bioinformatics analysis and R (v4.1.1) for statistical analysis. Sequence reads with a total of 9043 species were taxonomically classified into 66 phyla, 130 classes, 261 orders, 584 families, and 2477 genera. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were found the Phyla in all samples. Analysis of QIIME output by PICRUSt and ss-diversity showed unique clusters and functional microbial community structures. A total of 2961 ARGs were found that conferred resistance to multidrug, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, elfamycins, and more. The classified ARG mechanism revealed significant distribution of virulence factors in bacterial cells. Transposes and transposon were highly correlated to ARG gene transfer. Co-occurrence network analysis showed several MGEs appear to use the same ARGs (intI and rho) and were dominant in all samples. Furthermore, ARGs are also highly correlated with bacteria like Campylobacter and Escherichia. This study enhances the understanding of antibiotic risk assessment and provides a new perspective on bacterial assembly contamination and the functional prevalence of ARGs and MGEs with antibiotic resistance bacteria. Moreover, it raises public awareness because these contaminants put people's lives at risk of acquiring bacterial infections. In addition, it can also help propose hybrid water treatment approaches.

AB  - Positive energy buildings (PEB) are foreseen to help achieving global emissions reduction targets and decarbonisation. However, for vertical office spaces in urban centres the photovoltaic (PV) production area is restricted, so innovative strategies are needed. For cooling-dominated climates the extension of set point temperature associated to local control of air movement has the potential to increase the use of natural ventilation and generate a great amount energy savings.. Therefore, this study aims to identify to what extent adopting a mixed-mode operation with desk fans could help mid-rise office buildings to become NZEBs in warm climates. To verify the impact of this strategy, computer simulations were carried out with three building heights in four Brazilian cities. Results show this strategy can generate 20-40% energy savings and the set point could be extended up to 28 degrees C or 30 degrees C depending on the climate, without jeopardizing occupants' thermal comfort. Thus, in warm climate cities, the strategy allows lower buildings to become PEBs and mid-rise buildings to become NZEBs. In addition, the demand for extra PV area is expressively reduced, increasing the viability of mid-rise PEBs. This study adds innovative knowledge for achieving PEB targets under suboptimal conditions and highlights multiple aspects that should be considered for applying this strategy. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) are essential for human society worldwide. ES originate from ecological processes commonly occurring in well-preserved regions. Bats play an essential role in providing such services, primarily insect suppression, plant pollination, and seed dispersal. Human activities have affected Earth's systems, compromising species and ecosystems and, consequently, the ES provision. Brazil is a country with many bat species but is also one of the world's leaders in deforestation. Here we aimed to identify regions with high potential for bats ecosystem services provision, assuming that the predicted presence of the species represents the existence of the services. First, we used a Maximum Entropy algorithm to model the distribution of 128 bat species, which correspond to 71% of the Brazilian species. We classify all species into 10 different groups, which resulted from a combination of three body sizes and four predominant trophic guilds (i.e., frugivores, insectivores, nectarivores, and carnivores). The guilds were associated with services of seed dispersion, pest control, pollination, and animal control. Then, we created a 0.5 x 0.5-degree grid to represent an index of ES per guild, which is defined by the sum of the product of the bat's size weight (1, 2, or 3) by the area occupied of each species in each cell. For comparison, the index was normalized and scaled from 0 to 1. Finally, we used a map of current land use to compare the effects of natural area suppression on the provision of ES in each cell. Our results indicate a substantial reduction in the provision of ES by bats in extensive parts of the central and eastern parts of Brazil, but changes in ES varies among biomes. While the loss of species is an important factor affecting the provision of ES in the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado, the reduction of species occurrence is most important factor in Amazonia, Caatinga, or Pantanal regions. We suggest that degraded area restoration should be promoted in areas with high ES values and areas near cities and croplands and that a precautionary approach of promoting the conservation of high provider richness should be applied to protect the continuation of bat's ES.

AB  - An effective practice for monitoring bird communities is the recognition and identification of their acoustic signals, whether simple, complex, fixed or variable. A method for the passive monitoring of diversity, activity and acoustic phenology of structural species of a bird community in an annual cycle is presented. The method includes the semi-automatic elaboration of a dataset of 22 vocal and instrumental forms of 16 species. To analyze bioacoustic richness, the UMAP algorithm was run on two parallel feature extraction channels. A convolutional neural network was trained using STFT-Mel spectrograms to perform the task of automatic identification of bird species. The predictive performance was evaluated by obtaining a minimum average precision of 0.79, a maximum equal to 1.0 and a mAP equal to 0.97. The model was applied to a huge set of passive recordings made in a network of urban wetlands for one year. The acoustic activity results were synchronized with climatological temperature data and sunlight hours. The results confirm that the proposed method allows for monitoring a taxonomically diverse group of birds that nourish the annual soundscape of an ecosystem, as well as detecting the presence of cryptic species that often go unnoticed.

AB  - Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti pose a threat to global public health. Because there are no vaccines or drugs available, the prevention of these diseases in Argentina is based on integrated vector control. In this work, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the vector distribution was analyzed by monitoring oviposition. This information allowed the planning of anti-vector interventions and the evaluation of their effect on the relative abundance of mosquito populations in San Ramon de la Nueva Oran. Observed data were compared with the eggs expected via a statistical model based on meteorological variables. The oviposition substrate preference of mosquito females was also evaluated, and the possible relationship between the relative abundance of the vector and sociodemographic and environmental variables (normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index) was explored. A total of 4,193 eggs of Ae. aegypti were collected, and spatial clusters were detected for all months for which the presence of the mosquito was reported. The observed number of eggs was significantly less than the expected-corrected egg abundance. A significant correlation of oviposition activity was found with three sociodemographic variables, whereas no significant correlation was found with mean or median values of the environmental variables studied. This monitoring strategy made it possible to address the interventions and evaluate them, proposing them as good complementary tools for the control of Ae. aegypti in northern Argentina.

AB  - Sacramento, California's capital city has not, until recently, had the kind of cohesive and effective environmental justice (EJ) movement as seen in several other regions around the state or country. However, in the past 15 years, a variety of new forms of EJ organising are producing a vibrant if uneven movement. This article examines how and why this transformation has occurred and what challenges the movement has faced and which persist. I propose that the rise of the EJ movement in Sacramento can be traced to an explicit articulation of an EJ master frame, the development of an increasingly dense network of EJ-oriented organisations, the mobilisation of a grassroots base of residents, and several state-led EJ policy initiatives that have created openings for community mobilisation. The article begins by presenting a theoretical framework to understand the formation and development of social movements. This is followed by an overview of local environmental injustices and a series of focused case studies of key EJ struggles in the region. Finally, it closes with a discussion of the dynamic rise of the Sacramento EJ movement and further questions to track its continued development.

AB  - The squatting movement is a social movement that seeks to use unoccupied land or temporarily or permanently abandoned buildings as farmland, housing, meeting places, or centers for social and cultural purposes. Its main motivation is to denounce and at the same time respond to the economic difficulties that activists believe exist to realize the right to housing. Much of what we know about this movement comes from the informational and journalistic literature generated by actors that are close or even belong to the movement. However, there is also a significant diversity of knowledge and scientific evidence on the squatters' movement that is being produced by academia and that is worth knowing and grouping together. With the aim of defining and understanding how the squatters' movement is constituted and organized, and how it acts, this research analyzes what the scientific literature affirms about it. Through qualitative research based on the systematic literature review (SLR) method, information was sought in the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases. The initial universe of 262 articles was finally reduced to a sample of 32 articles. These have been analyzed by means of a categorized classification content analysis. The results obtained allow us to establish the state of the art on the squatting movement, placing special emphasis on its dynamics of resistance, its process of political subjectivation and its mechanisms of action and self-management. The study suggests that the movement is understood based on collective actions with a political role of resistance to neoliberalism and the inequalities it generates, and of response to the basic and social needs of the communities through self-management.

AB  - The paper presents the Urban Seismic Observatory based on MEMS accelerometers, which were installed in (and around) the historic centre of Camerino (Marche, Italy). The purpose of the infrastructure is to provide the parameters of the surface motion at the different recording sites, when an earthquake occurs, in order to take into account the effects due to the local geo-morphological conditions. In fact, these characteristics can play a significant role in the amplification of the ground motion, thus producing relevant effects on the site response, and then on the potential damage distribution. A lowcost seismic station was specifically designed and assembled, to be suitable for working 24 hours per day. Afterwards, 14 stations have been installed on the lower floor of buildings and in external street cabinets. This work is focused on the illustration of the monitoring station and the network deployment. Furthermore, by way of example, a shakemap is reported referring to an earthquake recorded by the network. The network is a first experimental infrastructure for seismic monitoring of widespread assets on the territory (such as the ancient buildings of a historic centre), however it can be adapted for any other asset that requires distributed monitoring with many measurement points.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine how physical expansion and urban redevelopment affect the population distribution and population mobility in the metropolitan area of Istanbul. In the study, the spatial change of the population at the district and neighbourhood level in the 2013-2017 period was examined. In the first stage, the population change, macro-form developments, housing production in the 2000-2017 period were examined and the magnitude of the spatial change was revealed. And in the second stage, the spatial distribution of population mobility in the city was examined. The study covers 39 districts in the metropolitan area of Istanbul. In order to determine the urban change, the built environment in the metropolitan area of 2000, 2007, 2012, and 2017 were compared and for this purpose, the CORINE database, Google, and Yandex maps were used. The population data of the same period were obtained from the general population census and address-based population registration system database fin - the neighbourhood and district levels. Population mobility between districts was obtained from the TurkStat intro- and inter-provincial migration database. In addition, one of the most important indicators explaining population mobility and spatial concentration in the metropolitan area is building occupancy permits on a district basis, and these data were obtained from the TURKSTAT Construction Statistics database. Some of the variables were obtained from previous studies on Istanbul. "Stratified regression analysis" was used in the study. When the net migration data of the districts of Istanbul received from both other provinces and other districts of Istanbul are evaluated; districts that receive immigration from both other provinces and other districts of Istanbul (Region-I) are Esenyurt, Sancaktepe, Arnavutkoy, Tuzla, Cekmekoy, Beylikduzu, Buyukcekmece, Silivri, Sile, Catalca, Maltepe, and Basaksehir districts. The districts that give population to other provinces but receive immigration from other districts of Istanbul (Region-II) are Eyupsultan, Kartal, and Pendik districts. Avcilar, Bagcilar, Bahcelievler, Bakirkoy, Bayrampw, Beykoz, Beyoglu, Esenler, Fatth, Gaziosman-pasa, Gungoren, Kadikoy, Kagithane, Kucukcekmece, Sultangazi, Umraniye and Zeytinburnu (Region-III) are the districts that give population to other provinces and Istanbul's other districts. Finally, districts that receive immigration from other provinces but immigrate to other districts of Istanbul (Region-IV) are Sisli, Besiktas, Uskudar, Sariyer, Atasehir and Sultanbeyli districts. In the 2013-2017 period, 1.4 million people moved out to other addresses within Istanbul. The population movement is bidirectional, from centre to periphery and vice versa. Another dimension of the population mobility in Istanbul is the locational preferences of foreign nationals. According to the study conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Istanbul in 2018, 60% of the foreign nationals (refugees and migrants) in Istanbul live in the 3rd region. In other words, foreign nationals take the place of the locals, moving out of core areas to the fringes.
   The cost of rent, security concerns, transport systems, urban redevelopment, inclination to work in places with irregular economic activities, and desire to live close to the established migrant population arc all elements that contribute to this preference. According to the results of the regression analysis, only the new housing permits determine the inward migration (R-2 =0.892). Outward migration is determined by the population of the district, quality of life and population density (R-2 =0.875). Physical thresholds in the metropolitan area of Istanbul prevent urban sprawl and this causes an intense urban development demand. This dense metropolitan development pattern is shaped by limitations such as inadequate public resource allocation for strong public transport infrastructure, and limited or high-cost land to develop new cities, topography, sea, or protected areas. It is observed that the urban area expands more slowly compared to the population growth, so the gross density has also increased. When the population change at the neighbourhood level after 2013 is examined, a significant decrease in the population in the central regions of the metropolitan area and significant population increases along the corridors in the periphery were detected. It has been determined that there is deconcentration and expansion in the metropolitan area, but there is very little change in the form of suburbanisation, decentralisation, sprawl and rural dispersal. Population mobility in a metropolitan area at this scale causes difficulties in estimating population distribution in urban planning. The estimation of the spatial distribution of the population is vital in transport planning, provision of public services, and infrastructure planning. The results obtained in this study can be used in long-term estimates of the spatial distribution of the population.

AB  - Malaria control in Somaliland depends on the effective identification of potential malaria vectors, particularly those that may be invasive. The malaria vector Anopheles stephensi has been detected in multiple countries in the Horn of Africa (HOA), but data on its geographic distribution and population genetic diversity are incomplete. We implemented a vector surveillance program and performed molecular analysis of Anopheles in three urban areas in Somaliland. Our study confirmed the presence of both the invasive An. stephensi and the long-established HOA malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis. Further analysis of An. stephensi genetic diversity revealed three cytochrome oxidase I (COI) haplotypes, all of which have been observed in other countries in East Africa and one also observed in South Asia. We also detected the knockdown resistance (kdr) L1014F mutation, which is associated with pyrethroid resistance; this finding supports the need for further assessment of the potential for insecticide resistance. The detection of multiple haplotypes previously observed in other regions of East Africa indicates that An. stephensi is an established population in Somaliland and likely shares its origin with other newly identified An. stephensi populations in East Africa. The detection of genetic diversity in An. stephensi in Somaliland provides a basis for future studies on the history of the species in the region and its dispersal throughout East Africa.

AB  - The functional mechanism of microbial assembly of activated sludge (AS) in urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) remains unclear. A comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the contribution of influent immigration and environmental factors to AS community composition requires investigation. In this study, the microbial characteristics of six full-scale UWTPs with different influent compositions and environmental factors (altitude, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and total phosphorus (TP)) were analyzed to determine the main forces affecting the bacterial assembly of AS microbial communities. Abundant and core taxa were screened out based on the abundance and frequency of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurrence in all samples. Abundant OTUs (18.7% occurrence) accounted for 87.7% of the total 16S rRNA sequences, while rare OTUs (71.7% occurrence) accounted for only 7.8% of the total 16S rRNA sequences. A total of 135 OTUs were identified as core taxa, accounting for 14.6-26.2% of the total reads, of which 83 OTUs belonged to abundant taxa. The richness and uniformity of the influent community were significantly lower than those of the AS system. The community composition in influent varied from that in AS. Moreover, about 89.7% (86.5% of 16S rRNA sequences) OTUs in AS samples showed positive growth rates, indicating that immigration of influent communities had a limited effect on the microbial composition of AS. Redundancy analysis (RDA) combined with co-occurrence network showed that the bacterial assembly of microbial communities was significantly correlated with altitude, pH, and TN (P < 0.05), and these three parameters could explain 23.3%, 21.1%, and 17.7% of the bacterial assembly of AS microbial communities in UWTPs, respectively.

AB  - Compound disasters are highly complex and can involve different types of disasters. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compound disasters of public health emergencies, accident disasters, and natural hazards have occurred frequently all over the world; therefore, it is important to establish effective compound disaster emergency collaboration networks. Thus, this study examined the 7 March building collapse in Quanzhou City as a case study. This case was a typical compound disaster involving a public health emergency and an accident disaster during COVID-19. Based on the network analysis, the overall response and dynamic characteristics of the emergency collaboration for compound disasters were examined in this study. A compound disaster emergency collaboration network (ECN) was constructed by identifying the interactional relationships between emergency organizations. After applying time slices, the dynamic evolution of network structure, organizational-functional relations, organizational attributes, and cross-organizational relationships were discussed. The research results showed the following: (1) The density and connectivity of the compound disaster ECN first decreased before increasing. Meanwhile, the evolution of the network structure followed a path from decentralized to concentrated and from being uneven to an equilibrium. (2) The characteristics and practices of compound disasters during different periods indicated varied emergency needs for emergency organizations. We found that the formation of emergency tasks not only involved the passive adaptation to match the practice for compound disasters, but also the active choices of emergency organizations when facing compound disasters according to their collective experiences and decisions. (3) The national emergency management departments, the government emergency rescue organizations, and the local governments were the core organizations of the ECN. Public health management departments and social organizations were also required to participate in the ECN to improve the diverse and heterogeneous distribution of resources. (4) With increased demands during a compound disaster emergency, the number of cross-organizational collaborative relationships gradually increased. This study explored compound disaster emergencies from the perspective of network analysis to improve our understanding of the current and developing organizational relationships and practices during a compound disaster event. The dynamic characteristics of compound disasters require efficient adaptation and improvements of the collaborative mechanisms involved during emergencies.

AB  - Knowledge of the genetic structure and cryptic diversity is essential for the conservation of endangered species. We conducted a genetic survey of the federally endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) sampled from its USA range in southern Florida. Florida bonneted bats are primarily found in four regions separated by approximately 100 to 250 km, including three western natural areas: Babcock Webb WMA (BW), Polk County (PC), and Collier County (CC) and one urban population on the east coast, Miami-Dade County (MD). We used 22 microsatellite loci and cytochrome b sequences to assess the extent of connectivity and levels of genetic diversity. Populations were highly differentiated at microsatellite loci (overall F-ST = 0.178) and model-based and ordination analyses showed that MD was the most distinct among pairwise comparisons. Regional populations were small (N-e < 100) with no evidence of inbreeding. Contemporary migration and historic gene flow suggested that regional populations have not frequently exchanged migrants, and thus the divergence among western regions was likely a result of genetic drift. Significantly, mitochondrial DNA revealed that haplotypes from MD were similar or shared with those recognized as Eumops ferox from Cuba and Jamaica, and divergent (1.5%) from the remainder of bonneted bats in Florida. Our data support the management of each of the four populations as distinct population segments, and that BW, PC and CC combined are on an independent evolutionary trajectory from bats in MD. Bonneted bats in Florida appear to harbor cryptic diversity that will require a reassessment of their taxonomy.

AB  - The habitat loss is the main threat for many parrot species worldwide. However, the disturbed environments can influence the occurrence of the species positively or negatively, depending on its structure and potential use as an alternative environment. Therefore, this work aims to determine the relationship between land use types and the occurrence of the threatened Red-browed Amazon, identifying the land use types related to species' occurrence and the direction of these relationships. Seven land use types were significantly associated with the species' occurrence: Primary/Secondary Advanced/Medium Natural Forest, Secondary Natural Vegetation, Pasture, Outcrop/ Bare Soil, Mangroves, Rivers and Urban Areas. We found that some land use types that are structurally different from the original environments (Pasture, Outcrop/Bare Soil and Urban Areas) positively affected the occurrence of the species. The relationship between intensity of occurrence and highly anthropized land use types, suggests a plasticity of the species in habitat use that may be contributing to the maintenance of Red-browed Amazon populations in highly disturbed habitats. Therefore, we proposed that the management of disturbed areas, along with usual conservation strategies (e.g., conservation of forest remnants, restoration of degraded areas), could contribute to Red-browed Amazon conservation.

AB  - Combined bridge-tunnel scenarios of driving on mountainous city expressways occur when bridges and tunnels frequently alternate during driving. The complex nature of these driving scenarios imposes crucial requirements on the drivers' eye movement characteristics. This paper attempts to clarify these characteristics using descriptive statistics and the box graph method, registering the pupil diameter, blink duration, fixation, saccades, and fixation loci at different tunnel locations, bridges, and ramps. Realistic driving experiments were performed on the road segment spanning from the Nanchang tunnel to the Liujiatai tunnel freeway in Chongqing, China. Eye movement data were collected for 21 drivers. The experimental results showed that, while driving in the tunnel, the maximal pupil diameter of the participating drivers was approximately 4.0 mm as the driving mileage and the number of tunnels increased, and the maximal visual load on the drivers in the tunnel tended to be stable. At the second tunnel exit, the ramp, the middle section of the first bridge, and the third tunnel exit, the driving load was the highest, while the fixation duration was shorter for nighttime driving. The fixation duration was the longest for the diversion road of bridge B1 to the ramp during the day, and the fixation times were the longest at the beginning and end of the test road. The drivers more often paid attention to the speed dashboard while entering tunnels during daytime driving (compared with nighttime driving).

AB  - Greenspaces, including parks, provide various socio-ecological benefits such as for aesthetics, temperature remediation, biodiversity conservation, and outdoor recreation. The health benefits of urban greenspaces have received particular attention since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered various movement restrictions and lifestyle changes, including regarding the frequency of people's visits to greenspaces. Using mobile-tracking GPS data of Kanazawa citizens, we explored how citizens' behaviors with respect to outings changed before and during Japan's declaration of a COVID-19 state of emergency (April-May 2020). We also examined citizens' greenspace visits in relation to their travel distance from home. We found that Kanazawa citizens avoided going out during the pandemic, with a decrease in the number, time, and distance of outings. As for the means of transportation, the percentage of outings by foot increased on both weekdays and holidays. While citizens refrained from going out, the percentage change of the percentage in large greenspace visits increased very slightly in 2020. As for greenspace visitation in 2020 compared to 2019, we found that citizens generally visited greenspaces closer to their homes, actually increasing visitation of nearby (within 1000 m) greenspaces. This study of how outing behaviors and greenspace use by Kanazawa citizens have changed underscores the value of nearby greenspaces for physical and mental health during movement restrictions under the pandemic.

AB  - Since gang violence typically occurs within racial and ethnic communities, gangs observed to launch counter-normative, inter-racial attacks draw attention to the variable social processes that may underpin conflict relations. Controlling for other factors previously found to influence the structure of gang-on-gang conflict, this study investigated whether gangs launching inter-racial attacks were placing themselves in a strategic position that may offer networked advantages for criminal enterprise. Examining the conflict patterns of 136 criminal street gangs operating in the City of Los Angeles we observed structural characteristics akin to what is observed among successful organizations interlinked by competitive business relations. MR-QAP nodal regression models suggest that gang violence reflects structurally efficient attack patterns. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of our main results. We conclude that inter-racial patterns of street gang violence may reflect a subset of violence associated with competitive processes that advance criminal enterprise.

AB  - In urban computing composed of various Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data is collected from IoT as learning data for other IoT devices in a circular structure. Therefore, data are shared resources and crucial in urban computing. In particular, group communication is essential for effective data sharing and for updating software in an IoT system. However, changing the group key is imperative for data security in group communication whenever the group member changes. When the movement of IoTs is high, group key redistribution must be repeated because the group membership keeps changing. In changing and redistributing the group keys, overhead occurs, inevitably degrading system performance. In addition, since much data traffic generates in IoT devices' crowded areas, transmission delay and data loss could degrade system performance. Due to IoT's low-power and low-capacity characteristics, one-to-one communication is inefficient, requiring efficient group management and group key management. This work proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based group and group key management scheme to establish an efficient communication environment in urban computing. We adopted blockchains to track the movement and density of IoT and secure node authorization. Using the upper layer blockchain, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) determines the movement and density of IoTs. Using the lower-layer blockchain, base stations (BSs) identify the IoT's movement of information in each group. We included only nodes determined to be safe in the group. Through the hierarchical blockchain, while protecting the IoT's privacy, we can record the information in the blockchain to determine the mobility of nodes and the node density of a group. We set several experimental environments, and analyzed the efficiency by simulating the addition of secondary gateways and group integration. As a result, we showed that our proposal establishes an efficient communication environment and reduces computational and communication overhead.

AB  - Micro- and macro-plastics pollution is a growing threat for marine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and consequently human wellbeing. Numerical models that consider main sources of plastics and simulate their dispersal characteristics are unique tools for exploring plastic pollution in marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we used a Lagrangian plastic drift model, taking into account various sizes/types of plastic litter, originating from major land-based sources (coastal cities and rivers), to predict plastic accumulation zones in protected areas of the Mediterranean Sea (i.e., nationally designated MPAs, Natura 2000 sites, and Cetacean Critical Habitats). The model predicted that the size of plastic litters plays a key role in their dispersion and ultimate destination (i.e., larger litter travel longer distances). Most of the studied Mediterranean countries (13 out of 15) had at least one national MPA with over 55% of macroplastics originating from sources beyond their borders. Consequently, in many cases, local efforts to reduce plastic pollution in protected areas would be insufficient, especially for macroplastics management. Transboundary collaboration among Mediterranean countries is critical for implementing successful management plans against plastic pollution in their territorial waters and specifically in MPAs.

AB  - Beavers are large, semiaquatic rodents in the genus Castor native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The European beaver (Castor fiber) has an undoubtedly positive impact on the environment: it is a key species, which means that it plays a critical role in the biodiversity of ecosystems and that many species, some endangered or threatened, rely on beavers and the landscapes they build. In this way, there are many benefits that humans and other animal species can get from beavers. Also, dam construction has the potential to alter the hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystems of river corridors and the feedbacks between them, thus the beaver is also recognized as an 'ecosystem engineer'. However, beavers can also generate conflict situations because not all watercourses can withstand the intense construction of dams. Thus, in many contexts, the engineering activities of the beaver may come into direct conflict with other priorities: agriculture, urban land use, forestry, irrigation. Beavers occasionally damage selected trees, but the worst damage is caused by their burrows, which raise water levels in streams, ponds or lakes, flooding the ground and frequently killing large areas of valuable trees in the forest. There are proven costs to agriculture that result from the impact of beavers, and these will have to be fully taken into account in future decisions to manage the beaver population. The ecological impact of the Eurasian beaver on habitat structure has been little investigated in Europe and includes in particular the changes that take place during dam construction activities. The purpose of this study was to summarize the publications that analyse the ecological impact of beaver (Castor fiber).

AB  - Eco-environmental quality assessment is an important process for ensuring sustainable regional development because it encourages the construction of an ecological civilization. This assessment also lays a foundation for informing digital management and decision-making for the ecological environment in the near future. Due to the particularity of mountainous areas, its Eco-environmental quality assessment needs to be deeply specific and may require re-working. Here, the AHP-Entropy model was developed and constructed to scientifically analyze and evaluate the Eco-environmental quality in mountainous Western Sichuan in 2009 and 2019 at the township (street) unit. It is based on indicators representing Biological richness, Vegetation cover, Water network density, Land stress, and Social-economic stress. This newly developed model offers a more complete assessment, is based on more easily acquired data and has a higher accuracy than past models. The Eco-environmental quality index (EQI) representing eco-environmental quality (EEQ) has five levels of rating: Better, Good, Moderate, Bad and Worse. After applying this model to the region, the results show that: 1) The ecological environmental quality in the Western Sichuan mountains has improved over the past 10 years. 2) The eco-environment in the study area is generally Good, with small areas receiving a rating of Moderate. 3) The areas considered Better are mainly distributed on Longmen Mountain, Daliang mountain and Qionglai mountain, while the Moderate areas are mainly distributed in the western Chengdu Plain, the Panzhihua urban area, and Shaluli mountain. 4) The areas rated Better earn their rating due to high vegetation coverage, high habitat quality, and low degree of land degradation, such as land desertification and soil erosion. The areas with moderate eco-environmental quality were mainly affected by frequent human activity or serious land degradation. This comprehensive regional Eco-environmental quality assessment can also be used in other areas with mountains.

AB  - Street view image classification aiming at the urban land use analysis is difficult because the class labels (e.g., commercial area) are concepts with higher abstract levels compared to the ones of general visual tasks (e.g., persons and cars). Therefore, classification models using only visual features often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this article, a novel approach based on a x201C;bottom-up and top-downx201D; framework is proposed. Instead of using visual features of the whole image directly as common image-level models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do, the proposed framework first obtains low-level semantic, namely, the bounding boxes of buildings in street view images through a bottom-up object discovery process. Their contextual information, such as the co-occurrence patterns of building classes and their layout, is then encoded into metadata by the proposed algorithm x201C;Context encOding of Detected buildINGsx201D; (CODING). Finally, these metadata (low-level semantic encoded with context information) are abstracted to high-level semantic, namely, the land use label of the street view image through a top-down semantic aggregation process implemented by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, in order to effectively discover low-level semantic as the bridge between visual features and higher abstract concepts, we made a dual-labeled data set named x201C;Building dEtection And Urban funcTional-zone portraYingx201D; (BEAUTY) of 19070 street view images and 38857 buildings based on the existing BICx005F;GSV. The data set can be used not only for street view image classification but also for multiclass building detection. Experiments on x201C;BEAUTYx201D; show that the proposed approach achieves a 12.65x0025; performance improvement on macroprecision and 12x0025; on macrorecall over image-level CNN-based models.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems in the western USA have been invaded by non-native woody species deliberately introduced for stream bank stabilization, agricultural windbreaks, and urban shade. Recent work suggests that the non-native tree Ulmus pumila (Siberian elm) is capable of significant spread in western riparian ecosystems, that range infilling is still incomplete, and that the invasion is dispersal-limited. Our objective was to understand the interacting roles of propagule pressure from upland U. pumila, human influences, and river geomorphology in promoting riparian U. pumila invasion along the South Platte River, Colorado, USA. We used linear regression and information-theoretic model selection to evaluate the relative importance of these factors to riparian U. pumila stem density. U. pumila stem density increased with increasing channel and floodplain restriction and increasing human influence from both urban and rural development. Model selection indicated that local upland U. pumila seed sources were relatively unimportant to riparian U. pumila stem density, suggesting that upland propagule pressure is currently contributing less than other human influences to U. pumila spread along the South Platte River. In particular, higher road density was the most important predictor for the proportional abundance of smaller U. pumila individuals (DBH<5-cm and 5-15-cm), suggesting that human influence in densely populated areas has been the primary driver of recent U. pumila population expansion. U. pumila stem density was only weakly associated with abundance of other common riparian tree species. Land managers and other entities concerned with non-native tree invasion into important riparian habitat may be able to reduce U. pumila spread most effectively by focusing U. pumila control efforts where human influences are greatest.

AB  - The 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill movement (Anti-ELAB) in Hong Kong peaked the tactical radicalization of the city's recent protest history. At the same time, it signified unprecedented tactical reconciliation between moderate and radical protestors that maintained strong movement momentum and a high degree of solidarity for a long period. An ethics of solidarity was successfully formulated to illuminate deliberative practices among participants. However, the change of protest spatiality and repertoire from wildcat protesting to temporary occupation at a university campus altered the dynamics of protestors and weakened deliberative communication. This paper illustrates the struggles and learning curves of students who suffered deliberative deficit in the interaction with other protestors. This paper argues that the occupation, despite its contested nature, offered informal experiential learning of civic engagement for the students to their political literacy and civic mentality towards social movement under the intense setting of real politics.

AB  - With the development of urbanization, the problem of green space ecological environment pollution becomes increasingly sharp and complicated. Online monitoring based on the traditional technology is not very comprehensive, and there are always defects such as a false positive rate. Therefore, this paper proposes an online monitoring method for the green space ecological space pollution network based on its vulnerability. An independent functional expression was constructed by interpreting and analyzing the fragile zone and the clear calculation standards of its width index and overlap index, and vulnerability and comprehensive indicators were constructed to reduce the occurrence of false positives. The online monitoring method was constructed based on the heterogeneous integration and the local conditions. The experimental results show the following: the proposed method has low false alarm rate, high accuracy, excellent stability, and a good online monitoring effect of the ecological pollution network.

AB  - The concept of "Ecosystem Services (ES)" has gained global importance since the 1990s. Today its link to sustainable development and human welfare is well documented. However, the level of know-how and the scale and effectiveness of practices differ significantly around the globe. The Ecosystem Services Partnership (ESP) National Network of Turkey aims to fill gaps in ES research and foster collaboration among experts in the public and academic sectors and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, a comprehensive review of ES studies was carried out with rigorous literature research. The review of 247 publications showed that ES research has advanced in the last two decades principally as a result of academia's impetus but increasing efforts in the science-policy interface have also supported its integration into diverse policy sectors. Among all ES, regulating ES were studied more intensely due to the growing effects of climate change on leading economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and water management. Monetary valuation and trade-off knowledge have remained low, based on the difficulties in data availability and assessment methods. Although protected areas are critical to biodiversity conservation, the ES concept has not been integrated into protected area management. Therefore, the ES knowledge in Turkey needs to be scaled up to cover the national level, with higher stakeholder engagement and more focused implementation driven by political will.

AB  - This paper investigates the influence of broadband internet availability in the occurrence of events of civil unrest. Using collected data on 2011's Occupy Movement in the U.S., we find that each new Internet Service Provider (which is associated to an increase in broadband penetration) accounts for an increase between 1 and 3 p.p. in the probability of observing protests in a given location. Results are consistent when analyzing county-level data for the contiguous U.S., for each different U.S. region separately (North-east, Midwest, South and West), and when analyzing city-level data for California.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The presence of microplastics (MPs) has been recognized as a significant environmental threat due to adverse effects spanning from molecular level, organism health, ecosystem services to human health and well-being. MPs are complex environmental contaminants as they bind to a wide range of other contaminants. MPs associated contaminants include toxic chemical substances that are used as additives during the plastic manufacturing process and adsorbed contaminants that co-exist with MPs in aquatic environments. With the transfer between the water column and sediments, and the migration within aquatic systems, such contaminants associated MPs potentially pose high risk to aquatic systems. However, only limited research has been undertaken currently to link the environmental risk associated with MPs occurrence and movement behaviour in aquatic systems. Given the significant environmental risk and current knowledge gaps, this review focuses on the role played by the abundance of different MP species in water and sediment compartments as well as provides the context for assessing and quantifying the multiple risks associated with the occurrence and movement behaviour of different MP types. Based on the review of past literature, it is found that the physicochemical properties of MPs influence the release/sorption of other contaminants and current MPs transport modelling studies have primarily focused on virgin plastics rather than aged plastics. Additionally, risk assessment of contaminants-associated MPs needs significantly more research. This paper consolidates the current state-of-the art knowledge on the source to sink movement behaviour of MPs and methodologies for assessing the risk of different MP species. Moreover, knowledge gaps and emerging trends in the field are also identified for future research endeavours.

AB  - Objective Food insecurity is a significant and growing concern undermining the wellbeing of 30% of the global population. Food in/security is a complex construct consisting of four dimensions: availability, access, utilization, and stability, making it challenging to measure. We provide a toolkit human biologists/ecologists can use to advance research on this topic. Methods We review the strengths and limitations of common tools used to measure food access and utilization, the two dimensions most proximate to people's lived experience, and emphasize tools that provide data needed to best link food security with human biological outcomes. We also discuss methods that provide contextual data human biologists/ecologists will find useful for study design, ensuring instrument validity, and improving data quality. Results Food access is principally measured using experience-based instruments that emphasize economic access. Social access, such as food sharing, is under-studied and we recommend using social network analysis to explore this dimension. In terms of utilization, emphasis has been on food choice measured as dietary diversity. Food preparation and intrahousehold distribution, also part of the utilization dimension, are less studied and standardized instruments for measuring both are lacking. The embodiment of food insecurity has focused on child growth, although a growing literature addresses adult mental wellbeing and chronic and infectious disease risk. Conclusions We see the potential to expand outcomes to include reproductive and immune function, physical activity, and the gut microbiome. Human biologists/ecologists are well-positioned to advance understanding of the human health impacts of food insecurity and provide data to support intervention efforts.

AB  - Malaysia Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) aims to bring the business, education, tourism and other industry sectors back into operation. Due to movement constraints that result in local economic patterns, individual mobility patterns are expected to occur. However, this matter needs further investigation from people's spatial behaviour during the RMCO. Therefore, this research proposed a new technique for analysing people's spatial behaviour patterns via geo-tagged data. The data from social media users are gathered using data mining techniques. Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to show the geolocation of social media users and analyse their spatial behaviour. The finding of this analysis shows higher levels of movement recorded when the RMCO was enforced; a distinctive pattern where spatial trajectory length is high but spatial area coverage is low. It is noticed that the focal points are concentrated in urban areas and tourism attractions.

AB  - The analysis and prediction of the Earthquake for smart cities are of greatest significance because all the critical infrastructure like drinking water resources, mobile networks, healthcare, power grid, and transportation, may affect the social-economic balance of the place which is tampered with such natural disasters. An earthquake has some effect on the environment due to the sudden movement of tectonic plates known as Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEE). These changes can be divided into 2 categories namely primary (e.g. subsidence, surface faulting) and secondary effects (displaced rocks, tsunami, landslides). In this paper, the major contribution revolves around earthquakes and their analysis. Earthquakes occur due to the shifting of tectonic plates on the lithosphere. These movements occur due to the Frictional stress between gliding plate borders builds up and leads to fault line failure. This sudden shaking of the plates releases a certain kind of energy in the Lithosphere which creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are also categorized into different classes ranging from minor to great, depending on their magnitude.

AB  - Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773), also known as the harlequin ladybird, is an invasive non-native species intentionally introduced to many countries as a biological control agent of agricultural pests. In Greece, H. axyridis was first introduced as a biological control agent in 1994, with releases taking place between 1994 and 2000. For many years there was no evidence to indicate that H. axyridis had established self-sustaining populations. In 2008, a citizen science campaign was initiated aimed at raising awareness regarding the invasive status of H. axyridis to farmers and agronomists. The campaign did not yield results, and it was discontinued in 2011. During this study, the distribution, phenology, and presence of H. axyridis in different habitat types and protected areas in Greece are investigated, using both citizen science data and literature records. Records from i Nu aturalist, the Alientoma database and social media examined herein demonstrate that H. axyridis has been established in Greece since 2010. Harmonia axyridis is currently present in 13 administrative districts of Greece, most of them at a considerable distance from the initial release sites. The harlequin ladybird is present in urban and agricultural habitats as well as seventeen NATURA 2000 sites. The adverse socioeconomic and environmental impacts of H. axyridis are briefly discussed alongside suggestions for management activities. Based on our findings, we propose the establishment of a national monitoring scheme for H. axyridis and native ladybirds that will also encourage public participation in recording ladybird observations and provide information on the distribution, spread and impact of this invasive non-native species.

AB  - At conventional construction sites, the removal of soil and other excavated materials causes enormous mass movement, with a significant climate impact and contribution to global CO2 release. This study aimed to generate a Circular Soil concept for reusing excavated materials by creating engineered soils for landscape construction at large building sites. Engineered soils act as a substitute for natural soils and fulfill vital technical and soil functions when installing an urban green infrastructure (GI). In a field study, the vegetation performance on engineered soils was evaluated to establish a methodological approach, to assess the applicability of the Circular Soil concept. First, the technical specifications (grain-size distribution) were modeled for intensive green roof and turfgrass applications. Then, the soil components were optimized, mixed, installed and tested for greenery purposes, focusing on plant growth performance indicators (vitality, projective cover ratio and grass-herb ratio) to assess the vegetation performance. The results showed that the engineered soils match the performance of the reference soil alternatives. In conclusion, the Circular Soil concept has a high potential to contribute considerably to sustainable on-site soil management and the circular economy. It can be applied on a larger scale for urban GI development and sustainable resources management in the landscaping and construction sector.

AB  - Background: Mosquito control is currently the main tool available to contain the spread of several arboviruses in Brazil. We have evaluated the association between entomological surveys of female adult Aedes aegypti and the Breteau index (BI) in space and time in a hyperendemic area, and compared the human resources costs required to measure each of these indicators.
   Methods: Entomological surveys were conducted between 2016 and 2019 in Vila Toninho, a neighborhood in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil. Monthly records of collected mosquito specimens were made and then grouped by season.
   Results: Our findings showed that adult and immature mosquitoes are more related in time than in space, possibly due to differences in their habitats or in climate variables. Bayesian temporal modeling revealed that an increase in 1 standard deviation in the BI was associated with a 27% increase in the number of adult female mosquitoes when adjusted for climatic conditions. The cost of entomological surveys of adult mosquitoes was found to be 83% lower than the cost of determining the BI when covering the same geographic area.
   Conclusions: For fine-scale assessments, a simple measure of adult Ae. aegypti abundance may be more realistic than aquatic indicators, but the adult indices are not necessarily the only reliable measure. Surveying adult female mosquitoes has significant potential for optimizing vector control strategies because, unlike the BI, this tool provides an effective indicator for micro-areas within an urban region. It should be noted that the results of the present study may be due to specific features of of the study area, and future studies should analyze whether the patterns found in the study neighborhood are also found in other regions.

AB  - Land cover has been modified by anthropogenic activities for thousands of years, although the speed of change has increased in recent decades, particularly driven by socio-economic development. The development of transport infrastructure can accelerate land use land cover change, resulting in impacts on natural resources such as water, biodiversity, and food production. To understand the interaction between land cover and social-ecological drivers, changing land cover patterns and drivers of change must be identified and quantified. This study documents land cover dynamics along the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) corridor in Kenya and evaluates the underlying drivers of this change from 2000 to 2019. The study utilised GIS and remote sensing techniques to assess the land use and land cover changes along the SGR corridor, while correlational and regression analyses were used to evaluate various drivers of the changes. Results showed that built-up areas, bare lands, water bodies, croplands and forests increased by 144.39%, 74.73%, 74.42%, 9.32% and 4.85%, respectively, while wetlands, grasslands and shrub lands reduced by 98.54%, 67.00% and 33.86%, respectively. The underlying drivers responsible for these land use and land cover dynamics are population growth, urbanisation, economic growth and agro-ecological factors. Such land cover changes affect environmental sustainability, and we stress the need to adequately identify and address the cumulative social and environmental impacts of mega-infrastructure projects and their interacting investments. The findings of this study provide an evidence base for the evaluation of the social-ecological impacts of the SGR and the implementation of best practices that will lead to enhanced sustainability in the development corridors in Kenya and beyond.

AB  - In the Central Himalayan mountains forest ecosystems occupy over two-third of the landscape. People of the region largely depend upon a variety of ecosystem goods and services (ES) emanating from these forest ecosystems for their subsistence living. The rich diversity of Central Himalayan forests harbors over 675 wild plant species used by people as food/edible, meets the protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamin and mineral requirement, fuelwood, fodder, fiber, resin, gums and medicinal plants for sustaining life that also accrue immense economic wealth to the nation and generate employment and income to the rural people. In addition, they provide a large sink for atmospheric CO2 and thus contribute to the climate change mitigation. These forests vary considerably from each other with respect to structure and functioning, and the seasonality and magnitude of flow of ES. However, in the recent decades owing to changing livelihood avenues and increasing developmental aspirations the forested landscapes are facing landuse change for infrastructure development such as urban sprawl, road network, hydro-projects and other activities. These activities along with unsustainable use of natural resources is leading to degradation of forests and decline in ES, jeopardizing agri-sylvi-pastoral forest-based livelihood of the rural people. Thus, rural society at large is facing confrontation between subsistence living, environmental conservation and developmental imperatives. Policy makers are looking for compensatory mechanisms in lieu of the bygone opportunity cost of landuse conversion for developmental activities. The immediate challenge is how to take the intangible services of the forest ecosystems into accounting of state domestic product as valuation of ES and payment mechanism is still developing. This article depicts linkages among ecology, economy and society and figure out complexities and challenges in quantification and valuation of ES from the standpoint of both academic and policy making, and calls for ecologists and economists to work together to provide sustainable solutions for environmental conservation and sustainable development in the Himalayan region.

AB  - The article examines the high schools' occupations between May and July 1973, focusing the analysis on the city of Rosario. The study, developed from research with documentary sources and interviews, allows us to understand the significance of the high school student movement, its dynamics of action, demands and experiences in a context of strong political radicalization in the beginning of the government of Hector Campora.
   The hypothesis of this article is that the occupied of schools were a central event in the reconfiguration of the high school student's movement, which has been generally underestimated. At the same time, it is argued that beyond the rhetoric against continuismo, the occupation enabled specific demands that set the agenda for the movement. Finally, a diverse range of political groups participated in the occupation of the educational institutions where the Peronist groups stood out for their growth and projection in the following months.

AB  - Background: Previous research has found that built environment features (e.g., density, diversity and design) influence children's mode of transportation choice during school excursions. How-ever, little is known about how and to what extent neighbourhood street morphology impacts students' commuting patterns.Methods: We studied the commuting patterns of children from 18 primary schools in three distinct urban fabric zones (inner, middle, and outer) in Shiraz, Iran. Parents with children in primary grades of 1-6 (n = 1503) were chosen to report on their children's school journey diaries. To examine street network layout, five well-known indices based on the Space Syntax methodology were used: Connectivity, Integration, Control, Intelligibility, and Choice. In order to select a local catchment area for each individual student, an inventory GIS model was created.Results: Intelligibility and Integration are found to have a positive association with students' walking distances of 400 and 800 m among local morphological elements. Students are more likely to stroll when the space's readability, continuity, and coherence improve. Control and Choice, on the other hand, had a detrimental influence on the walking of students.Conclusion: Active mobility to school is associated with urban layout characteristics among Ira-nian Students, especially within a radius of 800 m. This study discovered that increasing the movement potential of space within an 800 m radius had a greater impact on a child's ability to walk than increasing the movement potential of space within a 400 m radius, and that the Integration (R3), Choice (R3), and Intelligence of the street network within an 800 m radius of students' homes was linked to better walking between home and school. Improving the read-ability, cohesion, and spatial continuity of the local street network might boost their propensity to walk to school.

AB  - In this essay, we propose a new estimation of Argentina's real wages in the second phase of the first globalization (1895-1913). Using new sources of the period, we propose an estimation of the evolution in the price index and the wages of two urban labor categories in the economic structure (unskilled workers and skilled employees) for the Argentine provinces. The results tend to show a general growth in wages along the period. Between 1895 and 1903 this expansive dynamic is related to a big deflation episode after 1897 and the nominal wages recovery after the 1890 crisis. From 1904 to 1913, the wages grew slower, but the general index showed an improvement, related to a process of modernization on the labor structure, that resulted in a considerable skill level improvement among the workers. Provincial datasets show a wide diversity of trends at subnational level, including sharp rises, moderate increase and stagnation along the period. We suggest that this movement of wages is the result of an externality of an endogenous dynamic of the growth of regional economies. (C) 2021 Asociacion Espanola de Historia Economica

AB  - Urban-to-rural migration is a rising trend across industrialized countries, the significance of which is not interpreted unanimously. The explanations tend to fall into two competing groups: (a) an alternative to capitalism or (b) perpetuation of the status quo, where, on one hand, the richer participants effect a green lifestyle choice, while the poorer participants follow a coping strategy, on the other. Instead of focusing only on the radical fringe, this article describes and analyzes the diversity of the present-day neorural movement in France. It argues that the neorural movement is a multivocal critique of modern capitalist societies that rapidly transforms into an apolitical lifestyle choice once it is confronted with the capitalist value-making mechanisms. It shows that the deradicalization of rural utopia has to do with social stratification and people's enormous difficulty in reappropriating their agency over their time-use and lives at the household level. Finally, it suggests that the imagery of rural utopia could be mobilized for constructing a shared alternative, but one that would require rewriting the rules of socioeconomic interdependence.

AB  - This article brings Black feminist thought to bear on the urban geography of racialised financial violence. Our analysis focuses on the Moms 4 Housing movement, which began when five Black mothers occupied a vacant, corporate investor-owned house in West Oakland to protest how real estate speculation is fuelling displacement and homelessness for Black Oakland residents, disrupting care at the scale of the home and community. In taking space through recuperating the house on Magnolia Street, the Moms insist on housing as a site of care central to the survival of Black families and reclaim Oakland as a Black geographic space. In claiming ownership based on relations of care while refusing the institution of private property, we argue the Moms engage in speculative urban worldmaking-a form of collective care and a praxis of providing an alternative present that imagines and advocates for urban futures beyond financialisation's abstract racial violence.

AB  - Landslides are the most recurrent natural hazards in the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ), affecting sometimes lives but extremely frequently and severely the traffic and associated infrastructure. The present research proposes the calculation of the landslide susceptibility cartographic model in the city of Quito and its main highway, the Simon Bolivar avenue, using the Fuzzy logic and multicriteria evaluation techniques in geographic information systems (GIS). Based on the "Today and the past son key to the future" principle, landslides have been located using aerial photographs and field work. Based on the characteristics of historical landslides, photointerpreted and previous studies, the causal factors have been variable such as topography, structural geology, lithology, precipitation, water network, vegetation cover, among others. Each factor has been processed, analyzed and standardized according to its relationship to the occurrence of landslides, by means of a sinusoidal linked function that assigns to each element a degree of correlation [0,1] to the diffuse set. The landslide vulnerability map has been obtained from the combination of causal factors by map algebra, such as weighting techniques that include the hierarchical analysis process (HAP) and the weighted linear line (WLL), whose validation considered the locations of inventoried landslides.

AB  - Phylogeographic investigation of the Mexico City HIV epidemic illustrates the complexity of HIV transmission in the region. An active transmission area involving a few municipalities in the north of the city, with transmission links throughout the region, is identified and could be a location where targeted interventions could have a more pronounced effect on the entire regional epidemic, compared with those dispersed in other manners.
   Evolutionary analyses of viral sequences can provide insights into transmission dynamics, which in turn can optimize prevention interventions. Here, we characterized the dynamics of HIV transmission within the Mexico City metropolitan area. HIV pol sequences from persons recently diagnosed at the largest HIV clinic in Mexico City (between 2016 and 2021) were annotated with demographic/geographic metadata. A multistep phylogenetic approach was applied to identify putative transmission clades. A data set of publicly available sequences was used to assess international introductions. Clades were analyzed with a discrete phylogeographic model to evaluate the timing and intensity of HIV introductions and transmission dynamics among municipalities in the region. A total of 6,802 sequences across 96 municipalities (5,192 from Mexico City and 1,610 from the neighboring State of Mexico) were included (93.6% cisgender men, 5.0% cisgender women, and 1.3% transgender women); 3,971 of these sequences formed 1,206 clusters, involving 78 municipalities, including 89 clusters of >= 10 sequences. Discrete phylogeographic analysis revealed (i) 1,032 viral introductions into the region, over one-half of which were from the United States, and (ii) 354 migration events between municipalities with high support (adjusted Bayes factor of >= 3). The most frequent viral migrations occurred between northern municipalities within Mexico City, i.e., Cuauhtemoc to Iztapalapa (5.2% of events), Iztapalapa to Gustavo A. Madero (5.4%), and Gustavo A. Madero to Cuauhtemoc (6.5%). Our analysis illustrates the complexity of HIV transmission within the Mexico City metropolitan area but also identifies a spatially active transmission area involving a few municipalities in the north of the city, where targeted interventions could have a more pronounced effect on the entire regional epidemic.

AB  - Contrary to expectation, dengue incidence decreased in many countries during the period when stringent population movement restrictions were imposed to combat COVID-19. Using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we previously reported a 74% reduction in the predicted number of dengue cases from March 2020 to April 2021 in the whole of Sri Lanka, with reductions occurring in all 25 districts in the country. The reduction in dengue incidence was accompanied by an 87% reduction in larval collections of Aedes vectors in the northern city of Jaffna. It was proposed that movement restrictions led to reduced human contact and blood feeding by Aedes vectors, accompanied by decreased oviposition and vector densities, which were responsible for diminished dengue transmission. These findings are extended in the present study by investigating the relationship between dengue incidence, population movement restrictions, and vector larval collections between May 2021 and July 2022, when movement restrictions began to be lifted, with their complete removal in November 2021. The new findings further support our previous proposal that population movement restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced dengue transmission primarily by influencing human-Aedes vector interaction dynamics.

AB  - Dengue is a major mosquito-borne disease in many tropical and sub-tropical countries worldwide, with entomological surveillance and control activities as the key management approaches. This study aimed to explore the spatial dispersal of the vector Aedes albopictus, captured by the modified sticky ovitrap (MSO) in residential areas with low-rise buildings in Selangor, Malaysia. Distribution maps were created and shown as temporally distinguished classes based on hotspot analysis by Getis-Ord; spatial autocorrelation assessed by semivariograms using the exponential Kernel function; and universal Kriging showing areas with estimated high and low vector densities. Distribution, hotspot and interpolated maps were analysed based on the total number of mosquitoes by month and week. All maps in the present study were generated and visualised in ArcMap. Spatial autocorrelation ofAe. albopictus based on the monthly occurrence ofAe. albopictus was found in March, April, October, November and December 2018, and when based on the weekly numbers, in weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27, 31, 33, 42, 49 and 52. Semivariograms, based on the monthly and weekly numbers of Ae. albopictus, indicated spatial autocorrelation of the species extending between 50 and 70 m. The mosquito density maps reported in this study may provide beneficial information to facilitate implementation of more efficient entomological control activities.

AB  - Switzerland's alpine ecologies are uniquely affected by climate change. Many of the country's plant species are migrating higher in altitude due to rising annual mean temperature with extensive habitat loss expected in as early as 2050. Given the compounded effects of the growing tourism economy and the expanding presence of aggressive pioneer plant species, regionally significant alpine meadows have been displaced before their sensitive and rare plant communities can adapt. This impending loss of biodiversity is quickly becoming a national ecological redoubt.
   Situated at the crossroads of the Oberalp, the St. Gotthard, and the Furka passes, the town of Andermatt lies at the eastern end of the Urseren Valley, a floristically diverse region of Central Switzerland. Abandoned military bunkers and fortresses (Fort Stockli and Artillery Works Gutsch) overlook Andermatt as relics of the Swiss National Redoubt defence plan.
   This project investigates how specific military infrastructure integrated into the landscape can be repurposed into living archives for research, preservation, and propagation of alpine plant communities. Can this design strategy combining active and passive interventions mitigate anthropocentric pressures on these alpine ecologies while providing a new purpose to outmoded military infrastructure? Will a strategically managed ecological retreat preserve Swiss identity beyond the non-human?

AB  - This article examines the rise of charter schools in New York City through the lens of representation of educators on school governing boards. During its inception in the early 1990s, the charter school movement garnered support from progressives and conservatives alike. Albert Shanker, longtime head of the American Federation of Teachers, initially endorsed charter schools as engines for experimentation to be carried out by educators with fresh and potentially radical theories of pedagogy. While the charter school movement has pushed full steam ahead over the past three decades, the role of teachers in this expansion remains unclear. I use publicly available data from the New York State Education Department to identify 268 authorized charter schools for the 2020-21 academic school year. I record data on charter school board membership made available by the New York City Department of Education and State University of New York and then scrape the web (school websites, LinkedIn profiles, online CVs) for board members' current and prior professional occupations. Descriptive results suggest that school board members are overrepresented by financiers and business managers while current and past educators are less represented. The lack of teacher representation on charter school boards suggests that the charter school movement has not followed through on its initial promise to help professionalize teaching and enhance the role of educators in school governance.

KW  - LANDSCAPE
AB  - Buffer zones help protect historical heritage sites' integrity, authenticity, and sustainability, and thus are an essential measure for protecting such sites. Traditional buffer zone delineation considers mainly the urban texture, a rigid boundary, visual corridor construction, and other factors. A more direct approach is designating a rated outer periphery that includes historic properties as a buffer zone. However, boundaries determined by single-value orientation tend to omit protected objects. A buffer zone formed by boundary translation and enclosure will include many low-value areas in the protection scope, thereby wasting resources and affecting historic towns' natural development, resulting in a severe contradiction between humanity and the earth. This paper proposes a new method for delimiting buffer zones. The method arises from the field that covers the value assessment of cultural heritage and from the principles of comprehensive protection, which combine cultural heritage's tangible and intangible properties. We used 29 historical preservation plans as samples to obtain statistics on their protection content, selected natural and agriculture landscapes, architectural features, construction quality, number of stories in a building, building age, protection class, street pattern, historical elements, urban texture, cultural industry, and cultural elements according to the frequency of occurrence as the primary factors affecting a buffer zone's boundary demarcation. These factors were weighed and evaluated by the multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to create a comprehensive evaluation map for helping determine a buffer zone's boundary. Using such method, we identified the value of historical heritage through employing the quantitative analysis method of MCDM. We also used the evaluation result to determine the buffer zone boundary objectively. This approach rectifies the problems found in previous studies, namely an incomplete accounting of all relevant factors and a lack of data; it also provides a definition of an historical heritage buffer zone.

AB  - Remote sensing imagery (RSI) and point of interest (POI) are two complementary data for urban functional zone (UFZ) extraction. However, current methods only use single data or just simply fuse the features extracted from these two data, which may not fully exploit their complementary strength. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a unified deep learning framework containing two modules to jointly use RSI and POIs for UFZ extraction. In the first module, the complementary feature learning and fusing module, two coupled convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs) are used to learn the visual feature from RSI and social feature from POIs, respectively. Specifically, to apply CNN on discrete POIs, we convert them into a hierarchical distance heatmap, and employ CNN with the attention mechanism to extract the co-occurrence relationship of POIs in a specific UFZ for social feature representation. Afterward, we ensemble these two coupled CNNs by a feature attention based fusion strategy, to fuse the complementary features learned from RSI and POIs with adaptively learned weights in an end-to-end manner. In the second module, the UFZ spatial relationship modeling module, different from previous methods that only consider features in single UFZ, we design a spatial relation learning network, which can aggregate both local and long-range between-UFZ spatial relationship for UFZ classification. Experiments on three urban regions demonstrate that the proposed framework can take full advantage of visual, social, and spatial features learned from both RSI and POIs, and thus achieve more satisfactory result than the methods using single data or simple fusion strategy. Furthermore, we analyze the impacts of several factors on UFZ extraction, including the contributions of different category of POIs on UFZ extraction improvement, the synergy mechanism of RSI and POIs for the classification of UFZs, and the influence of using different mapping unit for UFZ mapping. The insights distilled from this study can potentially help researchers use heterogeneous data for UFZ extraction.

AB  - It is imperative to understand human movement and behavior, from epidemic monitoring to complex communications. So far, most research and studies on investigating and interpreting human movements have traditionally depended on private and accumulated data such as mobile records. In this work, social network data is suggested as a proxy for human mobility, as it relies on a large amount of publicly accessible data. A mechanism for urban mobility mining and extraction scheme is proposed in this research to shed light on the importance and benefits of the publicly available social network data. Given the potential value of the Big Data obtained from social network platforms, we sought to demonstrate the process of analyzing and understanding human mobility patterns and activity behavior in urban areas through the social network data. Human mobility is far from spontaneous, follows well-defined statistical patterns. This research provides evidence of spatial and temporal regularity in human mobility patterns by examining daily individual trajectories of users covering an average time span of three years (2018 to 2020). Despite the diversity of individual movements history, we concluded that humans follow simple, reproducible patterns. Additionally, we studied and evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on human mobility and activity behavior in urban areas and established a strong association between human mobility and COVID-19 spread. Numerous years of mobility data analysis can reveal well-established trends, such as social or cultural activities, which serve as a baseline for detecting anomalies and changes in human mobility and activity behavior.

AB  - The modeling and prediction of land movement susceptibility hazards, i.e., debris flow, landslide, and rock fall, can assist in controlling and preventing a variety of societal and environmental damages. The purpose of this study was to develop a land movement susceptibility hazard model of debris flow, landslide, and multiple land movement, i.e., combination of debris flow and landslide in the Saveh city of Markazi Province, Iran, using an ensemble of Bayesian generalized linear model (BGLM), sparse partial least squares (SPLS), boosted tree (BT), and random forest (RF) algorithms. For this purpose, 167 debris flow points, 261 landslide points, and 257 multiple (debris flow and landslide) points were identified based on field visits and available information, and 15 suitable conditioning factors were prepared as independent variables for this study. The accuracy and efficiency of the models were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and other statistical indices. The variable importance result indicates that slope is the most important factor in debris flow (25.53), landslide (31.39), and multiple hazard (41.90) occurrences. The accuracy assessment results in the validation phase revealed that the RF is the most optimal among the applied algorithms, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.90, 0.94, and 0.89 for debris flow, landslide, and multiple (D + L) hazard modeling. The findings of this study indicated that the use of a Bayesian and tree-based ensemble model in preparing a land movement-related disaster map could be useful among policymakers and land use planners for sustainable land use management and practices.

AB  - Through the understanding of cartography as an alternative representation tool, this paper researches the existing and usually invisible relationships between informal micro-activities and formal public spaces. For this purpose, Carapungo Entry Park located in the north of Quito (Ecuador), is taken as a case study, being a paradigmatic case of the complexity and multiplicity that constitutes informality in Latin American cities. After a first analysis based on the formal planning of this park, we will focus on dissident spatial practices carried out by inhabitants who occupy and appropriate a formal space. These situations of conflict originate spatial constructions based on spontaneity, fluidity, adaptability, movement, and temporality, which include local culture, economy, and social interaction. With the production of cartographies, the processes and activities generated by formal and informal vendors, passers-by, and public transport passengers, are made visible and analyzed. The expected results based on cartography as an alternative representation, are the presentation of relations of tensions, forces, conflicts, and negotiations that allow us to identify patterns, trends and behaviors that have no place in the supposed precision and rigor of the regulations in the formal planning of public space.

AB  - Trichonephila clavata, also known as the Joro spider, was first discovered in Georgia, USA in 2014. Its arrival from Asia and subsequent range expansion across the southeastern U.S. has received much media coverage, spanning from factual to sensational. Here, we describe T. clavata's invasion potential and known invasive range, and review its biology, dispersal abilities, potential impacts, and management strategies. As of October 2022, T. clavata's range spans at least 120,000 km(2), occurring across Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee, with additional reports in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. Its pattern of spread suggests it is primarily driven by natural dispersal mechanisms, such as ballooning, though human-mediated transport cannot be discounted. Like other large-bodied orb-weavers, T. clavata captures and feeds on flying insects and potentially other small animals, and we suggest thirteen co-occurring spider species that should be monitored for competition with T. clavata for resources and web-building sites. Since T. clavata is spreading across both natural and urban habitats, management options are limited. Overall, very little is known about this species in its new North American range, especially its impacts within this novel ecosystem. Thus, we advise journalists and experts alike against exaggerating its potential environmental impact or uncritical acceptance of the spider as ecologically harmless. Instead, T. clavata's rapid spread should be carefully monitored, and we should take a cautious, evidence-based approach when determining next steps.

AB  - This editorial introduces the Special Section "Commons and Social Movements", which centers on how social movements and commons initiatives shape each other. The Section responds to the recent momentum gained by the "commons movement" in Europe and across the world, as well as the consolidation of a critical scholarship that expands the frontiers of institutional ecological economics for the study of the commons. The diversity of contributions included in the Section illustrates the novelty of the topic. Still, some transversal themes emerge, including the coevolution of movements and commons, the role of heterogeneities, and cross-scalar dynamics. Also promising are the authors' efforts to put the commons and social movement theories in dialogue via con-cepts like water rooted collectives, management opportunity structures, collective reactions to commons grab-bing or liminal commons. Also important is the common understanding across all contributions about the potential of commons movements as sustainability transformation actors. Commons movements can break policy status quos but also prefigure, perform and scale up-and-out alternatives. This is probably the main take home message of this Section and we hope also a motivation to further a research agenda around it.

AB  - We investigated the roadkills of vertebrates in Ishinomaki City, northern Japan, for 1 full year (from April 2020 to March 2021), and attention was paid to (1) locations where the roadkill occurred, (2) the relationship between roadkill frequency and traffic volume, and (3) seasonality of roadkills and relationship with life events of target species. Over the study period, we recorded 1059 roadkill cases (2.9 records/day) from at least twenty-six vertebrates, among which three mammals (raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, domestic cat Felis catus, and sika deer Cervus nippon) accounted for more than 75% of the total cases. The locations where frequent roadkills occurred were species-specific as follows: suburban areas for raccoon dogs, within urban areas for cats, and forests, especially peninsula areas, for deer. Roadkill frequency (per kilometer) for raccoon dogs and cats showed a positive correlation with traffic volume, indicating that the prevention of animals from crossing roads would be an effective strategy of mitigating roadkills of these animals. Roadkills of raccoon dogs occurred frequently during fall (September-October), a season that corresponds to their dispersal period. Such seasonality was not found for roadkills of cats (probably due to altered life as pets) and deer (attributed to low seasonal changes in home range utilization). We suggest that management strategies can be adopted to mitigate roadkills from the viewpoint of the behavioral characteristics of target mammals.

AB  - The simulation and analysis of future land use and land cover-LULC scenarios using artificial neural networks (ANN)-has been applied in the last 25 years, producing information for environmental and territorial policy making and implementation. LULC changes have impacts on many levels, e.g., climate change, biodiversity and ecosystem services, soil quality, which, in turn, have implications for the landscape. Therefore, it is fundamental that planning is informed by scientific evidence. The objective of this work was to develop a geographic model to identify the main patterns of LULC transitions between the years 2000 and 2018, to simulate a baseline scenario for the year 2036, and to assess the effectiveness of the Chapeco River ecological corridor (an area created by State Decree No. 2.957/2010), regarding the recovery and conservation of forest remnants and natural fields. The results indicate that the forest remnants have tended to recover their area, systematically replacing silviculture areas. However, natural fields (grassland) are expected to disappear in the near future if proper measures are not taken to protect this ecosystem. If the current agricultural advance pattern is maintained, only 0.5% of natural fields will remain in the ecological corridor by 2036. This LULC trend exposes the low effectiveness of the ecological corridor (EC) in protecting and restoring this vital ecosystem.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of invasive species spread is key to designing optimal management programmes for controlling them. Population models, parameterized from demographic and dispersal data, are useful for simulating invasion when long-term observations are lacking, which is particularly important when invasions are occurring rapidly. We aimed to understand how the spread of Pyracantha angustifolia (an invasive ornamental shrub) is influenced by heterogeneity in local conditions within a dry inter-montane valley in northwestern Argentina that is currently experiencing rapid urban expansion and concomitant reduction in cattle farming. Field surveys demonstrated that individuals growing in shrublands have a higher fecundity than those in grassland and rocky habitats. Furthermore, grazing pressure of cattle and horses substantially reduces fecundity and impacts the relationship between age and fecundity. We incorporated our field-estimated habitat and age-specific fecundities into both analytical integro-difference equation models and individual-based models to predict rates of spread across each habitat type in the presence or absence of grazing pressure. Results indicate that the rate of spread would be substantially higher in shrublands (by up to 33%) and highlight that grazing pressure can, through direct consumption of seeds by livestock, substantially depress the rate of spread (by up to 53%). These results suggest that shrubland areas in the valley are most vulnerable to invasion and that grazing may help to reduce the impact of Pyracantha. This suggests that a synergism between urban expansion and reduction in domestic livestock density contributes to the spread of an invasive species in this environment.

AB  - According to the international literature, small towns are most likely to reorient following structural change if they are rich in natural or built amenity, accessible to large urban areas and have local capacity for change. However, not all places have these characteristics. Focusing on places less blessed with these features, this paper develops a conceptualisation that extends beyond these simplistic empirical regularities/characteristics and enhances understanding of the processes underlying small town change. Drawing on two cases from both the UK and New Zealand, key drivers for small town reorientation are explored, their meaning illustrated in terms of the likelihood of reorientation of the towns' development trajectory and the key policy choices emerging are highlighted. Whilst small town reorientation is inherently unpredictable, positive forces for change are likely to occur within most small towns. Informed by the adaptive cycle model and how this links to observed case realities, the findings suggest the need for an emergent strategic approach that focuses on supporting a local rediscovery/re-imagination of potential, local adaptive processes of emergence and connectivity as it emerges. Consistent with recent research into placeleadership and place-based revival, there is a need for public support to encourage positive local activity and the development of policies that are flexible to the changing place-based opportunities/synergies that emerge.

AB  - The bridge structures must work under random and complex excitation conditions. The vibration response of these structures includes two main components as a determining component and a stochastic component. Thus, using vibration data, the structural health monitoring (SHM) process for these structures requires eliminating random parts impact. The random decrement (RD) signature, a known technique to serve this requirement, is applied to analyze the bridge's vibrations under the ambient load (random excitation) in this study. The nonlinear viscoelastic model is used to evaluate the energy dissipation of material. Then, a new damage index, called the loss factor function (LF), determined from the power spectral density (PSD) of vibration modes, is used to assess material deterioration. In fact, only some vibration modes of structures that occur with large amplitude are considered to be determined. Therefore, the article evaluates some of the first vibration modes' energy dissipation to monitor the change of material's mechanical properties. The vibration of the Saigon bridge under actual traffic loadings over 9 years is used as an illustrative example. One single beam with the same modes of the bridge span is modeled and used to extract numerical data to train convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN is widely known at the current time with outstanding capabilities in the typical image classification. The distribution of these LF values is overall evaluated by using a featured image built from their contour plot images. With the supervised learning algorithm, the proposed network is trained to assess the deterioration level of materials. The output is the label corresponding to the deterioration level, and the inputs are featured images about energy dissipation.

AB  - During the Covid-19 pandemic, face masks became widely used and sometimes mandatory anti-infection devices across the world. While anti-mask protests emerged in several Western countries, nearly universal mask-wearing is commonly seen in Asian countries. Journalistic and popular accounts suggest that an Asian 'mask culture' explains the acceptance of mask-wearing and associates mask culture with political authoritarianism in Asian countries. Based on in-depth interviews conducted with residents of Singapore, an Asian city-state that implemented a mask mandate in 2020, we uncover a wide diversity of beliefs, motivations, and practices of mask-wearing that challenges the existence of a homogeneous 'mask culture'. Drawing on a recent theoretical movement known as the anthropology of ethics, we draw attention to individual judgments and engagements with cultural norms and obligations in order to characterise how it became 'desired and desirable' for a diverse population of Singapore residents to wear masks.

AB  - With the continuous acceleration of urbanization and agricultural modernization in China, the trend of concentration of rural land transfer is irreversible. For landless farmers, the absence of land guaranteed function inevitably gives rise to the substitution effect of other guaranteed methods. And the subjective preferences exhibited by farmers in making guaranteed behavior decisions can be quantitatively described as guaranteed behavioral responses (GBRs). Based on the analytical framework of distributed cognitive theory, this paper adopts the validated factor analysis method of structural equation modeling to quantitatively study the cognitive basis and behavioral responses of landless farmers' guaranteed behavior by combining the survey data of rural households in typical rural areas of Wuhan urban area. The study shows that the GBRs of landless farmers are significantly influenced by the cognitive level. "Locality power," "cultural power," and "personal power" are the main, important, and effective cognitive levels that influence farmers' GBRs, respectively. Policy-based protection occupies a dominant position in the rural social guaranteed system, savings-based protection still plays an important function in rural areas, and market-based protection has greater development potential.

AB  - Assessing environmental quality often requires selection of indicators that can be employed over large spatial scales and over long-time periods to assess the health and well-being of species, natural communities, and ecosystems, and to detect changes warranting intervention. Typically, the ecologic environment and the human environment are evaluated separately and selection of indicators and monitoring approaches are not integrated even though ecological indicators may also provide information on risk to human consumers from contaminants (e.g., eco-cultural indicators) or because of disease levels. This paper is a call for ecologists and managers to consider diverse cultural and environmental injustice disparities and health issues when selecting indicators for environmental assessment and monitoring. There is an opportunity for managers and community members to work together to preserve ecological and cultural resources and heritages. We propose a paradigm that selects indicators and monitoring approaches that lend themselves to the integration of human-diversity and uniqueness in the same manner that the selection of ecological indicators and monitoring approaches consider biological species diversity and uniqueness. The proposed paradigm builds on ecological risk assessment techniques, developing analogous endpoints for neighboring communities. For example, identification and protection of human communities, particularly culturally diverse and environmental justice communities, identification of contaminant corridors (e.g., through water or green corridors) into communities, and eco-monitoring of vulnerable communities are not routine at contaminated sites. Green corridors refers to a width of wild habitat (forest, grasslands) that connects other similar habitat paths (usually a corridor runs through an urban or suburban habitat). We coin the term Eco-EJ indicators for these endpoints, including examination of (1) unique cultural relationships to resources; (2) connectedness of on-site and off-site resources and habitats; (3) health of threatened, rare, and unique cultures and communities; and (4) linkages between ecological, eco-cultural, and public health for monitoring and assessment. We also propose that assessment and monitoring include these Eco-EJ indicators, especially for communities near facilities that have extensive chemical or radiological contamination. Developing these indicators to assess risk to culturally diverse and environmental justice communities would be an equivalent goal to reducing risk for significant ecological resources (e.g., endangered species, species of special concern). These Eco-EJ indicators are complementary to the usual human health-risk assessments, would include surveys of neighboring vulnerable communities, and require time and re-organization of current data and additional data collection at site boundaries and in adjacent communities, as well as rethinking the human component of indicators. This approach lends itself to addressing some diverse cultural and environmental justice issues with current indicator selection and biomonitoring, and helps identify specific hotspots of unique ecosystem risk and environmental justice community risk. We briefly discuss ecological and eco-cultural monitoring already on-going at three Department of Energy sites to illustrate how the addition of these indicators might work and add value to environmental management and to their relationships with surrounding communities.
   We recommend that managers of contaminated sites convene people from culturally diverse communities, environmental justice communities, local and federal government, Tribes, resource trustees, managers, and other stakeholders to develop appropriate site-specific indicators to address environmental inequities around contaminated facilities.

AB  - Photogrammetric products obtained by processing data acquired with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used in many fields. Various structures are analysed, including roads. Many roads located in cities are characterised by heavy traffic. This makes it impossible to avoid the presence of cars in aerial photographs. However, they are not an integral part of the landscape, so their presence in the generated photogrammetric products is unnecessary. The occurrence of cars in the images may also lead to errors such as irregularities in digital elevation models (DEMs) in roadway areas and the blurring effect on orthophotomaps. The research aimed to improve the quality of photogrammetric products obtained with the Structure from Motion algorithm. To fulfil this objective, the Yolo v3 algorithm was used to automatically detect cars in the images. Neural network learning was performed using data from a different flight to ensure that the obtained detector could also be used in independent projects. The photogrammetric process was then carried out in two scenarios: with and without masks. The obtained results show that the automatic masking of cars in images is fast and allows for a significant increase in the quality of photogrammetric products such as DEMs and orthophotomaps.

AB  - The aim of this article and associate Main Map is to highlight the social and economic diversity of the Ruhr area in Germany through the use of multivariate analysis and visualization. To this end we combine two different datasets. Demographic parameters stemming from the 2011 German census and socioeconomic indicators obtained from the microdialog of the German post service. Due to the different spatial resolution of the two datasets, we aggregated the data at the neighbourhood (Stadtteil) level. The multivariate analysis was carried out at this scale using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), an artificial neuron network, which uses an unsupervised learning mechanism for projecting multidimensional data in a low (in our case two) dimensional space. First we used a visualization technique to better comprehend the relationship between our observations via reducing the dimensionality or complexity of our input data. At the same time, we established a global statistical relationships between the indicators. Finally, using these results we built clusters for revealing the distribution of socioeconomic profiles over the whole region. Our results demonstrate that structural inequalities resulting from the processes of industrialization/deindustrialization in the region are still widely persistent and result in characteristic patterns along the three main rivers, the Lippe, Emscher and the Ruhr. In close connection with this, three types of societal segregation patterns become clearly evident in the Ruhr area, namely nationality, age and economic power.

AB  - The shrub Hypericum canariense L. (Hypericaceae) is an emerging invader in several parts of the world. In this study we determined the current invasive distribution in South Africa, assessed soil seedbanks, determined size at reproduction, and evaluated the current management protocols. We further assessed the feasibility of eradication and provide recommendations for control. In South Africa H. canariense is considered a rare ornamental and naturalised populations have escaped cultivation at ten localities in the Southwestern Cape and one in the Eastern Cape. In total, 9 populations are in disturbed areas -mostly along roadsides and informal dumping sites -but three populations are within protected areas. Once established, H. canariense forms large persistent seed banks with between 20 and 2040 seeds/m(2). It resprouts after cutting, with about half the plants resprouting if no herbicide or 3% Garlon (Ismapyr) is applied. If 2% Hatchet (Triclopyr) is applied, resprouting still occurs, but resprouting is significantly lower. Annual follow-up clearing is required to control resprouting and seedlings and should continue for an estimated 10 years until the seedbank is exhausted. We estimate that initial clearing of the naturalised populations of H. canariense would take 20 person days and from thereon 4.5 person days per year for the following 10 years to eradicate this species from South Africa. The initial cost of clearing all populations in South Africa will amount to ZAR2400, with a total cost for eradication estimated at ZAR25000. We recommend management efforts to eradicate this species and list it as 1a on the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity act (NEM:BA, Act 10 of 2004).

AB  - In this research, Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) were conducted along the coastal region of Miri City, East Malaysia for two different seasons to determine the spatial and temporal variation of aquifer vulnerability through Geographic Information System (GIS). VES data was processed in IPI2Win software and curve matching method was adopted to determine the predominance curve types in the study area. The corrected data were used to create spatial maps for resistivity and thickness for each layer through ArcGIS software. Pseudo cross-sections were produced to identity the lithological variance and the movement of saline groundwater plumes. Dar Zarrouk parameters such as longitudinal conductance (S) and transverse resistance (T) were also calculated and spatial maps were prepared to differentiate freshwater and saline water aquifers in the study area. From the results, it was found that the dominant curve types identified in the study area are Q type (24%) and QH type (28%) during the Northeast monsoon (NEM); whereas QH type (19%) and QHKH type (18%) are identified during the Southwest monsoon (SWM). The significant resistivity values that indicate the saline water intrusion (SWI) are 0.49-47.6 ohm.m and 4.34-40.2 ohm.m, which was identified from the northern and southern parallel pseudo cross-sections. Overall, the study reveals that the intensive SWI occurred during SWM, compared to NEM. SWI was observed with low resistivity at a deeper depth of 20 m on the northern side of the study area. The southern urban area of Miri City is continuously prone to infiltration of brackish water at shallow depth caused by anthropogenic activities. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In South Africa, little is known about interrelationships between syndemic problems among people with HIV (PWH). A better understanding of syndemic problems may yield important information regarding factors amenable to mitigation. We surveyed 194 PWH in Khayelitsha, outside of Cape Town, South Africa. We used network analysis to examine the frequency of 10 syndemic problems and their interrelationships. Syndemic problems among PWH in South Africa were common; 159 (82.8%) participants reported at least 2 co-occurring syndemic problems and 90 (46.9%) endorsed 4 or more. Network analysis revealed seven statistically significant associations. The most central problems were depression, substance use, and food insecurity. Three clusters of syndemics were identified: mood and violence; structural factors; and behavioral factors. Depression, substance use, and food insecurity commonly co-occur among PWH in sub-Saharan Africa and interfere with HIV outcomes. Network analysis can identify intervention targets to potentially improve HIV treatment outcomes.

AB  - Jinan is an important city in eastern China, with rich groundwater in the region. There are four famous springs in the urban area and an abundance of geothermal water in the northern part, which makes the migration of groundwater in this area a very important issue. To study the shallow shear wave velocity structure and groundwater migration in Jinan, we utilized almost a month of continuous waveform data from 175 short period seismometers deployed by the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, in order to calculate the cross-correlation function. We picked 7749 group dispersion curves and 6117 phase dispersion curves with a period range of 0.2-2 s. Through inversion, we obtained the fine three-dimensional shear wave velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structure (0-2.4 km). Combining the results with local geological and hydrological data, the following conclusions were reached. (1) There are widespread high velocity anomalies in the region between the Qianfoshan and Wenhuaqiao faults, as well as to the east of the Wenhuaqiao Fault, which may be related to the intrusive gabbro known as the Jinan Intrusive Rock. (2) The two distinct high velocity anomalies in our model (referred to as west and east Jinan Intrusive Rock in this paper) may indicate that the Jinan Intrusive Rock was broken through crustal movement. (3) There is an obvious low velocity layer under the intrusive rock, which could be the channel of groundwater migration. The precipitation in the southern mountain region seeps down into the ground, then is blocked by the Jinan Intrusive Rock and can only progress downwards to a deeper part, where the groundwater is heated by the geothermal gradient. The heated water finally arrives at the northern part and forms geothermal water. (4) The depth of the low velocity layer beneath the Jinan Intrusive Rock varies laterally, which may indicate that the depth of the groundwater migration is different beneath the west and east Jinan Intrusive Rock. (5) There is strong azimuthal anisotropy in southern Jinan, with nearly E-W fast orientation, which may be related to the tilt limestone layering structure.

AB  - When the Brazilian caricature ' s production went through a broad moderni-zation process,experienced, at the beginning of the 20th century, a period of profound technical, aesthetic and structural transformations, when it was no longer a craft and became a business production. In the last thirty years, the historiography related to caricature reshaped the Modernism concept, when it highlighted artistic expressions that forged a modernist and urban popular cul-ture. The objective of this article is to discuss the diversity of modernist expres-sions of Brazilian satirical illustration, from a selection of humorous drawings published in popular magazines such as Para Todos (1918-1958), Fon-Fon (1907-1958), O Malho (1902-1952), and Careta (1908-1960) analysis. We try to analyze the selected material, observing thematic and aesthetic aspects, seeking to unders-tand how they anticipated some values that would prevail from the movement that emerged in the Modern Art Week of 1922.

T2  - GEO-CONGRESS 2022: DEEP FOUNDATIONS, EARTH RETENTION, AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION

CP  - 2nd Geo Congress - Deep Foundations, Earth Retention, and Underground Construction
AB  - Predicting lateral wall displacement due to excavation is essential to the successful design and construction of deep excavations, particularly in dense urban environments where adjacent structures or utilities may be affected by excavation-induced movements. Wall movements are a function of many factors, including but not limited to soil stratigraphy, groundwater elevation, wall stiffness/type, depth of excavation, bracing, and excavation method (e.g., up-down vs. conventional). During construction, surcharges, construction sequence, and means and methods can also impact wall movement. This paper compares theoretical design estimates of lateral slurry wall movement to lateral wall movements measured by inclinometer for deep excavations supported by concrete diaphragm (slurry) walls in the Greater Boston area. While access to sophisticated finite element models has increased in the last several decades, the accuracy of predictions has not. The majority of overestimations occur when performance (i.e., maximum lateral wall movement) is better than average; average performance of excavation support systems has remained consistent over time.

AB  - Early detection of the spatial expansion pattern of alien plants and the associated environmental factors are essential for their management. In this study, we applied regression kriging and geographically weighted regression, which can incorporate spatial autocorrelation into the model, to estimate the critical environmental factors related to the invasion of Hypochaeris radicata into new habitats. We spatially interpolated the occurrence probabilities of H. radicata based on field survey data from 2000-2001 and 2018-2020 to compare the distri-bution pattern of this species over 20 years. Further, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental variables for the invasion of H. radicata using geographically weighted regression. Based on the results of our model, the expansion of H. radicata was found to be significantly associated with anthropogenic activities, such as human footprinting (HFP) and residential area, and the transportation system area. These results suggest that the primary dispersal forces of H. radicata are human activities, and that roads may be the main corridor of its expansion. Additionally, H. radicata did not invade the forest area over the 20 years. We can predict that this plant may flourish better around big cities because of human activities. Furthermore, deforestation and sporadic mowing can accelerate the expansion of H. radicata because of its preference for sunny spots.

AB  - The invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire; Coleoptera: Buprestidae) has killed tens of millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees across North America. A. planipennis was first detected in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 2017 and has the potential to become a serious threat to the city's ash canopy which accounts for ~30% of the public tree inventory. The goal of this study was to predict when adult A. planipennis emergence and peak activity would occur in Winnipeg to help logistical planning for the implementation of a city-wide management program. The management program would focus on detection and limiting the spread of the beetle with the objective of preserving ash trees as long as possible allowing for more proactive management of the EAB infestation. To predict adult emergence and peak activity of A. planipennis, we used local weather station data to calculate the number of degree-days accumulated in each year for the 1970-2019 period using three different degree-day accumulation models. Developmental thresholds for A. planipennis were derived from previous North American studies. The estimated mean emergence dates for the 50-year period were June 14 +/- 8.5 days (double sine model), June 14 +/- 8.5 days (single sine model), and June 19 +/- 9.1 days (standard model) whereas the peak activity dates were July 16 +/- 8.8 days (double sine model), July 17 +/- 8.7 days (single sine model), and July 21 +/- 9.4 days (standard model). Meteorological records indicate that temperatures in the Winnipeg region have increased over the study period. However, our predicted emergence dates do not significantly differ over the 50 years examined in the study, although estimated peak activity dates are significantly earlier, suggesting that EAB movement may benefit from climate change. The results from this study will provide managers with information regarding the temporal behavior of A. plannipennis in Winnipeg allowing for improved timing of control measures and monitoring, thereby extending the projected life span of a significant ash tree population within the Winnipeg urban region. The management model developed for Winnipeg could serve as an example for other locations in the prairie region of North America.

AB  - For the first time in the 21(st) century, many nations have been forced to conduct a lockdown that restricts their industrial, transportation, and social activities to avoid the extensive COVID-19 spread. Therefore, our study aimed to analyze the status of water quality that was measured by suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Sungai Langat, Selangor, Malaysia using the remote sensing technique. The study was concerned with rivers located in distinct land-use areas such as high-density urban, low-density urban, and agricultural areas. The study period included before and after movement control order (MCO) periods that occurred in February 2020 and February 2021, respectively. The SPM levels in each period were calculated using the remote sensing technique through Landsat-8 OLI images then they were analyzed using statistical analysis. The results of the remote sensing technique showed the highest decrease of SPM levels during the MCO period was observed in Sungai Langat within a high-density urban area (34.1%). Then, the SPM levels in all Sungai Langat raised significantly after the MCO period with the highest change at 31.6%. Rainfall and erosion factors had a significant impact on the SPM level through natural processes but the COVID-19 restriction had a direct impact on the SPM level due to the restriction of industrial and social activities. The suspended activities have made the lower emission compared with before the COVID-19 period in 2019.

AB  - The landscape of the Lower Mesopotamia Plain (LMP) has been moulded by water-related processes, consequently, its Holocene geomorphic evolution has been strictly connected to the fluvial process and the anthropogenic water management since 8000 BC. About 6000 years ago, during the maximum marine ingression, the modern cities of Nasiriyah and Al-Amara were close to the Persian Gulf shoreline. Successively, the Tigris and Euphrates developed two wide delta systems, that prograded south-eastward developing a complex fluvial network. Remote sensing investigations over the LMP using satellite imagery and topographic analysis revealed the surficial expression of deltaic bodies with a lobate planform and several terminal distributary channels (TDC5), classifiable as tidal-influenced river-dominated deltas. Tell Zurghul archaeological site, belonging to the ancient State of Lagash, expanded in the western part of the recognized TDC during the Mid- and Late Holocene. Indeed, the occurrence of a divergent multi-channel system supplied water for the early civilizations, which improved the water management and prevented floods through a canals network. Therefore, the multi-sensor remote sensing approach over an area of 2850 km(2) allowed us to recognize several fluvial landforms, both still active and relict, attributable to the Holocene riverscape of the LMP, as well as anthropogenic features and aeolian deposits. The Main map is a geomorphological map at the scale of 1:120,000 centred on Tell Zurghul, focusing on the geometry, spatial distribution, and state of activity of erosional and constructional landforms.

AB  - The considerable intensification of human activity in the second and first centuries BC in Central Europe was related to the sudden appearance of a network of large fortified towns, which are known as oppida. Bibracte was one of the most important oppida in France, but knowledge about the evolution of its hinterland is still incomplete. This article addresses the evolution of the landscape surrounding this oppidum. Our research was based on a study of sedimentary profiles sampled around the archaeological site and examined by physical, geochemical and palaeoecological analyses. Sediment sequences indicate that the earliest human-induced erosion associated with geomorphological change occurred in the 4th-1st century BC. Geochemical results indicate ancient mining and metallurgy in the catchment during the same time. Palaeoecological proxies from the same period point to a mosaic of an open cultural landscape with locally suppressed forest vegetation and prevailing pastoralism. Anthropogenic impact resurged in the 11th-13th centuries AD and was associated with livestock grazing and rye (Secale cereale) cultivation. Thereafter, the reconstructed human impact from the 15th century AD onwards was probably related to forest management focused on timber floating as well as to the cultivation of chestnut (Castanea sativa) and hemp (Cannabis sativa).

AB  - BACKGROUND The genetic backgrounds and occurrence patterns of weedy rice (WR, Oryza sativa) are highly diverse, and so are the challenges facing its control among countries. WR control is difficult because it is similar to cultivated rice and manual removal is one of the few options for control. Understanding the ecology of WR will aid efforts to break its life cycle and establish long-term management strategies under both irrigated and rainfed systems. RESULTS Nicaraguan WR (NWR) plants were genetically closer to the AUS and Indica pools in terms of to genetic distance. A map of admixture coefficients suggested a pattern of long-distance dispersal and spread of NWR across Nicaragua, which has likely been facilitated by commercial activities and sharing of harvesting equipment between border cities or important trading ports and inland regions. Moreover, the NWR plants from the soil seedbank in irrigated regions showed different habitats and lower grain number per panicle compared with plants spread by seed-mediated contamination. In addition, grain indexes showed that length-to-width ratio was a better indicator than awn length for distinguishing between NWR and Nicaraguan Indica cultivars. CONCLUSION Analysis of the population structure and habitats of NWR revealed five clusters derived from seed-mediated contamination in rainfed upland regions, plants from the soil seedbank in irrigated double-cropping regions, and pollen-mediated contamination across both regions. Field weed management before harvesting and seed purification based on the length-to-width ratio can be conducted to improve the efficiency of long-term control of WR in Nicaragua.

AB  - The domestic cat (Felis catus) is among the most popular companion animals and most abundant carnivores globally. It is also a pet with an immense ecological footprint because even non-feral and food-subsidized cats can be prolific predators. Whereas knowledge about the spatial behavior of individual domestic cats is growing, we still know little about how a local population of free-ranging pet cats occupies the landscape. Using a citizen science approach, we GPS-tagged 92 pet cats with outdoor access living in a residential area in southern Norway. The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface-the "catscape"-that potential prey have to navigate. There were few gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 m to their owner's home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats. We discuss the catscape as a conceptual and quantitative tool for better understanding and mitigating the environmental impact of domestic cats.

AB  - The European Union is significantly investing in the Green Deal that introduces measures to guide Member States to face sustainability and health challenges, especially employing Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban contexts. National governments need to develop appropriate strategies to coordinate local projects, face multiple challenges, and maximize NBS effectiveness. This paper aims to introduce a replicable methodology to integrate NBS into a multi-scale planning process to maximize their cost-benefits. Using Italy as a case study, we mapped three environmental challenges nationwide related to climate change and air pollution, identifying spatial groups of their co-occurrences. These groups serve as functional areas where 24 NBS were ranked for their ecosystem services supply and land cover. The results show eight different spatial groups, with 6% of the national territory showing no challenge, with 42% showing multiple challenges combined simultaneously. Seven NBS were high-performing in all groups: five implementable in permeable land covers (urban forests, infiltration basins, green corridors, large parks, heritage gardens), and two in impervious ones (intensive, semi-intensive green roofs). This work provides a strategic vision at the national scale to quantify and orient budget allocation, while on a municipal scale, the NBS ranking acts as a guideline for specific planning activities based on local issues.

AB  - The article provides an inventory of geoparks from the list of the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network. It is noted that geoparks as important tourist attractions have been the subject of scientific attention of many authors, but the data presented in these publications are outdated and can not claim to be relevant to the current state of the geoparks network, as it is quite dynamic and changes every year. The research of the chosen topic in the scientific domestic and foreign literature is characterized. The insufficiency of the tourism research of the UNESCO geoparks system is pointed out. The structural-territorial analysis of the distribution of objects is performed: absolute and relative indicators of the number of objects by macroregions are established. A cartographic model of the distribution of objects on the planet is presented. Monitoring of a specific set of geotourism attractions within each of the geoparks is done taking into account the following thematic types: geological and geomorphological (geological and geomorphological formations -the mountains, intermountain basins and gorges, craters and cones of volcanoes, river valleys, deltas and canyons, lakes, waterfalls, sea coasts, deserts and aeolian, glaciers and glacial, karst and pseudo-karst landforms, geological forms and phenomena -the minerals, rocks, structural and tectonic formations, paleontological fossils, geothermal phenomena; geological and geomorphological processes -volcanic eruptions, geyser explosions, avalanches, coastal processes on sea and lake coasts, melting glaciers, dune movements, erosion processes); industrial (the open and underground mine workings, clay and sand quarries, pits, exploratory shafts, drain lines, rock dumps, tunnels, catacombs, surface and underground military objects, engineering and geological activities, construction of tunnels, construction of roads and highways, use of geothermal water); cultural and cognitive (works of material culture are different buildings made of natural materials and the elements of their arrangement, stone pyramids, rock cities and temples, the stone artefacts, the stone elements of urban infrastructure, the works of art, jewellery, museum and other expositions, open-air expositions, such places of fossils, supporting stratigraphic sections, places of minerals and rocks location); tourist and infrastructural attractions (availability of the geopark for the access by several types of transport, several tourist accommodation options, currency exchange offices, recreation facilities, parking lots, places for tents; Tourist Information Centres; marked tourist routes for the needs of several types of tourism (cycling, green-, caving, water-tourism); marking of tourist attractions (information stands. Information support of tourism (creating internet portals of the geopark, mobile applications); accessibility of the geopark to the inclusive tourists). According to the indicators of occupancy of various thematic blocks, geoparks were ranked according to the scale of levels of attractiveness.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is highly transmissible with potential immune escape. Hence, control measures are continuously being optimized to guard against large-scale coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the intensity of control measures in response to different SARS-CoV-2 variants and the degree of outbreak control at city level.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 49 cities with COVID-19 outbreaks between January 2020 and June 2022. Epidemiological data on COVID-19 were extracted from the National Health Commission, People's Republic of China, and the population flow data were sourced from the Baidu migration data provided by the Baidu platform. Outbreak control was quantified by calculating the degree of infection growth and the time-varying reproduction number (R-t). The intensity of the outbreak response was quantified by calculating the reduction in population mobility during the outbreak period. Correlation and regression analyses of the intensity of the control measures and the degree of outbreak control for the Omicron variant and non-Omicron mutants were conducted, respectively.
   Results: Overall, 65 outbreaks occurred in 49 cities in China from January 2020 to June 2022. Of them, 66.2% were Omicron outbreaks and 33.8% were non-Omicron outbreaks. The intensity of the control measures was positively correlated with the degree of outbreak control (r= 0.351, P= 0.03). The degree of reduction in population mobility was negatively correlated with the R-t value (r= - 0.612, P < 0.01). Therefore, under the same control measure intensity, the number of new daily Omicron infections was 6.04 times higher than those attributed to non-Omicron variants, and the R-t value of Omicron outbreaks was 2.6 times higher than that of non-Omicron variants. In addition, the duration of non-Omicron variant outbreaks was shorter than that of the outbreaks caused by the Omicron variant (23.0 +/- 10.7, 32.9 +/- 16.3, t= 2.243, P= 0.031).
   Conclusions: Greater intensity of control measures was associated with more effective outbreak control. Thus, in response to the Omicron variant, the management to restrict population movement should be used to control its spread quickly, especially in the case of community transmission occurs widely. Faster than is needed for non-Omicron variants, and decisive control measures should be imposed and dynamically adjusted in accordance with the evolving epidemic situation.

AB  - The rebound of black-odorous occurred in organic-rich sediments has become a critical issue due to its great harm to the ecological environment. Elements such as S, C, and N play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of black-odorous rivers. As electronic acceptors, Ca(NO3)(2) and CaO(2 )can effectively remove acidified volatile sulfide (AVS) and organic matter to control the black-odorous rebound. However, the remediation mechanisms in organic-rich sediments by Ca(NO3)(2) and CaO2 are unclear. The present study explored the mechanism of C-N-S interconnection degradation in organic-rich urban river sediments by adding different ratios and sequences of Ca(NO3)(2) and CaO2. The results showed that Ca(NO3)(2) remediation followed by CaO2 and the accepted electron ratio 1:1 of Ca(NO3)2 to CaO2 is an effective method for controlling the rebound of black -odorous and reducing the accumulation NO2--N. Mainly attributed to that, CaO2 enhanced the degradation of organic matter by stimulating enzymatic activities in the sediments, which is also the main reason for controlling the rebound of black-odorous. Since CaO2 releases O-2 and center dot OH, which inhibit nosZgenes, NO2--N accumulates when remedied simultaneously with Ca(NO3)(2) and CaO2. Co-occurrence network analysis illustrated that sulfur -driven autotrophic denitrification bacteria, heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria interact strongly inside one module, clarifying a solid interaction of C-N-S substances among these bacteria. Our results reveal the C-N-S interconnection degradation mechanism and provide a new perspective on applying biochemical remediation in organic-rich urban river sediments.

AB  - This article examines how COVID-19 disrupted the Life vertical bar Performance festival in Bangkok in 2020; focusing on changes in three festival components. Viewing the festival as a cultural ecosystem interrupted by the 2020 novel coronavirus, the article will focus on the disruptions forced on three pieces: Eko Supriyanto's Urban Movement Laboratory Gecko Parade's Lindbergh's Flight and Pichet Klunchun's No. 60: Exhibition, Lecture vertical bar Demonstration. The pandemic-induced disruptions in these performances highlight several important ways that the COVID-19 pandemic transformed the Life vertical bar Performance urban festival. Changes occurred in the timing/scheduling, spacing/location, relationship with audiences/viewers and their mode of performance for all three pieces. The pandemic also compelled rearranging performances into new spaces, a greater mediatization of the festival and the development of new site-specific, community-centered platforms. These disruptions led to a reorientation of the festival toward efforts to enhance creative placemaking within a smaller urban zone.

AB  - Smartphone addiction has become a public health issue. To help reduce smartphone addiction, we assessed the combined effect of 24-Hour Movement Behaviors on smartphone addiction during Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) home confinement in Foshan, China. Data were collected in a sample of 1323 senior middle school students ((mean age +/- standard deviation): 16.4 +/- 0.9 years; 43.46% males) during the COVID-19 lockdown. Their 24-Hour movement behaviors were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire, The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV). The compositional multiple linear regression model and compositional isotemporal substitution model were used to examine the association between the time budget composition of the day and smartphone addiction. Smartphone addiction occurred in 671 (50.72%) of the 1323 students. Compared with smartphone-addicted adolescents, non-smartphone-addicted adolescents had more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep duration (SLP), and less sedentary behavior (SB). The distribution of time spent in 24-Hour movement behaviors was significantly associated with smartphone addiction. The negative effect was found for the proportion of time spent in MVPA or SLP (ilr(1-MVPA) = -0.453, p < 0.001. ilr(1-SLP) = -3.641, p < 0.001, respectively) relative to the other three behaviors. Conversely, SB was positively associated with the score of smartphone addiction (ilr(1-SB) = 2.641, p < 0.001). Reallocating one behavior to remaining behaviors was associated with smartphone addiction. Noticeably, the effects of one behavior replacing another behavior and of one behavior being displaced by another behavior were asymmetric. The 24-Hour movement behaviors of adolescents are closely related to smartphone addiction, and future intervention studies should focus on the compositional attribute of 24-Hour movement behaviors.

AB  - Riparian zones possesses unique ecological position with biota differing from aquatic body and terrestrial lands, and plant-animal coevolution through a propagule-dispersal process may be the main factor for the framework of riparian vegetation was proposed. In the current study, the riparian forests and avifauna along with three subtropical mountainous riparian belts of Chongqing, China, were investigated, and multivariate analysis technique was adopted to examine the associations among the plants' and birds' species. The results show that: (1) the forest species' composition and vertical layers are dominated by native catkins of Moraceae species, which have the reproductive traits with small and numerous propagules facilitating by frugivorous bird species, revealing an evolutionary trend different from the one in the terrestrial plant climax communities in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests. The traits may provide a biological base for the plant-bird coevolution; (2) there are significant associations of plant-bird species clusters, i.e., four plant-bird coevolution groups (PBs) were divided out according to the plant species' dominance and growth form relating to the fruit-dispersing birds' abundance; (3) the correlation intensity within a PB ranks as PB I > II > IV > III, indicating the PB I is the leading type of coevolution mainly shaped by the dominant plant species of Moraceae; (4) the PB correlation may be a key node between patterns vs. process of a riparian ecosystem responsible for the riparian native vegetation, or even the ecosystem health. Our results contribute understanding the plant-animal coevolution interpreting the forests' structures in riparian environments. The results may also be used by urban planner and managers to simulate the patterns for restoring a more stable riparian biota, a better functioning ecosystem in subtropical zone.

AB  - Warm-sector heavy rainfall in South China is a frequent type of precipitation in summer in the Pearl River Delta region. The complexity of the mechanisms involved in the triggering of convection, especially the effects of urbanization, has greatly increased the uncertainty of numerical simulations of warm-sector heavy rainfall. In this study, five new surface parameters with five new anthropogenic heat (AH) parameters were constructed and coupled with the urban canopy model (UCM) of the Weather Research and Forecasting model, version 4.1, based on the local climate zone system over the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration (PRDUA). Taking a typical warm-sector heavy rainfall process that occurred in the PRDUA on 20 April 2019 as an example, five groups of experiments involving different schemes were compared and analyzed, revealing that the precipitation simulated using the localized UCM with the new AH parameters was the best (closest to observations). The localized UCM successfully simulated the increase in 2 m temperature and sensible heat flux and the resultant thermal forcing in urban areas, which promoted the convergence of low-level southerly winds with water vapor and the lifting of the lower-layer warm and humid water vapor to the upper layers in the urban center, leading to a significant increase of precipitation. The improved AH parameters enhanced the anthropogenic heat and its vertical conduction in urban areas, but contributed only marginally to the convergence of 10 m winds. Compared with observations from wind profile radar, it was found that the localized UCM enhanced the accuracy of the simulated horizontal wind field convergence at upper and lower levels, while the improved AH parameters enhanced the accuracy of the simulated low-level jet intensity and vertical movement, which are important drivers for the spatial variation in warm-sector heavy rainfall over the PRDUA. The current findings will be helpful for improving the model skill in simulating warm-sector heavy rainfall over high-density urban areas, as well as enhancing understanding of the impact mechanism of urbanization on the occurrence and development of warm-sector heavy rainfall.

AB  - Dams are a globally important social-ecological issue, and the practice of removing aging or obsolete dams is increasing in many countries where rivers have been used to fuel industrial growth. News media play an important role in providing information and raising awareness about dam-related decision making and patterns in news media coverage can shape public sense-making about potentially controversial dam decisions. This research focuses on spatial patterns of news media references to "dam removal" georeferenced to a New England dams database, the types of dam removal characteristics that contribute to newsworthiness, and specific media framing strategies. We develop a method, known as DAMMDA, that combines a large geodatabase of dam features and corpus of news media articles. We find that spatial patterns of "dam removal" news media coverage do not necessarily coincide with the actual occurrence of removed dams, nor the distribution of extant dams, in the landscape. Instead, a minority of dams with specific characteristics make up the majority of dam media references. Such "newsworthy dams" are capable of generating hydroelectricity, are situated on large rivers, are located in urban areas, or have already been removed. Further, references to newsworthy dams are often used to frame discussions about future dam decisions in other locations in New England and across the United States. We conclude by reflecting on how this approach is relevant for understanding complex and interconnected factors that can shape controversial sustainability issues, such as the relationships between news media and social-ecological characteristics of infrastructures within landscapes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals frequently experience job-related injuries, most commonly overexertion or movement injuries. Data on injury reduction in EMS professionals is limited. The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a movement analysis tool suggested to predict musculoskeletal injury, but it has not previously been evaluated for EMS professionals.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the FMS to predict musculoskeletal injury among EMS professionals.
   METHODS: In October 2014, EMS professionals employed in an urban third-service EMS agency volunteered to participate in FMS administered by certified screeners. Age, sex, height and weight were recorded. After screening, participants were instructed on exercises to correct movement deficiencies. We reviewed recorded injuries from 2013 to 2016. We performed descriptive statistics. With logistic regression modeling, we described factors that predicted musculoskeletal injury. We generated a receiver operating curve (ROC) for FMS prediction of musculoskeletal injury.
   RESULTS: 147 of 240 full-time employees participated in the FMS. Participants' mean age was 33.7 years (SD = 9.6) and the majority (65%) were male. The median initial FMS score was 14 (IQR 11-16). Area under the ROC curve was 0.603 (p = 0.213) for FMS ability to predict any musculoskeletal injury within two years. Female sex was associated higher odds of injury (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.61-9.80). Increasing age, body mass index (BMI) category, and FMS score <= 14 did not predict musculoskeletal injury.
   CONCLUSION: The FMS did not predict musculoskeletal injury among EMS professionals.

AB  - In the conditions of an urban environment, insects, including Pyrrhocoris apterus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae), are subject to dozens of volatiles: solvents, food flavorings, cosmetic products. For firebugs, some attract them, some scare them off and to some they are indifferent In this article, in the conditions of laboratory experiment, we evaluated the influence of chemical substances on rates of movement of firebugs. Under the influence of the substances we studied, there occurred no significant increase or decrease in the activity of firebugs. The most significant effect on rates of movement of firebugs was exerted by solvent, white spirit and solvent 646 p - firebugs travelled 12 cm distance for 242%, 49.6% and 58.7% of the time the control group did. Movement activity of firebugs was insignificantly decreased by aromatic extracts Royal milk extract, Butcher's broom extract and chrysalis oil: firebugs travelled 12 cm distance for 132.7%, 1352% and 146.8% of time the control group. Aromatic substances likely interact with receptors on antennae of firebugs, and therefore the insects need additional time for orienting reactions, deciding whether those substances signal presence of potential food objects in the accessibility zone.

AB  - Under what conditions do Latinx communities mobilize in response to threats of repressive policing? This article addresses this question by comparing three cases of community organizing against civil gang injunctions. Drawing on six years of ethnographic fieldwork, 20 semi-structured interviews, and analysis of news reports, my findings reveal that mobilization was achieved in low-income Latinx neighborhoods located within affluent White cities, where organizers drew upon strong ties to community insiders to combine analyses of the threat of citywide gang injunctions with critiques of White racism and political power. Conversely, mobilization did not occur when this strategy was used to organize a low-income Latinx neighborhood within a primarily working-class, Latinx city, where organizers confronted a more narrowly targeted gang injunction and had weaker ties to community insiders. I argue this lack of mobilization in the latter campaign cannot only be attributed to the insufficient threat posed by the gang injunction. Rather, local racial and ethnic dynamics, where Chicanx organizers struggled to develop grassroots leadership among community insiders, build solidarity with first-generation Latinx immigrants and link threats of repressive policing to anti-Latinx racism impeded mobilization. These findings highlight how popular mobilization against perceived threats of repressive policing is not race-neutral but instead depends upon racial and ethnic contexts where organizers can effectively link the issue to White racism.

AB  - Using low-cost surface drifters, this study investigates the influence of the Buranhem River plume on the coastal region of the city of Porto Seguro (in the state of Bahia). The results highlight the importance of small river plumes on the coastal region and their possible influence on tourist beaches and high biodiversity regions. Three drifters, mounted with GPS receivers and temperature and salinity sensors, were simultaneously released into the mouth of the river in six experiments between December 2019 and December 2020, during ebbing spring tides. In each experiment, vertical salinity profiles were measured hourly at the position of the central drifter for 5 h, in order to investigate the alongtrack stratification of the plume. Results show that there are two distinct dispersion patterns in the Buranhem River plume, and that they are controlled mainly by wind and river discharge. Southward (northward) dispersion with curvilinear shape forced by northeasterly (south and southwesterly) winds were observed during the experiments. The maximum vertical salinity gradient confirmed the shallow character of the river plume (< 3 m in depth), more highly stratified during high river discharge and northward dispersion than in the opposite situation of northeasterly winds and low and medium river discharge. The results suggest that the Buranhem River plume has a larger influence over the northern beaches of Porto Seguro, with its reach being defined by the river discharge. Beaches to the south of the river inlet are less influenced by the river plume. Such unprecedented findings form the background for future studies and for management of this highly visited tourist area in Brazil. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - After the 2013 Mw 7.2 earthquake that occurred in Bohol, the shoreline specifically in Loon and Maribojoc was observed to shift seaward due to ground uplift. This study analyzes the post-earthquake shoreline movement, specifically a 12 km coastal strip in Loon and Maribojoc, and ground deformation of the West Bohol area through Sentinel-1 image processing techniques. From October 2014 to April 2018, the DSAS linear regression shoreline rates were - 4.36 m/yr in Loon and - 1.69 m/yr in Maribojoc, indicative of a landward movement of 91.4% and 88.8% of shoreline transects in Loon and Maribojoc, respectively. PSInSAR revealed varying rates of VLM in the study area from October 2014 to December 2018 such that Loon and Maribojoc exhibit a subsidence rate of - 2 to - 8 mm/yr. The correlation between the shoreline retreat and the land subsidence in the study area is 87%, indicating a possible elastic rebound after the earthquake. The portion of Tagbilaran City on its northern side exhibits land subsidence of - 2 to - 6 mm/yr while its southern side exhibits land uplift of 0-2 mm/yr. The relative sea level fall from TGSL measurements indicates an uplift in the location of the tide gauge in Tagbilaran City.

AB  - The east Taiwan Strait is largely fringed by sandy and muddy habitats. However, a massive algal reef made of crustose coralline algae has been found along the coast off Taoyuan city in northwestern Taiwan. The porous structure of Taoyuan Algal Reef harbors high abundance and diversity in marine organisms, including the ferocious reef crab, Eriphia ferox. Such a pivotal geographic location and unique ecological features make Taoyuan Algal Reef a potential stepping stone connecting biotic reefs in the east Taiwan Strait, South China Sea to the south, and even the high latitude of Japan to the north. In this study, we examined the population connectivity and historical demography of E. ferox by analyzing mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) fragments of 317 individuals sampled from 21 localities in the northwestern Pacific. Our analyses of haplotype network and pairwise F-ST comparisons revealed a lack of phylogeographical structure among E. ferox populations, implying the existence of a migration corridor connecting the South and East China Seas through the east Taiwan Strait. Multiple lines of evidence, including significant values in neutrality tests, unimodally shaped mismatch distributions, and Bayesian skyline plots elucidated the rapid population growth of E. ferox following the sea-level rise after Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 2-10 Ka). Such demographic expansion in E. ferox coincided with the time when Taoyuan Algal Reef started to build up around 7,500 years ago. Coalescent migration analyses further indicated that the large and continuous E. ferox population exclusively found in Datan Algal Reef, the heart of Taoyuan Algal Reef, was a source population exporting migrants both northward and southward to the adjacent populations. The bidirectional gene flow should be attributed to larval dispersal by ocean currents and secondary contact due to historical population expansion. Instead of serving as a stepping stone, our results support that Taoyuan Algal Reef is an essential population source for biotic reef-associated species along the east Taiwan Strait, and highlight the importance of conserving such a unique ecosystem currently threatened by anthropogenic development.

AB  - Quaternary palaeoenvironmental (QP) sites in Southeast Arabia are important not only to understand the history of global climate change but also to study how ancient humans adapted to a changing natural environment. These sites, however, are currently missing from conservation frameworks despite reports of destroyed sites and sites under imminent threat. This study presents the Geocultural Database of Southeast Arabia, the first open-access database on QP sites in this region, created as a comprehensive inventory of regional QP sites and a tool to analyse QP records and archaeological records. The endangerment assessment of QP sites in this database reveals that 13% of QP sites have already been destroyed and 15% of them are under imminent threat of destruction, primarily due to urban development and infrastructure development. Chronological and spatial analyses of QP and archaeological sites and records highlight the intricate relationship between palaeoenvironment and archaeology and emphasise the need for sub-regional-scale studies to understand the variation of climatic conditions within the region, especially to study changes in the ancient human demography. This database illustrates the potential of a geocultural approach that combines archaeological heritage with Quaternary geoheritage as a way forward for the conservation of QP sites at risk.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest helds one of the most diverse and unique avifauna in the world. Many vertebrate species are reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, and birds are an important group among them due to their mobility which facilitates the dispersion of ticks and the infectious agents they carry. This study brings data on the tick diversity parasitizing birds and the molecular detection of Rickettsia spp. in these arthropods. Birds (n = 773) were captured, identified, and banded at Mata do Paraiso Research, Training, and Environmental Education Center located in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Birds were checked for the presence of ticks, which were individually collected, identified, and molecularly processed through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the detection of Rickettsia spp. A total of 130 individuals were infested by ticks, and 479 tick specimens were collected, showing a seasonal distribution of the life stages throughout the year. Ticks were identified as Amblyomma longirostre (59/479); Amblyomma calcaratum (20/479); Amblyomma varium (3/479); Amblyomma sculptum (2/479) and Amblyomma spp. larvae (395/479). Seasonal distribution of the life stages of ticks was observed along the year and significant negative correlations were found between temperature and collected ticks and temperature and infested birds. From the evaluated samples of ticks, 25.44% (n = 43/169) scored positive for Rickettsia spp., and sequence analysis indicated high nucleotide identity with Rickettsia rhipicephali, R. massiliae, R. africae and R. honei marmionii. The potential for dispersal of ticks by birds added to the aggressiveness of species of the genus Amblyomma and the zoonotic potential of some species of Rickettsia are quite worrying when we consider that the study area is widely attended by students, researchers, people from the city and neighboring municipalities.

AB  - Background: Livestock systems have been proposed as a reservoir for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria and AMR genetic determinants that may infect or colonise humans, yet quantitative evidence regarding their epidemiological role remains lacking. Here, we used a combination of genomics, epidemiology and ecology to investigate patterns of AMR gene carriage in Escherichia coli, regarded as a sentinel organism. Methods: We conducted a structured epidemiological survey of 99 households across Nairobi, Kenya, and whole genome sequenced E. coli isolates from 311 human, 606 livestock and 399 wildlife faecal samples. We used statistical models to investigate the prevalence of AMR carriage and characterise AMR gene diversity and structure of AMR genes in different host populations across the city. We also investigated household-level risk factors for the exchange of AMR genes between sympatric humans and livestock. Results: We detected 56 unique acquired genes along with 13 point mutations present in variable proportions in human and animal isolates, known to confer resistance to nine antibiotic classes. We find that AMR gene community composition is not associated with host species, but AMR genes were frequently co-located, potentially enabling the acquisition and dispersal of multi-drug resistance in a single step. We find that whilst keeping livestock had no influence on human AMR gene carriage, the potential for AMR transmission across human-livestock interfaces is greatest when manure is poorly disposed of and in larger households. Conclusions: Findings of widespread carriage of AMR bacteria in human and animal populations, including in long-distance wildlife species, in community settings highlight the value of evidence-based surveillance to address antimicrobial resistance on a global scale. Our genomic analysis provided an in-depth understanding of AMR determinants at the interfaces of One Health sectors that will inform AMR prevention and control.

AB  - The paper analyzed rural areas in Romania from a territorial, demographic, economic, social and environment point of view in the year 2020 compared to 2011 in order to point out in what measure the gaps between rural and urban areas and EU rural areas have been reduced. The data from National Institute of Statistics and Eurostat were used in this comparison where fixed indices, structural indices, regression equations, determination coefficient helped to create an image on the changes. Rural areas keeps 89.6% of Romania's territory and 46.4% of its population, while at the EU level, the rural population accounts for only 29.1%. Rural population is aging, as 46% of people is aged of 50 and over. Depopulation caused by the negative natural movement and migration led to the decline in rural population. Rural poverty and social exclusion is higher, the EU average rate being 26%, while in Bulgaria, Malta and Romania is higher than 50%. Infrasfructure regarding rural roads, water supply, sewerage and waste collection continue to be a big problem. Education level is lower, in 2020, only 17% graduates were from the rural areas, while in the EU 22% of the people aged 25-64 and 28.4% of the ones aged 30-34 have tertiary education. Rural digitalization is relatively weak as only 49% rural residents have digital skills compared to 62% in the cities. Of Romania's occupied population, 20% is in the rural areas and women accounts for 50%. About 83% of occupied population in agriculture are self employed. Salaried men in agriculture represent 3.5%, while women 1.1%, reflecting gender discrimination in total salaried population. Labor productivity in agriculture is small, just 20% of the national level. Per 1,000 AWU, labor productivity in Romania is the smallest in the EU. The rural average monthly income represents 64% of the income level in the urban areas and its growth rate is smaller. Agriculturists have the smallest income. Climate change diminished agricultural output and gross value added in Romania, and also the contribution to the EU. GDP/capita in rural Romania accounts for Euro 13,000, representing 65% of the EU average reflecting the gap in economic development and living standard. National Strategic Plan 2021-2027, whose implementation will involve the local authorities, is expected to transform rural areas in a resilient and diversified eco-system supplying agro-food products for ensuring food safety, in a consolidated economic and social sector using new knowledge, innovation and digitalization.

AB  - Identifying the invasion routes of non-native species is crucial to understanding invasions and customizing management strategies. The box tree moth, Cydalima perspectalis, is native to Asia and was recently accidentally introduced into Europe as a result of the ornamental plant trade. Over the last 15 years, it has spread across the continent and has reached the Caucasus and Iran. It is threatening Buxus trees in both urban areas and forests. To investigate the species' invasion routes, native and invasive box tree moth populations were sampled, and moth's genetic diversity and structure were compared using microsatellite markers. Our approximate Bayesian computation analyses strongly suggest that invasion pathways were complex. Primary introductions originating from eastern China probably occurred independently twice in Germany and once in the Netherlands. There were also possibly bridgehead effects, where at least three invasive populations may have served as sources for other invasive populations within Europe, with indication of admixture between the two primary invasive populations. The bridgehead populations were likely those in the countries that play a major role in the ornamental plant trade in Europe, notably Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. All these invasion processes likely facilitated its fast expansion across Europe and illustrate the role played by the ornamental plant trade not only in the moth's introduction from China but also in the species' spread across Europe, leading to an invasion with a complex pattern.

AB  - Mass movement hazards in the form of mega-gullies and landslides pose significant risks in urbanizing areas, yet they are poorly documented. To obtain primary data on the size, frequency, and triggers of abrupt mega-gullies and landslides in urban areas, rapid assessment methods based on structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric techniques and watershed models were developed and deployed in the Los Laureles Canyon, a rapidly urbanizing watershed in Tijuana, Mexico. Three abrupt earth surface hazards were observed over a 5-year study period including two mega-gullies and one landslide, and all were linked to a combination of rainfall and water resources infrastructure failures (WRIFs): (1) water main breaks resulted from rainfall-driven gully erosion that undermined supply lines, and the resulting water jets caused abrupt mega-gully formation; this represents one of the first studies to document this process in an urban environment; (2) antecedent saturation of a hillslope from a leaking water supply pipe contributed to an abrupt landslide during a storm event. The return period of the storms that triggered the WRIF-based earth surface hazards was similar to 1-2 years, suggesting that such triggering events occur frequently. WRIF-based hazards were also a non-negligible contributor to sediment generation at the watershed scale. While the number of observed events is small, these results suggest that WRIF can, in some cases, be the single most important process generating abrupt and life-threatening earth surface hazards on the poor urban periphery. Future studies of the triggers and mechanisms of abrupt urban mega-gullies and landslides should consider the role of WRIFs in antecedent saturation and erosion by broken water supply lines.

AB  - The 2004-2008 period corresponds to a particular context. The geopolitical context is that of a disrupted world, where the international balance of power is being redrawn. The comics published in Pif Gadget offer to see different stagings of relationships with otherness and the crossing of limits in a very urbanized world marked by an important north-south relationship. The corpus chosen for this contribution is not made up of the follow-up of a single comic strip, but takes the advantage of raising different situations presenting a thought of the relationship to otherness in the diversity of imagined environments (city, extraterrestrial space, space microterrestrial). Finally, the corpus ignores contextualized comics in a chronologically defined historical framework. Indeed, it is not a question of analyzing a graphic interpretation of historical facts, but rather the fictions and their imagination created in the context of the 2000s. It will therefore be a question of seeing how these passages create otherness, and transform or not the spatialities of the characters depending on whether they are those who are in the movement of the encounter or those who are recipients of this encounter.

AB  - Playgrounds are not only for play and fun; they are places that offer diverse experiences for all groups of children. Outdoor playgrounds have been studied as an element of public space for their ability to offer an array of amenities and attributes. In addition to design and planning aspects, inclusiveness is a vital attribute of playgrounds. Inclusiveness within playgrounds provides accessibility for all children regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity, as both physical and social access are considered. Given the rapidly changing global agenda affected dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement, playgrounds have gained even more attention and the importance of inclusiveness has become more prevalent. This study examined the inclusiveness of play-based experiences within a playground in San Antonio, Texas, using mixed methods. The study utilized observational methods, behavior mapping, secondary data for spatial mapping, and a survey conducted in order to understand the perception of playground users. This study evaluated the inclusiveness of the playground and analyzed social and physical accessibility relative to the playground by assessing the diversity of users in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and disability. The findings of this study show that there is a need for additional studies yielding proposed improvements revolving around playground inclusivity. The study results show that urban designers, urban planners, and policymakers need to collaborate in order to create opportunities that work to eliminate social and physical disparities and that ultimately enhance inclusiveness in playgrounds.

AB  - Simple Summary The management of house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, in low-income high-rise multi-family dwellings (MFDs) is often frustrated by the limited resources available through low-bid contracting. An improved understanding of the small-scale distribution of this important public health pest could allow the pest management industry to better allocate its limited time and resources to better managing infestations. This study utilized data from two research projects that measured house mouse infestation rates from four urban low-income MFDs to determine if a significant correlation between neighboring units exists in their infestation status. Results show that such a correlation exists whereby apartments that share a wall, ceiling or floor with a neighboring apartment that has a current infestation are more likely to have existing house mouse activity. This information can be utilized by the pest management industry to design monitoring strategies, during integrated pest management activities, to better ensure the elimination of house mice in low-income high-rise MFDs. The house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, creates significant public health risks for residents in low-income multi-family dwellings (MFDs). This study was designed to evaluate the spatial distribution of house mice in MFDs. Four low-income high-rise apartment buildings in three cities in New Jersey were selected for building-wide monitoring on two occasions with approximately one year between the monitoring events. The presence of a house mouse infestation was determined by placing mouse bait stations with three different non-toxic baits for a one-week period in all accessible units as well as common areas. Permutation tests were conducted to evaluate house mouse infestation spatial patterns. All four analyzed buildings exhibited a significant correlation between apartments with house mouse infestations and whether they share a common wall or ceiling/floor at both sampling periods except one building during the second inspection, which contained a high number of isolated apartments. Foraging ranges, speed of locomotion, and dispersal behavior of house mice are relatively larger, faster, and more common, respectively, compared to common urban arthropod pests. This could lead to the conclusion that house mice are as likely to infest non-neighboring apartments as those that share a wall or floor/ceiling. However, these results demonstrate that house mouse infestations tend to occur among apartments that share common walls or ceilings/floors. This spatial distribution pattern can be utilized in rodent management plans to improve the efficiency of house mouse management programs in MFDs.

AB  - Historical buildings play a monumental role in religious communities around the world. Masonry structures such as minarets built in areas prone to dynamic effects such as earthquakes are vulnerable as a consequence of their brittle materials and slenderness. Structural health monitoring (SHM) has not been carried out in the regular control of minarets' health for early warning of collapse. Meanwhile, the protection and preservation of such a cultural heritage are urgent. Effective techniques to recognize damage occurrence and location in minarets are vital. In this study, a health monitoring solution on damage detection of minarets is presented. In particular, damage detection of the minaret (24.25 m high) of Hacilar mosque that was built using stone and brick in 1467 in Bursa city (Turkey) is aimed. Only four accelerometers are erected along with the height of the minaret to collecte lateral displacements, making an incomplete number of measured degrees of freedom (DOFs). To circumvent the complicated problem, the minaret is transferred into a lumped mass system correspondingly to the erected sensor network considering the similarities in terms of bending behavior at low modes between slender minarets and beamlike structures. Due to the changes in modal data at two bending modes, an eigenvalue problembased inverse solution is employed to localize damage in the minaret based on the reduction in terms of stiffness of the simplified system. As a result, reliable damage detection is achieved as long as the modal data is noise-free or low-level noise-contaminated (about 0.5%-1% random noise level).

AB  - The effect of land use and land cover (LULC) on the structure of stream fish assemblages involves factors on multiple scales. By adopting a hierarchical conceptual model, we assessed the importance of river basin physical characteristics and spatial factors on LULC across three spatial scales: catchment, riparian, and reach. Additionally, we verified the direct importance of the river basin physical characteristics, spatial factors, and local environment, and the indirect effect of LULC on fish assemblages. We sampled fish assemblages at 30 sites with different LULC from the Upper Paranapanema River basin. At the catchment scale, the average slope was positively correlated with forest cover and negatively correlated with agriculture and forestry. The river basin with forest cover had a more consolidated substrate and low quantity of silt. Altitude, shade, and spatial structure played an essential role in data variation at the sampling sites. Distance from the river mouth was negatively correlated with consolidated substrate and bank stability. Three groups of fish species were correlated with different sets of explanatory variables. Our work indicated that the hierarchical conceptual model identified environmental factors that affected the fish assemblages. This study highlights the importance of catchment-scale management on the conservation of stream fishes.

AB  - Urban Ergonomics is a design science driven by modern ergonomic data. It reacts to the challenges to architecture posed by changes, emergencies and advancements of the contemporary world, signifying a return to architectural humanism powered by new sciences. The key methodology of Urban Ergonomics is the quantitative descriptive model through which ergonomic data inform design with precision. The rise of Urban Ergonomics is aligned with the new human-centred urbanisation movement in China while offering positive potential in the country's transformation towards carbon net zero. This paper is a general introduction to Urban Ergonomics, putting basic discussions on its "why". "what" and "how" in three sections: 1 emergence, 2 ranges, and 3 tools. Urban Ergonomics opens up a whole new dimension for the revival and redevelopment of design science in the 21st-century discourse.
   Combined with the emerging technologies, Urban Ergonomics supports a more precise design decision-making process based on ergonomic analysis. For the project to be built, the ergonomic analysis generally takes the parameter of enumeration of virtual scenario as the independent variable, and takes ergonomic data as the dependent variable. with the help of descriptive models for a precise selection among different solutions; for the built spaces, real-life scenarios are analysed and assessed through the descriptive models and ergonomic data to support the renovation and regeneration; for design purposes, ergonomic analysis adds new design targets based on new quantitative spatial experience to the traditional targets. All of the processes, results and quantitative design targets above can lead to replicable application scenarios and bring new knowledge to design science.
   According to the four-level system of the spatial experience of survival, efficiency, reception and expression_ Urban Ergonomics transforms relatively vague urban space quality issues into clear design targets, and divides these spatial experience issues into five scales: Macro. far. medium_ near and micro. Initial research progress has been made in the fields of urban design, architecture, lighting design_ ventilation and heating design, and so on. It shows that human factors techniques can be applied in the quantification of spatial experience and that their quantified results can lead to more precise design intervention.
   Urban Ergonomics demonstrates its great potential in the core area of urban-architecture design intervention - forming in which it fills the gap between the ergonomic data and the spatial form. With the help of tools such as Ergonomic Notation Systems. Urban Ergonomics studies the objective and regular parts of the traditional aesthetic experience and helps both post-occupancy evaluations (POE) as well as design decision-making, which can be widely applied in the design process in the future: In the early stage of design, Ergonomic Notation System can help determine spatial requirements; in the late stage of design, when the ergonomic notation of the design is decided, the ergonomic data collected in a VR scene can help accurately search for the optimal solution to some extent; when the environment has been built, ergonomic data can also be collected in real-life scenarios to help evaluate the spatial experience quality and to summarise and redefine the knowledge of design methodology, spatial typology, spatial cognition_ and so on. It is expected to provide a new pathway for the redevelopment of design science supported by the interdisciplinary in the 21st century.

AB  - Through an ethnographic analysis of Hong Kong LGBT activists' fight for a gender recognition ordinance (GRO) that would simplify the process for transgender Hongkongers to change their legal gender, a paradox emerged: Why was a human rights framing of LGBT issues problematic when human rights were central to locals' understanding of what it meant to be Hongkongers? Local LGBT activists' vernacularization of human rights-or the process of localization of international human rights law into culturally relevant frameworks-hinged on reframing the need for a GRO as a matter of humanity, not human rights law. Relying on citations of human rights law among "ordinary citizens" violated the existing ways in which Hongkongers talked about human rights as a method of distinguishing Hong Kong from the rest of the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, this need to differentiate emerged from the 2014 Umbrella Movement in which prodemocracy activists occupied various urban centers in Hong Kong for seventy-nine days. The Umbrella Movement caused a shift in which ordinary citizens became responsible for each other and defending what made Hong Kong unique. Ultimately, the vernacularization process requires closer attention to the ways in which human rights are being talked about on the ground.

AB  - The research draws from diary entries shared by participants across various urban neighbourhoods and dwellings in Gauteng Province in South Africa during the Level-5 lockdown period. Occurring between 27 March and 1 May 2020, the Level-5 lockdown was severely restrictive, as residents were confined within their homes, and their movement and social activity curtailed. Research has already indicated that this had a negative impact on the mental health and food security of ordinary people. In this paper, we illustrate how participants' diary entries offer a layered and longitudinal lens to support this emerging research. Notably, analysis of these diary entries illustrates that the 6-week lockdown took an emotional toll on participants across different urban neighbourhoods and dwellings. Furthermore, these diary entries point to the sources of frustration and anxiety being shaded by the spatial and structural location of participants.

AB  - The development of new social housing faces important resistance by local population, a phenomenon knows as the "not in my backyard" movement. One argument from residents to oppose such project is the idea that new construction will negatively impact property values. This is what this paper aims to investigate. The analysis is based on a complete recension of the new social housing projects built between 2000 and 2020 and on single-family house transactions that occurred between 2004 and 2020 in Quebec City (Canada). A repeated sales model integrating a difference-in-differences estimator is developed to isolate the net price premium related to the emergence of a new social housing building while accounting for the possible heterogeneity impact related to characteristics of the building, including the number of apartments and the type of clientele hosted as well as the local characteristics, such as the spatial concentration of social housing buildings and distance to the city center. The results show a complex net price premium rent function that leads to mixed conclusions and has important implications for the development of new social housing projects.

AB  - Digital twin is increasingly prominent for realizing the digital and intelligent transformation of various industries as an emerging technological means to connect the physical and virtual world. While there has been a recent growth of interest in digital twin in industry, finance, and academia, most relevant studies lack a systematic analysis of the status quo, development trends, and technological competition situations for digital twin. In this article, we used bibliometrics and patent analysis to conduct comprehensive and in-depth research of digital twin by reviewing the current status of academic research and technological development, distribution of countries and institutions, and technological competition situations. We found that academic research and technological development in digital twin are currently in the early stages of rapid growth, which is radiating from applications in smart manufacturing to other scenarios such as medical and health, smart cities, energy, transportation, public emergency, and agricultural food. Artificial intelligence technology, digital twin integrated architecture and system, intelligent real-time control have gradually become the key topics of academic research and technology research and development in the field of digital twin in recent years. The digital framework, sustainable digital twin, deep learning and neural network algorithms, and full lifecycle management have the potential to become technology development trends. USA and Germany are the technology leaders and occupy first-mover advantage at present, while China, the U.K., and South Korea are the powerful chasers in the future.

AB  - The concept of low impact development (LID) plays a crucial role in rainstorm management and non-point source pollution prevention and control. Sorting and summarizing related research through the knowledge map can objectively present the disciplinary structure, research focus, and research hotspots of the LID research. Based on 2103 LID pieces of literature in Chinese and English included in the web of science (WOS) database and China's integrated knowledge resources system (CNKI) database from 2004 to 2021, this paper aims to perform statistical analysis from three aspects: bibliometrics, keyword hotspot co-occurrence and clustering, and literature co-citation clustering. The obtained results reveal that research on LID-based issues maintains a high degree of enthusiasm in China and abroad, but their corresponding focuses are dissimilar. Foreign research essentially focuses on the environmental field with frequent interdisciplinary phenomena, combining the triple goals of water quality improvement, runoff reduction, and multi-functional expansion, and is committed to solving the impact of uncertain factors on urban stormwater management in extreme climates. Chinese research is mostly aimed at unlocking practical engineering problems, which also leads to the majority of research works in the field of building science and engineering. This is mainly due to a series of water-related problems caused by the change in land use types in China. The researchers have determined the type, quantity, location, and combination of the optimal LID measures by establishing appropriate models, using optimization algorithms, and developing multi-level analysis methods. Although the multi-dimensional results of LID in recent years have greatly expanded the framework paradigm, most of the conducted research works are still biased towards the micro-scale. The present hotspot research considers how to make a macroscopic overall layout and efficiently cooperate with the pipelines network, rivers, and lakes systems to unlock the problems pertinent to urban rainwater and non-point source pollution.

KW  - 6 February 1853
KW  - remembering the Risorgimento
KW  - public history
AB  - The article recounts the revolt that took place in Milan on 6 February 1853 and investigates its presence in the official memory of the city. The main figures in the rebellion were from Milan's working class: while the movement was fomented by Mazzini, it was carried out independently by badly organized groups of workers; unlike the 'Cinque Giornate' of 1848, the upper classes were not involved. Barricades were erected and Austrian soldiers were killed, but order was promptly restored by the Austrians. The occupying forces arrested hundreds of people, executed sixteen working-class men and ordered the seizure of the goods of exiles who had left Lombardy after 1848. The article looks at how the events of 1853 were treated by historiography and local commemoration from unification to the present day. It discusses the meaning of the inclusion of that failed, impracticable uprising - a divisive one, involving as it did only figures from the lower classes - in the official justification of the city's heroism, sanctioned in 1948 when Milan was awarded the gold medal for military valour.

AB  - Purpose The police killing of George Floyd and other high-profile incidents of force sparked massive protests around the world. Amidst eroding public perceptions of police legitimacy, politicians and activists have sought to achieve systemic change. Over the past year, several cities in the United States have implemented various police reform initiatives, including reallocating resources, cutting budgets, and downsizing specialized units. As a result of these changes, the "defund the police" movement may have far-reaching consequences on police culture, especially within specialized units most affected by budget and resource changes. Furthermore, as fentanyl overdoses are surging and the American opioid crisis continues, specialized drug investigation units face a host of challenges in responding to increases in drug-related crime in the aftermath of "defund the police". Therefore, this study aims to examine the experiences of a Drug Investigation Section in a large metropolitan city. Design/methodology/approach This study uses data from semi-structured interviews conducted between October 2021 to May 2022. The results of this study provide a thematic analysis that explores the narcotics detectives' perceptions of key features of police culture, as well as how current challenges affect those perceptions. Findings Key features of the police culture were noticeably absent from detectives' responses, including an overemphasis on danger, machismo, conservatism, and social isolation. Elements of cynicism, group solidarity, and a mission/action-orientation, did emerge. The context of "defund the police" did little to alter their perceptions, except for heightening cynicism and negative perceptions of politicians and prosecutors (a form of "us vs them", but not involving citizens). The interviews also revealed various other changes that have occurred in recent years that have adversely affected the section's traditional investigative capabilities, especially with regard to illicit fentanyl distribution, though the addition of an intelligence analyst minimized those negative effects. Originality/value This study adds to the scarce research on contemporary police culture in specialized units, especially in the aftermath of the "defund the police" movement, providing a glimpse into its context within a drug investigation section and its potential effects on police culture and narcotics investigations.

Forty-one women competed for the title during the Cultural and Industrial Rally to promote the supposed harmonious relationship between the Ilonggos and the JMA and portray normalcy during the war. The beauty contest affirms the complexity of the issue of wartime collaboration in Iloilo as the Ilonggo elites simultaneously cooperated with the Japanese and supported the guerrilla movement in its "lie low policy.

AB  - Traffic simulation is widely used for modeling, planning, and analyzing different strategies for traffic control and road development in a cost-efficient manner. In order to perform an intersection simulation, random vehicle trip data are typically applied to an intersection network, making them unrealistic. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting two different methods of incorporating actual turning movement count (TMC) data and comparing their similarity for intersection simulation and analysis. The TMC of three intersections in Las Vegas are estimated separately for one hour using a developed vision-based tracking system and they are incorporated into Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) for estimating traffic measurements and traffic signal design. t-tests with a 95% confidence interval on the simulation variables demonstrate the importance of using a route-based creation method which injects vehicles into a simulation environment based on the frame-level departure time. The intersection analyses and comparisons are performed based on estimated traffic measurements such as travel time, density, lane density, occupancy, and normalized waiting time. Since the critical edge of each intersection network is identified based on a higher normalized waiting time, new traffic signal designs are suggested based on the actual critical turning movements and improvements in vehicle travel time are achieved to better accommodate the actual traffic demand.

AB  - In this intelligent transportation systems era, traffic congestion analysis in terms of vehicle detection followed by tracking their speed is gaining tremendous attention due to its complicated intrinsic ingredients. Specifically, in the existing literature, vehicle detection on highway roads are studied extensively while, to the best of our knowledge the identification and tracking of heavy-construction vehicles such as rollers are not yet fully explored. More specifically, heavy- construction vehicles such as road rollers, trenchers and bulldozers significantly aggravate the congestion in urban roads during peak hours because of their deadly slow movement rates accompanied by their occupation of majority of road portions. Due to these reasons, promising frameworks are very much important, which can identify the heavy-construction vehicles moving in urban traffic-prone roads so that appropriate congestion evaluation strategies can be adopted to monitor traffic situations. To solve these issues, this article proposes a new deeplearning based detection framework, which employs Single Shot Detector (SSD)-based object detection system consisting of CNNs. The experimental evaluations extensively carried out on three different datasets including the benchmark ones MIO-TCD localization dataset, clearly demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed detection framework in terms of confidence scores and time efficiency when compared to the existing techniques.

AB  - Large trucking vehicles have a comparatively more significant impact on safety, traffic congestion, pollution, and pavement wear than passenger vehicles. Appropriate planning and operation of truck movement are necessary to reduce these impacts. While heavy truck movement has traditionally been measured through surveys, these remain limited because they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we propose the use of large streams of GPS data to estimate truck origin-destination flows. Large streams of GPS data have typically been difficult to use as they lack descriptors for key events during a trip unless the data is accompanied by travel diaries. We address this problem by developing a heuristic-based approach to identify the key events, such as truck stops, trips, and other trucking activities. Then, a Pearson correlation coefficient and an entropy measure are applied to compare trucks' mobility patterns and to determine whether changes in trucks travel patterns have occurred over one year. Finally, we use a multinomial logit structure to estimate destination choice models for five time periods. This research provides a strong case study of how GPS data can be used along with outputs of existing travel demand model (a model created with data collected using traditional techniques) to estimate origin-destination and destination choice models of truck movement in a provincial model setting.

AB  - Background: Detailed understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) regional transmission networks within sub-Saharan Africa is key for guiding local public health interventions against the pandemic. Methods: Here, we analysed 1139 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from positive samples collected between March 2020 and February 2021 across six counties of Coastal Kenya (Mombasa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Kwale, Tana River, and Lamu) to infer virus introductions and local transmission patterns during the first two waves of infections. Virus importations were inferred using ancestral state reconstruction, and virus dispersal between counties was estimated using discrete phylogeographic analysis. Results: During Wave 1, 23 distinct Pango lineages were detected across the six counties, while during Wave 2, 29 lineages were detected; 9 of which occurred in both waves and 4 seemed to be Kenya specific (B.1.530, B.1.549, B.1.596.1, and N.8). Most of the sequenced infections belonged to lineage B.1 (n = 723, 63%), which predominated in both Wave 1 (73%, followed by lineages N.8 [6%] and B.1.1 [6%]) and Wave 2 (56%, followed by lineages B.1.549 [21%] and B.1.530 [5%]). Over the study period, we estimated 280 SARS-CoV-2 virus importations into Coastal Kenya. Mombasa City, a vital tourist and commercial centre for the region, was a major route for virus imports, most of which occurred during Wave 1, when many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) government restrictions were still in force. In Wave 2, inter-county transmission predominated, resulting in the emergence of local transmission chains and diversity. Conclusions: Our analysis supports moving COVID-19 control strategies in the region from a focus on international travel to strategies that will reduce local transmission.

AB  - The characteristics of the planning and governance systems influence how participatory practices, such as focus groups and online consultations, are employed. This study reviews the academic literature on participatory practices in strategic spatial planning (SSP). We use network analysis to group the participatory practices in meta categories and trends based on their co-occurrences, temporal distribution and dispersion across European spatial governance and planning systems: state-led systems, conformative systems, market-led neo-performative systems, misled performative systems and proto-conformative systems. We identified two innovative meta trends in participatory practices in countries with consolidated SSP. One, categorised as citizen-led participatory practices, is common in countries embedded in market-led neo-performative systems such as The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. A second, categorised as triparty knowledge exchange participatory practices involving citizens and public and private actors, is dominant in countries embedded within conformative (Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Italy) and state-led systems (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, France, Ireland and the UK). This study shows that innovative participatory practices such as regional design, living labs and 3D tools have been helping bridge the divide between planners, decision-makers and the citizens in SSP. We conclude with a plea for recognising innovative and multidisciplinary participatory practices to improve the quality of SSP and streamline the legitimacy and democratic values in spatial governance and planning systems.

AB  - Landscape quality is a crucial factor for the heritage attractiveness of tourism, allowing tourists to experience both natural and cultural aspects along railway journeys. Moreover, railway landscape is a comprehensive system that defines the landscape observed and perceived by passengers and is characterized by the diversity and continuity of the train's movement. Yunnan-Vietnam railway (YVR) heritage is the research object of this research, whose area encompasses various landscape types and heritage sites, providing great landscape enjoyment. Currently, the assessment methods specifically for railway landscape have been discussed less than for other landscape types, especially for a series of large linear sites like the YVR. To evaluate the value of railway heritage landscape along the railway, this paper proposes a methodology combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Delphi method, and GIS as an integrated spatial assessment. Creatively, this paper seeks to: (1) discuss the relationship between railway and landscape; (2) build a comprehensive evaluation system for the railway heritage landscape, covering the topics of history, tourism, ecology, heritage, social-culture, and visual quality; (3) quantify the landscape value of the YVR areas. Thus, the results of this research can be useful to future urban planning, development, and policymaking.

AB  - Several species of owls and seed-eating birds breeding in boreal forests may occur irruptively in areas south of their regular wintering range. One common explanation is that they may be forced to move south if food supplies have crashed (push hypothesis). Little attention has been devoted to the alternative idea that the birds are drawn towards abundant food further south (pull hypothesis), even if they could overwinter further north. I evaluate these two hypotheses (push or pull) using data on winter irruptions of the Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator) and one main type of winter food, seeds in berries of Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). Grosbeak numbers during winter in southern Norway and Sweden usually peaked at 2-3 year intervals during 1959-2020, and Rowanberries in Norway peaked at 2-3 year intervals during 1980-2020. Pine Grosbeak peaks coincided with Rowanberry peaks in most years, and annual number of grosbeaks was positively correlated with the Rowanberry index. However, even in irruption years grosbeaks moved north already in January-February, inconsistent with the push hypothesis. Furthermore, Rowan masting in Norway and Finland usually had synchronous cycles, implying that irruptions were triggered even when Rowans had large crops close to the most likely origin of irruptions, opposite to what is expected by the push hypothesis. Thus, available evidence is most consistent with the pull hypothesis: Pine Grosbeaks move south in winters with high Rowanberry abundance and exploit this resource until it is gone by mid-winter, and then return to northern areas.

AB  - More than just everyday acts of appropriation, guerrilla gardens have appeared in a growing number of civic protests. During Seattle's Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) in 2020, a guerrilla garden was featured prominently within the six-block area taken over by protesters following a standoff with the Seattle Police. Through informal and semi-structured interviews with the garden leaders, volunteers, protesters, and neighbours who lived near the site, this study examines the garden's role and significance during the month-long protest. Findings suggested that the CHOP garden provided opportunities for social interactions among protesters as well as non-protesters. Through expanded engagement, the garden brought a wider range of individuals to the protest site. With its ability to engage broader participation, the garden helped mobilise additional human and material resources for the movement. Furthermore, the garden functioned as a place of learning that deepened the meanings and narrative of the movement. It also served as a place of refuge and relief during the tense occupation. Lastly, the social networks and relationships that emerged from the garden serve as a vehicle for sustaining the movement beyond the protest. As a place that facilitated these multilayered processes, these findings suggest that the CHOP Garden functioned as a "thick" space of civil resistance. The notion of thick space highlights the importance of specific spatial practices that can contribute significantly to the transformative outcomes of social movements.

AB  - Interaction analysis for moving individuals in space and time can contribute to understanding urban dynamics and human social networks. Recent advancements in trajectory analytics have created methods to identify and extract spatiotemporal patterns of interaction using movement tracking data. However, existing definitions and classifications of interaction between moving individuals are isolated. This research is the first attempt toward developing a taxonomy of human interaction in space and time that are observable from movement data. In the proposed framework, interaction between moving individuals is divided into four categories based on the time when it occurs and the duration of the interaction, including concurrent encounter, concurrent interaction, delayed encounter, and delayed interaction. While the duration of interaction can play a significant role in classifying human interaction, techniques to quantify the duration of interaction are limited. This article incorporates an evaluation of the time-geographic interaction analysis method to quantify the duration of interaction between moving individuals using human-generated GPS tracking data in California. The evaluation is a comparison between the existing time-geographic-based approach that mainly relies on potential path area computation and polygon intersection and the proximity-based approach (i.e., based on the intersection of spatial and temporal buffers of two individuals) that is commonly used in digital contact tracing technologies. The results show that the time-geographic-based approach can measure the duration of interaction more accurately, whereas the proximity-based approach underestimates the duration of interactions.

AB  - Hospitals are indispensable to urban system, especially when an earthquake occurs. Once damaged, it is difficult for hospitals to maintain the continuity of emergency care operations for earthquake victims and ensure the safety of inpatients. A hospital can be regarded as a complex engineering system, whose physical performance relies on numerous sub-systems and components. The purpose of this paper is to propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the seismic resilience of hospital buildings, considering the interdependencies on nonstructural components. In this study, critical departments and rooms in the hospital are selected as functional units and the Bayesian network method is used to reveal the interdependencies between departments, rooms, and internal components for the calculation of availabilities of departments and rooms. An impact factor is proposed to quantify the amplification effects of one component on the other component, which provides an interface to input the results of a series of upcoming experiments on multiple components. A case study of a hypothetic hospital is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework.

AB  - Worldwide and especially in less developed regions, process-based evaluations and/or geomorphological information on large-scale rivers are still scarce. Such investigation become of urgent need due to the climate change and expected occurrence of extreme floods and drought which may threaten the safety of nearby and downstream cities, especially in regions that are highly sensitive and affected by climatic changes. The Tigris River, in Iraq, is one such river that has undergone significant alteration to its flow and morphologic aspects due to climate change and the construction of many dams. However, morphology and its change for many reaches of this river are still uninvestigated. To this end, field and satellite-based investigations into the morphology of a reach located between Makhool District and Tikrit City have been conducted. In addition to the cross-sectional survey-based determination of the reach geometrical aspects, a sinuosity indices-based evaluation of the reach planform was implemented, utilizing a satellite indices-based approach. Furthermore, the characteristics of bed material were identified through field sampling. Investigation results show that the reach has a steep bed slope and many islands of low altitude with an elongated shape. The reach has a mild sinuosity with alternating bars. The dominant particle sizes of the bed material are coarse and medium gravel with a dominant particle shape of disc particles. Moreover, the satellite-based change detection indicated the fading out and disappearance of some secondary channels, the growth of many islands, and the movement of some bends downstream. The percentage of changing parts for the period 1975-2021 is 14%. Most of this change, 11%, occurred after the construction of the Mosul Dam. This reveals the sensitivity of reach morphology to flow change due to the construction of dams. The conducted fieldwork and the applied methodology contribute to supporting efforts to add knowledge worldwide about uninvestigated rivers.

AB  - Settlement evaluation is important for shallow tunnels in big cities to estimate the settlement that occurs due to the excavation of twin tunnels. The majority of earlier research on analytical solutions, on the other hand, concentrated on calculating the settlement for a single tunnel. This research introduces a procedure to evaluate the settlement induced by the excavation of twin tunnels (two parallel tunnels). In this study, a series of numerical analysis were performed to validate the analytical solution results. Two geological conditions were considered to derive the settlement depending on each case. The analytical and numerical methods were compared, which involved considering many sections and conducting a parametric study; the results have good agreement. Moreover, a comparison of the 3D flat model and 2D (FEM) with the analytical solution shows that in the fill soil, the maximum settlement values were obtained by the analytical solution. In contrast, the values obtained by the analytical solution in the rock is more conservative than those in the fill. Finally, this method was shown to be appropriate for twin tunnels dug side by side by utilizing finite element analysis 3D and 2D (PLAXIS 3D and PLAXIS 2D) to verify the analytical equations. Eventually, it will be possible to use this approach to predict settlement troughs over twin tunnels.

AB  - Within the field of movement sensing and sound interaction research, multi-user systems have gradually gained interest as a means to facilitate an expressive non-verbal dialogue. When tied with studies grounded in psychology and choreographic theory, we consider the qualities of interaction that foster an elevated sense of social connectedness, non-contingent to occupying one's personal space. Upon reflection of the newly adopted social distancing concept, we orchestrate a technological intervention, starting with interpersonal distance and sound at the core of interaction. Materialised as a set of sensory face-masks, a novel wearable system was developed and tested in the context of a live public performance from which we obtain the user's individual perspectives and correlate this with patterns identified in the recorded data. We identify and discuss traits of the user's behaviour that were accredited to the system's influence and construct four fundamental design considerations for physically distanced sound interaction. The study concludes with essential technical reflections, accompanied by an adaptation for a pervasive sensory intervention that is finally deployed in an open public space.

AB  - Most of the existing results were related to the impact of land storms on sediment, and few explained the impact of storms on sediment movement and its formation law from the mechanism. At present, the research on the impact of storm on sediment suspension on the North Bank of Longkou City in the south of Bohai Sea was not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the formation and mechanism of storm on suspended sediment from the perspective of hydrodynamic characteristics and sediment distribution by monitoring the impact of storm on sediment suspension in the south of Bohai Sea. A storm with wind speeds of 4.5-13.5 m/s occurred in the coastal area of the north side of Longkou City located in Southern Bohai Sea in April, 2015. Suspended sediment samples were obtained using automatic samplers, and the results showed that the suspended sediment content was 7.8 mg/L under normal weather conditions, which reached 121.2 mg/L at the highest during the storm event. Waves and tides were synchronously observed by acoustic Doppler current meter. Wave height was more closely correlated with wind speed when the wind veered to north, and the maximum wave height was 243 cm. The reciprocating motion of the current at the sampling site was strong, with the maximum current speed of 43.8 cm/s and a water depth of 10 m. The results of laser analysis showed that the bottom sediments were composed of 92% sand and 8% silt, with a medium diameter of 0.102 mm. From the experimental observation and result analysis, it was known that the strong dynamic process during storm surge led to the movement of sediment surface and the resuspension of sediment.

AB  - Landslides are critical natural disasters characterized by a downward movement of land masses. As one of the deadliest types of disasters worldwide, they have a high death toll every year and cause a large amount of economic damage. The transition between urban and rural areas is characterized by highways, which, in rugged Himalayan terrain, have to be constructed by cutting into the mountains, thereby destabilizing them and making them prone to landslides. This study was conducted landslide-prone regions of the entire Himalayan belt, i.e., National Highway NH-44 (the Jammu-Srinagar stretch). The main objectives of this study are to understand the causes behind the regular recurrence of the landslides in this region and propose a landslide early warning system (LEWS) based on the most suitable machine learning algorithms among the four selected, i.e., multiple linear regression, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), random forest, and decision tree. It was found that ANFIS and random forest outperformed the other proposed methods with a substantial increase in overall accuracy. The LEWS model was developed using the land system parameters that govern landslide occurrence, such as rainfall, soil moisture, distance to the road and river, slope, land surface temperature (LST), and the built-up area (BUA) near the landslide site. The developed LEWS was validated using various statistical error assessment tools such as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), confusion matrix, out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The outcomes of this study can help to manage landslide hazards in the Himalayan urban-rural transition zones and serve as a sample study for similar mountainous regions of the world.

AB  - This paper aims to articulate the movement of toppling statues, symbols of colonization and slavery, with the choreographic performance of artist Diambe da Silva in the city of Rio de Janeiro between 2019 and 2020. First, we contextualize the social and symbolic role of statutes in public space and how art is a vector of change through a brief bibliographic review of articles and texts, which highlight the problem of statues of controversial personalities that are still preserved and maintained in public spaces and how authorities and citizens have addressed this issue in recent years. Next, we analyze Diambre's work, based on the choice of statues and their location in Rio de Janeiro. For the paper, we selected three choreographies from the Devolta series that took place by the statues of the historical figures of Dom Pedro I, Dom Joao VI, and Princess Isabel, recurring personalities in the narratives of Brazilian colonial history and who played central and controversial roles when we review the constructed narrative of a country that, from a colony, went to become an empire and, finally, was recognized as a republic. Through choreography, a new symbolic meaning is given to the statues, located in prominent areas of the city, well-known noble areas, the Copacabana neighborhood, and the commercial center of the city, which was the last residential space of the Portuguese monarchy in Brazil. By linking Andre Lepecki's concepts of choreopolice and choreopolitics to Diambe's work, together with Achille Mbembe's thoughts on the fate of statues that represent an oppressive colonial past, the paper does a critical reading of the role of statues today, based on the artist's work.

AB  - The practices of social movements during the pandemic show how severe limitations on political and social organization have been turned into opportunities by increasing the focus on social justice and care-based initiatives, building trust and solidarity. This case study explores how the urban militants of the anti-military occupation movement A Foras (Out) maintained visibility during the pandemic. Besides calling attention to the unethical growth of military spending concurrent with the lack of investment in public health during the COVID-19 crisis, the movement engaged in mutualistic action against pandemic-related issues, such as isolation, and social exclusion. We examine ethnographically this hybridized mobilization, which is grounded on the significance of solidarity, community, and the nature of public life. By making social inequality, exclusion and isolation more visible, mutualistic practices act in the social justice arena as a 'purposive orientation'. This case study offers an example of a grassroots social movement renewing its space of knowledge production by widening its agency and reconfiguring care as an action for political change, adding to the notion of caring democracy by giving rise to a mutualist initiative based on horizontality and potential reciprocity. The article provides an up-to-date understanding of how imaginaries and care practices activated around solidarity, security, and safety are recasting society in southern Europe in the wake of COVID-19. It contributes to the debate around caring democracy in social movements studies by rethinking the significance of caring infrastructures and, ultimately, the meaning of solidarity and trust.

AB  - The movement for global mental health (GMH) has brought perennial questions about human diversity in mental health to the fore through heightened debates over if and how established knowledge, institutions, and practices should be altered for ethical and effective interventions with diverse peoples around the world. Kirmayer and Pedersen (2014) encouraged dialogue between GMH scholars and communities considered for intervention to address differences and concerns about colonialism. American Indian mental health offers an instructive site for global mental health inquiry to understand frameworks that might facilitate this desired dialogue. Here, we draw from a clinical ethnography in urban American Indian behavioral health conducted between September 2014 and February 2015 to glean insights into a popular response to these differences: Incorporating Indigenous cultural forms into clinical practice. Our findings highlight a predicament this response presents to mental health professionals. They can either eschew their clinical training and its cultural assumptions to take up new lives enabling their representation of Indigenous cultural forms, or they can hold onto their professional training and modify what is clinically familiar to appear culturally different. Rather than a purposeful decision, in the clinic contextual factors-tacit assumptions, clinic structures, and popular culture concepts-powerfully shaped clinical practice and reconfigured Indigenous cultural forms to support familiar clinical processes (e.g., treatment planning). Although potentially therapeutic, culturally repackaged mental health practices are not the therapeutic alternatives called for by many Indigenous communities, and when advertised as such, risk harmful appropriations and misleading reticent people into participating in culturally prescriptive interventions. Lessons for global mental health point away from incorporating Indigenous cultural forms into clinical practice, which is likely to result in cultural repackaging, toward ethnographically-informed dialogue of differences to inform models for medical and epistemic pluralism providing interested communities more culturally commensurate mental health services alongside well-supported Indigenous therapeutic alternatives.

AB  - Asymmetric competition occurs when some species have distinct advantages over their competitors and is common in animals with overlapping habitats and diet. However, the mechanism allowing coexistence between asymmetric competitors is not fully clear. Chinese white-bellied rats (Niviventer confucianus, CWR) and Korean field mice (Apodemus peninsulae, KFM) are common asymmetric competitors in shrublands and forests west of Beijing city. They share similar diet (e.g. plant seeds) and activity (nocturnal), but differ in body size (CWR are bigger than KFM), food hoarding habit (CWR: mainly larder hoarding; KFM: both larder and scatter hoarding), and ability to protect cached food (CWR are more aggressive than KFM). Here, we tested seed competition in 15 CWR-KFM pairs over a 10-day period under semi-natural enclosure conditions to uncover the differences in food hoarding, cache pilferage, and food protection between the 2 rodents, and discuss the implication for coexistence. Prior to pilferage, CWR harvested and ate more seeds than KFM. CWR tended to larder hoard seeds, whereas KFM preferred to scatter hoard seeds. Following pilferage, CWR increased consumption, decreased intensity of hoarding, and pilfered more caches from KFM than they lost, while KFM increased consumption more than they hoarded, and they preferred to hoard seeds in low and medium competition areas. Accordingly, both of the 2 rodent species increased their total energy consumption and hoarding following pilferage. Both rodent species tended to harvest seeds from the source, rather than pilfer caches from each other to compensate for cache loss via pilferage. Compared to CWR, KFM consumed fewer seeds when considering seed number, but hoarded more seeds when considering the seeds' relative energy (energy of hoarded seeds/rodent body mass(2/3)) at the end of the trials. These results suggest that asymmetric competition for food exists between CWR and KFM, but differentiation in hoarding behavior could help the subordinate species (i.e. KFM) hoard more energy than the dominant species (i.e. CWR), and may contribute to their coexistence in the field.

AB  - Sustainable and alternative energy sources of biofuel and solar power panel have been revolutionizing the lives and economy of many countries. However, these changes mainly occur in the urban areas and the rural population section has long been ignored by policy makers and government in the provision of energy. It is only recently that solar and biofuel are finally making in road to provide cheap and clean energy sources to rural population. As a result, literatures on consumer behavior of rural population towards sustainable energy sources are still very scarce. The present research aims to fulfill this gap by developing a conceptual model to investigate the adoption of solar power and biofuel energy resources in the cross-cultural setting of Malaysia and Pakistan. The data was collected from the rural areas of Pakistan and Malaysia. The two-stage data analysis method of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) have been applied to satisfy both linear and non-linear regression assumptions, respectively. The results show that consumer in rural areas of Pakistan are willing and possess intention to adopt both biofuel and solar power for commercial and domestic use. Additionally, the results confirm that branding, economic, and altruistic factors are important in yielding intention to use towards biofuel and solar power panel in Pakistan which are validated by the results obtained in Malaysia. Other factors such as climate change awareness, retailer services quality, and ease of use are also important. The results offer wide-ranging theoretical and managerial implications.

We limit our definition of "exit bans" to civil business disputes between a foreign businessperson and his or her local Chinese counterpart, where the foreigner is prevented from leaving China. A traveler typically learns of an exit ban at the airport when he or she is not allowed to board a flight; accordingly, an exit ban is distinct from a debt hostage situation in which the foreigner's freedom of movement within the country is restricted. To conduct our study, we submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests (or their equivalents) to six Western governments of countries that engage in significant trade with China and whose citizens were subjected to an exit ban preventing them from leaving China. We also conducted a separate content search and analysis of English and Mandarin media articles that discuss exit ban situations in China. Our analysis yields four primary findings. First, the data reveal at least 128 total cases, and approximately one-third of the cases were driven by business disputes. It is likely that many more of the 128 cases were caused by business disputes, but because much of the data we received from government agencies was provided in aggregate form, we were unable to verify the driving force behind such cases. Second, in the business-related cases, Chinese authorities generally appeared to follow applicable exit ban laws and application processes, thereby pushing back on the narrative that local norms and a culture of ignoring the law trump the legal mandates issued from Beijing. Third, most exit bans took place in Tier 1 cities or coastal regions (where more foreign business activity is concentrated), although scattered cases occurred in more remote locations, thus indicating that foreign business interests may be at risk in cities of diverse sizes throughout China. Last, the concern within the international business community that the term "responsible person" under Chinese exit ban law would be abused by authorities to also restrict the movement of non-senior level businesspeople finds some limited confirmation in our data, although most exit ban cases we located were brought against senior-level executives. Relying on these findings, the article concludes with four practical recommendations that business leaders can use to better evaluate and manage exit ban risks in China.

AB  - High-rise buildings, with high number of population, have always been among the concerns discussed in urban crisis management. One of the crucial aspects of high-rise buildings is having a proper and timely action plan for evacuation in the case of emergencies such as fires. The spread and progression of fire smoke in high-rise buildings are affected by the architectural design of the building, and having a three-dimensional (3D) model of high-rise buildings can play key role in damage reduction in such cases. This paper, first presents a method for 3D smoke emission based on utilizing 2D cadastral data to generate a 3D model of the buildings. Then, in step of smoke fire emission simulation, the influence of different smoke movement paths such as the entrance/exit doors, windows, smoke barrier, stairs, and elevators, are examined in different scenarios. Next, the emergency evacuation of occupancies with different behavioral and physical characteristics is simulated. The results indicate that 2D cadastral data of apartments can be employed as a suitable source to create 3D models of high-rise buildings, and allows to examine the emergency evacuation of residents by including the smoke simulation spread in the building.

AB  - Changes in free-roaming dog population size are important indicators of the effectiveness of dog population management. Assessing the effectiveness of different management methods also requires estimating the processes that change population size, such as the rates of recruitment into and removal from a population. This is one of the first studies to quantify the size, rates of recruitment and removal, and health and welfare status of free-roaming dog populations in Europe. We determined the size, dynamics, and health status of free-roaming dog populations in Pescara, Italy, and Lviv, Ukraine, over a 15-month study period. Both study populations had ongoing dog population management through catch-neuter-release and sheltering programmes. Average monthly apparent survival probability was 0.93 (95% CI 0.81-1.00) in Pescara and 0.93 (95% CI 0.84-0.99) in Lviv. An average of 7 dogs km(-2) were observed in Pescara and 40 dogs km(-2) in Lviv. Per capita entry probabilities varied between 0.09 and 0.20 in Pescara, and 0.12 and 0.42 in Lviv. In Lviv, detection probability was lower on weekdays (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% CI 0.53-0.96) and higher on market days (odds ratio: 2.58, 95% CI 1.28-4.14), and apparent survival probability was lower in males (odds ratio: 0.25, 95% CI 0.03-0.59). Few juveniles were observed in the study populations, indicating that recruitment may be occurring by movement between dog subpopulations (e.g. from local owned or neighbouring free-roaming dog populations), with important consequences for population control. This study provides important data for planning effective dog population management and for informing population and infectious disease modelling.

AB  - Deep into the night of 9 June 2021, a high-intensity and short-duration rainstorm, the largest rainfall ever recorded in Zhuji, struck the entire city. The abrupt rainfall triggered several debris flows, which killed four residents and closed a highly ranked national scenic area for over three months. The debris flows, triggered by record-breaking rainfall, occurred in a rhyolite porphyry area that was not recognised as an area prone to frequent debris flow. Thus, detailed field investigations were conducted on three debris flow gullies. It was demonstrated that an extreme rainfall event, complex topographic profiles and abundant diluvium in the gullies were the main contributing factors in the disastrous damage. In particular, steep eluvial slopes with a high gradient of over 30 degrees failed under heavy rainfall, which was one of the major factors in the initiation of debris flows. In addition, geometric properties, such as the curved travelling path, natural cliff and cross-sectional shape of the gullies, interacted significantly with the deep and lateral erosions of diluvium in the gullies, which promoted mass enlargement and the long-runout movement of the debris flows. Furthermore, reasonable countermeasures made some contribution to the reduction and mitigation of this kind of geo-disasters.

AB  - With analysis occurring during a heightened concern with the Black Lives Matter movement and knife crime in the U.K., this paper aims to delineate the characteristics of a street code, constituting a specific dominant and often hegemonic form of 'street masculinity' found on an inner-city housing estate in London called Maxwell. The fieldwork ran over nine months in 2019, involving 48 Black, Asian, and minority ethnic men aged 18-22. Using an ethnographic methodology, the principal methods of data generation were observations, interviews and informal conversations. The main theories this study draws on to understand 'street masculinity' were Connell's and Messerschmidt's dominant, hegemonic, subordinate and complicit masculinity forms. Findings centre on data from two young men who exemplify different patterns of masculinity performing the street code. Findings are presented under a series of characteristics that make up the game of the 'on-road' street masculinity and include (1) authenticity, 'swagger' and not being 'pussy'; (2) a preparedness for violence; (3) knife-carrying; (4) a presence on the digital street. Although this way of living drove a desire for respect and group status, there was also an underlying and pervasive sense of vulnerability derived from risk-taking and anticipation of danger.

AB  - Izmir, which is one of the biggest cities of Turkey and has the extensive tectonic features of the Western Anatolia region, has been struck in recent years due to its high seismic activity. In particular, the south of Izmir is one of the regions that has high seismic activity in the city, which is constrained by major fault zones. The earthquake of magnitude of a Mw 6.9 occurred 8 km north of Samos Island at a depth of 16 km on 30.10.2020, at 11:51:24 UTC (14:51:24 Local Time (LT)). It occurred on a 40-kilometer-long north-dipping normal fault zone in the Mediterranean between Greece's Samos Island and Turkey's Kusadasi Bay. Following the mainschock, a tsunami with a height of more than 1 meter occurred at Sigacik Bay, south of Izmir, and on the north side of Samos Island. This article focuses on the investigation of the Samos earthquake by utilizing both GNSS data and InSAR images, and the obtained results are given in this paper. GNSS data were processed by using CSRS-PPP Software as static and kinematic modes. After processing the GNSS data, the maximum displacements were observed at CESME and IZMIR CORS-TR points located in the north of the fault. Horizontal movements of 12 cm and 6 cm towards the north were obtained at CESME and IZMIR points, respectively. However, the amount of horizontal movements was less at DIDIM and AYDIN CORS-TR locations, which are located to the south of the fault. In addition to GNSS data, ESA Sentinel-1 SAR data was used in the InSAR procedure, and the displacements were clarified using the unwrapped interferogram. The interferogram revealed a 10 cm uplift in the west of the Island of Samos and a 10 cm subsidence in the Izmir region, on the north side of the fault, based on the InSAR data. The most striking feature of this study is that the earthquake that occurred near the island of Samos was reported by Gansas' study that the 3 GNSS points (SAMO, SAMU, and 093A) on the island of Samos are moving in a south direction and the largest displacement is about 36 centimetres south. However, in our study, the north direction is more prominent as the direction of movement at IZMIR and CESME points. The movement at the DIDIM point supports his work. In other words, the Samos Fault affected the points located in the north and south differently.

AB  - South African students have since 2015 returned to the forefront of the country's social movement struggles. Central to this wave of contention was the #RhodesMustFall (#RMF) movement at the University of Cape Town (UCT), which coalesced with uprisings at universities across the country under the banner of #FeesMustFall, focusing demands on abolishing tuition fees, decolonizing education and society, and ending campus worker exploitation. In the process, students imagined how education and society could be different. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between social movements, occupations, and imagination, by examining a crucial event in the #RMF movement: the student occupation of an administrative building at UCT. Because social movement theory has an underdeveloped conception of the imagination, we draw on Sartre's and Fanon's understanding of the imagination and apply it to students' activism. Based on original qualitative research we demonstrate how imagined futures guide movement activity, while their prefigurative practices in the occupation enacted these in the present. The #RMF occupation was seen as a break from reality that catalysed students' imaginations, honing their critiques of society and shaping two central imaginaries of alternative futures, decolonization and intersectionality. The #RMF movement's imaginaries and enactments were influential in reshaping the South African higher education landscape and even inspired movements internationally.

AB  - Background The consequences of demographic change are already noticeable in Saxony, the federal state with the highest average age in Germany and predominantly rural areas. In order to improve medical care for patients with Parkinson's disease (PwP), a status quo analysis of current care practice is required. Objective To what extent does the utilization of medical services by PwP differ a) between urban and rural areas in Saxony and b) between PwP with and without neurologist contact in the observation period from 2011 to 2019? Material and methods The cohort study was based on extensive routine data for Saxony from the health insurance company AOK PLUS from 2010 to 2019. A cohort of 15,744 PwP (n = 67,448 patient-years) was compared to a matched cohort (n = 674,480 patient-years; criteria: year of birth, gender, year of insurance, place of residence: urban/rural) without an ICD-10 coding of a movement disorder. Results Overall, there was a steady increase in the number of PwP in the dynamic cohort from 2011 (n = 6829) to 2019 (n = 8254). Urban-rural differences included a smaller proportion of patients being seen by a neurologist in rural areas. The PwP had a 3.5 to 4-fold higher risk of dying compared to those in the comparison cohort. Changes in drug therapy for Parkinson's disease (i.e., increases in COMT and MAO inhibitors) and in remedy delivery (i.e., increases in occupational therapy and speech therapy) over the observation period were primarily seen in PwP who were seen by a neurologist. Discussion The study identified increased morbidity and mortality in PwP who are suitable targets for innovative care concepts. The increasing number of patients and the described differences document the need for this. At the same time, changes in prescription practice show that innovative forms of treatment are being used by neurologists in outpatient care.

AB  - An intersection of two or more roads poses a risk for potential conflicts among vehicles. Often the reasons triggering such conflicts are not clear, as they might be too subtle for the human eye. The environment also plays a part in understanding where, when, and why a particular vehicle interaction has occurred in a certain way. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to dive deeper into the vehicle interaction at a micro-scale within the embedded geographical environment, particularly at the intersections. This would in turn assist in evaluating the association of vehicle interactions with conflict risks and near-miss accidents. Moreover, detection of such micro traffic interactions could also be used to improvise the complexity of the already established transport infrastructure. Conversely, traffic at intersections has been explored mainly for flow estimation, capacity and width measurements, and traffic congestion, etc., whereas the detection of micro-scale traffic interactions at intersections remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we present a novel approach to retrieve and represent micro-scale traffic movement interactions at a non-signalized T-junction by extending a recently introduced qualitative spatiotemporal Point-Descriptor-Precedence (PDP) representation. We study how the PDP representation offers a fine solution to study the interaction of traffic flows at intersections. This permits tracking the micro-movement of vehicles in much finer detail, which is used later to retrieve movement patterns from a motion dataset. Unlike conventional approaches, we start our approach with the actual movements before modeling the static intersection environment. Additionally, with the aid of illustrative examples, we discuss how the length, width, and speed of the vehicles can be exploited in our approach to detect specific patterns more accurately. Additionally, we address the potential benefits of our approach for traffic safety assessment and how it can be extended to a network of intersections using different transport modes.

AB  - Colegio Santa Cruz was part of the experimental secondary classes movement, which occurred in Brazilian education from the late 1950s on. To do this, this catholic and male school, located in Sao Paulo city, appropriated, since 1959, the innovative Personalized and Community Pedagogy, as proposed by Pierre Faure. This paper focuses on two innovative practices in experimental secondary classes at Colegio Santa Cruz, namely: the organization of school space and time; and teaching through directed study and use of worksheets. The analysis of this new school culture is conducted through an interview given by former secondary student Henrique Lindberg Neto. Thus, the experimental class at Colegio Santa Cruz contributed to providing students with more autonomy, detaching from the pedagogical traditionalism that prevailed in Brazilian secondary education.

AB  - Background and Aims European mesic meadows are semi-natural open habitats of high biodiversity and an essential part of European landscapes. These species-rich communities can be a source of seed mixes for ecological restoration, urban greening and rewilding. However, limited knowledge of species germination traits is a bottleneck to the development of a competitive native seed industry. Here, we synthesize the seed ecology of mesic meadows. Methods We combined our own experimental data with data obtained from databases to create a combined dataset containing 2005 germination records of 90 plant species from 31 European countries. We performed a Bayesian meta-analysis of this dataset to test the seed germination response to environmental cues including scarification, stratification, temperature, alternating temperature and light. We also used multivariate ordination to check the relationship between seed traits (germination and morphology) and species ecological preferences, and to compare the seed ecology of mesic meadows with that of other herbaceous plant communities from the same geographic area. Key Results The seed ecology of mesic meadows is characterized by (1) high seed germinability when compared with other herbaceous plant communities; (2) low correspondence between seed traits and species ecological preferences; and (3) a deep phylogenetic separation between the two major families, Poaceae and Fabaceae. Poaceae produce many light seeds that respond to gap-detecting germination cues (alternating temperatures and light); Fabaceae produce fewer heavy seeds, which need scarification to break their physical dormancy. Conclusions High germinability of meadow seeds will reduce their capacity to form persistent seed banks, resulting in dispersal limitations to passive regeneration. For centuries, human activities have shaped the regeneration of meadows, leading to a loss of seed dormancy and decoupling seeds from seasonal cycles, as has been found in many domesticated species. The same anthropic processes that have shaped semi-natural mesic meadows have left them dependent on continued human intervention for their regeneration, highlighting the importance of active restoration via seed supply.

AB  - Thousands of chemical substances daily reach the aquatic environment, mainly deriving from industrial, urban, and agricultural activity. Such chemical substances can form mixtures that are difficult to detect with routine chemical analysis. Many of them exhibit neuroactive properties and they are considered an emerging issue for both human and environmental health. The real impact of exposure to neurotoxic contaminants on the ecosystem is not yet well known but there is evidence that they can cause important changes in organism behavior with a long-term impact on biodiversity and human health. Humans can be indirectly exposed to neurotoxicants for example through ingestion of fishery products and drinking waters. Neurotoxicity was identified as one of the most emerging Modes of Action (MoAs) in the aquatic environment. An improvement to bridge the gap of knowledge in this sector is needed and new standardized methods are required.
   The aim of this study is to verify the feasibility of the Coiling Activity Test (CAT) with the zebrafish embryo model applied on environmental samples and chemical substances. Spontaneous movements of the tail in embryos occurred earlier at 17 hours post-fertilization (hpf) originate from a single neural circuit and are influenced by contaminant exposure. The count of bursts and their intensity are important parameters of the neurotoxic effect and specific software allows rapid measurement of them.
   We applied the CAT on different environmental samples and chemical substances at different laboratory conditions in order to recommend a rapid, cost-effective operating protocol for environmental analysis. In parallel, we have carried out the 96 hours Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) test (OECD, 236) to add more information on the samples and to verify the sensibility between the two tests.
   The spontaneous tail movement in zebrafish is demonstrated to be a very powerful tool in eco-neurotoxicological studies as it provides in few hours important screening information on the presence of dangerous neurotoxic substances in the ecosystem. This test could give also a valid contribution to implementing the regulatory guidelines for the identification of neurotoxic risks in the ecosystems.

AB  - The goal of smart cities and sustainable transport is to ensure the efficient movement of people while minimizing a negative impact on the environment. Many cities around the world conduct a policy aimed at limiting parking spaces; however, the complete elimination of parking spaces in cities currently does not seem possible. Parking vehicles cause disturbances in road traffic by searching for a parking space and performing the parking maneuver. This article analyzes the impact of the parking maneuver on the capacity of the inlets of intersections with traffic lights, and the significance of the time it takes to enter and exit a parking space on road traffic disturbance areas under Polish conditions. The research is carried out in on-street parking, characterized by different positions of the parking space to the road, the different surfaces of parking spaces, and the geometry of the road next to which the parking spaces are located. Differences in the time of entry to and exit from the parking space between the research areas indicate that different characteristics of the parking spaces affect the time of the parking maneuver. Drivers wait for the acceptable distance between vehicles on the road into which the vehicle can exit from the parking space. Drivers exiting from perpendicular parking spaces more often cause traffic disruptions than in the case of parallel parking spaces, due to limited visibility. The occupancy of parking spaces directly next to the analyzed ones also affects the time of entry to and exit from the parking space. However, between the time of entry to or exit from the parking space, and the use of the parking space, there is no relationship. This finding indicates that more factors determine the time of entry to and exit from the parking space. The results presented in the article show the need to conduct further research on the impact of parking maneuvers on the capacity of intersections with traffic lights for road traffic conditions in Poland. The results of the research will allow for the design and construction of an optimal parking infrastructure that will meet the needs of road users, while minimizing the negative impact on road conditions and the natural environment following sustainable development.

AB  - Rome has the world's longest historical record of felt earthquakes, with more than 100 events during the last 2600 years. However, no destructive earthquake has been reported in the sources, and all of the greatest damage suffered in the past has been attributed to far-field events. While this fact suggests that a moderate seismotectonic regime characterizes the Roman area, no study has provided a comprehensive explanation for the lack of strong earthquakes in the region. Through the analysis of the focal mechanism and the morphostructural setting of the epicentral area of a "typical" moderate earthquake (M-1 = 3.3) that recently occurred in the northern urban area of Rome, we demonstrate that this event reactivated a buried segment of an ancient fault generated under both a different and a stronger tectonic regime than that which is presently active. We also show that the evident structural control over the drainage network in this area reflects an extreme degree of fragmentation of a set of buried faults generated under two competing stress fields throughout the Pleistocene. Small faults and a present-day weaker tectonic regime with respect to that acting during the Pleistocene might explain the lack of strong seismicity in the long historical record, suggesting that a large earthquake is not likely to occur.

AB  - Aedes-borne viruses, yellow fever (YF), dengue, Chikungunya and Zika are taking a huge toll on global health as Africa faces re-emergence with potential for massive human catastrophe. Transmission driven by diverse vectors in ecological settings that range from urban to rural and sylvatic habitats with human and nonhuman primate/reservoir activities across such habitats has facilitated virus movement and spillover to susceptible human populations. Approved vaccine exists for YF, although availability for routine and mass vaccination is often constrained. Integrating vector surveillance, understanding disease ecology with rationalised vaccination in high-risk areas (YF) remains important in disease prevention and control. We review trends in disease occurrence in Africa, hinting on gaps in disease detection and management and the prospects for prevention and/or control.

AB  - This study examines the development of a 1950s educational programme for the inclusion of children with severe intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) - those with IQ scores of less than 50, referred to as "trainable" or "dependent" children - into community life. Conducted by the American Association of Parents of Retarded Children (AHRC) in New York City, the programme clarified the social life expectancies of children with severe IDD who had historically been segregated from society. The programme aimed to have these children be accepted within their communities and families, broaden their lives, and help their parents understand them appropriately. It affirmed the notion that children with severe IDD and their families could live in society with support. In other words, the goal was not just vocational independence but also the pursuance of a social life while receiving community services. The intended outcomes of the programme included personal independence, housework, good relations with others, physical movement, and literacy, among others. Although the programme was unique and thus different from traditional academic learning content, it was emphasised that the original goals of education for children with severe IDD and that of mainstream education are the same in the sense of realising democracy. The education and guidance necessary for them to grow to their fullest potential and integrate into community life could also lead to academic and vocational outcomes. The development of the school programme represented the beginning of what became known as social inclusion, thereby bringing diversity to social life and education.

AB  - The lion-tailed macaque is an endangered species, endemic to the Western Ghats of southern India. The Anamalai hills harbour 63 groups of the species, several of which occur in rainforest fragments, amidst tea and coffee plantations, on the Valparai plateau. Being highly arboreal, these populations have always been assumed to be largely restricted to their fragmented forest patches and possibly unable to navigate successfully through the surrounding plantation-human habitation matrix. While adult males have occasionally been sighted along roadsides between forest fragments, we now provide evidence for the emigration of an entire troop out of a forest fragment into nearby human settlements, leading to the inclusion of areas completely devoid of natural vegetation into the core home range of the troop. We argue that a combination of hostile inter-troop encounters, a natural urge to expand their range and the discovery of novel and relatively easily accessible food resources may have led to such unusual ranging patterns, accompanied by significant changes in troop behavioural profiles, which we consider as inexorable processes of synurbisation.

AB  - The growing interest and usage of green space during the pandemic relates to why greenery increases enjoyment of daily life and alleviates troubles arising from infectious periods. However, it is necessary to understand what reactions to the degree of COVID-19's spread were expressed in hiking exercise characteristics (hiking frequency, actual movement distance, average speed, total exercise time). To understand the progress of forest usage behavior during the pandemic, we analyzed factors influencing hiking exercise characteristics and relationships between those factors and hiking exercise characteristics. Hiking record data were obtained (2019-2020) from the workout app "Tranggle " pertaining to hikers in their 20s and 30s who visited the 13 mountains in the Seoul Metropolitan Area most frequently. The differences in hiking exercise characteristics (2019 data subtracted from 2020) were linked with factor data that could be related to them, including the degree of COVID-19's spread (Rt). To explore relationships between hiking exercise characteristics and factors, we developed four models with a linear mixed model. We found that Rt, week, weekdays/weekends, and PM10 contributed to explaining the hiking exercise characteristics' differences. As a result of this analysis, the degree of COVID-19's spread (Rt) affected hiking frequency; the week affected hiking frequency and actual movement distance; weekdays or weekends affected hiking frequency, actual movement distance, average speed, and total exercise time; and PM10 affected hiking frequency. These findings indicate that hiking was an alternative way for those looking for a new strategy to replace lost opportunities for physical activity. Therefore, we conclude that it is necessary to induce the usage of green space so that many people can take advantage of the functions and benefits of greenery, which stood out during the pandemic era.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is an important component of urban resources which contributes to human physical and mental health. Studies on the accessibility of UGS under the two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) framework have recently received much attention. However, the effects of people's actual mobility patterns have not been fully considered in current studies. Proposed in this study is an improved accessibility model called AM-Ga2SFCA, which refines the traditional Gaussian 2SFCA method with the actual mobility information extrac-ted from mobile phone big data and online map. A new attractiveness index of UGS is implemented by combining the popularity evaluated by the PageRank algorithm and the actual utilisation based on buffer analysis. In addition, realistic travel time between each demand point and UGS is retrieved from the online map, which is further introduced into AM-Ga2SFCA as the travel cost. A case study is conducted in Shenzhen, China to validate the proposed model. Results show that the accessibility of UGS is strongly correlated with regional urbanization level, for example, higher accessibility generally occurred in the region with developed transportation and rich green resources. From the perspective of age groups and travel modes, we found that the environmental justice issue had already occurred in Shenzhen especially for the non-elderly: under the walk mode, nearly 80% of the non-elderly only shared 20% of UGS whilst approximately 80% of the elderly shared 30% of UGS. However, taxi or private vehicles can effectively alleviate the aforementioned phenomenon by reducing the Gini index to less than 0.5. The proposed model is expected to advance the understanding of UGS accessibility and facilitate effective planning to reduce environmental justice.

AB  - Haze occurred in Zhengzhou, a megacity in the northern China, with the PM2.5 as high as 254 mu g m(-3) on 25 December 2019, despite the emergency response measure of restriction on the emission of anthropogenic pollutants which was implemented on December 19 for suppressing local air pollution. Air pollutant concentrations, chemical compositions, and the origins of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) between 5-26 December were investigated to explore the reasons for the haze occurrence. Results show that the haze was caused by efficient SO2-to-suflate and NOx-to-nitrate conversions under high relative humidity (RH) condition. In comparison with the period before the restriction (5-18 December) when the PM2.5 was low, the concentration of PM2.5 during the haze (19-26 December) was 173 mu g m(-3) on average with 51% contributed by sulfate (31 mu g m(-3)) and nitrate (57 mu g m(-3)). The conversions of SO2-to-sulfate and NOx-to-nitrate efficiently produced sulfate and nitrate although the concentration of the two precursor gases SO2 and NOx was low. The high RH, which was more than 70% and the consequence of artificial water-vapor spreading in the urban air for reducing air pollutants, was the key factor causing the conversion rates to be enlarged in the constriction period. In addition, the last 48 h movement of the air parcels on 19-26 December was stagnant, and the air mass was from surrounding areas within 200 km, indicating weather conditions favoring the accumulation of locally-originated pollutants. Although emergency response measures were implemented, high gas-to-particle conversions in stagnant and moisture circumstances can still cause severe haze in urban air. Since the artificial water-vapor spreading in the urban air was one of the reasons for the high RH, it is likely that the spreading had unexpected side effects in some certain circumstances and needs to be taken into consideration in future studies.

AB  - The article presents the author's search for and systematization of miscellaneous materials on campaign record of the Marusya Nikiforova' unit on the territories of the Kherson and Yekateroslav gubernias and the Province of the Don Cossack Host. The name of Maria Grigorievna Nikiforova is inextricably linked with the history of Russian anarchism; her activities still serve as an illustration of the events of the Civil War in Russia. The article uses information from memoirs of the participants in revolutionary events written in the 1920s. It establishes main points in detachment's movement through the cities and towns of the South of Russia from autumn 1917 to summer 1918. The collected materials show that the detachment size ranged from 100 to 500 people, fluctuating under the influence of military circumstances. The popularity of M. Nikiforova was served by her own actions aiming to make her name known. The anarchist deliberately brought about a bloody phase of social conflict, establishing the practice of requisitions and "unmotivated" executions. In September-October 1917, she contributed to radicalization of another anarchist, N. I. Makhno. Her detachment was formed in November 1917 in Aleksandrovsk, Yekaterinoslav gubernia. In December 1917, it took part in battles with the Haidamaks. In February 1918, during the demobilization of the old army, Marusya's detachment moved to strengthen the front. In Yelisavetgrad, Kherson gubernia, Nikiforova proceeded with requisitions, provoking street battles with the city's Red Guard and self-defense units. Her allies were reserve detachment of the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets under the command of A. M. Belenkevich and the Red Guard detachment of Yekaterinoslav workers. She retreated under the Austro-German troops' pressure together with the Bolshevik-Left SRs-anarchist detachments following the railway line of Yelisavetgrad-Krivoy Rog (Dolgintsevo)-Melitopol-Taganrog-Novocherkassk. Clashes with enemy units were unfortunate for Nikiforova. Her detachment was losing numbers and military equipment. Combat successes were insignificant. Marusya's detachment arrived at Tsaritsyn, bleeding and exhausted. It did not participate in the robbery of the "golden" echelon of the Don Council of People's Commissars. Unlike commanders of other detachments, who retreated from the territory of Ukraine, Maria Nikiforova did not fight as part of the Red Army. Nikiforova's name became an element of mass consciousness in the days of the revolution. The legendary veil encourages exaggeration of her role in the military events. She had a direct, albeit short-term, impact on expanding of the boundaries of the "permissible" in an internal armed conflict in Russia.

TI  - Modeling Cross-Regional Transmission and Assessing the Effectiveness of Restricting Inter-Regional Population Movements in Controlling COVID-19-Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, 2021
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA  - English
KW  - EPIDEMIC
AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to construct an assessment method for cross-regional transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to provide recommendations for optimizing measures such as interregional population movements.
   Methods: Taking Xi'an City as the example subject of this study's analysis, a Cross-Regional -Gravitational-Dynamic model was constructed to simulate the epidemic in each district of Xi'an under three scenarios of controlled population movement (Scenario 1: no intensive intervention; Scenario 2: blocking Yanta District on December 18 and blocking the whole region on December 23; and Scenario 3: blocking the whole region on December 23). This study then evaluated the effects of such simulated population control measures.
   Results: The cumulative number of cases for the three scenarios was 8,901,425, 178, and 474, respectively, and the duration of the epidemic was 175, 18, and 22 days, respectively. The real world prevention and control measures in Xi'an reduced the cumulative number of cases for its outbreak by 99.98% in comparison to the simulated response in Scenario 1; in contrast, the simulated prevention and control strategies set in Scenarios 2 (91.26%) and 3 (76.73%) reduced cases even further than the real world measures used in Xi'an.
   Discussion: The constructed model can effectively simulate an outbreak across regions. Timely implementation of two-way containment and control measures in areas where spillover is likely to occur is key to stopping cross-regional transmission.

AB  - LGBTQI issues have become commonly investigated phenomena in research lately, probably due to the rise in the number of queer sexuality people who are "coming out" to open about their true sexual identities. A lot of research today explores LGBTQI population challenges. One critical challenge facing this minority population is their constant movement from one place to the other. Though research on LGBTQI migration is constantly growing, there is still increasing concern that this minority population choose to reveal their true sexual statuses in other geographical spaces while conceal in others. Only few studies endeavor to address the relationship between "coming out" decision and LGBTQI movement from around and/or between spaces. This paper explores how geographical context determines "the coming out of closet" for LGBTQI population. We seek to enquire why the minority populations choose to "come out" in some places and remain closeted in some. How do geographical spaces determine "coming out of closet" by LGBTQI population? How can dialogues be used to explore the relationship between "coming out of closet" and LGBTQI migration?' community dialogues were used at Qoqolosing community. Diverse populations were represented in terms of church denominations, age, social class, and most importantly gender. Our results demonstrated that quite a noticeable number of LGBTQI population in Lesotho spend their lives moving around, searching for the right space to live their lives openly as queer sexuality persons. These results go beyond previous reports, showing that LGBTQI normally move from villages to towns where there is greater acceptance of LGBTQI people. Our study, thus expand the existing body of research on LGTBQI and migration by stipulating that, this minority populations migrate and relocate specifically to reveal their true sexual statuses. Taken together, the findings of this study revealed a strong correlation between revealing one<apos;>s true sexual status and the environment one is exposed to Findings underscore the importance of geographical factors for "coming out of closet" for LGBTQI population. The paper suggests further investigation relating to the impact of constant relocation to LGBTQI socio-economic statuses.

AB  - In order to improve the accuracy of dust storm prediction and reduce the damage and losses by a dust storm event, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth study on the same. The data of the national air quality stations, backward trajectories generated by the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT), and the lidar network data from Wuwei, Baiyin, and Dingxi were used to study a large-scale dust storm event that occurred from 12 to 14 May 2019. This study explores the cause of the dust storm and physical characteristics of dust aerosols in three-dimensional space, as well as its impact on air quality. Results show that the dust storm was caused by the eastward movement of the East Asian trough and affected most cities in northern China from northwest to southeast. Consequently, the air quality deteriorated seriously, especially over the Hexi Corridor. The hourly peak concentrations of PM10 in Wuwei and Baiyin were close to 3,000 mu g center dot m(-3). The observations from the lidar network show that the dust intensities were similar at different cities, and their extinction coefficients were close. However, the depolarization ratio varied with sources and the physical characteristics of dust particles. According to the simulation results of extinction coefficients and particle concentrations, due to the impact of dust transported at high altitudes, the concentration of particles in Dingxi did not decrease with the increase in altitude. The particle concentrations from ground-based monitoring were lower than those of Baiyin and Wuwei, while particle concentrations above 0.3 km were higher than those of Baiyin and Wuwei.

KW  - AFRICA
AB  - Background. Cholera is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. This study aimed to generate evidence to better understand the epidemiology of cholera as well as chronicle the city administration's emergency management efforts during the Addis Ababa cholera outbreak in 2016. Method. A descriptive analysis was performed using the cholera outbreak data collected from June 8 to October 31, 2016. A case was defined as a patient aged 5 years or older who develops acute watery diarrhea with or without vomiting. Administrative and laboratory finding reports were also used, as well as documented situational updates. Result. A total of 8,083 cases (AR of 0.24 percent) with 15 deaths (CFR of 0.18 percent) were reported. Males in unskilled manual occupations and housewives accounted for 2,198 (27.2%) and 1,195 (14.8%), respectively, of the total. A total of 6,908 cases (85.46 percent) sought medical attention within two days of the onset of the condition. The presence of the Kolfie river as well as the relatively confined living conditions of the residents aided in the emergence and rapid spread of the disease. The increased in-and-out movement of people, combined with the city administration's deficient development infrastructure of water, hygiene, and sanitation, contributes to higher morbidity and a longer duration of the outbreak. Multiple command posts established in various locations as well as a lack of collaboration among relevant stakeholders resulted in inefficient information and resource management. Furthermore, there is a lack of risk factor surveillance for the early detection of cholera-causing agents. Conclusion and Recommendations. This outbreak caused significant morbidity and mortality. Prioritizing early risk detection, implementing preventive measures, and developing positive working relationships with relevant parties are all critical. A well-established community-based surveillance system and incident management system (IMS) will be required for future emergency management. It is recommended that the city administration make critical adjustments to its developmental infrastructures related to water, sanitation, and hygiene and implement risk factor surveillance from sewerage lines for the early detection of agents that cause cholera.

AB  - Objectives As the political, economic, military, and cultural center of the early Yuan Dynasty, Xanadu attracted people from all over the world. It was thriving and prosperous, composed of residents with different customs and religious beliefs from different social strata. Genetic analysis of Xanadu's residents provides a valuable approach for inferring processes of population movement and exchange during the Yuan period. Materials and Methods Nine skeletons from Zhenzishan cemetery, the largest cemetery near Xanadu, were selected for the whole-genome shotgun sequencing and capture sequencing of the nonrecombining region of the Y chromosome, three of whom were identified as likely being of European descent based on cranio-facial morphology. Results There were nine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes (F1a1, D5b1, B4a3, B5a2a1, H6a1a, T2d1, D4o2a, N9a1, and Z4a) and eight Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups (G/M201, I/M170, J/M304, L/M20, O/M175, Q/M242, R/M207, and T/M184) identified in the nine ancient individuals. Autosomal analysis further subdivided them into four groups (ZZS_EA, ZZS_CA, ZZS_SA, and ZZS_Cau). Discussion As the capital of the Yuan Dynasty, Xanadu was a prosperous city with international influence. The nine skeletons from the Zhenzishan cemetery reflect the high genetic diversity of Xanadu's residents, with clear differences in paternal and maternal origins. The maternal lineages of these residents were mainly East Asian with some western Eurasian features, while the paternal lineages were mainly western Eurasian with fewer East Asian features. These results contribute to a better understanding of the Mongolian Empire's impact on the migration and mixture of people across the Eurasian continent.

DesignA prospective cohort study with a two-year follow-up. SettingKashiwa City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan and Toshima Ward, Tokyo Metropolitan, Japan. ParticipantsThe data were acquired from two cohorts. The final sample comprised 1,523 community-dwelling older people aged 65-94 years (681 men, 842 women). They were individuals who were independent in IADL at baseline and participated in follow-up IADL assessments two years later. MeasurementsAt baseline, comprehensive assessments were performed including: health interview, gait function, hand-grip strength, skeletal muscle mass, balance function, oral function, dietary lifestyle, cognitive function, quality of life, mental status, and social network. When the two-year follow-up was performed, IADL declines were observed in 53 out of 1,523 people. The association of each Z-transformed parameter with the occurrence of IADL decline was examined by employing a binominal logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, body weight, body height, and medical history. An odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval were calculated and compared between different parameters. ResultsA decrease in walking speed and one-legged stance time, whereas an increased timed up & go test time was associated with significant ORs for the occurrence of IADL decline. ConclusionGait-related parameters appear to be the strong predictors of the onset of IADL decline in community-dwelling older people.

AB  - As a form of social movement aiming to effect social change, protests could bring about unintended impacts on all walks of life. In other words, the cost of protests can be incurred by those who might not be protesters. The protests triggered by an extradition bill in Hong Kong since 2019 are no exception. This paper focuses on the impacts on the ridership of the metro system on protest days. It synthesizes and hypothesizes factors influencing the distribution of the ridership changes and conducts an empirical study in the context of Hong Kong to study the possible influences and spatial dependence. It is found that, across metro stations, political orientation (percentage of votes to pro-democracy camp in the 2019 Election of District Councils), law enforcement (permission from the police to protest), land use type (especially for commercial and open space), population age and income, as well as transit/road network characteristics and intermodal connectivity, significantly influence the ridership of metro stations during protest days. In addition, the mixed regressive spatial autoregressive model has higher explanatory power than the ordinary least square model, suggesting the need for a spatial lag and error specification. The results could also have significant implications for policy and planning for operating metro services and managing metro stations before, during, and after social shocks.

AB  - Throughout history, humans living in the coastal area constantly adapt to the natural environment and create a changing environment. The rapid coastal development occurred in the mid-19th century and peaks in the mid-20th century, which was a common process in most industrialized areas. With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal lowlands are unprecedently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea level rise, increasing extreme storm events, and coastal flooding. Under the influence of urban revitalization and conservation, the landward shoreline movement accelerated and coastal land shrank, accompanied by community retreat. This research focuses on the importance of incorporating an understanding of the changing coastal land-ocean interaction into adaptive management strategies by illustrating the relationship of land use change, social-economic development, and climate change. Typical coastal changes in Connecticut were selected: New Haven Harbor reflects a dramatic seaward land accretion under industrial and transportation development, New London downtown waterfront reveals a trend of building retreat under industrial and commercial transformation and coastal hazard, New London Ocean Beach indicates how overdeveloped coastal low-lying community fully retreat after a natural disaster, and Jordan Cove barrier island shows a highly dynamic coastal land change and proactive management strategy. The results reveal that to cope with a constantly changing shoreline and the challenges of climate change, a resilient management process must incorporate a cycle of learning, experimenting, and creating with the goal of developing new solutions that are able to deal with our ever-changing environment.

AB  - The exploitation of underground coal resources has stepped up local economic and social development significantly. However, it was inevitable that time-dependent surface settlement would occur above the mined-out voids. Subsidence associated with local geo-mining can last from several months to scores of years and can seriously impact infrastructure, city planning, and underground space utilization. This paper addresses the problems in predicting progressive residual surface subsidence. The subsidence process was divided into three phases: a duration period, a residual subsidence period, and a long-term subsidence period. Then, a novel mathematical model calculating surface progressive residual subsidence was proposed based on the logistic time function. After the duration period, the residual subsidence period was extrapolated according to the threshold of the surface sinking rate. The validation for the proposed model was estimated in light of observed in situ data. The results demonstrate that the logistic time function is an ideal time function reflecting surface subsidence features from downward movement, subsidence rate, and sinking acceleration. The surface residual subsidence coefficient, which plays a crucial role in calculating surface settling, varies directly with model parameters and inversely with time. The influence of the amount of in situ data on predicted values is pronounced. Observation time for surface subsidence must extend beyond the active period. Thus back-calculated parameters with in situ measurement data can be reliable. Conversely, the deviation between predictive values and field-based ones is significant. The conclusions in this study can guide the project design of surface subsidence measurement resulting from longwall coal operation. The study affords insights valuable to land reutilization, city planning, and stabilization estimation of foundation above an abandoned workface.

AB  - The residential energy consumption in China shows diversity and complexity in space. This paper aims to investigate the spatial pattern and evolution trends of four kinds of residential energy consumption (electricity, coal, oil, and natural gas) through gravity center modeling and standard deviational ellipse modeling. Further, their relations to economic growth are probed by using the coupling and coordination degree model. Panel data at the provincial level in China are collected from 2000 to 2019. Our results show that the most drastic movement trend of gravity centers is coal, natural gas, followed by oil, whereas electricity moved slightly in space. Further, the standard deviational ellipse of electricity exhibits relatively stable patterns than the other three residential energy consumption during the study period. In addition, the coupling coordination degree between residential energy consumption and the economic growth is examined, and the results indicate that the total residential electricity consumption shows the highest coupling coordination degree, followed by residential gas, oil, and coal. It demonstrates lower coupling coordination degrees in rural areas than in urban areas in the total and sectoral residential energy consumption. In sum, several policy implications can be demonstrated based on our findings, i.e., the development of electricity consumption in the residential energy structure may improve the energy stability in space in China, and ensuring access to electricity should be taken into further consideration in the development of residential energy improvement to achieve a better coordination level to economic development.

AB  - The majority of accidents observed at signalized intersections comprise rear-end collisions resulting from a diversity of actions happening during signal change. This study explores the spatial and temporal variation of rear-end conflict in non-lane-based multi-class traffic conditions. Precise positions of the vehicles extracted from traffic video data collected from two major cities in India are utilized to identify critical vehicle interactions. Multiple surrogate safety measures (time to collision and deceleration rate to avoid crash) are used to identify the rear-end conflicts. More than 9,000 vehicle trajectories extracted from four signalized intersections were used to develop heat maps showing space-time variation of rear-end conflict at varying threshold values. Results showed that the majority of rear-end conflicts happened at the beginning of red time and green time at the upstream side of signalized intersections. Separate heat maps were developed to explore the variation in rear-end conflict caused by different vehicle types and lateral movement of vehicles. In addition, this study develops conflict-based safety models to investigate how changes in traffic parameters including traffic volume, vehicle speed, platoon ratio, queue length, and signal control affect the conflict hotspot (most intense conflict location) at the signalized intersections. The results showed that the higher the vehicle speed and queue length the greater the shift of the conflict hotspot away from the stop line in the upstream direction. The developed models can give insight into how changes in the traffic parameters and the signal cycle time affect the safety of signalized intersections.

AB  - Turning to archival materials continues the Russian archivists' tradition, developed in the recent decades, to introduce into scientific use documents of key importance for understanding the Soviet history and its episodes, including those related to socially significant activities of voluntary activists in the field of healthcare under the auspices of the Union of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the USSR. The chronological frameworks of the undertaken research is 1920-70s. The author aims to review documentary sources that reflect the activities of the Society's activists acting on voluntary and gratuitous basis. The work actualizes the problem of evolution of the sectorial sphere of volunteer labor application from historical point of view. In its activities during the studied period, the Society used traditional organizational forms and sought out new ones for social mobilization of the population's participation in gratuitous donor movement and its promotion, sanitary improvement of cities and villages, improvement and popularization of sanitary culture at work and home, public sanitary control, preventive measures and combating the spread of infectious diseases, etc. The empirical base of the study is formed by materials from the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the Central State Archive of Moscow. The body of sources on the subject analyzed by the author is distinguished by its diversity (minutes of meetings of the executive committee plenums, operational meetings, transcripts, certificates, annual reports on core activities, etc.); it permits to highlight the diverse activities, forms and methods of the Society's activists' work, as well as to trace the process of institutionalization of the profile direction in the national volunteer movement in the field of healthcare. The author has introduced unique archival documents into scientific use. The methodological basis of the work is principle of historicism, systematic nature of scientific analysis, objectivity, integrated use of a wide range of sources, which has made it possible to consider the volunteer practices of socially significant activity in the healthcare system in the process of its formation and development, in the context of historical conditionality and continuity of its development. The article takes on particular importance in connection with systematic development and popularization of medical volunteering in modern Russia, which takes into account the rich historical experience and heritage of the USSR.

AB  - Transportation facilities in the classical migration model expand the scale of population movement by reducing the physical distance and costs of travel between regions. This study empirically analyzes the effect of population inflow into a region near a highway construction using a migration model. The purpose was to examine whether large-scale transportation infrastructure such as highways contributes to the growth and balanced development of the connected regions. Four metropolitan transport-type and commuter transport-type highway routes constructed in South Korea after 2000 were used as study subjects. The results show that population inflow occurred in the region where commuter transport-type highways were constructed. However, no effect was observed in regions where metropolitan transport-type highways were constructed. The reason for these unique results is that factors affecting migration include not only transit facilities, but also parameters such as economic factors, housing, and amenities. Moreover, the findings show that the impact of population inflow is affected by the geographical characteristics of the highway construction areas and city size.

Design/methodology/approach In this study, a case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through secondary data collection that is literature survey and through empirical data collection by conducting face to face interviews and survey of key stakeholders, citizens, and government authorities, and in some cases supplemented by on site photography. The data collected from the field was analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The questionnaires were coded for scientific analysis of data. The information was presented in a structured way that permits for in-depth analysis of the data. Findings In this study, many paradoxes were noted defying common sense, but nonetheless, they require a solution. It has been concluded that, while efforts to improve settlements and anticipate future ones are becoming more common, the desire for eradication persists in many towns in Botswana. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this study is that it was done during the period of COVID-19 induced movement restrictions. As a result, the preferred face to face interviews with key informants were not possible. Practical implications This research informed policy on low-income housing in Botswana. The Government of Botswana can use the findings of this study to formulate policies which help in alleviating challenges currently faced in practice when implementing low-income housing projects. The concept of low-income housing has been adopted by many developing countries including in Africa. As such, results of this study can also be applicable in other developing countries where they can be used as a starting point for evaluating the success of policies and the practice of low-income housing. Originality/value This work made original contribution to knowledge by putting the plight of housing the urban poor in Botswana will in perspective.

AB  - Context. Many threatened species persist in modified landscapes. Species in these landscapes often inhabit vegetation strips adjacent to linear structures such as roads, railways and artificial waterways. These vegetation strips may act as refugia or provide resources, but the associated structures (e.g. roads) may also act as barriers to movement. The southern brown bandicoot (eastern subspecies) is listed as Endangered in Australia and is known to inhabit modified landscapes. Aim. We aim to determine the extent of occupancy of southern brown bandicoots and the relative importance of different habitat types. Our data are intended to provide a baseline for future monitoring of changes to bandicoot populations, and to further our understanding of the relative importance of different habitat types for management and conservation. Methods. We conducted a remote-camera survey of southern brown bandicoots, at 98 locations across a 60 000 ha region south-east of Melbourne. Bandicoots in this area inhabit patches of remnant habitat in reserves and remnant, modified or non-native vegetation strips along roadsides and artificial waterways created in the 19th century to drain swampland. These habitat fragments sit within a matrix of agricultural, residential and commercial land. Key results. Our results suggest that bandicoot occupancy is higher along artificial waterways (0.76) than along roadsides (0.35) or within reserves (0.39). Implications. Habitat along waterways is often different from remnants, with a mix of weedy and native vegetation. The implication of this is a potential conflict between habitat and vegetation management for bandicoots, weed control and maintenance of drains and associated levees.

AB  - Invasive alien species may cause substantial changes and damaging impacts. Here, we document the current distribution and ecological interactions with native biota of relatively recently introduced wasps, Vespula vulgaris and V. germanica, in the southern part of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (CHBR) in southern Chile. We conducted field studies in four different habitats on Navarino Island: evergreen, deciduous and mixed forests, and shrublands. The spread of V. vulgaris throughout the island has led to it occupying suitable habitats in both urban and rural settings, while V. germanica has not been observed in the last 2 years. The presence of V. vulgaris in remote areas of the CHBR is likely the result of human-mediated movement through the channels within the reserve. The composition of foraged items was different in each of the four studied habitats, yet strongly linked to the resources of each, indicating the inherent ability of V. vulgaris to exploit available resources efficiently. V. vulgaris mainly forages berries from shrubs, and preys on a variety of arthropods, particularly hoverflies, craneflies and lepidoptera larvae. The lack of natural competitors and availability of multiple resources has allowed V. vulgaris to rapidly become a common pest in urban and rural settings in the southern extremity of South America. While we consider that eradication would now be impossible, population control at local scales may still be possible with proper planning and long-term management. Our data provide a baseline for management planning, and we strongly recommend social engagement and dialog with relevant governmental institutions to achieve this challenging task.

AB  - PurposeThis paper extends the authors' previous research work investigating resilience for municipal infrastructure from an asset management perspective. Therefore, this paper aims to formulate a pavement resilience index while incorporating asset management and the associated resilience indicators from the authors' previous research work. Design/methodology/approachThis paper introduces a set of holistic-based key indicators that reflect municipal infrastructure resiliency. Thenceforth, the indicators were integrated using the weighted sum mean method to form the proposed resilience index. Resilience indicators weights were determined using principal components analysis (PCA) via IBM SPSS (R). The developed framework for the PCA was built based on an optimization model output to generate the required weights for the desired resilience index. The output optimization data were adjusted using the standardization method before performing PCA. FindingsThis paper offers a mathematical approach to generating a resilience index for municipal infrastructure. The statistical tests conducted throughout the study showed a high significance level. Therefore, using PCA was proper for the resilience indicators data. The proposed framework is beneficial for asset management experts, where introducing the proposed index will provide ease of use to decision-makers regarding pavement network maintenance planning. Research limitations/implicationsThe resilience indicators used need to be updated beyond what is mentioned in this paper to include asset redundancy and structural asset capacity. Using clustering as a validation tool is an excellent opportunity for other researchers to examine the resilience index for each pavement corridor individually pertaining to the resulting clusters. Originality/valueThis paper provides a unique example of integrating resilience and asset management concepts and serves as a vital step toward a comprehensive integration approach between the two concepts. The used PCA framework offers dynamic resilience indicators weights and, therefore, a dynamic resilience index. Resiliency is a dynamic feature for infrastructure systems. It differs during their life cycle with the change in maintenance and rehabilitation plans, systems retrofit and the occurring disruptive events throughout their life cycle. Therefore, the PCA technique was the preferred method used where it is data-based oriented and eliminates the subjectivity while driving indicators weights.

AB  - Development activities associated with urbanization can directly displace animals, causing high mortality and dispersal rates. Wildlife managers have attempted to mitigate the impacts of development on burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), a species susceptible to ground-disturbing activities, by translocating them away from areas slated for development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of translocation on burrowing owl reproduction by comparing nest survival and productivity of owls involved in an ongoing translocation program in Arizona, USA, with that of resident owls. We used nest survival models to evaluate differences in nest survival and generalized linear models with Poisson error to assess differences in productivity. In 2017, cumulative nest survival (CNS) was lower among current-year translocated owls (i.e., owls translocated within the last year; CNS = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.51) compared to non-translocated resident owls (0.83, 95% CI = 0.71, 0.94), but CNS was similar between previously translocated owls (i.e., those translocated >1 yr ago, CNS = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64, 0.98) and residents. Likewise, in 2018, CNS was lower for current-year translocated owls (CNS = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.24) compared to residents (CNS = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.87) and previously translocated owls (CNS = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.90). Productivity was significantly lower for current-year translocated owls ( x <overline> = 0.5 fledglings/nest) compared to residents ( x <overline> = 2.4 fledglings/nest) and previously translocated owls ( x <overline> = 1.5 fledglings/nest) across sites and years. With the current methods of translocation, owls had poor reproductive success in the first year after release, but if they survived 2 years after release, they had similar nest survival and productivity compared to residents. Our results demonstrate that the current practice of releasing translocated burrowing owls in the Phoenix, Arizona area during the breeding season depresses reproduction and should be substantially changed. Nest survival was low and this was mainly attributed to nest establishment of translocated owls within release tents (acclimation structures used in translocations that involve soft release) where 85% of nests failed following tent removal. Translocation approaches that reflect a closer fit to the timing and behavior of the species should be tested to determine whether they result in better success. In particular, future studies should examine the translocation results of releasing owls as male-female pairs or single birds during the nonbreeding period.

AB  - Accurate identification of land use conflicts is an important prerequisite for the rational allocation of land resources and optimizing the production-living-ecological space pattern. Previous studies used suitability assessment and landscape pattern indices to identify land use conflicts. However, research on land use conflict identification from the perspective of ecological security is insufficient and not conducive to regional ecological, environmental protection, and sustainable development. Based on ecological security, this study takes Shandong Province as an example and comprehensively evaluates the importance of ecosystem service function and environmental sensitivity. It identifies the ecological source, and extracts ecological corridors with a minimum cumulative resistance model from which ecological security patterns are constructed. It identifies land use conflicts through spatial overlay analysis of arable land and construction land. The results show that: (1) Shandong Province has formed an ecological security pattern of "two ecological barriers, two belts, and eight cores" with an area of 15,987 km(2). (2) The level of arable land-ecological space conflict is low, at 39.76%. The proportions of serious and moderate conflicts are 13.44% and 26.97%, respectively, distributed primarily on the Jiaodong Peninsula and the low hill areas of Ludong. (3) Construction land-ecological space conflict is reasonably stable and controllable, at 76.39%, occurring mainly around urban construction land, with serious and moderate conflict concentrated in the eastern coastal areas, mainly between rural settlements and ecologically safe space in the region. This study has important theoretical and practical reference values for identifying land use conflicts, protecting regional ecological security, and optimizing land use patterns.

AB  - This study investigates the thermal modeling of heaters at the city gate stations (CGS) in Iran with a focus on efficient heat transfer and fuel consumption. Gas heaters are basic equipment with applications in various industries, especially CGS sites. Research on gas heaters and their optimal and efficient performance has been a challenging subject in the engineering world. This study aimed to change the heaters' thermal functionality from free to forced convection and examine the effect of such alteration on the heaters' efficiency while reducing their energy consumption. To make forced convection in the heater, a pump is required to be installed on it. This pump causes fluid circulation inside the heater and by creating movement in the fluid, it increases the heat transfer coefficient and changes the heat transfer mechanism of the system from free con-vection to forced convection. Using the first law of thermodynamics, the net energy these heaters emit into the environment consists of multiple components. These include the energy expended as follows: in the chimney, to warm up the gas, and the part dissipated away from the heater's body. The heat transfer coefficient is determined after calculating the energy loss for each of the components. Changes in the required energy for the total heat transfer coefficient for both free and forced convection may be analyzed. The results of this research indicate that forced con-vection heat transfer causes more heat loss from the heater's body than that transferred to the gas stream in the heater coils. This energy transfer ultimately reduces the heater's efficiency con-cerning the net generated heat. Thus, a reduction in the efficiency occurs and the initial efficiency (32%) of the free convection declines to a lower coefficient value for the forced convection.

AB  - A seismic network of ten three-component broadband seismographs was deployed in and around Hyderabad city during September-October 2020, which enabled us to record a rare lower-crustal cratonic earthquake of M-w 3.9 that occurred on 25 July 2021 (23:31:01.1) at 35 km depth below the region about 140 km south of Hyderabad city. Utilizing broadband waveforms from this network, we model source parameters and moment tensor solution of this rare event using simultaneous inversion of S-wave spectra and ISOLA software, respectively. The average corner frequency, seismic moment, moment magnitude, stress drop, and source radius are 3.87 Hz, 7.14E + 14 N-m, 3.8, 3.92 MPa, and 229 m, respectively. The modelled mean crustal Q varies from 506 (at VKB) to 4136 (at NLG), with an average of 2182 +/- 1178, suggesting lower crustal attenuation below the Hyderabad region. We perform a deviatoric moment tensor inversion of multiple point sources on the band-passed (0.04-0.1 Hz) displacement traces of the Hyderabad event. The best fit is obtained at 35 km centroid depth, with a moment magnitude of 3.9, and a normal dip-slip mechanism with a minor strike-slip component with strike of 169 degrees, dip of 65 degrees, and rake of -113 degrees. The P-axis orients N42 degrees E, which is parallel to the direction of the absolute plate motion direction of the Indian Plate, while the T-axis orients E-W. The occurrence of this earthquake could be attributed to the sudden movement on the almost-vertical plane in the viscous lower crust due to high fluid pore pressure resulting from the presence of CO2-rich mantle fluids.

AB  - Artificial lighting at nights (ALAN) affects behaviour in many animals, especially nocturnal species. However, its effect on frugivorous bats remains less explored, especially in the family Pteropodidae. Since they rely predominantly on vision and light-based cues, ALAN at roost sites could have consequences on their behaviour, activity, and the ecosystem services they provide. In a semi-urban site in southern India, we compared the emergence-return activity of the cave-roosting Rousettus leschenaultii, between a roost in an undisturbed, naturally-lit agricultural well and an artificially-lit roost in a temple. We also compared emergence times between five colonies of the tree-roosting Pteropus giganteus (currently P. medius) that were exposed to different intensities of artificial light. Emergence-return flights at the naturally-lit R. leschenaultii roost occurred significantly earlier than at the artificially-lit roost. Peak flight activity across nights varied more in the naturally-lit than at the artificially-lit roost. Nightly flight durations (interval between peak emergence and peak return times) varied more in the naturally-lit roost, while mean flight durations were similar between these roosts. In P. giganteus, emergence was significantly earlier in the highly light-polluted roost than in the other roosts. These modified flight activities could have potential consequences on the physiology and ecology of fruit bats and requires further study. Moreover, the effect of ALAN on seed dispersal and pollination services provided by fruit bats in tropical landscapes remains to be understood.

AB  - Peberholm is a constructed Danish island in the oresund strait. It was primarily constructed by calcareous clay from the sea floor, and is traversed by a highway and a railway. Being constructed from material without a seed bank, Peberholm constituted a good opportunity to study primary succession in an anthropogenic context. In this study, data from a survey of the vascular plant community of Peberholm was studied. The data span over a 22 year-period, between 1999 and 2020. The development of the flora was analysed with regards to indicators for environmental factors and vegetation types, as well as occurrence of alien species or species of conservation concern. Peberholm experienced a rapid succession during its first five years. The effects of the initial ground disturbance quickly wore off, resulting in a relative decline in plant communities associated with ruderal land. These highly anthropogenic habitats were replaced with grasslands. The shrubification also began early on. The rapid initial changes were then replaced with a much slower but also more continuous change, resulting in the development of both more natural grasslands and an increased shrubification. Although several rare or threatened species colonized Peberholm from the beginning, the conservation value of the flora on a whole increased during the succession process of forming more natural vegetation types. The succession process demonstrated at Peberholm has more in common with the succession at urban soils than with naturally occurring primary succession.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes may occur due to natural and anthropogenic activities. The present study area is situated in the Himalayan foothill region of north-eastern India and covers around 1507 km2. This area comprises Siliguri Municipal Corporation (SMC) and the surrounding five community development blocks. Geopolitical location of the study area makes it significant as it is exposed to the negative impacts of human and commercial activities across the region. The present study aims to identify the LULC classes in the study area from 1991 to 2021 with their change dynamics and predict the LULC changes in 2050. Apart from these, a perception study is also carried out to identify the major drivers of LULC changes in the study area. After delineating the study area, supervised classification of Landsat satellite images was done applying the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) tool for the year 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2021. Each image was classified into six LULC classes i.e., vegetation, plantation, agricultural land, built up, water bodies and fallow land and the overall accuracy (average) of the classified maps is 88.83%. The result shows that vegetation, agricultural land and fallow land are decreased from 23% to 20%, 35%-28% and 23%-19% respectively and plantation and built up areas are significantly increased from 14% to 24% and 2%-8% respectively. Then the land change modeler (LCM) under multi layer perceptron neural network Markov Chain (MLPNN-MC) model was applied to predict the spatio-temporal LULC changes from 2021 to 2050. The result reveals that in 2050 built up areas will be increased significantly and are expected to cover almost 12% of the total study area and only 24% of agricultural land will be left. The model was validated by Pearson's chi-squared test and found no significant distinguishes between simulated and actual classified maps. For identifying the main drivers of the LULC changes in the study area people's perceptions were taken from 25 focus group discussions (FGD) randomly over the area. The result reveals that physical and economic location, immigration, development of transport network, increasing multi-functional land use, expansion of small trade and enterprises, and cutting of trees for fuel wood and construction purposes are the key drivers of LULC change for this particular region. The change in the land surface in this Sub-Himalayan region is threatened by unplanned urbanization and unorganized land use practices so, crucial measures are needed indeed.

AB  - The northern Red Sea in eastern Egypt is one of the world's newest marine basins. The northern Red Sea is a very active seismic region and poses a significant hazard to the nearest cities on the Red Sea coast. On June 16, 2020, a moderate earthquake (M-L = 5.4), as published by the Egyptian National Seismic Network (ENSN), occurred in the northern Red Sea followed by several aftershocks, ranging in magnitude from 2.0 to 3.4. The best-fitting doublecouple movement obtained using the full waveform moment tensor inversion of the main earthquake indicated strike-slip movement, with a minor normal component. The two nodal main shock planes were oriented NNE-SSW and ESE-WNW, respectively. The aftershocks sequences distribution did not coincide with the 16 Jun, 2020 main earthquake, neither in map view nor with respect to depth which may pointed to a secondary fault plane activation and stress triggered by the mainshock. The aftershocks clustered at the north western side of the main earthquakes and extend in the north western direction, which supported that the ESE-WNW plane is the fault plane. The spectral parameters of the S-wave displacement spectra of the main earthquake and its significant aftershock sequences were determined using the spectral inversion method and Brune's w 2 modulation. The obtained spectra are flat in the frequency range from 0.8 Hz to each corner frequency, and they decreased rapidly at frequencies of < 10 Hz. The calculated seismic moment, moment magnitude, corner frequency, source radius, and stress drop vary from 8.293E+18 to 7.541 E+22 dyn.cm, 2.4 to 5.0, 2.2 to 8.2 Hz, 171 to 633 m, and 0.02 to 13 MPa, respectively. The moment magnitude is equal to or slightly higher than the local magnitude reported by ENSN. The calculated stress drops for the earthquakes increased with increasing earthquake size.

AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient loading has led to declines in the function and productivity of some tropical coastal ecosystems. We use the seagrass Thalassia testudinum as a sentinel for tracing nutrient inputs and movements in Ambergris Caye Lagoon, Belize, a region heavily dependent on ecotourism and in the process of expanding its network of marine protected areas. Seagrass samples were collected at stations distributed along a 24-km section of the lagoon, with stations bracketing the urban center of San Pedro. Leaf tissue carbon/nitrogen (C:N) stoichiometry, stable isotope composition (delta C-13, delta N-15), and epiphyte load (mg cm(-2)) were analyzed relative to spatial location and proximate land use conditions. Seagrass tissues showed a modal pattern in delta N-15 composition along the north-south axis of the lagoon, with maximum average values (1.5 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand [SD]), occurring adjacent to or slightly down-current of the most urbanized areas of San Pedro (range = -3.0-3.7 parts per thousand). Offshore seagrasses were enriched in delta C-13 relative to inshore areas, but there was no consistent relationship with adjacent land use. Tissue C:N and epiphyte load (mg cm(-2)) decreased monotonically from south to north, declining from average values of 25.3 to 19.2 (C:N) and from 4.2 to 0.8 mg cm(-2) (epiphyte load). Impervious surface cover adjacent to lagoon sites was positively related to delta N-15 values (parameter estimate +/- SE = 0.80 +/- 0.36) but negatively related to tissue C:N (-2.78 +/- 0.65) and epiphyte load (-1.04 +/- 0.33). Isoscapes of spatially interpolated isotope values highlighted the location and potential sources of nutrient input to the lagoon, some of which occurred within marine protected areas. These results support the application of seagrass tissue stable isotope composition analysis as a low-cost and time-integrated means of tracing nutrient inputs in some naturally oligotrophic ecosystems. Spatially explicit information on nutrient inputs is vital for natural resource managers and land-use planners to identify, mitigate, and control sources of anthropogenic eutrophication in tropical coastal ecosystems such as Ambergris Caye Lagoon.

AB  - The role of Jewish activism in the transformative changes that have occurred in the West in recent decades continues to be controversial. Here I respond to several issues putatively related to Jewish influence, particularly the "default hypothesis" that Jewish IQ and urban residency explain Jewish influence and the role of the Jewish community in enacting the 1965 immigration law in the United States; other issues include Jewish ethnocentrism and intermarriage and whether diaspora Jews are hypocritical in their attitudes on immigration to Israel versus the United States. The post-World War II era saw the emergence of a new, substantially Jewish elite in America that exerted influence on a wide range of issues that formed a virtual consensus among Jewish activists and the organized Jewish community, including immigration, civil rights, and the secularization of American culture. Jewish activism in the pro-immigration movement involved: intellectual movements denying the importance of race in human affairs; establishing, staffing, and funding anti-restrictionist organizations; recruiting prominent non-Jews to anti-restrictionist organizations; rejecting the ethnic status quo as a goal because of fear of a relatively homogeneous white majority; leadership in Congress and the executive branch.

TI  - The Impact of Refugees in Neutral Hong Kong and Macau, 1937-1945
T2  - HISTORICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - WAR
AB  - This article investigates the complex entanglement of neutrality and displacement in Hong Kong and Macau with a focus on the impact of and responses to an unprecedented influx of refugees during the Second World War. Displaced persons were of central importance in shaping the ambiguous experience of neutrality before Hong Kong's occupation by Japan in late 1941 and until the end of the war in Macau. Building on Elizabeth Sinn's conceptualization of Hong Kong as an 'in-between place', this article considers these two foreign-ruled territories as 'in-between places' where multi-layered transborder flows developed in an 'in-between time' of neutrality. Highlighting similarities and connections between Hong Kong and Macau, it argues that neutrality was shaped by the movement of refugees and that refugees often experienced neutrality differently depending on perceptions of race, class, and nationality. The presence of diverse communities of refugees shaped multiple dimensions of urban life, with colonial concerns for spatial order and social control co-existing with humanitarian co-operation. The discourses and practices around refugees are an important precedent to understanding post-war refugeedom in these territories.

AB  - Road intersections play an important role in the operation of an urban road transportation system. However, channelized segment (C-segment) spillovers frequently occur during peak hours, making the vehicle queue on a lane spatially and temporally interact with the queue on another lane. Intersection traffic efficiency is thus largely degraded. Unfortunately, most of the existing models cannot capture the spatial-temporal queue interactions and thus are incapable of developing efficient intersection optimization plans. To fill this gap, the paper proposes a highly efficient approach traffic flow model to capture C-segment spillovers. An optimization problem that takes C-segment spillovers into account is formulated as a nonlinear programming model, and it is solved by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed model and solution are tested in several scenarios with various intersection settings, and the effectiveness of the proposed models is demonstrated. This study is beneficial to understanding C-segment spillovers and the models can be applied to improve traffic efficiency at recurrently-congested intersections.

AB  - Urban metro systems are often affected by disruptions such as infrastructure malfunctions, rolling stock breakdowns and accidents. The crucial prerequisite of any disruption analytics is to have accurate information about the location, occurrence time, duration and propagation of disrup-tions. To pursue this goal, we detect the abnormal deviations in trains' headway relative to their regular services by using Gaussian mixture models. Our method is a unique contribution in the sense that it proposes a novel, probabilistic, unsupervised clustering framework and it can effectively detect any type of service interruptions, including minor delays of just a few minutes. In contrast to traditional manual inspections and other detection methods based on social media data or smart card data, which suffer from human errors, limited monitoring coverage, and po-tential bias, our approach uses information on train trajectories derived from automated vehicle location (train movement) data. As an important research output, this paper delivers innovative analyses of the propagation progress of disruptions along metro lines, which enables us to distinguish primary and secondary disruptions as well as effective recovery interventions per-formed by operators.

TI  - The UK landscape evaluation movement (1965-85)
T2  - RURAL HISTORY-ECONOMY SOCIETY CULTURE
LA  - English
AB  - Tracing developments in British town and country planning during the 1960s and 1970s, this article describes the sudden upsurge of landscape evaluation method-development among landscape architects and planners, and the disputes that made such efforts come to an end in the late 1970s. In this burst of activity, here referred to as the UK landscape evaluation movement, we can observe competing definitions of visual amenity and landscape quality take form. It is described how practitioners invented or adopted numerical measurement and preference methods as means to gain a supposedly unbiased understanding of how different landscape areas are valued by communities. Struggling to make themselves heard in a planning sector that was dominated by more powerful stakeholders and quantitative approaches (for example, cost-benefit analysis), in the landscape evaluation movement we can also witness how pioneering practitioners adopt advanced statistical techniques and computer mapping to communicate qualitative values of landscape more effectively to each other, communities and decision-makers. These were deliberate attempts by the practitioners to occupy a more active and influential role in landscape and country planning during the period. As this article shows, their success in this regard was limited due to the lack of general agreement with respect to the reliability, validity and generalisability of both assessment methods and produced findings.

AB  - Archaeologists working in the Late Formative Lake Titicaca Basin have identified several "transit communities"-villages that benefited from long-distance exchange. Some scholars suggest that such places played a key role in the development of the Middle Horizon city of Tiwanaku. In this article, we explore the movement of plant goods into transit communities during both the Late Formative (300 BC-AD 500) and Middle Horizon (AD 600-1100) periods. After presenting the current understanding of transit communities, we summarize previous work on both local plants, including tubers and quinoa, and the presence of maize. We then report on a recent microbotanical study of ceramics recovered from excavations at Late Formative Challapata (in the eastern basin) and a burial from the Middle Horizon occupation at Chiripa (in the southern basin). For the first time we identify lowland tubers in the Lake Titicaca Basin, including yuca, sweet potato, and arrowroot. These findings reveal the critical importance of microbotanical analyses for tracing regional connections and foodways in emergent Middle Horizon worlds, as well as the need for more complex interpretive models for things/plants-in-motion.

AB  - Understanding the impact and dynamics of invasive alien species (IAS) is essential for tailoring appropriate management plans. This information can be difficult to obtain in the short term, and intrinsic difficulties of monitoring hard-to-reach areas may hamper prompt estimation of IAS distributions. Using the case of the invasive Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) in Madagascar, we show how public surveys coupled with a multi-analytical approach can promptly provide accurate information on invasion dynamics and impacts. On the basis of key-informant responses, we built polynomial regressions to investigate the spatiotemporal invasion patterns, false-positive occupancy models to estimate species occupancy, and mixed-effect models to evaluate the public perception and attitudes. The invasion followed a linear expansion of approx. 2 km year(-1), with human-mediated dispersal facilitating the spread of the species. Toad occupancy decreased towards the invasion front and increased in the southern portion of its range. Negative perception decreased in urban areas, where people were less concerned by toad impacts on ecosystems, and in recently invaded localities, suggesting density- or time-dependent effects. We also identified 12 potential impacts, with "loss of domestic apiaries", "poisoning of poultry" and "decline of snakes" standing out for prevalence and potential severity. Our results bring important insights into the invasion dynamics and the human-toad interactions in Madagascar, highlighting the versatility of public surveys to obtain essential information for invasion science and management, which can be especially useful in hard-to-monitor regions of the world with a low in-country capacity to counter invasive species.

AB  - Participants in the coastal socio-economy of the Mediterranean Sea, such as industries, aquaculture, urban populations, conglomerates, and tourists, create intense anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems (such as the release of trace metals). This raises concerns about their impact on the surrounding environment and on marine organisms, including those collected for human consumption. This study introduces the possibility of using Patella caerulea (Linnaeus 1758), indigenous to the Mediterranean Sea, as a biosentinel of marine pollution. This study proposes coupling environmental (bioaccumulation) and toxicological (redox homeostasis) measures of bioavailability with genetic variability (COI mtDNA) assessments. Concentrations of six trace metals (cadmium, copper, iron, lead, nickel, and zinc) were measured in surface seawater and in P. caerulea individuals collected from four coastal stations on the Tunisian coast where different levels of metal contamination have occurred. The quantified biomarkers involved the determination of antioxidant defense enzymes, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the measurement of lipid peroxidation indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Our study identified critical levels of metal contamination among locations in the Gulf of Gabes. Concomitantly, the induction of antioxidant biomarkers (especially SOD and GPX) was observed, highlighting the potential of P. caerulea to acclimate to stressful pollution conditions. Molecular analysis of COI (mtDNA) revealed low discrimination between the four P. caerulea populations, highlighting the role of marine currents in the Mediterranean Sea in the dispersal and passive transportation of limpet larvae, allowing an exchange of individuals among physically separated, P. caerulea populations.

AB  - The spatialities of anti-imperialist praxis are increasingly fraught with innumerable challenges that require complex epistemological considerations. As borderless US-based militarisation regimes proliferate globally at an unprecedented pace, embedding their political-territorial control more securely through state and logics of neo-imperial extractive capitalism, they have prevailed through the strategic discourse of "progress, security and freedom". This paper explores the geopolitical workings of Caimanera, the town closest to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (GTMO), as a counter-hegemonic project to US imperialism. Referred to as the First Anti-Imperialist Trench in Cuba-a territory lying within the shadow of one of the world's most notorious prisons and oldest military bases-Caimanera's history is fraught with tension since the base was first established by the US in 1903. Since the triumph of the 1959 revolution, the base continues to be held against the will of the Cuban people and is strongly denounced as an illegal occupation. Based on archival material, landscape analysis, and visits to Caimanera in 2015, 2017 and 2019, this paper explores how the anti-imperialist geopolitical suburb has historically evolved through the territoriality of its governance and actions. This anti-imperiaist geopolitical suburb is explored as a conceptual form and mode of praxis drawing insights from Fidel Castro's theorisation of the "Battle of Ideas", whereby the production of oppositional space in response to imperial threats and aggression is tackled through complexities of the city-building process and the cultural ideological resistance of its closely interwoven educational landscape. The anti-imperialist geopolitical suburb as a space of subaltern geopolitics creatively attends to the complex task of sovereignty and boldly promulgates a movement towards peace and solidarity in the larger transnational region.

AB  - The last two decades have seen an incessant growth in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with HD cameras for developing aerial vision-based systems to support civilian and military tasks, including land monitoring, change detection, and object classification. To perform most of these tasks, the artificial intelligence algorithms usually need to know, a priori, what to look for, identify. or recognize. Actually, in most operational scenarios, such as war zones or post-disaster situations, areas and objects of interest are not decidable a priori since their shape and visual features may have been altered by events or even intentionally disguised (e.g., improvised explosive devices (IEDs)). For these reasons, in recent years, more and more research groups are investigating the design of original anomaly detection methods, which, in short, are focused on detecting samples that differ from the others in terms of visual appearance and occurrences with respect to a given environment. In this paper, we present a novel two-branch Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method for low-altitude RGB aerial video surveillance to detect and localize anomalies. We have chosen to focus on the low-altitude sequences as we are interested in complex operational scenarios where even a small object or device can represent a reason for danger or attention. The proposed model was tested on the UAV Mosaicking and Change Detection (UMCD) dataset, a one-of-a-kind collection of challenging videos whose sequences were acquired between 6 and 15 m above sea level on three types of ground (i.e., urban, dirt, and countryside). Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in terms of Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), achieving an average of 97.2% and 95.7%, respectively, thus suggesting that the system can be deployed in real-world applications.

AB  - One of the most common tendencies of human settlements is for larger settlements to display higher population densities. Work in urban science and archaeology suggests that this densification pattern reflects an emergent spatial equilibrium where individuals balance movement costs with social interaction benefits, leading to increases in aggregate productivity and social interdependence. The temporary camps created by hunters and gatherers exhibit a tendency to become less dense with their population size. The different manner in which hunter-gatherer groups express their sociality in residential space suggests that they typically lack the social structures and material technologies necessary for humans to live at greater spatial densities in permanent settlements. Here we examine why this difference occurs and consider conditions under which hunter-gatherer groups may transition to sedentism and densification. We investigate the relationship between population and area in hunter-gatherer camps using a data set representing a large cross-cultural sample derived from the ethnographic literature. We present a model based on the interplay between social interactions and scalar stress that describes the observed patterns among mobile hunter-gatherers. We find that the transition to a densification scheme does not necessary involve domestic food production, only surpluses and storable resources.

AB  - Individual hobbies and interests, the ways of spending leisure time develop personal resources influencing health and wellbeing. The literature analysis helped selecting thirteen personal resources that also affect the rate of aging: sports, order, creativity, intellect, handwork, kindness, Humor, spirituality, risk, nature, achievements, optimism, communication. In 1632 people, (840 women and 792 men) personal resources were assessed using a questionnaire developed in-house. Biological age was determined by health indicators. The personal typology was determined by testing functional asymmetry, physique, interaction style, emotionality, profession, marital status, gender, age, and place of residence. The data were processed by correlation and cluster analysis and methods of automatic artificial neural networks (ANN). Personal resources were used as input continuous variables. Personality types were used as input categorical variables. The index of relative biological aging (RBA) was applied as an output continuous variable. We also calculated the correlation between the RBA index and the applied personal resources in different types of personalities. For most female types including investigative occupations, psychomotor emotionality, living in urban areas, asthenic physique, negative correlations were found between most personal resources and the aging index. In men, resources that slow down aging are found only for certain types: enterprising and conventional professions, ambidexter and left-handed, intellectual emotionality, athletic physique. In conclusion, with the help of the trained ANN, we selected personal resources that slow down aging. For women of all types, there are common resources reducing RBA index including nature, intellect, and achievements. For men, ANN was unable to find common resources that slow down aging. However, with an individual selection of resources, a trained neural network gives a favorable forecast of the ability to slow down the biological aging of a particular man by changing his hobbies and interests and ways of spending free time.

AB  - Landslides occurred in 1997 and 2018 in the White Mountain region called Al Maa'ajeen of the City of Nablus, Palestine. Landslides in 1997 caused complete house failure, damages in several neighboring houses and in Nablus-Tulkarm Main Street. Remedy measures were taken including rows of bored cast in-situ reinforced concrete sheet piles, overall drainage of the site and planting the sliding area with special types of trees to stabilize the site. Furthermore, it was suggested to divide the region into three zones regarding slope stability analysis and construction. It was found that the reasons for this sliding were the type of soil that becomes very soft when mixed with water and the deep excavation with neither bracing system nor engineering supervision. Very close to the site other landslides occurred in 2018. The reasons for these landslides are again the type of soil and the deep excavation without a support system. This landslide causes major soil movement in the region and severely damaged in several houses. These damages were caused by the shear forces that contributed as inclined and vertical cracks in the internal and external walls of the buildings. This paper summarized the main reasons for landslides that occurred in 2018 in the White Mountain region and the remedy measures to correct the sliding.

AB  - Civil society organizations (CSOs) are sites for creating and strengthening social ties among participants. Ties are developed when participants in CSO convenings (meetings, events, activities) interact, but convenings vary in the amount of interac- tion they generate. Theory and research suggest that the physical spaces where convenings occur may impact participant interaction. However, previous methods lack sufficient scale to formally test related hypotheses. We introduce a method for collecting data at scale to examine how CSO convening spaces influence social interaction. The method-systematic social observation (SSO)-assembles comparable, quantitative data from many CSO convenings. As part of an exploratory study, we collected data from 99 CSO convenings from three organizations in Indianapolis, Indiana. For illustrative pur- poses, building on theories of spatial propinquity and configuration, we highlight two dimensions of spatial variation in CSO convenings-footprint and permeability-and examine how they relate to three indicators of participant interaction. Our findings suggest that controlling for the number of participants and other convening characteristics, medium-sized spaces foster more interaction than small or large ones. More broadly, this study demonstrates the viability of the SSO method for collecting data at scale and provides a model for future work on space, interaction, and networks.

AB  - Defence engineering infrastructures reduce casualties and economic losses, and alleviate damage, and respond to climate-change exacerbated coastal flooding. This study quantitatively estimated the relative sea level rise (SLR) in the Pearl River Estuary and investigated the potential upper and lower bounds of the maximum inundation depths in Macau City induced by Typhoon Mangkhut (2018). Extreme tidal levels are assumed to be coincident with the pre-landfall hour of Mangkhut during its movement towards the coast. Under both SLR scenarios, inundations caused by astronomical tides indicate a significantly shortened return period of flood events with a rising sea level. The tidal barrier with a crest elevation designed according to Typhoon Hato (2017) can effectively protect the Inner Harbor region from flooding by astronomical tides or Mangkhut-like typhoons occurring at low tides; however this effectiveness is lost under high tides. The results indicate the dominant role of tidal timing at inundation depths, which is also influenced by modulated surge heights owing to nonlinear tide-wave-surge and SLR-surge interactions. In spite of decreased surges affected by SLR around Macau, proper engineering countermeasures should be planned to cope with severe inundation by compounding unfavorable factors.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (Pango lineage 8.1.617.2) variant of concern spread globally, causing resurgences of COVID-19 worldwide(1,2). The emergence of the Delta variant in the UK occurred on the background of a heterogeneous landscape of immunity and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here we analyse 52,992 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from England together with 93,649 genomes from the rest of the world to reconstruct the emergence of Delta and quantify its introduction to and regional dissemination across England in the context of changing travel and social restrictions. Using analysis of human movement, contact tracing and virusgenomic data, we find that the geographic focus of the expansion of Delta shifted from India to a more global pattern in early May 2021. In England, Delta lineages were introduced more than 1,000 times and spread nationally as non-pharmaceutical interventions were relaxed. We find that hotel quarantine for travellers reduced onward transmission from importations; however, the transmission chainsthat later dominated the Delta wave in England were seeded before travel restrictions were introduced. Increasing inter-regional travel within England drove the nationwide dissemination of Delta, with some cities receiving more than 2,000 observable lineage introductions from elsewhere. Subsequently, increased levels of local population mixing-and not the number of importations-were associated with the faster relative spread of Delta. The invasion dynamics of Delta depended on spatial heterogeneity in contact patterns, and our findings will inform optimal spatial interventionsto reduce the transmission of current and future variants of concern, such as Omicron (Pango lineage B.1.1.529).

AB  - During the last 10 years, the Erythrina stem borer moth, Terastia meticulosalis, emerged as a pest of cultivated coral trees (Erythrina spp.) in California. Erythrina trees are valued for their moderate drought resistance and beautiful flame-like flowers. They are beloved enough to be considered Los Angeles's official "City Tree." Thus, they are a valuable horticultural crop and are grown by many nurseries and occur throughout the landscape in coastal southern California. Coral trees have been heavily affected by T. meticulosalis recently. Using whole genome sequencing techniques, we analysed the origins of this and other infestations of Erythrina in coastal areas and found that they have likely originated from the repeated expansions of the native range of the species in Arizona, a process possibly driven by climatic factors and/or movement of plants by humans. We also found sufficient genetic differences between the western population of the moth and the rest of the New World populations to describe a new western subspecies, T. meticulosalis occidentalis Sourakov & Grishin ssp. n. (type locality USA: CA, San Diego Co., La Jolla). These findings are of economic importance for future attempts to control the moth's impact on activities surrounding the horticultural use of Erythrina spp. by the Californian landscape and nursery industries.

AB  - In climbing plants, fruits can be formed at different heights, depending on the height of external support. However, the effect of height on fruit and seed traits in invasive vines of Cucurbitaceae has not been intensively studied so far. In Europe, Echinocystis lobata, a North American member of Cucurbitaceae, is considered one of the most abundant invasive alien plants spreading in natural riparian forests, thickets, and tall herbs, whereas it is a rare species in urban woodlands. In this study, we tested the variability of selected fruit and seed traits of E. lobata in connection with habitat origin (natural, semi-natural, and anthropogenic), habitat type (using the EUNIS habitat classification), height (the distance between the fruit and the ground), and geographical position. The study was conducted in 2018 in 65 sites located in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia. In each study site, a random sample of 10 fresh mature fruits of E. lobata was collected from subsequent 0.50 m intervals of height. The length, the width, and the weight of the fresh fruits, as well as the total number of seeds and number of undeveloped seeds per fruit, were examined. Moreover, the well-developed seeds from selected study sites were weighed. The statistical analysis showed the significant effect of habitat origin, habitat type, and height on most of the studied fruit and seed traits. The largest range of height (from 0.00 to 4.00 m) was observed in two types of habitats (F-heathland, scrub, and tundra; and G-woodland, forest, and other wooded land). The total number of seeds per fruit was positively correlated with the length, width, and weight of the fresh fruits. The fruits were a little heavier and bigger in natural habitats located in the northeast of the study area. The distribution of fruits at different heights may contribute to better dispersal of seeds by animals and wind, and may also better protect the seeds from being eaten by granivorous animals. The defence against seed-eating animals is expected to be stronger in semi-natural habitats, as well as on banks and shores of inland surface waters, where the seed production is the highest. The influence of seed traits on seed germination and seedling survival in various habitats and their importance in the invasiveness of E. lobata require further study.

AB  - The large objects mark the recent landscape of Amazonia and disrupt preexisting lives in the places where they are installed, as happened with the Tucurui hydroelectric enterprise, in the State of Pare, inaugurated in the 1980s. New socio-spatial configurations occurred with the construction of this project, accompanied by expropriation, violence, low compensations and unfulfilled promises, leading to the creation of the Movement of People Affected by the Tucurui dam. Supported by specific bibliography, documentary sources and interviews, the article addresses these transformations. It shows, from the memories of its former residents, the village of Velho Repartimento, where the socio-spatial constructs, the elements of sociability and the labor relations are perceived in one of the places of first home for the affected people, submerged with the construction of the dam on the Tocantins River and the formation of the lake.

We present a framework and prototype software tool for logically reasoning about occupant perception and behaviour in the context of dynamic aspects of buildings in operation, based on qualitative deductive rules. In particular, we focus on the co presence of different user groups and the resulting impact on perceptual and functional affordances of spatial layouts by utilising the concept of spatial artefacts. As a first proof of concept of our approach, we have implemented a prototype crowd analysis software tool in our new system ASP4BIM, developed specifically to support architectural design reasoning in the context of public-facing buildings with complex signage systems and diverse intended user groups. We evaluate our prototype on the Urban Sciences Building at Newcastle University, a large, state-of-the-art living laboratory and multipurpose academic building. Our findings are that the ASP4BIM-based prototype supports a range of novel query services for formally analysing the impacts of crowds on pedestrians that are logically derived through the use of qualitative deductive rules, that complements other powerful crowd analysis approaches such as agent-based simulation.

AB  - Aim Concern about the impacts of biological invasions has generated a great deal of interest in understanding factors that determine invasion success. Most of our current knowledge comes from static approaches that use spatial patterns as a proxy of temporal processes. These approaches assume that species are present in areas where environmental conditions are the most favourable. However, this assumption is problematic when applied to dynamic processes such as species expansions when equilibrium has not been reached. Location Iberian Peninsula. Taxon Birds. Methods In our work, we analyse the roles played by human activities, climatic matching and spatial connectivity on the two main underlying processes shaping the spread of invasive species (i.e. colonization and extinction) using a dynamic modelling approach. We use a large data set that has recorded the occurrence of two invasive bird species-the ring-necked (Psittacula krameri) and the monk (Myiopsitta monachus) parakeets-in the Iberian Peninsula from 1991 to 2016. Results Human activities and climate matching play a role on species range dynamics. Human influence and urbanization were the most relevant factors explaining colonization. Additionally, an effect of climate matching was found. Persistence (the inverse of extinction) was mainly affected by human influence for the monk parakeet and by the extent of urban environments for the ring-necked parakeet. Main conclusions Human activities play a major role not only on colonization of new locations, but also on persistence during range expansion. Additionally, natural processes-notably climate matching-also affect new colonizations. These findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms that might allow alien species to expand their geographic range at new locations and might help to improve our capacity to assess invasion risks and impacts accurately.

AB  - Chemical asphyxiation at petrochemical factories can provoke the unconsciousness or death of factory workers through suffocation. Some chemicals vaporize and mix with air without showing any warning properties that raise the risk of oxygen deficiency. In light of this, Industry 5.0 focuses more on human-centricity than technology-driven implementations to ensure secured and work-friendly environments in industries. Recently, research on factory safety management dependent on the Internet of things (IoT) sensors have been executed unwaveringly. In this work, the ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor is adopted to recognize the motion and breathing pattern of workers in smart factory scenarios. After capturing the data from the UWB sensor in real-time, the proposed dataset is further inspected by the deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) approaches. Twofold detection schemes are considered where the movement and vital patterns are distinguished first by the stacked ensemble (SE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) frameworks. The Bayesian optimized ensemble learning (EL) and bidirectional (Bi-LSTM) models are further occupied to analyze abnormalities in the breathing rate of a worker in the smart shop floors. The investigated outcome shows that the DL frameworks (LSTM and Bi-LSTM) outperformed the others by acquiring 99.90% and 99.94% accuracy in 147 s and 293 s, respectively. The devised perception indicates prominent attainment to the smart factory shop floor, Internet of medical things (IoMT), the smart city paradigm, and e-health appliances.

AB  - People all over the world have needed to adapt to social distancing, movement restrictions, and change in life routines due to Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This study aimed to explore the relationships between time-use, occupational balance, and temporal life satisfaction of university students in Turkey during the social isolation period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted online in May 2020, with 128 university students of a Turkish university with the mean age of 20.27 +/- 1.49 years (Min. 18 - Max. 26 years old) from 37 cities. The measures used were the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ), the Temporal Satisfaction with Life Scale (TSWLS), and a customized question about the time-use of the students in specific occupational domains. The results indicated that individuals with lower occupational balance had less present life satisfaction (p < .001). While the time allocated to study lessons, socialization, and exercise had small positive correlations with OBQ (p <.01), watching TV had a negative correlation with OBQ (p <.05) and with 'present TSWLS' (p <.01). The mean value of 'present TSWLS' (15.45 +/- 7.54) was lower than 'past TSWLS' (21.57 +/- 6.27) and 'future TSWLS' (22.64 +/- 4.60). Evaluation of occupational balance and the time use patterns of university students during the isolation periods could be important due to its relationship with life satisfaction. This issue raises the potential need for preventive occupation-based interventions to address the mental health of the community.

AB  - Unbound permeable aggregate base (UPAB) materials with strong load-transmitting skeleton yet adequate inter-connected pores are desired for use in the sponge-city initiative. However, the micro-scale fabric evolution and instability mechanism of macroscopic strength behavior of such UPAB materials still remain unclear. In this study, virtual monotonic triaxial compression tests were conducted by using the discrete element method (DEM) modeling approach on specimens with different gradations quantified by the parameter of gravel-to-sand ratio (G/S). The realistic aggregate particle shape and inter-particle contact behavior were properly considered in the DEM model. The micromechanical mechanisms of the shearing failure of such UPAB materials and their evolution characteristics with G/S values were disclosed from contact force chains, microstructures, and particle motion. It was found that the proportion of rotating particles in the specimens decreased and the proportion of relative sliding between particles increased as the content of fine particles decreased. The plastic yielding of the specimens originated from the failure of contact force chains and the occurrence of the relative motion between particles, while the final instability was manifested by the large-scale relative motion among particles along the failure plane (i.e., changes in the internal particle topology). By comparing the macroscopic strength, microstructure evolution, and particle motion characteristics of the specimens with different G/S values, it was found that the specimens with G/S value of 1.8 performed the best, and that the G/S value of 1.8 could be regarded as the threshold for separating floating dense and skeletal gap type packing structures. The variation of Euler angles of rotating particles was significantly reduced in the particle size range of 4.75 mm to 9.50 mm, indicating that this size range separates most of the particles from rolling and sliding. Since particle rolling and sliding behavior are directly related to shear strength, this validates the rationality of the parameter G/S for controlling and optimizing gradations from the perspective of particle movement. The findings could provide theoretical basis and technical guidance for the effective design and efficient utilization of UPAB materials.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic, the new panorama that we are facing makes it difficult for many people to grasp and assimilate all that is going on. This challenge can become severe in people with autism, both in children and in adults around 10% of autistic individuals have co-occurring physical conditions. Parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia face several challenges. Aim: To Assess Autism Spectrum Disorder Parental Quality of Life During Covid 19 Method: Descriptive community base study was conducted at the city of Al-Taif using semi-structured questionnaire during Feb. 2022, A total of 76 parents living in Al-Taif participated in the study Results: The study shows that the most frequency of effect of the emerging corona virus Covid 19 on making the lives of children with autism more isolated distributed among study sampling parents of autism children was to a certain extent, the percentage 31, the most frequency of effect of the emerging corona virus Covid 19 on health condition of children with autism distributed among study sampling parents of autism children was disagree, the percentage 32.8, the most frequency effect distribution of emerging coronavirus Covid 19 pandemic on aggressive of children with autism was disagree and the percentage 32.8, and the most frequency effect distribution of emerging coronavirus Covid 19 pandemic on learning of children with autism was strongly agree and the percentage 44.8. Conclusion: The Corona epidemic has doubled the suffering of children with special needs, as the quarantine period and the reduction in the movement to go out to schools and movement have been an incomprehensible thing for them, and it is difficult for them to realize its risks, and the deterioration of their health condition has increased in light of their failure to follow the treatment and follow-up sessions in the Autism House and clinics for months Also. Children of this category are unable to express what is going on inside them towards the ongoing developments of people wearing masks and social distancing, which has been imposed in varying proportions for weeks and months, even for a short period.

AB  - Environmental exposure to toxicants is a major health issue and a leading risk factor for premature mortality worldwide, including environmental exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), specifically Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene (BTEX). While exposure to these compounds individually has shown behavioral and neurochemical effects, this investigation examined the impact of exposure to combined BTEX using a preclinical model. Male Swiss Webster mice were exposed to BTEX vapors designed to approximate environmental levels in urban communities. Animals were exposed to one of four treatment conditions: a 0-ppm (air control), two BTEX groups representing levels of environmental-like exposure, and a fourth group modeling occupational-like exposure. These exposures were conducted in 1.5-h sessions, 2 sessions/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. Effects on coordination (i.e., rotarod and inverted screen test), learning and memory (i.e., Y-maze), and locomotor behavior (i.e., movement during exposure) were assessed during and after exposure. Monoamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens were assessed immediately following exposure. Effects of BTEX exposure were found on the variance of locomotor activity but not in other behavioral or neurochemical assessments. These results indicate that the combination of inhaled BTEX at environmentally representative concentrations has demonstrable, albeit subtle, effects on behavior.

AB  - Background Canadian and international research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in health behaviours, including physical activity.Methods The Canadian Community Health Survey asked Canadian youth (12 to 17 years) and adults (18 years and older) to report the amount of time they spent in the past seven days engaged in physical activity across the following domains: recreation, transportation, household or occupation, and school (youth only). The present analysis compares the physical activity from two cross-sectional samples collected during the fall of 2018 (n=13,482) and the fall of 2020 (n=27,234).Results Youth reported accumulating, on average, two hours less physical activity per week in the fall of 2020 compared with the fall of 2018 (-129 minutes per week). The percentage of youth meeting the Canadian physical activity recommendation for children and youth dropped from 50.8% in the fall of 2018 to 37.2% in the fall of 2020. Physical activity decreased more among youth living in urban (-135 minutes per week) compared with rural (-86 minutes per week) areas. Physical activity decreased more among youth from Ontario (-168 minutes per week), Quebec (-121 minutes per week) and the Prairies (-106 minutes per week) compared with youth from the Atlantic provinces (-38 minutes per week) and British Columbia (-75 minutes per week). There was no change in the percentage of adults aged 18 and older meeting the Canadian physical activity recommendation between the fall of 2018 (52.7%) and the fall of 2020 (53.3%). Weekly physical activity was stable between fall 2018 and fall 2020 among 18 to 49 year olds, while significant increases were observed among adults aged 50 to 64 years (+41 minutes per week), 65 to 79 years (+55 minutes per week) and 80+ years (+20 minutes per week). Increases in physical activity among adults were statistically significant only among non-immigrant, non-Indigenous, those not designated as a visible minority, those living in urban areas and those with a postsecondary degree.Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on the physical activity of youth but not adults. The findings of this study add to a growing body of evidence that shows the considerable impact the pandemic has had on many aspects of Canadian life, including physical activity.

AB  - Human crowds have become hotspot research, particularly in crowd analysis to ensure human safety. Adaptations of machine learning (ML) approaches, especially deep learning, play a vital role in the applications of evacuation, detection, and prediction pertaining to crowd analysis. Further development in the analysis of crowd is needed to understand human behaviors due to the fast growth of crowd in urban megacities. This article presents a comprehensive review of crowd analysis ML-based systems, where it is categorized with respect to its purposes, viz. crowd evacuation that provides efficient evacuation routes, abnormality detection that could detect the occurrence of any irregular movement or behavior, and crowd prediction that could foresee the occurrence of any possible disasters or predict pedestrian trajectory. Moreover, this article reviews the applied techniques of machine learning with a brief discussion on the used software and simulation platforms. This work also classifies crowd evacuation into data-driven methods and goal-driven learning methods that have attracted significant attention due to their potential to adopt virtual agents with learning capabilities. This review finds that convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown superiority in abnormality detection and prediction, whereas deep reinforcement learning has shown potential performance in the development of human level capacities of reasoning. These three methods contribute to the modeling and understanding of pedestrian behavior and will enhance further development in crowd analysis to ensure human safety.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

KW  - WALKING
AB  - Synchronization between humans is often observed in our daily lives, for example in breathing, in hand clapping in crowds, and in walking. It has been reported that pedestrian gait synchronization maximizes walking flow efficiency. As increasingly more mobile robots are being developed for practical use, it is important to consider how robots may impact pedestrian flows. While there is research on synchronization phenomena between humans and robots, gait synchronization between humans and robots has yet to be studied, particularly synchronization occurring with wheeled humanoid robots while moving. In this paper, we investigated the gait phase synchronization between humans and a wheeled mobile humanoid robot, which moved its upper body in three distinct types of motion patterns: (1) no-motion, (2) arm-swinging (as is common for typical mobile humanoids), and (3) arms-swinging in addition to periodic vertical-oscillation similar to the human upper body movement while walking. Rayleigh test was performed on the distribution of the obtained gait phase differences under each condition and a significant distributional bias was confirmed when participants were walking with the robot that performed both arm-swinging and vertical-oscillation of the upper body. These results suggest that humans can spontaneously synchronize their gaits with wheeled robots that utilize upper body oscillating. These findings can be important for the design of robot-integrated urban transportation systems, such as train stations and airports, where both humans and robots are mobile and a highly efficient flow is required.

AB  - Haze is a product of in-situ biomass fires that becomes mobile as it moves across state boundaries in Southeast Asia. The literature on the governance of transboundary air commons has largely been fixed at the national or supranational scalar of reference. Hence, successes and failures tend to be evaluated based on policy and diplomatic (non)progress. This paper contributes to recent literature that argues that haze should be treated as a challenge and opportunity for transboundary governance and not merely transnational governance. Transboundary governance does not restrict the study of cross-border relations to national scales of analysis but encompasses resource connections that traverse borders at all scales of governance. This paper focuses on Singapore, a state where biomass fires do not occur but where the effects of haze are acutely felt. Among ASEAN member states, Singapore has been viewed as a particularly active player in region-wide governance on haze. However, the role of non-state environmental stewardship initiatives in pathfinding, nudging, and signalling state, corporate and regional actors towards emergent transboundary governance arrangements have been underplayed. By focusing on the efforts of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA), Singapore Environment Council (SEC), and People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM Haze), this paper explores how transboundary publics can fill policy gaps in transnational haze governance regimes. As a highly depoliticised city-state, Singapore's experience serves as a microcosm for ways forward within the broader ASEAN geopolitical culture favouring depoliticised 'engaged non-indifference'.

AB  - The historical analysis of particulate matter (PM) concentration proved that pro-clean-air legislation and grassroots movement have a positive impact on air quality in Krakow. However, when the temperature drops in late autumn, winter, and early spring, the problem of smog still occurs in the city. In a 24-hours averaging period, the concentration of PM10 has exceeded EU norms in 10 days in pandemic March 2021. It is estimated that 50% of the carbon fraction in PM10 measured in Krakow comes from domestic heating. This is mostly caused by the migration of air pollutants from neighboring municipalities (where the use of fossil fuels for heating is allowed) to Krakow (where this type of households heating is forbidden). In this paper, we analyzed PM10 concentrations in Krakow and neighboring municipalities. Moreover, we showed the main migration directions of air pollutants in connection with wind direction. We used statistical analysis to examine the relations between PM10 concentrations and other physical characteristics of the atmosphere. It includes measurements of pressure, temperature, and humidity. We were collecting data during early spring 2021 when car transportation was limited due to the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland. Car transportation in Krakow is responsible for up to 20% of the PM10 carbon fraction concentration. It allowed for observation of air pollutions from solid fuel heating with minimum traffic-generated pollution background. The Airly (c) low-cost sensors (LCS) network was used for this study.

AB  - This study is devoted to ways of forming routes taking into account external natural and artificial factors, and the perception of such factors by the traveler. The route is built based on preliminary knowledge of an area and is updated with information obtained during travel. Orientation along the route is carried out using signs (waymarks, billboards) and other natural and artificial references which clarify preliminary knowledge of the area. The final and intermediate targets along the route are determined by spatial objects-"points of interest" or "points of attraction"-which are either chosen in advance or occur unpredictably during movement along the route. At the same time, the available accuracy, completeness and degree of relevance of local maps do not always provide the information necessary for travelers. The interface of route creation acts as an intermediary between the preliminary idea of the route and the observable external environment. The interface can supplement incomplete or unavailable information; it helps to search for appropriate objects based on given attributes. Currently digital applications are often used as such interfaces. Objects on the route are constantly changing their properties over time-both according to a previously known schedule and as a result of random events. The appearance of unexpected obstacles, and sudden changes in lighting and weather conditions, force travelers to significantly change their routes and choose new route options. The framework can be used both for optimizing navigation and tourism services and for preparing project designs for landscaping and development of suburban terrains.

AB  - The major goal of this research is to identify optimal arrangement of forced cooling enhancements such as baffles and fins. This research focuses to determine the effect of the different configurations for achieving higher thermal efficiency of the 150 W solar photovoltaic thermal collectors (PV/T). The air-cooling enhancements evaluated in this PV/ T system are free duct without fins, ducts with fully transverse fins, partially transverse fins, longitudinal fins with straight baffles and inclined baffles. The experiments are done on hot days of summer in May 2018, India and achieved diverse flow rates of air mass ranging from 0.012 to 0.016 kg/s. The Reynolds number obtained in the flow experiments are in the range of 900-1300 and Nusselt number 35-130.A Computational fluid dynamics study was established to achieve a parametric research to determine surface and outside profiles to study the cooling effectiveness. The impacts on flow rate of air mass on the outlet T, Reynolds Number, coefficient of heat transfer and Nusselt number were studied. The maximum irreversibility occurred at the free type fins whereas minimum irreversibility obtained at longitudinal type with inclined baffles and detected that PV/T system have a prodigious impact on the energy efficacy as well as energy losses increased with increasing surface T. This research displayed that the coefficient of heat transfer of solar panel upsurges by means of growing Reynolds number. Additionally, the PV module thermal efficacy by growing flow rate and reduced with increasing friction factor. An increase by 6-8% in exergy efficiency and 5% to 7% in energy efficiency was recorded while using these forced air-cooling enhancements. A reasonable agreement was reached between experimental and computational model. The exergy performance was increased from 20% to 28 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. The thermal energy performance was increased from 12 to 18 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. This is the maximum energy efficiency achieved in this PV/T system with the Nusselt number ranging from 30 to 130 and Reynolds number 900-1300. This study showed that Nusselt number of PV/T system upsurges with growing Reynolds number of air flow. The PV module thermal efficacy upsurges by means of growing flow rate as the friction factor increases. The longitudinal fins with inclined baffles provided higher friction factor, thereby ensured higher heat transfer rate. The fins and baffles employed in our research are economical and relaxed to manufacture and install. They bid a fairly lower friction lack in movement of air and henceforth do not necessitate higher fan power. This set up can be used for green and smart cities as it helped to reduce the energy consumption considerably.

AB  - The definition of pedestrian behavior when crossing the street and facing potential collision situations is crucial for the design of new Autonomous Emergency Braking systems (AEB) in commercial vehicles. To this end, this article proposes the generation of classification models through the deployment of machine learning techniques that can predict whether there will be a collision depending on the type of reaction, the lane where it occurs, the visual acuity the level of attention, and consider the most relevant factors that determine the cognitive and movement characteristics of pedestrians. Thereby, the inclusion of this type of model in the decision-making algorithm of the AEB system allows for modulating its response. For this purpose, relevant information on pedestrian behavior is obtained through experiments made in an ad-hoc, Virtual Reality (VR) environment, using a portable backpack system in three urban scenarios with different characteristics. Database generation, feature selection, and k-fold cross-validation generate the inputs to the supervised learning models. A subsequent analysis of the accuracy, optimization, error measurement, variable importance, and classification capability is conducted. The tree-based models provide more balanced results for the performance metrics (with higher accuracy for the single decision tree case) and are more easily interpretable and adaptable to the algorithm. From them it is deduced the high importance of the reaction type and the relative position where it occurs, coinciding with the high significance of these factors in the analyzed collisions.

AB  - Global efforts to assess honey bee health show viruses are major stressors that undermine colony performance. Identifying factors that affect virus incidence, such as management practices and landscape context, could aid in slowing virus transmission. Here we surveyed viruses in honey bees from 86 sites in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and tested effects of regional bee density, movement associated with commercial pollination, julian date, and hive management on virus prevalence. We also explored patterns of virus co-occurrence and spatial autocorrelation to identify whether local transmission was a primary driver of pathogen distribution. Our surveys found widespread prevalence of Deformed wing virus (DWV), Sacbrood virus (SBV), and Black queen cell virus (BQCV). BQCV and SBV were most prolific in commercial apiaries, while Chronic bee paralysis virus (CPBV) was more common in hobbyist apiaries than commercial apiaries. DWV was most common in urban landscapes and was best predicted by mite prevalence and julian date, while the incidence of both SBV and BQCV were best predicted by regional apiary density. We did not find evidence of additional spatial autocorrelation for any viruses, although high co-occurrence suggests parallel transmission patterns. Our results support the importance of mite management in slowing virus spread and suggest that greater bee density increases transmission. Our study provides support that viruses are widespread in honey bees and connects known mechanisms of virus transmission to the distribution of pathogens observed across the Pacific Northwest.

AB  - Purpose Intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance use disorder (SUD) frequently co-occur and are rarely addressed together despite evidence indicating benefits of combined interventions. Both are linked to trauma. Scholars have theorized attention to trauma may facilitate engagement with IPV and SUD but have not studied this potential empirically. Methods Using service system level quantitative data on organizations focused on IPV or SUD (n = 281) in a midwestern city in the United States and semi-structured interviews with policymakers, funders, and practitioners in both areas (n = 27), this paper uses grounded theory to explore whether attention to trauma facilitates attention to IPV and SUD. Results While quantitative data suggest addressing trauma and both IPV and SUD are associated at the service system level, analysis of interview data indicates greater complexity. Despite consensus on trauma-informed care's potential, competing understandings of temporality (when trauma occurs in relation to IPV or SUD), different liabilities associated with addressing trauma, and different intervention approaches combine to limit engagement by both IPV and SUD organizations. Rather than adopting trauma-informed care, both types of organizations more typically engage trauma selectively, offering discrete services rather than holistic intervention. Findings have implications for addressing co-occurring IPV, SUD, and trauma and for practice, policy, education, and research. Conclusions There is need for greater consensus about what it means to address trauma, increased investments in practitioner education and training around intersections of IPV, SUD, and trauma, and additional supports to incentivize movement from a trauma services approach towards meaningful implementation of trauma-informed care.

AB  - The health of drinking water is an important criterion for developed countries and around half of the world's population is deprived of sanitary and safe drinking water. By identifying the time of pollution occurrence and the places that are most sensitive to pollution the management of the quality of drinking water can be planned. Since the landfill for Yasouj, a city in Iran, was located in a higher place than the drinking water wells, which were drilled in a karst aquifer, the safety of the drinking water resources (including eight wells) of Yasouj were investigated in the present study. For this purpose, different parameters, comprising the concentration of eight heavy metals and eight ions, alkalinity, total harness, pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and total coliform, were measured over 12 months and the obtained data were compared with the WHO's and Iran's drinking water standards. To assess the measured data statistically, SPSS software was applied. From the reported results, the water characterizations of the wells complied with the mentioned standards; however, four of the wells were more prone to supply higher quality water. It is noted that Hg, Cd, and the total coliform of wells were close to the permissible values reported by both the aforementioned standards. Therefore, the water obtained from wells should be disinfected before using and Hg and Cd concentrations need to be monitored regularly to prevent poisoning. Due to the rapid movement of pollutants in karst areas, it is very important to detect their presence in the water resources over time. Consequently, continuous monitoring and sampling is one of the most important protection dealings for karst aquifers.

AB  - Background Physical inactivity is common during hospitalization. Physical activity has been described in different inpatient populations but never across a hospital. Purpose To describe inpatient movement behavior and associated factors throughout a single university hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was performed. Patients admitted to clinical wards were included. Behavioral mapping was undertaken for each participant between 9AM and 4PM. The location, physical activity, daily activity, and company of participants were described. Barriers to physical activity were examined using linear regression analyses. Results In total, 345 participants from 19 different wards were included. The mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years and 57% of participants were male. In total, 65% of participants were able to walk independently. On average participants spent 86% of observed time in their room and 10% of their time moving. A physiotherapist or occupational therapist was present during 1% of the time, nursing staff and family were present 11% and 13%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed the presence of an intravenous line (p = .039), urinary catheter (p = .031), being female (p = .034), or being dependent on others for walking (p = .016) to be positively associated with the time spent in bed. Age > 65, undergoing surgery, receiving encouragement by a nurse or physician, reporting a physical complaint or pain were not associated with the time spent in bed (P > .05). Conclusion As family members and nursing staff spend more time with patients than physiotherapists or occupational therapists, increasing their involvement might be an important next step in the promotion of physical activity.

AB  - Practically speaking, fluid flow in round and noncircular nozzle is a very regular occurrence. The cold and hot water used in our homes is delivered to us via pipes. Water is delivered throughout the city via large pipe networks. Large pipelines carry natural gas and oil hundreds of kilometres from one place to another. During the operation of an engine, cooling water is carried by hoses to the radiator's pipes, in which it is cooled as it travels. Experimentally, we detected the results of the model because there is no restriction on the application of experimental research to a certain sector or kind of concept. It may be used for a broad range of events and circumstances. Under parabolic velocity conditions, fluid (Water Pr 6.9) flows from the inlet position. The top and bottom walls of the rectangular nozzle are also moving at the same velocity as they are at the inlet position. Due to the movement of the walls, fluid is compressed in the particular region and also exhibits the same parabolic behavior. The solution of the coupled equations is determined by using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). When partial differential equations are expressed as algebraic equations, the FVM may be used to evaluate them. It can be used to evaluate elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic partial differential equations. Using FVM, it is necessary to know the values (and derivatives) of multiple variables at the cell faces, when the values (and derivatives) of these variables are only known at the cell centres. When determining these variables for convective terms, it is common to take the direction of the flow into consideration. The numerical results of the velocity and the pressure could be seen in the rectangular nozzle.

AB  - Rabies causes approximately 20,000 human deaths in India each year. Nearly all of these occur following dog bites. Large-scale, high-coverage dog rabies vaccination campaigns are the cornerstone of rabies elimination strategies in both human and dog populations, although this is particularly challenging to achieve in India as a large proportion of the dog population are free-roaming and unowned. Further, little is known about free-roaming dog ecology in India which makes defining optimum vaccination strategies difficult. In this study, data collected using a mobile phone application during three annual mass vaccination and neutering (surgical sterilisation of both males and females) campaigns of free-roaming dogs in Ranchi, India (during which a total of 43,847 vaccinations, 26,213 neuter surgeries and 28,172 re-sight observations were made) were interrogated, using two novel approaches to estimate the proportion of neutered dogs that were lost from the city (assumed due to mortality or migration) between campaign years. Analysis revealed high losses of neutered dogs each year, ranging from 25.3% (28.2-22.8) to 55.8% (57.0-54.6). We also estimated that the total population declined by 12.58% (9.89-15.03) over the three-year period. This demonstrates that there is a high turnover of free-roaming dogs and that despite neutering a large number of dogs in an annual sterilisation campaign, the decline in population size was modest over a three-year time period. These findings have significant implications for the planning of rabies vaccination campaigns and population management programmes as well as highlighting the need for further research into the demographics of free-roaming, unowned dogs in India.

AB  - Over thirty manganese deposits have been discovered and mined along the southern Egyptian Red Sea coast (Abu Ramad area). The manganese deposits are hosted in Miocene-Pliocene syn-rift sediments of the downdip portion of the NW-oriented rift-border fault and are in a tectonically complex area. The NW-oriented rift-related extensional fault system is overprinting the old NE to ENE-oriented Onib-Sol Hammad suture. The latter was reactivated as sinistral faults during the Pliocene. The rift-related fault pattern, including the reactivated, inherited Precambrian faults and shear zones, plays a vital role in the distribution and genesis of manganese deposits. In this work, results from field investigation, geological mapping, and boreholes data were integrated to establish a geological model for the fault-controlled manganese deposits east Abu Ramad city. Manganese minerals occur as fault-hosted lenses and vein-like bodies (Type I) and cementing material in the Pliocene manganiferous sandstone (Type II). These two types are genetically related and mapped together at or near the intersection zones between NW-oriented normal faults and ENE-oriented transfer faults. The damage zone of the cross-trend at their intersections with the NW-oriented faults hosted the high-grade manganese deposits (Type 1), while the low-grade type II deposits were formed as the cement of the Pliocene sandstone. Pliocene reactivation of the ore-rich shear zones causes high permeability damage zones that act as a corridor through low-permeable Pliocene shale and brings the manganese-rich solution into localized fault-bounded basins. Additionally, the sinistral offset for the NW-oriented faults enhances the permeability at faults intersection zones, which act as a structural trap of the manganese deposits. This study recognizes multi-reactivated faults and fault intersection zones as crucial targets for manganese mineral exploration along the Red Sea margin.

AB  - Increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves (HWs) in a warming climate exert catastrophic impacts on human society and natural environment. However, spatiotemporal variations of HW and their driving factors still remain obscure, especially for HW changes over Eurasia, the region with the largest population of the world. Here we provide a systematic investigation of the HW changes over Eurasia and quantify the contributions of different natural and anthropogenic factors to these changes. Increasing frequency, duration and intensity of HW are observed in most parts of Eurasia, and the occurrence of the first HW event tends to be earlier as well, especially in Europe, East Asia, Central Asia, Southwest Asia, and the Mediterranean region. These intensified HW activities are particularly stronger and more widespread after 1990 s. The spatial pattern of the increasing HW trend is closely tied to the interdecadal changes of sea surface temperature in the North Pacific. More intense hot airmass convection, atmospheric circulation obstruction over the Mediterranean region and the enhanced Mongolian high hinders the southward movement of cold air and cold and wet airmass exchange. Further analyses suggest that the intensifying Eurasian HW tendency is a combined result of both climate change and human activities. Overall, the fractional contributions of climate warming, urbanization, standardized precipitation evaporation index, and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation to the frequency of Eurasian HWs are 30%, 25%, 21% and 24%, respectively. It is also suggested that the relative influential rate of different driving factors for HW varies over time and differs in different areas.

AB  - Pipe jacking engineering, as a non-open excavation construction method, is widely used in urban municipal engineering construction because of its small disturbance to the surrounding soil and no need to demolish existing buildings and underground structures. The pipe jacking construction of Hangzhou intake upward movement project ( Phase I) needs to go through the gas station. In order to ensure that the construction process does not cause large deformation of the foundation soil and the oil storage tank of the gas station, the numerical simulation analysis of the disturbance response of the buried oil storage tank and the upper structure of the gas station during the pipe jacking construction and operation stage is carried out based on the finite element method. The simulation results show that: With the jacking of pipe jacking, the uplift of oil tank floor gradually increases. When DN3200 pipe jacking is under the oil tank foundation, the uplift increases greatly, and the maximum uneven settlement difference is 0.05 mm. When the pipe jacking is completed, the maximum uplift of the tank bottom plate is 0.14 mm, and no settlement occurs. The surface uplift at the business hall gradually decreases along the pipe jacking direction, and it is one side of settlement and one side of uplift. The maximum uneven settlement difference is 0.3 mm. When the pipe jacking is completed, the maximum settlement is 3.4 mm, and the maximum uplift is 0.15 mm. The normal operation stage of the water pipeline will not adversely affect the Zhipu Road Gas Station, but the fault state of the underground water pipeline (generally refers to the pipeline leakage) will cause stratum settlement and the risk of ground collapse.

AB  - Background: The pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is an environment where seriously ill children receive complex care, delivered mostly by specialty-trained nurses (registered nurses [RNs]) who must perform multiple high-level tasks. With stressors on healthcare systems at an all-time high, design that optimizes RN workflow has taken on a renewed imperative. Objectives: To employ a multimodal approach (1) to identify environmental factors in the PICU patient room that contribute to caregiver workflow inefficiencies, (2) to optimize safety by identifying high-touch surfaces that cause hospital-acquired infections, (3) to develop human-centered design recommendations. Methods: This mixed-method case study was conducted in a 23-bed urban hospital PICU. The activities, movements, and workflows of 13 RNs were recorded using spatial movement mapping, behavioral mapping, and clinical activity mapping. Frequency of RN contact with surfaces was documented to assess relative infection transmission risk. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with RNs to elicit their views on care delivery and their physical work environment. Results: Direct patient care occupied 50% of RNs' time. Of the direct patient care workflow activities recorded, 26% were to prepare for care around the bedside, while 27% were for random travel between clean and soiled areas. The surfaces most frequently touched were (1) patient bedrails, (2) intravenous pumps and poles, (3) tubing and medical equipment, and (4) vital sign monitors. Conclusion: Value-added tasks account for only about 20% of nurses' work. Combining technology and strategic interior design to streamline workflow and enhance infection prevention optimizes efficiency and empowers frontline providers to maximize their time at the bedside performing value-added tasks.

AB  - Hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are considered the most important transmitters of pathogens in the temperate zone that covers most of Europe. In the era of climate change tick-borne diseases are predicted to undergo geographical range expansion toward the north through regions that are connected to southern areas of the continent by bird migration. This alone would justify the importance of synthesized knowledge on the association of tick species with avian hosts, yet birds also represent the most taxonomically and ecologically diverse part of urban vertebrate fauna. Birds frequently occur in gardens and near animal keeping facilities, thus playing a significant role in the dispersal of ticks and tick-borne pathogens in synanthropic environments. The primary aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive reference source (baseline data) for future studies, particularly in the context of discovering new tick-host associations after comparison with already published data. The records on the ixodid tick infestations of birds were assessed from nearly 200 papers published since 1952. In this period, 37 hard tick species were reported from 16 orders of avian hosts in Europe. Here we compile a list of these tick species, followed by the English and Latin name of all reported infested bird species, as well as the tick developmental stage and country of origin whenever this information was available. These data allowed a first-hand analysis of general trends regarding how and at which developmental stage of ticks tend to infest avian hosts. Five tick species that were frequently reported from birds and show a broad geographical distribution in the Western Palearctic (Ixodes arboricola, I. frontalis, I. ricinus, Haemaphysalis concinna and Hyalomma marginatum) were also selected for statistical comparisons. Differences were demonstrated between these tick species regarding their association with bird species that typically feed from the ground and those that rarely occur at the soil level. The ecology of these five bird-infesting tick species is also illustrated here according to avian orders, taking into account the ecology (habitat type) and activity (circadian rhythm and feeding level) of most bird species that represent a certain order.

AB  - Taiwan, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, is highly vulnerable to the destructive impact of powerful earthquakes. When a massive earthquake occurs, failure to take proper measures can lead to massive casualties, collapse of public facilities, and disruption to traffic networks. Among the many post-disaster management strategies, efficient evacuation is absolutely critical as it can potentially reduce the number of casualties substantially. At present, most post-disaster evacuation decisions are made based on past experience, but the rarity of high-magnitude earthquakes impedes the rate at which the quality of the decision-making process can improve. As such, this study primarily aims to develop an efficient and credible evacuation simulation modeling framework which can be used as a powerful tool to bolster evacuation strategies. The simulation evacuation framework we propose is known as the Stochastic Pedestrian Cell Transmission Model (SPCTM). The model is built based on real data of the mapping of roads and emergency shelters in an urban environment, as well as predictive models of pedestrian flow, the number of people needed to be evacuated after an earthquake, and the impact of earthquakes on urban infrastructure. Much of the data is provided by the Taiwan Earthquake Impact Research and Information Application platform (TERIA) developed by the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR). Applying this data, the model divides the traffic network into a cellular structure, applies the concepts of inflow and outflow to represent population movement and uses random variables to simulate the selection behavior of pedestrian agents. In addition to SPCTM, we propose an alternative model which makes slight modifications to SPCTM to offer users a complementary framework in which evacuees are armed with less ideal information about the evacuation situation. An empirical study is run in a district of Taipei, Taiwan based on a simulated earthquake of magnitude 6.5 in which the overall and moment-by-moment simulation evacuation process is presented. The use of SPCTM as a simulation evacuation model is compared to the current government evacuation policy in Taiwan. Further potential benefits of using the proposed simulation evacuation tool are numerous. For example, the frameworks proposed in this study can offer valuable insights to policy-makers on infrastructure design decisions and evacuation strategies before an earthquake occurs, including the best placement of relief centers, to potentially significantly reduce the number of casualties. Also, simulation results can be utilized after a disaster to assist in crucial decisions related to road restoration priorities, distribution of supplies to shelters, etc.

AB  - Natural resources and its enrichment activities are often being associated with the paradoxical effects in ecology such as in predator-prey and fishery models. Several studies have shown that an increase in resources can cause the "Paradox of Enrichment'' i.e., the destabilization of certain species population as the system is enriched. This situation is rather contradictory to our logical intuition. Parallel with this view, harvesting effort and the intensity of enrichment activities are among crucial factors in shaping the sustainability of fishery activities and natural resources. This is because an extreme harvesting effort could lead to resource depletion and threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems. In this work, we investigate the joint effects of enrichment and harvesting activities in an intraguild predator-prey fishery model that incorporates the Michaelis-Menten type of harvesting of predatory fishes. We study the existence and stability of the steady states in this system analytically and conduct numerical simulations, together with bifurcation analysis to verify our analytical findings. Our co-dimension one bifurcation analysis shows that the system can exhibit local bifurcations such as transcritical, saddle-node, subcritical, and supercritical Hopf bifurcations. Co-dimension two bifurcation analysis further demonstrates the existence of global dynamics through the appearance of Generalized Hopf (GH) and Zero-Hopf (ZH) bifurcations, which occur due to the interactions of distinct local bifurcations in this ecological system. The limit point bifurcation of cycles that emanates from the GH point has a bounded parameter space region in which tristability phenomenon (between stable steady states and stable limit cycles) occurs. In a scenario where the resources are enriched in the presence of harvesting activity, bistability emerges with the long-term outcomes lead to the exclusion of either prey or predator population, depending on the initial conditions of species. Based on these findings, we propose another interpretation to the "Paradox of Enrichment'' as postulated in ecological theories: this predator-prey fishery system can be destabilized through an alternative stable states phenomenon, which results in the extinction of certain species as the ecosystem is further enriched.

AB  - During July 17-22.2021. a disastrous extreme rainfall event occurred in Henan Province, China, with the maximum 6-day accumulated rainfall obtained from meteorological observations being 1122.6 mm (Hebi City). The maximum hourly rainfall reached 201.9 mm (Zhengzhou city), which broke the record in the inland of China. The daily rainfall of 1/6 of the national rain gauge stations in Henan Province exceeded their respective records. In this study, a comprehensive review and a preliminary investigation on the multi-scale atmospheric processes are conducted by using rain gauge observations, sounding data, Doppler weather radar observations and the ERAS reanalysis data. Results show that this extreme rainfall event was caused by the joint effect of multi-scale atmospheric systems in the middle and low latitudes, and the effect of local topography: (1) The western Pacific subtropical high is abnormally northerly and strong, as compared with the mean circulation in July during the 30-year period of 1991-2020. It prevented the tropical cyclone "In-fa" from moving northward, and was conducive to the westward movement of "In-fa" along its southern periphery. An easterly low-level jet formed between the subtropical high and "In-fa". which strengthened the water vapor transport to East China. (2) The water vapor was transported from the South China Sea to the Northwest Pacific by the southwest monsoon, and then was carried northwards by the tropical cyclone "In-fa". The water vapor over the Northwest Pacific was transported to Henan Province by the easterly jet on the north of "In-fa" and the southeast flow around the southwestern periphery of the western Pacific subtropical high. This abnormal remote water vapor transport associated with the tropical cyclone caused a positive anomaly in precipitable water in Henan. (3) In the upper troposphere, the location of Henan Province was in front of an upper-troposphere trough. In the lower troposphere, there was a low-level vortex or an inverted trough over Henan and its periphery. The synoptic conditions over Henan were conducive to the convergence and upward motion of lower-tropospheric atmosphere. In addition, the Funiu and Taihang mountain ranges favored the convergence of water vapor and the uplift of the approaching easterly or southeasterly airflow. (4) The subtropical high and the abnormally strong continental high connected and formed a "high-pressure dam", which prevented mid-latitude cold air from moving southward. The extreme rainfall in Zhengzhou occurred in a warm-humid environment which resulted in a low-centroid precipitation resembling tropical precipitation. During the two days with the heaviest rainfall in Zhengzhou, convection was initiated continuously and merged into the main convective cluster from the southeast, south and southwest respectively, which helped maintain the mesoscale convective system in Henan for a long time.

AB  - A landslide occurred on November 24, 2019, in weathered phyllite at the western longwall of Yabaling open pit of Anqian iron mine in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, China. The landslide was estimated to be 3.0 x 10(4) m(3) in volume and caused severe damage to the road of transporting waste materials. This landslide was a typical jointed rock mass landslide, and the cause of the landslide was related to four factors: open-pit mining activity, the weak rock, discontinuities, and the high rainfall. According to the failure characteristics, the landslide area was divided into three parts: the tension-cracking area, the sliding-deformation area, and the colluvium area. The failure mechanism of the landslide was investigated through a back analysis combining nonlinear Hoek-Brown criterion and FLAC3D program with a parameter reduction technique. The results showed that the predicted sliding surface at the critical state matched closely the field observations. A remedial scheme of landslide stabilization including four rows of micropiles was proposed and the stabilization mechanism of the micropiles was discussed. The shear strain increment contours show that the micropiles arrested the original sliding surface and controlled the movement of the sliding mass behind them, and thereby significantly improved the stability of the landslide. This paper also presents the results obtained from the parametric analysis in order to understand the impact of strength parameters on the long-term stability of the stabilized slope. The findings improved understanding of the failure characteristics and mechanism of jointed rock mass landslides may be used for evaluating the stability of slopes and early identification for both active and inactive open-pit mines.

AB  - A catastrophic debris flow occurred in the Zengda gully, a branch of the Dajinchuan River in Zengda town, Jinchuan County, Sichuan Province, China. The successful implementation of a real-time evacuation avoided 820 casualties for people living in 200 settlements. This was the largest-scale successful real-time evacuation for a debris flow disaster after the Wenchuan earthquake in China. In order to better reveal the causes of the successful real-time evacuation process of the giant debris flow disaster, the characteristics, formation and movement process of the debris flow were studied using multi-temporal remote sensing images, field investigation, laboratory analysis, and empirical formula calculations. It was found that the successful real-time evacuation was possible because of a well-executed monitoring system, timely release of early warning information, a highly effective operation disaster prevention system, and decisive and advanced avoidance. It also transferred strategies through in-depth analysis of several important stages in the real-time evacuation process. Finally, an exemplary mode of community-based warning is proposed based on the Zengda gully giant debris flow disaster real-time evacuation. Specifically, the mode was led by government, implemented by local residents and proceeded with the guidance by experts in the field. The experience and effective risk avoidance mode presented in this paper can be shared and employed by other countries or regions at serious risk for debris flow disasters.

AB  - Numerical modelling, a physically based method, is adopted to obtain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of sediment-related hazards such as landslides and debris flows. With its ability to address large deformation problems, the particle flow analysis method (the particle flow code or PFC model) can simulate propagation and runout from landslides to debris flows under complex landslide material compositions with a proper rheological model. Hence, this study aims to analyse the kinematic characteristics of a landslide-generated debris flow event in Shaziba, Enshi City, that occurred on June 8, 2020, with the PFC3D numerical model and linear parallel bonding method. To determine the differences among various processes, field surveys, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography campaigns, and laboratory direct shear tests were conducted to invert the relevant parameters, such as the digital elevation model (DEM) and shear strength, corresponding to the rheological properties of landslide debris flow materials. In dynamic analysis, the velocity, displacement, and characteristics of landslide deposition were considered. The results indicate that the initial landslide stage started with overall acceleration, and the movement of gravel-silty clay materials lasted approximately 733 s with double-peak velocity curves and nonsynchronous displacement. The maximum velocity of the landslide body was 17.5 m/s, and the maximum displacement exceeded 1000 m. The volume of the landslide body was 9.31 x 10(5) m(3). The simulation results agree with the actual landslide volume (1.5 x 10(6) m(3)) and morphology of the landslide dam observed in Qingjiang. The study provides detailed information on the recent Shaziba landslide, thereby providing a useful reference for better understanding the dynamics of gravel-silty clay landslides and preventing the potential hazard for remobilisation of the Shaziba landslide.

We ground our reaches for Indigenous futures in the Mekong through a lens of relative-ness-specifically how making relatives toward enacting more poetic forms of teaching and learning held political possibilities to disrupt colonial logics implicit in global schooling for Indigenous children. While the extension of schooling worldwide is deemed important for development, rhetorics of modernity have largely suppressed the rich family-based knowledges that Indigenous children bring into classrooms, contributing to the debilitation of human communities' intellectual and socioecological health. Our interest here is then: How can educational movements travel in regenerative ways for Indigenous peoples and their lands instead? With a focus on tracing the relational commitments of our trans-Indigenous design research, we illustrate how ongoing acts of making relatives occurred across two timescales-both within our educational design and within moment-to-moment interactions among teachers and students. First, we illustrate how making relatives occurred within 3 years of growing the collaboration across grassroots educators in Mexico, where the Tutoria pedagogical movement in which we were working originated. Second, we present a microanalysis of a teacher-student dialogue to show how poetic forms of relating within everyday interactions expanded political possibilities of schools living in right relationships with families at Sahasatsuksa. Finally, we suggest that making relatives, a deeply trans-Indigenous practice, is an alternative frame to "comparison" and can open up possibilities for more generative, decolonial forms of edgework across comparative education and the learning sciences, teaching, learning, and research.

AB  - This article provides the readers with vivid examples and detailed analysis of how "decadent " aesthetics find expressions in fiction written by Eileen Chang and Qian Zhongshu in occupied Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan (1937-1945). The main purpose of this article is to dig into the works of fiction by these two writers to examine the representations and variations of the aesthetics of "decadence ". Through detailed textual and intertextual analysis, the aesthetical characteristic of "decadence " can be found in fiction written during the War of Resistance against Japan, which proves that the style of "decadence " was not just confined to the European continent, but was also an international literary movement that had already been spread to Mainland China. Shrouded in the sinister shadow of the war, which annihilated thousands of lives and resulted in the collapse of the existing social values of that time, fiction writing demonstrated a style of "decadence, " effusing ennui and desperation, in which the depiction of the mundane urban life was tinged with an annoying atmosphere of the doomsday. Meanwhile, fiction writing had become a means of escape for writers to assuage the anxieties of living and to dispel the melancholies deep down in their hearts. The deficiency of material life as well as spiritual life together constituted a grotesque atmosphere in which the style of "decadence " could thrive through literary works. Eileen Chang and Qian Zhongshu in occupied Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan embraced the advocacy of "art for art's sake " proclaimed by the decadent aesthetes, attaching more subtleties and complexities to their works of fiction with a belief that the literature could correlate to the social atmosphere to which they belonged. Modernism and Realism were miraculously combined together; idealism had been questioned and even discarded, while nihilism and hedonism reared up their ugly heads.

AB  - A multiagent mobility simulation model was built to simulate the movements of villagers in 2 townships in Myanmar to gain a better understanding of how mobility impacts risk of exposure to malaria infection in a region with different occupation structures.
   Background More details about human movement patterns are needed to evaluate relationships between daily travel and malaria risk at finer scales. A multiagent mobility simulation model was built to simulate the movements of villagers between home and their workplaces in 2 townships in Myanmar. Methods An agent-based model (ABM) was built to simulate daily travel to and from work based on responses to a travel survey. Key elements for the ABM were land cover, travel time, travel mode, occupation, malaria prevalence, and a detailed road network. Most visited network segments for different occupations and for malaria-positive cases were extracted and compared. Data from a separate survey were used to validate the simulation. Results Mobility characteristics for different occupation groups showed that while certain patterns were shared among some groups, there were also patterns that were unique to an occupation group. Forest workers were estimated to be the most mobile occupation group, and also had the highest potential malaria exposure associated with their daily travel in Ann Township. In Singu Township, forest workers were not the most mobile group; however, they were estimated to visit regions that had higher prevalence of malaria infection over other occupation groups. Conclusions Using an ABM to simulate daily travel generated mobility patterns for different occupation groups. These spatial patterns varied by occupation. Our simulation identified occupations at a higher risk of being exposed to malaria and where these exposures were more likely to occur.

AB  - BackgroundMigrants in Mexico are entitled to care at all levels, independently of their migration status. However, previous studies show that access to care is difficult for this population. As the movement of in-transit migrants and asylum seekers has been interrupted at the Mexico-United States border by migration policies such as the "Remain in Mexico" program, and by border closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mexican health system has the challenge of providing them with health care. Levesque et al.'s framework, according to which access occurs at the interface of health system characteristics and potential users' abilities to interact with it, is a useful theoretical tool to analyze the barriers faced by migrants. ObjectiveThe objective of this article is to analyze the barriers to access the public Mexican health system, encountered by migrants in cities in Mexican states at the Mexico-United States border during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsData came from a multiple case study of the response of migrant shelters to health care needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study consisted of a non-probability survey of migrants with a recent health need, and interviews with persons working in civil society organizations providing services to migrants, governmental actors involved in the response to migration, and academics with expertise in the subject. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative results according to Levesque et al.'s framework. Results36/189 migrants surveyed had sought health care in a public service. The main limitations to access were in the availability and accommodation dimension (administrative barriers decreasing migrants' ability to reach the system), and the affordability dimension (out-of-pocket costs limiting migrants' ability to pay). Civil society organizations were a major source of social support, helping migrants overcome some of the barriers identified. ConclusionsWhile Mexico's health regulations are inclusive of migrants, in practice there are major barriers to access public health services, which might inhibit migrants from seeking those services. In order to comply with its commitment to guarantee the right to health of all persons, the Mexican health authorities should address the implementation gap between an inclusive policy, and the barriers to access that still remain.

AB  - Background: Many capital cities around the world have been subjected to terrorist attacks on their transport systems with devastating consequences. Large crowds in small enclosed spaces, disruption to people movement, and the psychosocial and financial repercussions of attacks are some of the many soft target vulnerabilities of mass-transit systems. This study is an epidemiological examination of all terrorism-related events targeting air, sea, and ground transport modalities sustained from 1970-2019, comparing the rates of fatal injuries (FI) and non-fatal injuries (NFI). Method: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was downloaded and searched using the internal database search functions for all events that occurred from January 1, 1970 - December 31, 2019. Years 2020 and 2021 were not yet available at the time of the study. "Transportation," "Airport and Aircraft," and "Maritime" as primary target types were selected for the purpose of this study, and events were further sub-classified by region, weapon type used, and by suicide attack (SA). "Airport personnel" were excluded. All classifications and sub-classifications were pre-determined by the GTD. Results: There were 8,729 transportation-related (air, sea, and ground) attacks documented during the study period with 19,020 fatalities and 45,218 NFI. This accounted for 5.2% of all terrorist attacks (168,003 total events), 5.6% of all FI (total 339,435), and 9.1% of all NFI (total 496,225). The mean FI was 2.2 per event and the mean NFI was 5.2 per attack. South Asia (28.4%), Middle East and North Africa (18.2%), and South America (14.9%) accounted for 61.5% of all transport related attacks. Attacks on subways inflicted a disproportionately high 51.5 NFI per attack. Suicide attacks recorded the highest ratios for both FI (13.71 per attack) and NFI (139.00 per attack). Conclusion: Transport modalities are vulnerable terrorist soft targets. The repercussions of attacks on public transport modalities represent a significant and unique psychosocial and economical risk to the affected communities. Suicide attacks on subways represent a unique and significantly higher casualty risk than other transport modalities. Risk mitigation strategies should be regularly revisited by Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) specialists.

AB  - In order to prevent the occurrence of water inrush accidents, it is particularly important to predict the mine water inrush, especially the accurate prediction of the mine water inflow in the coal mining process. Mine water inflow is caused by mining disturbance, groundwater flows into mining panels along the mining-induced fissures, and a depression cone of water table is formed in certain range around the mining sites. Mining panel is usually regarded as an irregular "virtual large diameter well" so as to calculate mine water inflow in China. However, in the mining process, the area, shape, and cross section of goafs are constantly changing, so is the water inflow. Therefore, the central position and influence radius of the "virtual large diameter well" in the spatial and temporal distribution are in a dynamic process of continuous movement and expansion, rather than being confined to a static position. This paper firstly analyzes the formation mechanism of coal mine roof water inflow and the errors and defects in the calculation of mine water inflow by virtual large diameter well (VLDWM). Then, based on the theory of steady flow and combined with the dynamic change process of goaf area and depression cone of water table during mining activities, this paper proposes an improved method and puts forward a concept of dynamic virtual large diameter well (DVLDWM) and establishes a theoretical model of the central position and influence radius of the "mining large diameter well" moving forward. The first (periodic) caving step is taken as the calculation unit and generalized as the "dynamic large diameter well," which is used to calculate the dynamic water inflow in the process of mine advancing. Taking the No.7208 mining panel in Zhangshuanglou Coalmine in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, as the study area, the mine water inflow was calculated dynamically by using the DVLDWM. The results show that the mine water inflow calculated is similar to the actual mine water inflow of the No.7208 mining panel observed, thus proving the reliability and credibility of the DVLDWM.

AB  - The disastrous earthquake of 1693 AD caused over 60,000 causalities and the total destruction of several villages and towns in south-eastern Sicily. Immediately after the earthquake, a tsunami struck the Ionian coasts of Sicily and the Messina Strait and was probably recorded even in the Aeolian Islands and Malta. Over the last few decades, the event has been much debated regarding the location of the seismogenic source and the possible cause of the associated tsunami. The marine event has been related to both a submarine landslide and a coseismic displacement at the seafloor. To better define the most reliable sources and dynamics of the tsunami, we couple high-resolution marine seismic survey data with hydrodynamic modelling to simulate various scenarios of tsunami generation and propagation. Results from the simulations are compared with geomorphological evidence of past tsunami impacts, described in previous work along the coast of south-eastern Sicily, and within historical chronicles and reports. The most reliable scenario considers the 1693 event composed by two different tsunami waves: a first wave generated by the coseismic fault displacement at the seafloor and a second wave generated by a submarine landslide, triggered by the earthquake shaking. Tsunami modelling shows that a simultaneous movement between fault displacement and submarine mass movement could determine a destructive interference on the tsunami waves, resulting in a reduction in wave height. For this reason, the second tsunami wave probably occurred with a maximum delay of few minutes after the one generated by the earthquake and induced a greater flooding. The double-source model could explain the observation because in the course of other destructive earthquakes in south-eastern Sicily, such as that of 1169 AD, the associated tsunami caused less damages. This implies the need to better map, define and assess the hazard responsible for this type of tsunami events.

AB  - Despite the benefits of rural chickens in the Eastern Cape Province (ECP) of South Africa, this sector is still underdeveloped and poorly surveyed for poultry diseases. The lack of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system coupled with communities and practices where the interactions between birds are high, emphasize the need for targeted surveillance of chicken diseases in the province. However, to set up such a system requires knowledge of the value chain and trade networks. Consequently, a survey, which involved a rural chicken value chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading practices to identify biosecurity hotspots and an identification of barriers to market entry for rural farmers was conducted. Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements in the province was carried out to identify trade hubs that could be targeted for disease surveillance based on their centrality within the network and their size and influence within their ego networks. Traders and their transport vehicles were identified as biosecurity hotspots that could be targeted for disease surveillance within the chain. Social network analysis identified three municipalities viz. Umzimvubu, King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) and Enoch Mgijima as trade hubs where interaction between rural chickens occurs and resources can be focused. The movement of spent hens from commercial operations that are transported over long distances and distributed in the rural areas and townships were a major risk for spread of poultry diseases. This is the first study to formally describe chicken trade networks within the province and the surrounding region. Its findings provide a model for cost effective targeted surveillance in the ECP and similar resource poor regions of the world. The study also provides insight into the profitability of rural chickens and a possible contribution to job creation and poverty alleviation once the barriers to market entry are lifted.

AB  - In more than one word, India across the globe is biggest democracy. It features free elections, a parliamentary system of several parties, a diverse and frankly free paper and broadcasting media, a dignifiedjudiciary system, and the country abounds with NGOs which take pride in independence and help to form a lively civilian society. It appears from an examination of the imprisonment and detention of the police in our country. There is a substantial increase in the likelihood of violence or worse in some of the major cities of the country we were in visiting, and possibly elsewhere, than in other countries that do not have the maximum security for civil liberties available in India. Even if we knew in advance that we would find comprehensive police abuses of the prisoners, we were not prepared for what we learned about the jails, the prisoners to which the police were sent. They will be evil, if only because most Indians outside the prisons find their lives tough. While prisons are meant to lift the institutional character of the prisoners' criminal records and their actions in custody, the variables influencing the conditions for their imprisonment can also be considered in many countries.
   Condition of prisoners and prisons in a developing country like India needs a lot of improvement as they continue to suffer due to lack of facilities and funds. Normal prisons also have many restrictions on movement of prisoners which impairs their adjustment in society after release. Detention centres provide an alternative which makes prisoners self-reliant and helps in their adjustment in the society. Detainees are frequently seen hostile by all the environmental elements, wrongdoing that simply occurs with extraordinary cases like hard core criminal yet rest of the guilty parties carries out wrongdoing by incited abrupt activities. Without having solid rationale to lead a particularly unlawful demonstration. Accordingly, wrongdoing is considered as an infection, and they kept in jail for treatment furnished with appropriate drug like reformative measures. Outdoors's jail is one of the reformative ideas required by criminal equity framework in endeavoring detainees to define themselves as a reputable resident in the general public. Open jail was initially begun with making detainees as works and utilizing them for government works, it was called as work state, as days of yore it was begun as the idea of renewal moreover.

AB  - Background Dracunculiasis (also known as Guinea worm disease), caused by the Dracunculus medinensis nematode, is progressing towards eradication, with a reduction in cases from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s to only 54 human cases at the end of 2019. Most cases now occur in Chad. On April 19, 2019, a 19-year-old woman presented with D. medinensis in an area within the Salamat region of Chad, where the disease had not been previously reported. We aimed to investigate the connection between this case and others detected locally and elsewhere in Chad using a combination of epidemiological and genetic approaches.
   Methods In this cross-sectional field study, we conducted household case searches and informal group interviews in the Bogam, Liwi, and Tarh villages in Chad. All community members including children were eligible for participation in the outbreak investigation. Adult female D medinensis associated with this outbreak were collected for genetic analysis (18 from humans and two from dogs). Four mitochondrial genes and 22 nuclear microsatellite markers were used to assess relatedness of worms associated with the outbreak in comparison with other worms from elsewhere in Chad.
   Findings Between April 12 and Sept 6, 2019, we identified 22 human cases and two canine cases of dracunculiasis associated with 15 households. Six (40%) of the 15 affected households had multiple human or canine cases within the household. Most cases of dracunculiasis in people were from three villages in Salamat (21 [95%] of 22 cases), but one case was detected nearly 400 km away in Sarh city (outside the Salamat region). All people with dracunculiasis reported a history of consuming fish and unfiltered water. Worms associated with this outbreak were genetically similar and shared the same maternal lineage.
   Interpretation Molecular epidemiological results suggest a point-source outbreak that originated from a single female D medinensis, rather than newly identified sustained local transmission. The failure of the surveillance system to detect the suspected canine infection in 2018 highlights the challenge of canine D medinensis detection, particularly in areas under passive surveillance. Human movement can also contribute to dracunculiasis spread over long distances. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ha'il region in northwest Saudi Arabia is characterized by the presence of oases, flat plains, Paleo- lakes, and lava fields, which are some of the main landscape characteristics in which Palaeolithic sites have been found in the region. It is located on one of the routes of early hominin dispersal across Arabia. The ongoing archaeological research made by the Paleodeserts and Disperse projects have recorded several Acheulean and Middle Palaeolithic sites in such localities as Jubbah basin in the Nefud desert (Groucutt et al. 2021; Petraglia et al. 2015; 2019), yet large parts of the region are still unexplored.The ground archaeological survey conducted by the authors at Al-Huwaidy village, 70 km southwest of Ha'il town , has led to the discovery of a unique Palaeolithic site on the margin of a palaeo-oasis, close to a volcanic mountain. The archaeological site consists of an agglomeration spread of lithics covering an area of basaltic field and outcrops. Numerous handaxes have been documented on the surface and the profiles of current water canal shafts. The site setting and the quantity and quality of lithics from Large Cutting Tools (LCT), including typical handaxes, foliate handaxes, Acheulean cores and flakes, indicate that the site represents a new and interesting extension of Palaeolithic archaeology in the northwest of Arabia similar to Palaeolithic characteristics in the Jubbah basin. Thus, this discovery has a direct relevance in assessing the distribution of Palaeolithic sites in the Ha'il region, showing that they not only occur in the northern area (Nefud desert), but also in the different landscape (basaltic lava field) in the southern part of the region.

AB  - Key biological processes that are related to feeding, growth, and mortality in corals and other benthic organisms, depend on the flow field around them. For example, in the absence of flow, oxygen is accumulated inside and around photoautotrophic organisms such as algae and corals, and the rate of photosynthesis is therefore reduced. When mixing by turbulence and by streamline separation is suppressed, nutrient supply is reduced and prey capture becomes insufficient. Despite the overwhelming ecological impacts of flow on corals, almost no in-situ studies focused on the hydrodynamics at the scale of the coral polyps and their tentacles. Here we report on in-situ measurements obtained by an underwater Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) above the tentacles of the massive coral Dipsastraea favus. The tentacles in this species, approximately 5-10 mm long, extend during the night and contract during the day. A comparison was made between the flow field around the coral when the tentacles were contracted and extended. As in large-scale canopy flows such as forests or urban areas, we found that when the tentacles were extended, a mixing layer rather than a boundary layer was formed above the coral. Velocities in between the tentacles were reduced, resident time increased, and velocity instabilities developed around the tentacle tips. Our in-situ measurements under the conditions of contracted tentacles agreed well with laboratory measurements obtained above dead skeletons of D. favus. When the tentacles were extended, a velocity profile typical for canopy flows developed, having a clear inflection point near the interface between the tentacles and the layer of free flow. The relative velocity fluctuations increased up to 3.5-fold compared with the state of contracted tentacles. The highest mixing was around the distal ends of the tentacles, where knob-like spheres named acrospheres contain extremely high concentrations of nematocytes. The intense mixing, the ensuing slowing down of prey movement, and its longer residence time within that zone may augment prey capture by the coral. These findings can explain the ubiquitous occurrence of acrospheres in benthic cnidarians.

AB  - This article explores an instance of dialect levelling in South East England, the reversal of Cockney diphthong shift. We trace this reversal through an apparent-time analysis of 52 speakers from Debden, a community in Essex with East London heritage. Dynamic vowel analyses of word-list and passage data suggests a reversal of the diphthong shift towards SSBE targets which has occurred most abruptly in those born after 1992 potentially as a result of increased social mobility in this generation. We compare the results in Debden to previous findings in the south-eastern towns of Milton Keynes and Reading where apparent-time change was also observed away from a shifted vowel system and towards SSBE targets (Kerswill & Williams 2000, 2005). In diverse areas of South East England, a common process of levelling towards the pan-regional standard is present which is not occurring exclusively as a result of dialect contact or face-to-face interaction. Nonetheless, each community exhibits a distinct trajectory and timing of language change which can be attributed to different patterns of movement and resettlement and, in particular, access to social mobility and the retention of community networks.

AB  - The Timpe Fault System (TFS) represents the source of shallow earthquakes that strike numerous towns and villages on Mt. Etna's eastern flank. In the last 40 years, three destructive seismic events reached I-0=VIII EMS (heavily damaging) in 1984 (October 25), 2002 (October 29), and 2018 (December 26). These events followed a few days after the occurrence of strong seismic swarms and the sudden acceleration of the eastern flank seaward. The damaging seismic events in 2002 and 2018 were associated with dike intrusions and eruptions of the volcano; however, no eruptive activity was observed at the time of the 1984 earthquakes. In this study, we investigate seismic parameters for the 1984 sequence, in order to interpret the seismicity in terms of volcanic activity. Parameters such as localization, cumulative seismic moment, and hourly occurrence frequency of the 1984 seismic swarm have been analysed and shown to have typical values of Mt. Etna's intrusive seismic swarms. This suggests that the 1984 episode may have been an aborted intrusive magma episode that triggered similar processes (long and powerful intrusions with acceleration of the eastern flank movement and destructive earthquakes), as in 2002 and 2018. These three episodes suggest that an evaluation of some seismic parameters during future intrusive swarms may furnish indications of a possible reactivation of the TFS.

AB  - Zhangmu Town in Tibet of China, which lies in the southern piedmont of the median Himalayas, is a small but strategically important port of trade exchange between China and Nepal. Many rockfall events have occurred in Zhangmu since 1970, resulting in huge economic losses and serious influence on the bilateral trade. We conducted a detailed field investigation on the high and steep slope in Zhangmu Town, and analyzed the distribution features, stability, failure modes and evolution of dangerous rocks of potential rockfalls. Then we numerically simulated the movement path, velocity and accumulation forms of the rockfall with PFC3D program. The results indicated that the dangerous rock belt could be divided into three sections, namely, unstable section, slightly stable section and basically stable section. It was estimated that the rock debris and single dangerous rock would be unstable in the case of earthquakes or rainstorms. Due to the terrain constraints, the fallen rocks would scatter near the mouth of the Zhangmu ditch and in the Buqu River through multiple times of rolling, collision-induced diversion and bouncing. Without reinforcement, the rockfall could cause serious damage to the car parks, gas stations and National Highway 318 along the line from Zhangmu Town to Zhangmu ditch. Based on the field survey and numerical simulation, we recommended rockfall removal and interception as the major prevention measures, and protective sheds as auxiliary measure.

AB  - The article draws on archival documents to show the nature of the Nazi occupation regime on the border territories of the North-West of Russia and in Belarus. The relevance of the study springs from the region's specifics in the wartime due to its long occupation by the Nazi armies and formation of stable occupation administration, active resistance to the invaders and existence of partisan zones. The chronological framework is 1941-44, i.e. the period of occupation of the region. The significance of the problem of occupation of border territories of the North-West of Russia and Belarus has incited considerable research interest. The study uses comparative-historical and statistical methods, as well as methods of source studies, structural/diachronic and system analysis. The source base is numerous archival documents, primarily, acts of the Extraordinary State Commission for the Establishment and Investigation of the Atrocities of the German Fascist Invaders and Their Accomplices and the Damage They Caused to Citizens, Collective Farms, Public Organizations, State Enterprises and Institutions of the USSR (ChGK), acts of local (district, city and regional) commissions, eyewitness accounts, dispatches and special reports of intelligence officers and partisans, reports, information notes, transcripts and minutes of meetings of the party and Soviet bodies, materials of medical examinations of mass graves of victims. The documentary base also includes documents of personal provenance: letters and memoirs. A large group of documents is made up of acts of district and village commissions to investigate the atrocities of the Nazi invaders. The acts contribute to identification and investigation of the atrocities in form of murder, torture, humiliation, and violence against Soviet citizens and prisoners of war, as well as deportation to slave labor. The acts contain information on the activities of the Nazi punitive detachments. The plight of Soviet citizens abducted to Germany can be assessed in their memoirs and letters to relatives and friends. The brutal crimes of Nazism committed on the border territories of the North-West of Russia and Belarus are also evidenced in interrogation protocols of residents as witnesses of the events. The fonds of the Leningrad and Belarusian headquarters of the partisan movement store documents of investigations conducted by partisan formations, which not only show the scope of the anti-fascist struggle in the region, but also contain information on the situation in the areas occupied by the enemy. German documents also deserve attention. They contain information on the structure of administrative and economic institutions, state of agriculture and industry, taxes and fees. The article notes that the entire complex of archival materials reveals the criminal nature of the Nazi occupation regime. New archival documents are still being found, containing data on most serious crimes and atrocities, responsibility for which has no limitations period.

AB  - Background: There is growing interest and investment in electronic immunization registries (EIRs) in low-and middle-income countries. EIRs provide ready access to patient-and aggregate-level service delivery data that can be used to improve patient care, identify spatiotemporal trends in vaccination coverage and dropout, inform resource allocation and program operations, and target quality improvement measures. The Government of Tanzania introduced the Tanzania Immunization Registry (TImR) in 2017, and the system has since been rolled out in 3736 facilities in 15 regions. Objective: The aims of this study are to conceptualize the additional ways in which EIRs can add value to immunization programs (beyond measuring vaccine coverage) and assess the potential value-add using EIR data from Tanzania as a case study. Methods: This study comprised 2 sequential phases. First, a comprehensive list of ways EIRs can potentially add value to immunization programs was developed through stakeholder interviews. Second, the added value was evaluated using descriptive and regression analyses of TImR data for a prioritized subset of program needs. Results: The analysis areas prioritized through stakeholder interviews were population movement, missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs), continuum of care, and continuous quality improvement. The included TImR data comprised 958,870 visits for 559,542 patients from 2359 health facilities. Our analyses revealed that few patients sought care outside their assigned facility (44,733/810,568, 5.52% of applicable visits); however, this varied by region; facility urbanicity, type, ownership, patient volume, and duration of TImR system use; density of facilities in the immediate area; and patient age. Analyses further showed that MOVs were highest among children aged <12 months (215,576/831,018, 25.94% of visits included an MOV and were applicable visits); however, there were few significant differences based on other individual or facility characteristics. Nearly half (133,337/294,464, 45.28%) of the children aged 12 to 35 months were fully vaccinated or had received all doses except measles-containing vaccine-1 of the 14-dose under-12-month schedule (ie, through measles-containing vaccine-1), and facility and patient characteristics associated with dropout varied by vaccine. The continuous quality improvement analysis showed that most quality issues (eg, MOVs) were concentrated in <10% of facilities, indicating the potential for EIRs to target quality improvement efforts. Conclusions: EIRs have the potential to add value to immunization stakeholders at all levels of the health system. Individual-level electronic data can enable new analyses to understand service delivery or care-seeking patterns, potential risk factors for underimmunization, and where challenges occur. However, to achieve this potential, country programs need to leverage and strengthen the capacity to collect, analyze, interpret, and act on the data. As EIRs are introduced and scaled in low-and middle-income countries, implementers and researchers should continue to share real-world examples and build an evidence base for how EIRs can add value to immunization programs, particularly for innovative uses.

AB  - A self-consistent two-dimensional fluid model is employed to investigate the coaxial-coplanar dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) excited by the sinusoidal voltage in atmospheric helium. Simulation results show that there are two current pulses in the positive half cycle, but only one in the negative half cycle. The discharge is transformed from the Townsend-like mode, through the glow-like mode, and back to the Townsend-like mode in both the positive and negative half cycles, during which the electric field line exhibits an arc-shape profile due to the configuration of coaxial-coplanar electrodes. In the glow-like mode, the cathode fall is located near the inner edge of the ground electrode at the first positive current peak, but close to the outer edge of the ground electrode at the second positive current peak. At the negative current peak, the cathode fall is distributed near the outer edge of the high voltage electrode. Since the instantaneous anode and the instantaneous cathode are on the same side of the discharge space, the dielectric layer is simultaneously covered by positive and negative surface charges due to the movement of charged particles. It is also found that the surface charge density changes significantly on the dielectric layer facing the electrodes. A further study reveals that a stronger discharge always occurs in the central circular area and an alternately complementary discharge takes place in the periphery ring area in the positive half cycle due to the activator-inhibitor effect. This feature is helpful for producing uniform plasma in a whole cycle of DBD. (c) 2022 Author(s).

AB  - Purpose This article examines the inaction, silencing and ignorance in ex ante disasters whilst conducting a case study analysis of the Izmir/Samos earthquake, a 6.6 Mw (moment magnitude) earthquake that occurred at a depth of 14.9 km from the ground on 30 October 2020 at 2:51 PM. The 8-floor Riza Bey Apartment in Bayrakli/Izmir was demolished in the earthquake approximately 100 km from the epicenter. After the earthquake, several lawsuits started to conduct investigations on an apartment basis. Focusing on the causes of disasters in engaging with adoptive thinking in disasters, the current article posits the following research question: what are the ex ante socio-technical dynamics and causes of fatality in disasters? Design/methodology/approach The methodological tools and advice related to disaster prevention in ex ante disasters originate from the actor network theory (ANT). Although ANT probes complex and dynamic multiplicities in disaster prevention management, this may be unsatisfactory for conceptualizing and operationalizing a disaster, as it is heavily reliant on discerning between humans and non-humans. Data were gathered (February 2021-February 2022) from 15 face-to-face interviews, 2 phone interviews, official documents, archival records, open-sourced public interviews, political speeches, newspaper articles, public reports, expert reports stories, videos, legal transcriptions and photographs. Additionally, data were gathered from the commission minutes officially published on the government website. Findings This article revealed the confusion of authority between the local and central governments and the gap between institutions and citizens in understanding and implementing the disaster prevention laws and regulations. It found that the causes of disasters beyond any dichotomies, such as surface versus site and ground versus grounded, rely not only on the technical roles of disaster prevention but also the non-technical roles assigned to it. Research limitations/implications Since the lawsuit has been in continuation, the process is still alive, and data gathering is limited to the litigation conditions of public servants in terms of sharing information. Since many of the flat owners died, it is difficult to access information on the apartment meetings to learn more about the resistance of flat owners against urban transformation and the possibility of ignoring or hiding the risk assessment report. Practical implications Disaster prevention is such a complex process which generates complex adaptation mechanisms (physical, behavioral, biological, cognitive through training, learning and experiencing). Also, there is a need to understand the scale of adaptive behavior and its function to improve adoptive mechanisms. With a transdisciplinary focus, each discipline needs to embrace one another's calculation and calculative practices while they measure, observe, analyze and implement risk and uncertainties. Social implications It is hard to prevent disasters without knowing the flow of root relations between actors and elements that are in movement with different directions, forms and motions. These unbalanced, uneven and endless root relationships between actors' movements create a constant state of tension of organizing, recording, auditing, quantifying, computing, mapping (geology, Earth information system and micro-zonation), budgeting, bookkeeping, measuring, performance, regulating, controlling, monitoring and auditing with all the numbers and data.
   Originality/value There is a gap in the literature in terms of the interaction between accounts and institutions in ex ante disaster.

AB  - On 5 April 2021, a high-position landslide occurred in Tiejiangwan, Liujiang Town of Hongya County, Sichuan Province, China. The detached mass transformed into a debris avalanche traveled about 1300 m with an elevation difference of 665 m and caused three fatalities. Then landslide deposits were initiated by continuous rainfall and evolved to a debris flow five days later, forming a secondary disaster chain. The rapid characterization of a landslide-debris flow chain (LDC) is a critical step in remediation works and future early warning of failure. This paper proposes a rapid disaster information integration and assessment method for providing information on LDC occurrence, failure mechanisms, and potential hazard-affected areas via examining and characterizing the Tiejiangwan LDC based on multi-method including geomorphological mapping, structural characterization, kinematic analysis and numerical simulation. The results suggested that the first landslide initiated from a mountain ridge that experienced historical deformation extended over the fractured argillaceous siltstones. Constrained by three discontinuity sets, the failure mode was determined as planar failure along a sub-vertical defect. The cause of first landslide can be attributed to a jointed effect of structural plane, tectonic activity, terrain and slope structure, while rainfall is the dominating triggering factor. Deposits with loose structure subjected to persistent rainfall and gully topography contribute to the occurrence of secondary debris flow. Using UAV and LiDAR identification, the unstable elements in the surrounding cliffs of the source area are derived and a three-dimensional simulation was implemented to detect the energy, velocity, height and reach of detached blocks. The proposed method leads to rapid characterization of LDC and assists the evaluation of cliff instability of these environments.

AB  - Landslide deposits are common in basin fill of tectonically active areas, including the Basin and Range province of western North America. However, interpreting and reconstructing ancient landsliding events from these deposits is challenging, but can be aided by detailed field analysis. Remnants of the Blue Diamond landslide breccia are exposed capping hills and ridges in the foothills of the eastern Spring Mountains near Blue Diamond, Nevada, USA. Uncertainties surrounding the origin and emplacement of the ancestral Blue Diamond landslide have emerged based on the disparate distribution of landslide outcrops. Therefore, in this study we used detailed sedimentological data and observations to interpret a two-phase emplacement history for the Blue Diamond landslide.
   Sedimentological observations are consistent with Blue Diamond landslide breccia emplacement as a rock avalanche. The presence of clastic dikes and flame structures and negligible incorporation of bedrock substrate material suggest that runout occurred over a saturated substrate. Flow transformation into a debris avalanche is ruled out because clast-count data show that debris entrainment was not sufficient to act as the sole mechanism behind the excessive mobility experienced by the Blue Diamond landslide. Instead, we propose that the excessive mobility was driven by flow entrainment of large Aztec Sandstone boulders and interaction with a saturated runout path substrate that caused a reduced basal frictional resistance, enabling initial emplacement onto Blue Diamond Hill. We therefore suggest that the Blue Diamond landslide was derived from a source area about 8.5 km northwest of the Blue Diamond townsite and flowed into the Blue Diamond Hill site where it was emplaced onto Moenkopi Formation atop the hill during the Miocene. Due to loading by this new overburden, incompetent gypsum horizons failed in the upper Kaibab Formation stratigraphically below the Moenkopi Formation. These failed gypsum horizons then served as a compound landslide rupture surface, transporting the overlying Moenkopi Formation and landslide breccia. This secondary emplacement likely ceased by late Miocene to Pliocene time.

AB  - Anxiety is an aversive emotional and motivational state occurring in threatening circumstances, mainly including general anxiety and separation anxiety in early childhood. General anxiety is a kind of trait anxiety relating to general susceptibility to anxiety, while separation anxiety belongs to the state anxiety determined interactively by trait and situational stress. Previous studies have demonstrated the negative effects of anxiety on creativity, but less is known about the mechanisms of these effect, particular the longitudinal effects of anxiety on creativity from toddlerhood to preschool period. Processing Efficiency Theory and Attentional Control Theory explained the effect of anxiety on cognition from the perspective of cognitive processing. Moreover, childhood anxiety may longitudinally affect later development of creativity through neuroendocrine system. That is, anxiety activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) with releasing glucocorticoids, which are associated with the development of higher-order cognitive function. Thus, we assumed that anxiety in early childhood had a longitudinal adverse effect on later development of creativity. Further, the present study explored the mechanisms between early childhood anxiety and creativity in preschool period. The general cognitive ability, a foundamental component of creativity, and motivation may be candidate mediated variables. According to Piaget's cognitive development theory, a necessary precondition for the development from one cognitive stage to a higher stage is that the individual encounters with discrepancies between the previous schema and the current stimulus, which lead to the motivation to achieve a new cognitive balance. These views suggested that cognition and motivation may be two closely intertwined processes, and general cognitive functions play a decisive role in motivation activation. For younger children, the motivation is reflected in the persistence on objects and people and so on, namely mastery motivation. Accordingly, a longitudinal study was designed to examine the relation between anxiety of toddlers and their creativity when they were 5 years old, and investigate the underlying mechanism by chain mediation effects of general cognitive function and mastery motivation.
   96 families (42 boys and 54 girls) were recruited from the local communities and child care clinics in urban areas of Beijing. At 14 and 25 months, infants' general anxiety and separation anxiety were reported by their mother with the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA-Chinese version). When children were 25 and 38 months, children's general cognition and master motivation were evaluated using the Bailey Scale of Infant Development and Dimensions of Mastery Motivation Questionnaire in the laboratory respectively. Children's creativity was assessed by Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement (TCAM) when they were 61 months.
   Results showed that: (1) Both general anxiety and separation anxiety in the first two years of life negatively predicted motor creativity at preschool years directly. (2) The chain mediation effects of general cognitive ability at toddler period and mastery motivation at 3-year-old were significantly linking both types of anxiety to creativity. (3) The general anxiety could negatively predict mastery motivation, which in turn led to the decreased performance of creativity.
   Overall, our findings indicated the long-term impact of both general and separation anxiety in early childhood on creativity in preschool years. Path analysis confirmed the interwined process of cognition and motivation in the development of creativity. These results suggest that early identification of child anxiety as well as intervention for general cognition and master motivation would be conducive to the development of creativity.

AB  - At GMT+8 1:45 on January 8, 2022, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6. 9 occurred in Menyuan Town, Haibei Prefecture, Qinghai Province (N37. 77 degrees, E101. 26 degrees). The seismogenic fault is the Lenglongling section (also named after Lenglongling fault) of the Qilian-West Haiyuan fault system. This is another destructive moderately strong earthquake that occurred on the Lenglongling fault after the M-s 6. 4 earthquake on January 21, 2016. In this paper, we constrained three-dimensional inverse electrical structures across the different segments of the Lenglongling fault using three magnetotelluric (MT) profiles, interpreted the deep extensional characteristics of the fault, and further discussed the dynamic model of the 2022 M-s 6. 9 earthquake. The Lenglongling fault is generally characterized by large-scale high-low resistivity boundary zone that extends downward to the lower crust, which is consistent with the previous cognition of electrical structure for large-scale strike-slip fault. The 2016 M-s 6. 4 and 2022 M-s 6.9 earthquakes both occurred in the boundary zone of high and low resistivity near the Lenglongling fault and close to the side of high resistivity. The structure of the west section of the Lenglongling fault is relatively complex. The main fault is shown by a nearly vertical electrical boundary zone. The Sunan-Qilian fault and Minle-Damaying fault in the north are associated faults of Lenglongling fault and share the thrust component. The middle and east segments of the fault are characterized by the south-dipping electrical boundary zones. The kinematics of Lenglongling fault has a trend of transformation from strike-slip to the west towards strike-slip with thrusting component to the east, which is compatible with the varied seismogenic mechanisms for the 2016 M-s 6. 4 earthquake and 2022 M-s 6.9 earthquake in different sections. Combined with the data analysis of GPS and precise leveling field in the study area, we suggest that the Lenglongling fault is the core area where the NE-trending compressional stress field induced by the growth of the Tibetan Plateau is decomposed into SE-trending extension. The strongly sinistral strike-slip movement of the Lenglongling fault caused by the stress decomposing is the dynamic source of the 2022 M-s 6. 9 earthquake. With the continuous NE-ward pushing of the Tibetan Plateau and the characteristics of the Lenglongling fault acting as an important boundary separating the physical properties to the north and south, we suggest that this fault still has a potential risk for strong earthquake occurrence in the future.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition of intermittent nocturnal upper airway obstruction. OSA increases sympathetic drive which may result in clinical and biochemical features suggestive of pheochromocytoma. We present the case of a 65-year-old male with a 2.9-cm left adrenal incidentaloma on CT, hypertension, symptoms of headache, anxiety and diaphoresis, and persistently elevated 24-h urine norepinephrine (initially 818 nmol/day (89-470)) and normetanephrine (initially 11.2 mu mol/day (0.6-2.7)). He was started on prazosin and underwent left adrenalectomy. Pathology revealed an adrenal corticoadenoma with no evidence of pheochromocytoma. Over the next 2 years, urine norepinephrine and normetanephrine remained significantly elevated with no MIBG avid disease. Years later, he was diagnosed with severe OSA and treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Urine testing done once OSA was well controlled revealed complete normalization of urine norepinephrine and normetanephrine with substantial symptom improvement. It was concluded that the patient never had a pheochromocytoma but rather an adrenal adenoma with biochemistry and symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma due to untreated severe OSA. Pseudo-pheochromocytoma is a rare presentation of OSA and should be considered on the differential of elevated urine catecholamines and metanephrines in the right clinical setting.
