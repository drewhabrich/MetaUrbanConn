AB  - Parks, remnants of natural habitats and other green areas are important for preserving biodiversity in urban areas. Here, we investigate the relative importance of habitat type and connectivity for butterfly species richness in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the urban habitats with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterfly species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within I km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the urban habitats than in semi-natural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of "townscape" composition for species richness in urban habitats but also, demonstrates clearly that urban habitats, especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use.

AB  - Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the city's ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones.

AB  - Ecological corridors are landscape elements that prevent the negative effects of fragmentation. However, their effectiveness has never been clearly validated in urban landscapes.
   We analysed the role of green corridors in an urban context by comparing metacommunities of arthropods in (i) woodlots considered as sources of species, (ii) woody corridors and domestic gardens that are (iii) connected (CG) or (iv) disconnected to corridors (DG) and taking into account the connectivity of the matrix. We trapped 3 taxa of arthropods - spiders, carabids and staphylinids - because they are sensitive to fragmentation but with different dispersal capabilities. We analysed their species richness, abundance and taxonomic and functional composition.
   For the 3 taxa, the taxonomic and functional compositions of communities in CG were closer to those of the corridor and the source than those of DG. Woodland species were associated with source, corridor and CG. A lower abundance in DG was revealed for staphylinids and spiders. Lower species richness in DG was observed for staphylinids.
   The differences between taxa could be explained by the dispersal capabilities of the species and by their various responses to landscape structures. For carabids, processes at a wider scale could be responsible for their rarity in sources and, consequently, in gardens. For spiders, the colonisation from other sources could explain the high species richness found in disconnected gardens. Our results suggest that the role of corridors is crucial for enhancing biodiversity in green spaces such as domestic gardens.
   Our results clarify the effectiveness of corridors in urban landscapes and have direct implications for the ecological management of cities. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 x 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.

AB  - Although habitat fragmentation is recognized as a primary threat to biodiversity, the effects of urban development on genetic population structure vary among species and landscapes and are not yet well understood. Here we use non-invasive genetic sampling to compare the effects of fragmentation by major roads and urban development on levels of dispersal, genetic diversity, and relatedness between paired bobcat populations in replicate landscapes in coastal southern California. We hypothesized that bobcat populations in sites surrounded by urbanization would experience reduced functional connectivity relative to less isolated nearby populations. Our results show that, bobcat genetic population structure is affected by roads and development but not always as predicted by the degree that these landscape features surround fragments. Instead, we suggest that urban development may affect functional connectivity between bobcat populations more by limiting the number and genetic diversity of source populations of migrants than by creating impermeable barriers to dispersal.

AB  - Identification of trait syndromes that make species vulnerable to habitat fragmentation is essential in predicting biodiversity change. Plants are considered particularly vulnerable if their capacities for persistence in and for dispersal among local habitats are low. Here we investigated the influence of easily measured functional traits on the presence of 45 plant species in an urban landscape in north-west Germany where patches were separated by distances consistent with regular plant dispersal range. To describe the spatial configuration of patches we calculated species-specific patch connectivities. Then we assessed plant connectivity responses in distribution models calculated from connectivities and environmental predictors. Twenty (45%) of the analysed species showed a positive connectivity response after accounting for species-specific habitat requirements. These species differed from non-responsive species by functional traits associated with dispersal, including reduced seed numbers and higher terminal velocities relative to non-responsive species. Persistence traits played however no role which we attribute to the environmental conditions of urban habitats and their spatiotemporal characteristics. Our study underlines that even ruderal plants experience dispersal limitation and demonstrates that easily measured functional traits may be used as indicators of fragmentation vulnerability in urban systems allowing generalizations to larger species sets.

AB  - Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Functional connectivity is essential to maintaining biodiversity in fragmented landscapes but little attention has been given to structures that can provide it in an urban context. Using both the taxonomic and functional diversity of semi-natural grassland plant communities, we assessed the functional connectivity of linear transportation infrastructures in urban landscape. We sampled the vegetation at 71 study sites located along the edges of two railway lines. We hypothesised that if railways favour functional connectivity, then spatially connected communities should be more similar than disconnected communities. Therefore, we compared floristic dissimilarities between site pairs that were either connected or separated by a railway spatial break (overpass or station). As a further approach, we supposed that functional connectivity may attenuate the effect of urbanisation filters on plant communities. Thus we examined whether and how edges' plant communities were influenced by urbanisation and compared our results to the patterns described in the literature. Functional connectivity was mainly maintained at railway stations, contrary to overpasses, which seemed to interrupt dispersal, demonstrating that railway edges provide connectivity for some but not all functional groups: this was only true for moderately mobile species. Surprisingly, railway edges did not seem to play an additional connective function for invasive species, the presence of which being strongly related to the urbanisation intensity and not influenced by spatial breaks along railways. Our study thus highlights the potential function of railway edges as corridors for common grassland plants. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve connectivity in urban landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban areas can contain rich flora that contribute significantly to biodiversity, but loss and isolation of habitats due to urban sprawl threaten biodiversity and warrant limits on development. The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The majority of forests in urban areas are small and isolated. Improving habitat quality of small forests instead of increasing habitat size and connectivity could be an effective means of conserving the biodiversity of such highly fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of habitat quantity, quality and isolation on butterfly assemblages in urban fragmented forests in Tokyo, Japan. We used four habitat geographic parameters: (1) fragment size, (2) shape index, (3) isolation (distance to the mainland), and (4) connectivity; and three habitat quality parameters: (1) herbaceous nectar plant abundance, (2) herbaceous nectar plant diversity, and (3) larval host plant diversity. We surveyed butterfly assemblages along transects in 20 forest fragments that ranged in size from 1 to 122 ha. We used generalized linear models to relate the number of species in a fragment to four habitat geographic parameters and three habitat quality parameters. The averaged models based on AIC(c) showed that fragment size had a strong positive effect on butterfly species richness. There was also a positive effect of herbaceous nectar plant abundance on species diversity. These findings suggest that improving the habitat quality of small and isolated forests in highly fragmented landscapes may be capable of maintaining levels of butterfly diversity comparable to those of large fragments.

AB  - Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones. Location Sheffield, Northern England. Methods Multiple taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, plants) were surveyed at 105 sites spanning seven riparian corridors that transect the study system. For all groups, we model the relationships between species richness and environmental variables pertinent to an urban system. To test whether riparian zones can act to maintain semi-natural habitats within a city, we modelled the proportion of semi-natural land cover within 250 m grid squares that do, and do not, contain a river. Results Species richness varied markedly in relation to distance from the urban core. Trends differed both between taxonomic groups and between rivers, reflecting the complex patterns of environmental variation associated with cities. This suggests that biodiversity surveys that focus on a single group or transect cannot reliably be used as surrogates even within the same city. Nonetheless, there were common environmental predictors of species richness. Plant, avian and butterfly richness all responded positively to Habitat Diversity and the latter two declined with increases in sealed surface. Main conclusions Multiple transects and taxonomic groups are required to describe species richness responses to urbanization as no single pattern is evident. Although riparian zones are an important component of the mosaic of urban habitats, we find that river corridors do not disproportionately support tree and Natural Surface Cover when compared to non-riverine urban areas.

AB  - The effects of urbanization on bats are poorly understood, but published data suggests it might be detrimental to them. Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vitria, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard's similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may benefit generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species. Vegetation cover is important to maintain bat diversity in urban centers. Activities like landscape planning and gardening should include biodiversity data in their outputs in order to better design a landscape that improves the likelihood of persistence of bats.

AB  - Background and aims - Understanding how to ensure connectivity by gene flow between insect-pollinated plant populations is essential for designing functional ecological networks in a human-dominated matrix such as in urban settings. Linear landscape elements (LLEs) might contribute to such connectivity by increasing pollen transfer.
   Methods - Pollen dispersal was investigated for the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior in urban forest remnants, using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue, in three study sites comprising population pairs located in fragments connected or not by a wooded LLE. We examined whether the presence of a small patch of plants of P elatior placed within the LLE (stepping-stone population) might increase pollen dispersal compared to an LLE where P. elatior is absent.
   Key results - Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with most dye transfer events at short distances (80% at less than 15.4-114.8 m) and a maximal distance of 647.5 m. Populations not connected by an LLE, separated by distances of 249 m or more, did not exchange dye, whereas populations that were connected by LLEs (up to 602 m) did show interpopulation dye transfer, suggesting that LLEs function as biological corridors facilitating dye dispersal. The presence of a stepping-stone population of P. elatior within the LLE increased between-population dye transfers (between 1.8 and 3.3 times the proportion of visited individuals) and deposition distances, compared to an LLE with no stepping stone, at least when pollen flow already existed.
   Conclusions - These results provide evidence that LLEs may be more effective for pollen dispersal when serving as both movement conduit and habitat. In urban settings, developing a network of core populations connected by LLEs comprising small, even temporary, stepping-stone populations should be encouraged.

AB  - The landscape matrix is increasingly being recognized as important to biodiversity conservation. The nature of the matrix impacts the persistence of species in human-modified landscapes through its pervasive influence on adjacent habitat and through the habitat value of the matrix itself. However, previous studies have not isolated the effects of the matrix from the effects of other aspects of landscape modification, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, and much remains to be understood about the independent impact of the matrix on wildlife. We investigated the effects of the matrix on mammal abundance and landscape use in south-east Queensland, Australia. Mammals were surveyed in patch 'core', patch 'edge' and 'matrix' landscape elements along a rural-suburban gradient of matrix development intensity quantified by a weighted road-length metric, which was significantly correlated with housing density, while controlling for potentially confounding patch and landscape attributes. Response to increasing matrix development intensity was highly species-specific. Several native species declined in abundance; however, others were more resilient to moderate levels of matrix intensity, one species increased in abundance, and at least one species appeared unaffected by matrix intensity. Native species richness peaked at moderate levels of matrix development intensity. Exotic species richness and feral predators increased with matrix intensity and were negatively correlated with native species. Species response to matrix intensity appeared related to their use of edge or matrix habitat. An ability to use the matrix per se, however, may not translate into an ability to persist in a landscape where development substantially reduces the habitat or movement value of the matrix.

AB  - We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2 ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2 ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds.

AB  - Through a literature review, we determined the current state of knowledge on urban ecology in the larges cities of southern Chile: Temuco, Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Montt and Punta Arenas. This review revealed the scarcity of studies on urban ecology where urbanization is increasing considerably, unkowning the impacts that this phenomenon may have on their ecosystems. Puerto Montt is the city with greater increase in urban population and simultaneously, the city with the lowest number and diversity of studies. The main impacts generated by the process of urbanization on the landscape are watershed pollution, air pollution, loss of native biodiversity and increasing exotic species. Suggestions are given to increase and conserve local biodiversity in the urban landscapes of southern Chile, as well as the lines of research needed to be done.

AB  - Urban green spaces are potentially important to biodiversity conservation because they could provide patches of high quality habitat or connectivity to nearby habitat. Presence-only species distribution models (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency.

AB  - We assessed the benefit of 11 gravel pits for the settlement of waterbird communities in an urbanized area lacking natural wetlands. Gravel pits captured 57% of the regional species pool of aquatic birds. We identified 39 species, among which five were regionally rare. We used the Self-Organizing Map algorithm to calculate the probabilities of presence of species, and to bring out habitat conditions that predict assemblage patterns. The age of the pits did not correlate with assemblage composition and species richness. There was a positive influence of macrophyte cover on waterbird species richness. Larger pits did not support more species, but species richness increased with connectivity. As alternative wetland habitats, gravel pits are attractive to waterbirds, when they act as stepping stones that ensure connectivity between larger natural and/or artificial wetlands separated in space.

AB  - Uncontrolled urban development is threatening the survival of many terrestrial species worldwide, especially those with limited dispersal capabilities. Soil invertebrates account for a high proportion of the global biodiversity but there are few studies on how soil biodiversity varies with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in fragmented tropical habitats. Millipedes are among the most abundant detritivore invertebrates in the soil-litter macrofauna. We examined the relationships between soil millipede diversity and landscape structure in 12 forest patches of approximately 30 years of age, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Spatial characteristics of the landscape were determined from aerial color photographs and were digitized into a GIS package for analysis. Millipede species diversity and composition in these forest patches showed correlations with their surroundings (e.g. amount of forest in the matrix) and with the presence of vegetation corridors that connected to other forest patches, rather than forest patch attributes such as patch area and shape. Millipede species richness correlated negatively with the degree of isolation of forest patch (within 600 m radius), while species evenness correlated positively to the amount of forest within a 50 m buffer. Millipede species composition was related with the presence of vegetation corridors and the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest reserve. These findings show that a low degree of patch isolation, forested buffers, and presence of vegetation corridors need to be considered for the conservation and management of forest patches surrounded by urban developments, especially to protect terrestrial invertebrate species that require forested habitats for their dispersal.

AB  - Many organisms persist in fragmented habitat where movement between patches is essential for long-term demographic and genetic stability. In the absence of direct observation of movement, connectivity or isolation metrics are useful to characterize potential patch-level connectivity. However, multiple metrics exist at varying levels of complexity, and empirical data on species distribution are rarely used to compare performance of metrics. We compared 12 connectivity metrics of varying degrees of complexity to determine which metric best predicts the distribution of prairie dog colonies along an urban gradient of 385 isolated habitat patches in Denver, Colorado, USA. We found that a modified version of the incidence function model including area-weighting of patches and a cost-weighted distance surface best predicted occupancy, where we assumed roads were fairly impermeable to movement, and low-lying drainages provided dispersal corridors. We also found this result to be robust to a range of cost weight parameters. Our results suggest that metrics should incorporate both patch area and the composition of the surrounding matrix. These results provide guidance for improved landscape habitat modeling in fragmented landscapes and can help identify target habitat for conservation and management of prairie dogs in urban systems.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is vital to the ecological health of many landscapes, and identification of linkages in working landscapes that are somewhat, but not irreversibly, degraded is needed. Assessment of the current ecological condition of habitat linkages can be used to determine appropriate management activities, including restoration. Forecasting the future ecological condition of identified linkages under multiple human-use scenarios can identify future patterns of vulnerability and degradation, and thus aid in prioritization of conservation and restoration actions. We forecast the ecological condition of a modeled conservation network of cores and habitat linkages in the San Joaquin Valley, California, a highly developed agricultural area. We assessed current and projected future impacts from modeled urban growth representing seven regional urban growth policy scenarios to determine conservation and restoration priorities. We characterized current ecological condition of the linkages using a clustering algorithm that compared vegetation type, length, and major road and canal crossings. The modeled urban growth forecasts were overlaid on the ecological network to identify expected impacts. A threat index was calculated for individual network components and for component clusters, and revealed significant impact differences between the various urban growth scenarios. The linkages most threatened by urban conversion were those that are currently the most ecologically degraded, suggesting that a significant future conservation issue in this working landscape will be the loss of restoration opportunities rather than loss of intact wildlife linkages. This study presents an approach for incorporating regional conservation design with urban growth policy analysis for working landscapes.

AB  - Fragmentation of wildlife populations can have detrimental effects, including genetic differentiation of populations, loss of genetic diversity, and inbreeding depression We evaluated the genetic structure among isolated colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) along an urban gradient in southern Denver, Colorado. Urban colonies are important ecologically and for educational purposes, and they serve as source populations for relocation efforts Levels of genetic differentiation between colonies were high relative to colonies in natural habitat at comparable or greater distances Prairie clog colonies depend on dispersal among colonies for long-term persistence, and we found evidence for reduced but measurable rates of movement of individual prairie dogs among urban fragments We observed a trend for smaller and more isolated colonies to exhibit lower genetic diversity, but we did not detect Inbreeding in any of the colonies sampled. Isolation-by-distance measures, including measures based on permeability of various features of urban habitat such as roads and development, did not explain genetic differences. Our system represents a possible end point in the genetic consequences of continued loss and Isolation of prairie clog colonies as fragmentation Increases in both urban and natural landscapes Urban development could affect dispersal in unexpected and complex ways and requires further study, hut prairie dog colonies and their associated wildlife communities in urban areas have the potential for long-term persistence if not extirpated by human activity DOI 10.1644/09-MAMM-A-019.1.

AB  - Severe low frequency natural disturbances along stream networks can substantially alter urban and rural landscapes and impact habitat and population dynamics of wildlife species. In 1978, severe flooding along the North Prong of the Medina River significantly altered the habitat for the Rio Grande wild turkey and may have contributed to the decreased abundance of this species observed during recent decades in the southeastern Edwards Plateau, TX, USA. The objective of our study was to examine the changes in landscape structure caused by this flooding event and their potential impact on wild turkey habitat. Aerial photography from 1972, 1984, and 1995 was used to quantify habitat changes in riparian zones and adjacent bottomlands along the Medina River. We documented substantial reductions in habitat suitability and connectivity caused by the flooding, followed by a partial recovery over 17 years. Analysis using patch-level metrics in conjunction with class-level metrics, provided insights to the pattern and possible mechanisms of the landscape changes. Habitat along higher-order streams was most affected, reducing not only the suitable habitat locally, but also the habitat connectivity throughout the riparian network. This loss of connectivity rendered numerous habitat patches along lower-order streams unavailable to Rio Grande wild turkeys as this species depends on riparian corridors for dispersal and movement among habitat patches.

AB  - In this study, I examine the influence of urban canopy cover on gene flow between 15 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City parklands. Parks in the urban core are often highly fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of green spaces may provide dispersal corridors through grey urban infrastructure. I identify urban landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban environment and compare the success of two different landscape connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was associated with effective distances between populations that were calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR), an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from FST, BayesAss+ and Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway medians. These results have implications for understanding the impacts of urbanization trends on native wildlife, as well as for urban reforestation efforts that aim to improve urban ecosystem processes.

AB  - Indonesia has recently been faced with a number of great problems: poverty, natural disasters such as tsunami, earthquakes, flooding and typhoons, volcanic eruptions, loss of biodiversity, decreasing water quality and quantity, increased pollution, and aesthetic degradation of the landscape. These disturbances have been caused by rapid changes in land use and land cover, deforestation, the application of monoculture farming systems in commercial agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, and other types of infrastructure development. The government, urban communities and companies have promoted some programs to ameliorate the problem of environmental degradation. The government has ratified law no. 26/2007 as a commitment to sustainability; this law ensures that cities are obliged to provide green open spaces covering a minimum of 30% of urbanized areas. Many metropolitan cities have feverishly enacted policies to promote greening programs, such as those applied in Jakarta. However, a new town-Sentul City-has engaged in policies that aim to create a well-designed eco-city with urban greenery and ecological networks. This new policy is supposed to herald a better future for urban quality. It is expected that green spaces will provide environmental services: water resource management, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and landscape beauty.

AB  - The creation of cities, towns and farms following European settlement of Australia has fragmented the original vegetation. Many native species that were previously widespread are now found only within isolated remnants of their original habitat. These relictual populations are at increased risk of decline and local extinction, so identifying the factors that determine their persistence is important for ongoing management and conservation. I compared the effects of site area, connectivity, vegetation condition and habitat resources on the presence, abundance and total number of species of butterflies and day-flying moths within 46 urban fragments of remnant vegetation in south-west Western Australia. Site area and vegetation condition were the dominant determinants of species presence: large sites with more undisturbed vegetation favoured 16 of 20 native species and only one (Geitoneura minyas) benefited from disturbance. Another nine species that were not sufficiently widespread or abundant to enable individual analysis were collectively more prevalent in larger sites. Resource quality and quantity dominated the patterns of site occupancy, consistent with habitat resources, not metapopulation effects, determining current distribution patterns. The total number of species at each site reflected the collective responses of the individual species: increasing with area and declining with vegetation disturbance. The effects of area and vegetation condition were not simply additive: disturbance had a far greater impact on small remnants. Restoration or maintenance of high vegetation condition will be essential to maintain regional species diversity and to prevent local extinctions of butterflies and day-flying moths, especially in small remnants.

AB  - Urbanization particularly promotes habitat fragmentation, which in turn strongly affects biodiversity patterns. A major driver of species loss in isolated habitat patches is dispersal limitation. The relative importance of dispersal ability of species, spatial habitat configuration and local environmental conditions for predicting species composition is still unclear though. Addressing urban abandoned railway areas as study areas, we analyzed the relative importance of environmental versus landscape predictors (e.g. proportions of sealed, built-up and ruderal areas) using variation partitioning methods. To add the perspective of individual species dispersal ability, we characterized the effect of species traits on explained variation in species occurrence with a regression tree. The difference in explained variation in the occurrence of individual species (Delta Cfit) between a CCA with environmental predictors and environmental and landscape predictors together was analyzed.
   The results revealed that environmental predictors explained a slightly larger amount of variation than landscape predictors. Adding landscape predictors to the analysis with environmental predictors resulted in a sizeable increase in explained variation. The most important predictors in the CCA were photosynthetically active radiation, C/N-ratio in the soil and the proportion of ruderal habitats in the surroundings of the plots. The regression tree model showed higher Delta Cfit values for species with a long-term persistent soil seed bank. The lowest Delta Cfit values were found for species with a transient seed bank and long seeds.
   Linking dispersal-related traits to the predictability of species occurrence is a promising approach to reveal the interdependencies between environmental conditions, landscape configuration and species-specific dispersal abilities. Our results suggest that in fragmented urban habitats, a persistent seed bank is advantageous because it allows for stable populations once habitat patches have been colonized.

AB  - Urban forests are increasingly valued for multiple benefits such as amenity, cultural values, native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and carbon sequestration. Urban biodiversity in particular, is the new focus although global homogenisation is undermining regional differentiation. In the northern hemisphere (e.g., Canada and USA) and in the southern hemisphere, particularly in countries like South Africa, Australia, South America and New Zealand, local biodiversity is further impacted by historical colonisation from Europe. After several centuries, urban forests are now composed of synthetic and spontaneous mixtures of native species, and exotic species from around the temperate world (e.g., Europe, North and South America, South Africa, Asia). As far as we are aware no-one has carried out in-depth study of these synthetic forests in any Southern Hemisphere city. Here we describe the composition, structure, and biodiversity conservation imperatives of urban temperate forests at 90 random locations in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   We document considerable plant diversity; the total number of species encountered in the 253 sampled urban forest patches was 486. Despite this incredibly variable data set, our ability to explain variation in species richness was surprisingly good and clearly indicates that total species richness was higher in larger patches with greater litter and vegetation cover, and taller canopy height. Species richness was also higher in patches surrounded by higher population densities and closer to very large native forest patches. Native species richness was higher in patches with higher soil pH, lower canopy height, and greater litter cover and in patches closer to very large native forest patches indicating dispersal out of native areas and into gardens. Eight distinct forest communities were identified by Two-Way INdicator SPecies ANalysis (TWINSPAN) using the occurrence of 241 species that occurred in more than two out of all 253 forest patches.
   Christchurch urban forest canopies were dominated by exotic tree species in parklands and in street tree plantings (linear parkland). Native tree and shrub species were not as common in public spaces but their overall density high in residential gardens. There was some explanatory power in our data, since less deprivation resulted in greater diversity and density, and more native species, which in turn is associated with private ownership. We hypothesise that a number of other factors, which were not well reflected in our measured environmental variables, are responsible for much of the remaining variation in the plant community structure, e.g., advertising, peoples choice. For a more sustainable asset base of native trees in New Zealand cities we need more, longer-lived native species, in large public spaces, including a greater proportion of species that bear fruit and nectar suitable for native wildlife. We may then achieve cities with ecological integrity that present multiple historical dimensions, and sequester carbon in legible landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many authors have concluded that habitat loss has a greater influence on biodiversity than habitat fragmentation per se. Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (n = 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2 h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To clarify the distribution and abundance of natives, archaeophytes and neophytes in settlements along an urban-rural gradient we investigated the importance of site-related and socio-economic factors within settlements in determining the abundance and species richness of these three groups of plant species.
   The Wetterau region north of Frankfurt/Main, Hesse, Germany.
   The occurrence and abundance of plant species were recorded in 2003 along transects in 66 settlements in a region north of Frankfurt/Main (Germany). The transect routes had been established in an earlier study in 1974-81. We used ordinations to analyse species composition, fitting 10 independent variables to explain the main gradient in species composition. Additionally, socio-economic styles (derived from interviews of 1359 households) were fitted, to analyse the influence of these on plant communities. Finally, we analysed species richness by calculating independent contributions of the variables using hierarchical partitioning.
   Many species of neophytes have expanded their range since the 1974-81 survey, but this was not associated with a general decline of archaeophytes and natives. The main variation of species composition was along a rural to urban gradient, associated with site conditions and with socio-economic factors that vary from settlements dominated by households rooted in the local community to settlements characterized by a mobile new middle class. For neophytes, variables describing the connection to Frankfurt (distance or connectivity) were most important in predicting species richness. For archaeophytes, the data showed a positive relationship between species richness and increasing herbicide application.
   These results suggest that the occurrence of neophytes within settlements along the urban-rural gradient is triggered by dispersal, related to human mobility patterns. In contrast, the occurrence of archaeophytes in settlements is determined by disturbance-related factors that predominantly depend on traditional gardening practices and weed control practices associated with farming.

AB  - Urbanization causes fragmentation creating "islands" of natural habitat. The resulting fragmented landscapes represent a challenge for migratory and resident species because of decreased connectivity among fragments. We examined the effects of urbanization on avifauna communities in remnant and restored parks in the greater St. Louis area (St. Louis), Missouri and Illinois, USA. St. Louis is located along the Mississippi flyway, a significant North American migratory bird route, and ranks second among the most sprawl-threatened large cities. We compiled bird assemblages for 20 parks and used multiple linear regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to analyze seven potential predictors of species richness for breeding, migratory and wintering species: area, habitat diversity, external development within 1 km and 5 km buffers, internal developed areas, road length, and presence of water bodies. The best predictors of resident bird (i.e., breeding and wintering) species richness was park area and external developed area within 5 km, a surrogate for isolation. We suspect that the high species richness in parks in heavily urbanized areas is explained by the parks' relatively large size and the funneling of species to two large parks within the most urbanized areas of St. Louis. For migratory species, the best predictors were habitat diversity and developed area within the park. As development continues to transform natural habitat along important avian migratory flyways, urban planning that includes large, diverse natural areas within urbanized landscapes is key to conserving local and migratory avifauna diversity.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a prevalent threat to biological diversity, and urbanization is a primary agent of fragmentation and a leading cause of species endangerment. Landscape biogeographic and local habitat characteristics can be important determinants of the distribution of species in habitat patches in urban landscapes. However, the specifics of which characteristics are most critical to maintaining biological diversity are not fully known for prairie ecosystems, especially in fragmented urban habitat. This study focuses on black-tailed prairie dogs along an urban gradient in Denver, CO. Prairie dogs have declined precipitously throughout the region and are an essential part of the prairie ecosystem, making them excellent study subjects. We identified a series of habitat fragments along a gradient of urbanization in the fully urbanized areas and south suburbs of Denver, CO, both containing and not containing prairie dogs. Local characteristics, including fragment slope and vegetative cover, and landscape characteristics, including fragment size, age and connectivity, were measured on each fragment. We used likelihood-based methods to explore which variables most accurately predicted prairie dog occurrence within our study area. Multiple factors influenced the distribution of prairie dogs in urban settings, with colony connectivity the strongest predictor of occupancy. Large and recently isolated fragments near other prairie dog colonies, flat areas and those with high graminoid cover were most likely to support prairie dog populations. Our study provides the first attempt to model prairie dog occurrence in highly fragmented urban habitat and has important implications for the management and conservation of prairie dogs.

AB  - Urban areas are an increasingly prevalent feature in contemporary landscapes and can play an important role in conservation. In urban areas, planting and maintenance of native plants is practiced to promote multi-trophic native communities; however, the effect of an urban habitat on the native foodwebs that use these plants is poorly understood. Here, we asked (1) whether the composition and diversity of specialized herbivore communities on native trees remains intact in urban areas as compared to reference natural areas and (2) what factors, from patch to landscape, correlated with variation in composition and diversity in urban areas. Specialized herbivore (gall wasp) communities on native trees (Quercus lobate) were surveyed in 10 paired urban and natural areas across the tree's natural range. Communities of specialized herbivores remained partially intact in cities. Species richness was greater in natural areas; community composition, however, varied by region but did not differ between urban and natural areas. Within urban areas, species richness was higher when there was a greater density of habitat patches; patch quality factors also affected specialist herbivore diversity. Overall, our results indicate that urban environments are not deterministically removing individual specialist herbivores species. Rather, dispersal limitation and patch quality drive stochastic losses of herbivores on urban trees. Communities of urban specialist herbivores remain largely intact and cities can be suitable habitat for these groups. Simple management practices in cities that can be conducted on the scale of individual land parcels may increase diversity of specialist herbivore communities to reference levels.

AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is affecting global biodiversity, but the integration of conservation goals into urban planning can minimise ecological damage. Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland. (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning.

AB  - Background: Urbanization is characterized by high levels of sealed land-cover, and small, geometrically complex, fragmented land-use patches. The extent and density of urbanized land-use is increasing, with implications for habitat quality, connectivity and city ecology. Little is known about densification thresholds for urban ecosystem function, and the response of mammals, nocturnal and cryptic taxa are poorly studied in this respect. Bats (Chiroptera) are sensitive to changing urban form at a species, guild and community level, so are ideal model organisms for analyses of this nature.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We surveyed bats around urban ponds in the West Midlands conurbation, United Kingdom (UK). Sites were stratified between five urban land classes, representing a gradient of built land-cover at the 1 km 2 scale. Models for bat presence and activity were developed using land-cover and land-use data from multiple radii around each pond. Structural connectivity of tree networks was used as an indicator of the functional connectivity between habitats. All species were sensitive to measures of urban density. Some were also sensitive to landscape composition and structural connectivity at different spatial scales. These results represent new findings for an urban area. The activity of Pipistrellus pipistrellus (Schreber 1774) exhibited a non-linear relationship with the area of built land-cover, being much reduced beyond the threshold of similar to 60% built surface. The presence of tree networks appears to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization for this species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that increasing urban density negatively impacts the study species. This has implications for infill development policy, built density targets and the compact city debate. Bats were also sensitive to the composition and structure of the urban form at a range of spatial scales, with implications for land-use planning and management. Protecting and establishing tree networks may improve the resilience of some bat populations to urban densification.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation had an important effect that preserved ecological balance and sustainable development of the regional and urban, and the conservation degree and efficiency of biodiversity largely depend on the conservation of habitats. Take the case of longyan city, this paper explored the planning theory and methods of urban biodiversity habitat conservation from two aspects: municipal administrative areas and urban area. (1) In terms of municipal administrative areas, the paper proposed the hierarchical planning ideas from geomorphology pattern, biological environment and cultural resources, and constructed the habitat conservation structure of "conservation region - conservation sub-region - conservation plot"; (2) In terms of urban area, from "green belt, green corridor, green wedge, green network and green center ", the paper constructed habitat conservation structure of "natural ecosystems, artificial ecosystem and wetland ecosystem", and proposed the control width of ecological corridor. These conclusions will be provided scientific guidance for biodiversity conservation in Longyan city.

AB  - To preserve biodiversity in highly fragmented landscapes, it is crucial to conserve and possibly improve the connectivity among remaining habitat patches. However, multiple users are competing for a limited amount of land, and conservation efforts subsequently need to be efficiently directed to maximize biodiversity given limited resources. In terms of connectivity, this could be expressed as to which habitat patches do we really need to preserve, and which patches could we lose without facing any significant negative effects on connectivity? Network-based models of fragmented landscapes provide for comprehensive visualizations and analyses of landscape connectivity that could help in prioritizing habitat patches for conservation. This is especially valuable in a planning context where many different types of agents are typically involved, thus emphasizing the importance of being able to present key ecological implications of different spatially explicit habitat configurations in a easily understandable way.
   Here, three different aspects of landscape connectivity are presented, all suggested as being particularly suitable for network-based modeling approaches. These are: (i) estimating to what degree the landscapes spatial configuration enables re-colonization following local extinctions; (ii) identifying clusters of patches that together form sufficient habitat; and (iii) identifying key-stone patches that are crucial in providing connectivity.

AB  - Throughout eastern Australia, fragmentation and modification of eucalypt woodlands are causing declines in populations of woodland-dependent small passerines. Although agriculture is a major factor in these land use changes, development of peri-urban areas is also driving the simplification of habitat structure through removal of both native and weedy understorey species and the subdivision of remnant habitat. This study investigated the influence of habitat modification and fragmentation on birds in an urbanizing area of south east Queensland, Australia. The influence of spatial factors, such as surrounding vegetation cover, was considered alongside that of site-level habitat factors (vegetation structure) including interspecific competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). Spatial factors did not influence the abundance and species richness of small passerines, a group of conservation concern. However, site-level factors, specifically shrub density and interspecific competition from the noisy miner, had a substantial influence on small passerine species richness and abundance. The density of shrubs (which consisted mainly of the introduced weed Lantana camara) had a strong positive relationship with small passerines while the abundance of noisy miners had a strong negative influence. Consequently, protection of vegetation with an intact shrub layer in this developing area is essential for many small birds of conservation significance. Removal of weedy understorey plants should be accompanied by replacement with native shrubs. The results of the study emphasize that factors other than the spatial distribution of vegetation in the landscape need to be considered in order to develop appropriate conservation strategies.

AB  - Urbanization is a pervasive process causing habitat fragmentation, spatial isolation of populations, and reduction of biological diversity. In this study, we applied 11 microsatellite loci and Bayesian analyses to investigate genetic diversity and population structure in marsh frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus) living in two types of environment-highly fragmented urban landscapes, and landscapes characterized by the presence of a river and artificial canals. Our results show reduced genetic diversity, lower effective population sizes, and higher genetic differentiation for spatially isolated urban populations in comparison with populations outside intensely urbanized areas. Reduction of allelic diversity in urban localities isolated for 13-37 generations is more conspicuous than reduction of expected heterozygosity. Populations living close to the River Danube, its branches, and artificial canals are genetically more homogenous. Our results also suggest that the Danube in Bratislava is not a natural barrier to gene flow. In contrast, it acts as a natural corridor for water frog dispersal. Population structure of P. ridibundus also shows higher genetic connectivity within water paths than between them, suggesting limited overland dispersal, and reflects the historical landscape structure associated with the distribution of the lost river branches.

AB  - The Topological City is a design concept for a three-dimensional city in China.
   To accommodate future populations, cities need to be dense, diverse and ecological. Minimising the physical dimension reduces the consumption of material and energy and the destruction of ecological and agricultural landscapes. Mixed-use cities reduce the time, energy and congestion of travel. The integration of natural systems improves environmental quality and supports biodiversity.
   Ultimately however, the quality and functionality of contemporary urban life relies on dynamics of economic, social and intellectual interaction. The design form of a city must facilitate exchange between heterogeneous and changing programs while minimising energy and maximising habitat. High-rise construction is the dominant morphology of modern cities. Generated by an extrusion from the ground toward the sky, high-rise adds significant density but results in circulatory dead ends, structural inefficiency and habitat disconnectedness. High-rise is not interactive, energy efficient, or ecological.
   The Topological City proposes an alternate configuration of the urban environment. Drawing on the theory of place and connection known as 'topology', it constructs a three-dimensional network of vertical and horizontal towers, connected and activated by circulation. The Topological City is dense, diverse, ecological and interactive, suggesting a potential new direction for sustainable urban form.

AB  - Global climate change threatens the structure and function of ecological communities in urban areas, including public and private gardens. An adaptation strategy was developed to accommodate the challenges of urban greenspace design under a changing climate. The strategy offers a protocol for planting design that focuses on adding resilience to plantings rather than matching specific plant species to specific predictions of climate change. The adaptation strategy begins by rating locally appropriate plant species on ecological criteria for plasticity, functional redundancy, response diversity, and structural diversity. The plant palette is then developed within the confines set by ecological value and aesthetic goals, plus cultural and financial considerations. Collective application of the strategy at smaller scales across the urban landscape has the potential to protect and expand nature corridors that are resilient to climate change and to provide a low cost version of assisted migration. Examples of how to apply the adaptation strategy demonstrate that the approach is not specific to place or scale, and does not require extensive training or bring added expense. The benefits and manageable challenges of the strategy are discussed in relation to biodiversity conservation, social impact, the opportunity for "designed" experiments that examine urban ecosystem processes, and existing model forecasts for climate change.

AB  - Barbour's Pond is a 4.45-ha pond located in Garrett Mountain Reservation in Passaic County in northern New Jersey, one of the most densely populated regions in the United States. Despite its small size and surrounding urban sprawl, the shallow waters of this pond hold 18 species of molluscs. Monthly samples from March 2004 through March 2006 found the highest diversity in December 2004, and in January, June, and July 2005. Additional samples were taken in April 2007 and May 2010 to spot-check relative diversity years after the original sampling period. Total molluscan abundance was greatest in July and November 2004, possibly reflecting new late spring and autumn cohorts. Univariate statistics demonstrate that this pond has a temporally stable and diverse malacofauna. Analysis, of basic environmental parameters including temperature and pH, however, showed little correlation with molluscan diversity over time, underscoring the stable yet complex nature of biodiversity of this small urban pond.

AB  - Conservation subdivision is a design concept used by landscape architects and other built environment professionals to conserve wildlife habitat within growing communities. The idea is by Clustering homes together to maximize open space. one can conserve urban biodiversity. It is a popular concept used by many planners and landscape architects and is used in many municipalities as an alternative to conventional urban development. In this review paper, we systematically review Randall Arendt's book, Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide to Creating Open Space Networks, which has championed the conservation design concept. Through this review and our experiences with how the conservation design concept has been applied, we provide suggestions that will (1) maximize the potential of conservation subdivisions to conserve wildlife and their habitats, and (2) promote positive wildlife experiences for residents of conservation subdivisions. We found several recommended design elements that could negatively impact wildlife but of significance, we found that most guidelines and effort in conservation subdivisions are placed on the design phase: construction and post-construction phases are neglected. We discuss the social and ecological elements that warrant consideration during the construction and post-construction phases and how they are necessary in order to conserve functional wildlife habitat within a conservation subdivision.

AB  - This study presents a graph-theoretical modelling approach using daily movements and habitat demands of different target bird species in an urban context to assess: 1) habitable land cover types, 2) threshold distances between patches of habitat, 3) the required minimum accessible habitat areas and 4) the effects of barriers and stepping stones. The modelling approach is tested using empirical data from field surveys in the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden.
   The results show that groups of small habitat patches can house the same species as larger contiguous patches as long as they are perceived as functionally connected by the inhabitant organisms. Furthermore, we found that binary habitat/non-habitat representations of the landscape could roughly explain the variation in species occurrence, as long as habitat was properly defined. However, the explanatory power of the landscape models increased when features of matrix heterogeneity such as stepping stones and barriers were accounted for.
   Synthesis and application: in a world where forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragmented there is an urgent need to find comprehensive and scientifically relevant methods for managing and planning ecosystems. This study shows that: 1) groups of well placed small habitat patches can, together, be sufficient to attract birds in intensively developed areas, 2) the presented modelling approach can help identify such groups of patches, 3) matrix heterogeneity should preferably be accounted for, and 4) proper assessments of habitable land cover types are important. Finally, we argue that the modelling approach applied here may substantially improve landscape management and planning at scales ranging from whole landscapes down to neighbourhoods.

AB  - Microreserves may be useful in protecting native arthropod diversity in urbanized landscapes. However, species that do not disperse through the urban matrix may eventually be lost from these fragments. Population extinctions may be precipitated by an increase in genetic differentiation among fragments and loss of genetic diversity within fragments, and these effects should become stronger with time. We analyzed population genetic structure in the dispersal limited Jerusalem cricket Stenopelmatus n. sp. "santa monica" in the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills north of Los Angeles, California (CA), to determine the impacts of fragmentation over the past 70 years. MtDNA divergence was greater among urban fragments than within contiguous habitat and was positively correlated with fragment age. MtDNA genetic diversity within fragments increased with fragment size and decreased with fragment age. Genetic divergence across 38 anonymous nuclear Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) loci was influenced by the presence of major highways and highway age, but there was no effect of additional urban fragmentation. ISSR diversity was not correlated with fragment size or age. Differing results between markers may be due to male-biased dispersal, or different effective population sizes, sorting rates, or mutation rates among sampled genes. Results suggest that genetic connectivity among populations has been disrupted by highways and urban development, prior to declines in local population sizes. We emphasize that genetic connectivity can rapidly erode in fragmented landscapes and that flightless arthropods can serve as sensitive indicators for these effects.

AB  - Urbanization involves the conversion of natural habitats into human-modified ecosystems and is known to reduce the diversity and abundance of indigenous plant and animal communities. Urbanization may lead to the extinction of indigenous species or facilitate the establishment of non-indigenous communities in cities and towns. We analysed sighting records held in wildlife databases to infer the probability of persistence of reptiles and amphibians ('herpetofauna') within Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Throughout greater Melbourne, 81% (13) of the 16 frog species recorded had >= 95% probability of being extant in 2006, compared with 56% (22) of the 39 species of reptiles recorded. The number of frog species that had >= 95% probability of being extant in inner local government areas (LGAs) within 10 km of the centre of Melbourne was higher (86%) than in the outer LGAs (69%). Conversely, only 46% of reptile species had >= 95% probability of being extant in inner and outer LGAs. The proportion of reptile species with <50% probability of being extant in inner LGAs was higher than for frog species (25% and 7%, respectively), suggesting that reptiles have been negatively affected by urbanization to a much greater extent than frogs. Based on the probability of species being extant, frogs and reptiles exhibited variations in their response to urbanization between species that persisted (urban-adapters) and species that did not (urban-sensitive or urban-avoiders). These differences in response were likely related to individual species' life-history and their requirements for habitat, space and dispersal. To conserve herpetofauna in urban areas we need to maintain structural complexity in remnant habitat patches, and implement strategic policies and management actions that protect habitat remnants and habitat corridors.

AB  - We collected ants from six urban and one forest land-use types in Raleigh, NC to examine the effects of urbanization on species richness and assemblage composition. Since urban areas are warmer (i.e., heat island effect) we also tested if cities were inhabited by species from warmer/drier environments. Species richness was lower in industrial areas relative to other urban and natural environments. There are two distinct ant assemblages; 1) areas with thick canopy cover, and 2) more disturbed open urban areas. Native ant assemblages in open environments have more southwestern (i.e., warmer/drier) distributions than forest assemblages. High native species richness suggests that urban environments may allow species to persist that are disappearing from natural habitat fragments. The subset of species adapted to warmer/drier environments indicates that urban areas may facilitate the movement of some species. This suggests that urban adapted ants may be particularly successful at tracking future climate change.

AB  - Connectivity of populations influences the degree to which species maintain genetic diversity and persist despite local extinctions. Natural landscape features are known to influence connectivity, but global anthropogenic landscape change underscores the importance of quantifying how human-modified landscapes disrupt connectivity of natural populations. Grasslands of western North America have experienced extensive habitat alteration, fragmenting populations of species such as black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Population sizes and the geographic range of prairie dogs have been declining for over a century due to habitat loss, disease, and eradication efforts. In many places, prairie dogs have persisted in the face of emerging urban landscapes that carve habitat into smaller and smaller fragments separated by uninhabitable areas. In extreme cases, prairie dog colonies are completely bounded by urbanization. Connectivity is particularly important for prairie dogs because colonies suffer high probabilities of extirpation by plague, and dispersal permits recolonization. Here we explore connectivity of prairie dog populations using analyses of 11 microsatellite loci for 9 prairie dog colonies spanning the fragmented landscape of Boulder County, Colorado. Isolation-by-resistance modeling suggests that wetlands and high intensity urbanization limit movement of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs appear to move moderately well through low intensity development (including roads) and freely through cropland and grassland. Additionally, there is a marked decline in gene flow between colonies with increasing geographic distance, indicating isolation by distance even in an altered landscape. Our results suggest that prairie dog colonies retain some connectivity despite fragmentation by urbanization and agricultural development.

AB  - The ability to disperse among patches is central to population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Although saproxylic (=dead wood dependent) insects live in extremely fragmented forest ecosystems and comprise a significant proportion of the biodiversity therein, few studies have focused on dispersal of members in this group. We quantified the terrestrial movements of Odontotaenius disjunctus Illiger, a common saproxylic beetle in eastern North American forests. Movement behavior of individual beetles was measured in deciduous forest and two common matrix (=unsuitable) habitats (urban lawn and cattle pasture). Probability of emigrating from a forest fragment was assessed at the high-contrast boundary between forest and pasture. Seasonal, diurnal, and sex-biased patterns of O. disjunctus dispersal were determined from captures at drift fences encircling inhabited logs. Movement was 1.6 and 2.7 times faster and 1.1 and 1.5 times more linear in suitable habitat (forest) than in unsuitable matrix (lawn and pasture, respectively). Net displacement in the forest exceeded predictions of a correlated random walk, but net displacement in matrix habitats was less than expected. When confronted with a high-contrast boundary, O. disjunctus was 14 times more likely to move toward the forest than the pasture. The importance of temperature was indicated by its positive relationship with movement rate and increased diurnal and warm season dispersal activity. Reluctance to cross boundaries into open fields and slow movement within open fields suggest a low likelihood of terrestrial O. disjunctus movement among forest fragments.

AB  - Natural habitats, and the populations they sustain, are becoming increasingly fragmented by human activities. Parallels between 'true' islands and 'habitat' islands suggest that standing levels of individual genetic diversity in naturally fragmented populations may predict the genetic fate of their anthropogenically fragmented counterparts, but this hypothesis remains largely untested. We compared neutral-locus genetic diversity of individual song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) breeding in a naturally fragmented landscape (small coastal islands) to that of song sparrows in similar-sized 'urban islands' separated by roads and housing developments rather than by water. Individuals on coastal islands were more heterozygous and less inbred than those in urban islands. Estimates of population genetic structuring (assessed by pairwise genetic differentiation and Bayesian clustering methods) and contemporary dispersal (based on assignment tests) revealed little structure within either landscape, suggesting that lack of connectivity at the geographic scale we investigated cannot explain the reduced heterozygosity of urban birds. However, within-site genetic similarity was higher in the urban than the coastal landscape. Assuming that historic genetic diversity was similar in these two environments, our findings suggest that anthropogenically fragmented populations may lose genetic diversity faster than their naturally fragmented counterparts.

AB  - Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of once contiguous natural landscapes into a patchy habitat interspersed within a growing urban matrix. Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less spatially structuredexhibiting a more even distribution between habitat fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow between subpopulations when assessing connectivity.

AB  - Lichens are sensitive to pollution and have therefore been used as air quality indicators. While the distribution of lichens within cities may reflect the distribution of traffic pollution, other factors affecting urban lichens are correlated with this pollution particularly moisture and the presence of lichen colonization sources. Our objective was to determine the relative importance of these three factors vehicle pollution, moisture and colonization sources in determining lichen distribution within a city. We surveyed macrolichen richness and cover on 420 trees within 84 sites across urban Ottawa, Canada. The sites were selected to minimize correlations among vehicle pollution, moisture and colonization sources. Model-averaged standardized regression coefficients were used to compare the relative effects of these three variables on macrolichen richness and cover. We found that macrolichen cover was most strongly related to vehicle pollution and that this effect occurred within 300 m of a site. However, macrolichen species richness responded more strongly to both moisture (at the site centre) and colonization sources (within 1000 m of the site) than to vehicle pollution. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that macrolichen cover, but not macrolichen species richness, can be used as an indicator of urban traffic pollution. Our results also suggest that, to promote urban macrolichen diversity, it would be more effective to increase the availability of lichen colonization sources (nearby trees) than to control traffic pollution.

AB  - In a time of increasing urbanization, the fundamental value of conserving urban biodiversity remains controversial. How much of a fixed budget should be spent on conservation in urban versus nonurban landscapes? The answer should depend on the goals that drive our conservation actions, yet proponents of urban conservation often fail to specify the motivation for protecting urban biodiversity. This is an important shortcoming on several fronts, including a missed opportunity to make a stronger appeal to those who believe conservation biology should focus exclusively on more natural, wilder landscapes. We argue that urban areas do offer an important venue for conservation biology, but that we must become better at choosing and articulating our goals. We explored seven possible motivations for urban biodiversity conservation: preserving local biodiversity, creating stepping stones to nonurban habitat, understanding and facilitating responses to environmental change, conducting environmental education, providing ecosystem services, fulfilling ethical responsibilities, and improving human well-being. To attain all these goals, challenges must be faced that are common to the urban environment, such as localized pollution, disruption of ecosystem structure, and limited availability of land. There are, however, also challenges specific only to particular goals, meaning that different goals will require different approaches and actions. This highlights the importance of specifying the motivations behind urban biodiversity conservation. If the goals are unknown, progress cannot be assessed.

AB  - Private, residential gardens form a substantial proportion of the undeveloped land in urban areas. Evaluating them role in supporting biodiversity is crucial to (i) predicting which plant and animal species can persist in towns and cities, (ii) understanding the regional Impacts of urbanisation, and (in) guiding sympathetic garden management by owners To obtain baseline information on a poorly-studied component of garden biodiversity, we measured the size and composition of the cryptogam assemblages in 61 domestic gardens in the city of Sheffield. UK. A total of 67 bryophyte and 77 lichen taxa were recorded Bryophytes ranged from 3 to 24 species per garden, with a mean richness of 11.3 species; lichens ranged from 2 to 30, with a mean of 14.9 species. Stone substrates supported the highest lichen richness. although minor substrates contributed unique species. Just over one fifth of bryophyte species were recorded in grass lawns, and these were more widespread than those of other habitats Most cryptogams were scarce, with around one quarter of both bryophytes and lichens occurring in single gardens, and only 10% wet e found in more than half of the gardens Gat den area - correlated with substrate richness - and garden altitude were the only two factors explaining variation in cryptogam richness (bryophytes 39.1%, lichens 32 4%) Positive correlations existed among bryophyte, lichen and vascular plant richness, and these were only partially mediated by the effect of garden area Therefore the opportunity remains for garden owners to support cryptogam richness, the most effective action being to enhance substrate diversity.

AB  - Coastal dune systems are particularly fragile and threatened environments, which, however, provide fundamental ecosystem services to nearby urban areas acting for example as protective buffers against erosion. Correctly assessing their conservation status is a priority in order to manage them adequately and to plan urban development in coastal regions. In this paper we propose a practical multiscale method for the assessment of the conservation status of sandy coastal environment. The proposed method is articulated in two stages, one focusing on the landscape and the other on the plant community level. In the first phase mosaic structure and composition of the coastal landscape are analyzed using a series of indicators: natural coastal surface, richness of land cover typologies, landscape diversity and eveness, number and average size of habitat patches, and mean shape index. At a detailed scale, floristic, vegetational and structural aspects of the dune plant communities are analyzed along the main environmental gradient by measuring: spatial connectivity and richness of boundaries, species diversity, eveness and chorological index. In this work we apply and test the method in an experimental area on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy (Latium region), comparing the conservation status of two study sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban greenways are proven strategies to counter ecological fragmentation and improve urban sustainability. However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are the major causes of biodiversity loss, and, increasingly, habitat is fragmented by urbanization. Yet, the degree to which urbanization creates barriers to animal dispersal remains poorly understood. We used population genetic techniques to determine whether urbanization and/or natural landscape features are dispersal barriers to a butterfly, Atrytonopsis new species 1, throughout its range on coastal sand dunes that are increasingly threatened by development. Using AFLP markers that produced 89 polymorphic loci, we found significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1. We found no indication that existing levels of urbanization were barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 dispersal. Rather, two natural barriers, an ocean inlet and maritime forest, explained the genetic structure. Even in areas with long histories of urbanization, we found no significant isolation-by-distance relationship, and there was very low genetic differentiation between sampling locations. Consequently, conservation strategies for Atrytonopsis sp1, and potentially for other mobile insects that use open-structured habitats, should not focus explicitly on habitat corridors through urban areas, but rather should seek to preserve and restore as much habitat as possible across the butterfly's range.

AB  - Urbanization and habitat fragmentation have the potential to influence bird communities. In addition, these phenomena, as well as ongoing lethal control measures, have also greatly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) since the beginning of the 20th century. Although prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence avian communities, few studies have investigated whether these interactions persist in urban settings. Our goal was to investigate the relative impacts of habitat fragmentation and prairie dogs on bird communities within an urban matrix. We performed bird surveys on 20 habitat fragments (10 colonized by prairie dogs, 10 uncolonized by prairie dogs) distributed throughout the Denver metropolitan area, and calculated Shannon-Weiner diversity and richness of all birds and native species, as well as total counts of grassland birds and raptors. Diversity, richness, and counts of many species increased with increasing fragment connectivity, and decreased on fragments isolated for longer periods of time. Avian diversity and richness did not differ between fragments with and without prairie dogs, suggesting that this element of the ecological role of prairie dogs is not fully retained in urban habitat. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as keystone species in urban systems should include other taxa as well as consider the influence of the urban matrix surrounding prairie dog habitat. Our results emphasize that conservation of urban avian diversity should focus on landscape connectivity as well as local habitat features.

AB  - 1. Aquatic macrophyte diversity and water quality of 55 ponds in western Japan were related to land use and morphometric variables to identify the environmental factors that sustain biodiversity and the spatial extent at which these factors operate.
   2. The relevant spatial extent for floating-leaved macrophyte richness (500 m from pond edge) was larger than that for submerged macrophyte occurrence (10, 75 and 100 m), whereas emergent macrophyte richness was best explained at much larger extents (1000 m). Total macrophyte richness was explained at the extent of 500, 750 and 1000 m. The extents relevant for explaining the physicochemical condition of pond water (100 and 250 m) were similar to those for submerged and floating-leaved macrophytes, suggesting that these two growth forms are more sensitive to water quality compared to emergent macrophytes.
   3. Diversity of all three growth forms and that of total macrophytes collectively were inversely related to turbidity and nutrient concentration; among the three growth forms, submerged macrophytes were most affected by water quality.
   4. Negative relationships were found between the proportion of urban area and the diversity of the three growth forms and that of total macrophytes and water quality. Species richness of emergent, floating-leaved and total macrophytes decreased with depth and increased with surface area up to about 5000 m(2), above which it declined.
   5. Urbanisation and enlargement of ponds were the two main factors that decreased aquatic macrophyte diversity in irrigation ponds. To alleviate the adverse effects of urban areas on aquatic macrophyte diversity, our results suggest that management efforts should focus on the creation of buffer zones within the relevant spatial extent from the pond edge.

AB  - Most people on the planet live in dense aggregations, and policy directives emphasize green areas within cities to ameliorate some of the problems of urban living. Benefits of urban green spaces range from physical and psychological health to social cohesion, ecosystem service provision and biodiversity conservation. Green space coverage differs enormously among cities, yet little is known about the correlates or geography of this variation. This is important because urbanization is accelerating and the consequences for green space are unclear. Here, we use standardized major axis regression to explore the relationships between urban green space coverage, city area and population size across 386 European cities. We show that green space coverage increases more rapidly than city area, yet declines only weakly as human population density increases. Thus, green space provision within a city is primarily related to city area rather than the number of inhabitants that it serves, or a simple space-filling effect. Thus, compact cities (small size and high density) show very low per capita green space allocation. However, at high levels of urbanicity, the green space network is robust to further city compaction. As cities grow, interactions between people and nature depend increasingly on landscape quality outside formal green space networks, such as street plantings, or the size, composition and management of backyards and gardens.

AB  - Urban river walls represent some of the most common habitat available to riparian species within heavily engineered urban river corridors, but research into the characteristics and diversity of river walls is very rare. In this study, the flora of urban river walls was surveyed at 16 sites (92 walls) along 32 km of the river Thames through central London to determine the characteristics and habitat origins of species found on these walls, whether these species indicated an urban cliff effect occurring on wall habitats and whether plant species richness varied between different wall types. A total of 90 species were found on the walls, with the majority of species associated with disturbed areas and riparian habitats, supporting the idea of a mass effect occurring, whereby the flora is maintained by propagule pressure from remnant or introduced habitats within urban or peri-urban areas, rather than walls selecting for cliff/rock species. There was an increased incidence of plants from cliff/rock habitats found in the flora however, suggesting that an urban cliff effect does still occur. Species were organized along the river walls based on riparian/terrestrial gradients and stress tolerance, probably reflecting a gradient of wall height above river flows. Plant species richness was significantly higher on brick walls than that on sheet piling, indicating key differences between materials probably based on surface integrity. Large areas of connected river walls (wallscapes) through heavily engineered urban rivers represent potential sites for the enactment of reconciliation ecology via habitat improvement in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Cities contain a diverse range of habitats that support plant establishment and persistence. This study focuses on a particular vertical artificial habitat: masonry retaining walls in Hong Kong. We explored the diversity and co-existence of different plant growth forms, synoptic assessment of habitat conditions, and relationship between habitat factors and vegetation occurrence. Some 270 walls with notable plant colonization in old districts were studied. We surveyed intrinsic wall fabric, extrinsic site condition, tree species and abundance, and other types of plant cover. The data were evaluated with the help of principal component and multiple regression analyses. A wide assemblage of species and growth forms have established spontaneously on walls. The tree flora is dominated by Moraceae (Mulberry family) members, genus Ficus (figs or banyans), and particularly Ficus microcarpa. Trees with strangler characteristics pre-adapted to grow on the vertical habitat are strongly favoured, followed by ruderals and garden escapees. Natives outnumber exotics by a large margin. Multiple wall attributes could be condensed into four factors, classified as water-nutrient supply, habitat connectivity, structure-maintenance, and habitat size. The action of habitat factors on vegetation occurrence hinges on plant growth form and dimension. The occurrence of diminutive lichen-moss is related to the fundamental sustenance water-nutrient factor. The bigger mature trees are more dependent on the larger-scale habitat size factor. The medium-sized plants, including herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings, are contingent upon the dual influence of water-nutrient and habitat connectivity. Spatial contiguity with natural ecosystem can secure continual supplies of seeds, water, nutrient, genial microclimate, and clean air to foster wall vegetation growth. The conservation of walls and their companion flora could avoid degrading or reducing these critical enabling factors. The urban ecological heritage deserves to be protected from unnecessary, misinformed and harmful impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization is currently responsible for widespread declines of amphibian populations globally through the loss, isolation, and degradation of habitat. However, it is not clear how urbanization affects amphibian communities at both local (pond) and landscape scales. We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and examined community relationships with habitat quality and landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found that species richness decreased at ponds surrounded by high densities of human residents and at ponds with high water conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at ponds surrounded by a high proportion of green open space. Ordination of individual species presence-absence data by canonical correspondence analysis largely confirmed these findings. Ordination also highlighted the negative influences of pond shading and density of predatory fish, and the positive influence of aquatic vegetation, on community composition. Individual species' responses to urbanization varied. Urbanization had strong negative effects on species that were associated with well-vegetated, sunny, fish-free ponds. Our study highlights the importance of strategic management actions in urban landscapes to improve terrestrial habitat and connectivity around ponds and other wetlands, and local management actions to improve water quality, remove predatory fish, and plant aquatic vegetation at breeding sites.

AB  - Since urbanisation and fragmentation result in a decrease in larger forests, the importance of isolated trees as habitat in urban landscapes is increasing. This study investigated the contribution of trees in urban landscapes to the abundance and variety of arthropod taxa. Ants and other arthropods were surveyed on the bark of 341 trees in three types of arrangement: isolated trees, trees in linear corridors and trees in patches. Ant species and other arthropods were identified and the numbers on each tree were counted. In order to determine the effects of host tree properties (size and plant species) and the surrounding environment (arrangement of trees, surrounding land cover), an analysis of covariance was conducted. Tree species was the most important influence, followed by tree size, on ants and other arthropods in the urban landscape, with little effect from the arrangement of trees. Thus, in order to increase arthropod diversity in urban landscapes, it is important to select tree species that attract a large number of arthropod taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - P>1. Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located. Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban context.
   2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant.
   3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or multiple gaps.
   4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest. Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of 'most forested route' as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the permeability of heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - The changeability of perception determines the interpretation of many different cities. The ripened experience of urban space is conditioned by atmosphere and by the anthropological and psychological conditions of the beneficiary and the city permits one to ripen one's numerous and invisible images. The exploration of the diversity of the different parts of the city which live together is seen as a value, as has happened for the "historical urban landscape". The theory of "the city within a city" has attracted attention to the membranes and to the spaces of transition of the parts of the city which permits us to see its connectivity as well as its porosity. And on the other hand, the negativity of exclusion aimed at attenuating the communication between the parts has been understood. In the politics of urban renewal, the awareness of "the city within the city" has become predominant, confirming contemporary methodology in urban planning.

AB  - Using 5 years of patch occupancy data for 384 habitat fragments, we evaluated population and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog in urban habitat remnants in the rapidly developing landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we evaluated the landscape factors, including fragment area, age, and connectivity, that characterize the habitat fragments most likely to be colonized by prairie dogs, as well as those experiencing local extinctions. In addition, we determined which patch types were most often removed by land development. Sites in proximity to colonies were more likely to be colonized by prairie dogs. Local extinctions were most common on isolated colonies, and older and more isolated colonies were more likely to be extirpated by human activity. In general, smaller and older habitat patches were at the highest risk of being lost to land development. Our results provide observations of dynamic changes to the distribution of a potential keystone species in an urban area, which can be used to inform island biogeographic and metapopulation models for wildlife persistence in developing landscapes. Although populations are currently in decline, most local extinctions are the direct result of human activity, and we suggest that prairie dogs in this area can persist with appropriate management.

AB  - In order to conserve forest plant species under the particularly high constraints that represent urban surroundings, it is necessary to identify the key factors for population persistence. This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) and high genetic differentiation (F-ST), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.

AB  - The Lobau, a former floodplain area of the Danube River situated within the city limits of Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity led to an increasing loss of aquatic habitats. A water enhancement scheme with a maximum water input of 0.5 m(3) s(-1) was initiated in 2001. The present study assesses the effect of this scheme on biodiversity using three target species groups - aquatic molluscs, dragonflies and fish - following a common Before-After Control-impact design (BACI). Dragonflies and molluscs were positively affected, reflecting the habitat alterations in the system. For fish. no significant impact was observed. The aim of the scheme has been achieved: increased habitat diversity and improved habitat conditions for the system's initial community and further rheophilic/rheotolerant species. Water enhancement schemes can be effective remediation measures and deserve further attention in the management of urban wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization is often identified as a primary cause of species decline. Yet little is known about biodiversity conservation in human settlements, the 'places where people live and work'. In this study, conducted in the densely populated Netherlands, our main objective was to explore new conservation planning strategies to strengthen metapopulations in urbanized landscapes. We focused on a rarely studied part of the city: business sites, the places where people work. We selected eight endangered butterfly species, all habitat specialists of low-productive, early-successional vegetation. Potentially, vacant lots, lawns and green roofs at business sites could offer habitat patches for these butterflies. Our analysis combined national distribution data on both butterflies and business sites. We explored the extent to which the creation of additional habitat at business sites within dispersal distance of adjoining populations could enhance the sustainability of the entire population network. We found that for four endangered butterfly species (Aricia agestis, Hipparchia semele, Issoria lathonia and Ochlodes sylvanus), additional habitat developed at nearby business sites could support a substantial proportion (19-33%) of the currently vulnerable populations in the Netherlands. Moreover, in numerous occasions the business sites could offer sufficient habitat to upgrade vulnerable butterfly populations into viable metapopulations. The present study illustrates that - even for habitat specialists such as the selected butterfly species - urbanized areas may provide yet unexplored conservation opportunities.

AB  - Managing forest landscapes to sustain functional connectivity is considered one of the key strategies to counteract the negative effects of climate and human-induced changes in forest species pools. With this objective, we evaluated whether a robust network of forest connecting elements can be identified so that it remains efficient when facing different types of potential land cover changes that may affect forest habitat networks and ecological fluxes. For this purpose we considered changes both in the forested areas and in the non-forest intervening landscape matrix. We combined some of the most recent developments in graph theory with models of land cover permeability and least-cost analysis through the forest landscape. We focused on a case of study covering the habitat of a forest-dwelling bird (nuthatch, Sitta europaea) in the region of Galicia (NW Spain). Seven land-use change scenarios were analysed for their effects on connecting forest elements (patches and links): one was the simplest case in which the landscape is represented as a binary forest/non-forest pattern (and where matrix heterogeneity is disregarded), four scenarios in which forest lands were converted to other cover types (to scrubland due to wildfires, to extensive and intensive agriculture, and to urban areas), and two scenarios that only involved changes in the non-forested matrix (renaturalization and intensification). Our results show that while the network of connecting elements for the species was very robust to the conversion of the forest habitat patches to different cover types, the different change scenarios in the landscape matrix could more significantly weaken its long-term validity and effectiveness. This is particularly the case when most of the key connectivity providers for the nuthatch are located outside the protected areas or public forests in Galicia, where biodiversity-friendly measures might be more easily implemented. We discuss how the methodology can be applied to a wide range of forest landscape management situations, where both the conservation of the forest critical areas and an adequate management of the landscape matrix between them are of concern to achieve the sustainability of the ecological flows and ecosystem services at the wider forest landscape scale.

AB  - Aim It is generally believed that communities of small organisms, or those with small propagules, are structured mainly by local niche-based processes, and less by dispersal limitation. Conversely, weaker environmental and stronger spatial structure, indicating dispersal limitation, are expected to occur more frequently in communities of large organisms. However, this hypothesis has rarely been tested by comparing spatial and environmental effects across groups of organisms of different size (or with different size of propagules) sampled at the same set of sites. Here, we test it in urban environments. Location Thirty-two cities in 10 countries of Central Europe and Benelux. Methods We compared effects of spatial location and climate on species composition of different groups of organisms sampled in corresponding types of urban habitats. The studied groups were: (1) subaerial cyanobacteria and algae, (2) vascular plants, (3) land snails; and subgroups of vascular plants with different life form and dispersal mode, namely: (4) herbs, (5) animal-dispersed trees and shrubs, and (6) wind-dispersed trees and shrubs. Data were analysed by variation partitioning based on redundancy analysis (RDA) with principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM). Eighteen PCNM eigenvectors (expressing spatial effects) and mean annual temperature, JulyJanuary temperature difference and annual precipitation sum (expressing environmental effects) were used as explanatory variables. Results Pure effects of climate on species composition, indicating niche-based processes, were not significant for any group or subgroup of the studied organisms. In contrast, pure effects of space, indicating dispersal limitation, were significant for all groups and subgroups except herbs. Surprisingly, the community of cyanobacteria/algae possessed much stronger spatial structure independent of climate than communities of larger organisms, although cyanobacteria/algae had the lowest beta diversity among the studied cities. Main conclusions We hypothesize that the community of subaerial cyanobacteria/algae is structured by natural processes which involve dispersal limitation, whereas communities of urban plants and snails are influenced by human-assisted dispersal of their propagules between cities, which results in weaker dispersal limitation. Our study indicates that dispersal vectors can be more important for community structure than size of organisms or of their propagules.

AB  - Monoculture and mixed pastures in Florida provide habitat for a variety of resident and migratory bird species. The objectives of this Study were to investigate the effects of grazing on vegetation structure and bird species richness and abundance in grazed monoculture and mixed pastures. Study pasture units were subject to four cattle grazing intensities: 0 = nongrazed (control), 15 = low, 20 = medium, or 35 = high animal units (AU) per pasture unit (no cattle, 1.3, 1.0, and 0.6 ha . AU(-1), on monoculture pastures and no cattle, 2.1, 1.6, and 0.9 ha . AU(-1), on mixed pastures). Monoculture pastures displayed a greater decrease in spatial heterogeneity of the vegetative community in the presence of grazing than mixed pastures. All increase in grazing intensity led to declines in total avian species richness and abundance and species richness within short-distance migrant, neotropical migrant, and permanent resident guilds oil monoculture pastures. Declines in total species richness and abundance and neotropical migrant guild species richness and abundance were observed on mixed pastures subject to increasing grazing intensity. However, species richness within short-distance migrant and urban guilds and abundance within the grassland guild increased on this pasture type in the presence of grazing. Loss of spatial heterogeneity typically results in a lack of suitable habitat for birds that occupy the extremes of the vegetation structure gradient. This can lead to a loss of species richness and abundance. For the majority of avian guilds, a low grazing intensity of 1.3 ha . AU(-1) and 2.1 ha . AU(-1) on monoculture and mixed pasture, respectively, is recommended to maintain abundance. However, these grazing intensities may result in declines in species richness. Ultimately, if a range of avian species are to be supported on monoculture and mixed pastures, spatial heterogeneity of plant structure and composition must be maintained.

AB  - Determining ecological corridors is crucial for widely applicable to gain more in-depth information on conservation efforts in fragmented habitats. Commonly potential dispersal barriers for large carnivores. employed least cost path (LCP) analysis relies on the underlying cost matrix. By using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, we minimized the problems connected with subjective cost assessment or the use of presence/absence data. We used data on the wolf presence/absence in Poland to identify LCPs connecting patches of suitable wolf habitat, factors that influence patch occupancy, and compare LCPs between different genetic subpopulations. We found that a lower proportion of cities and roads surrounds the most densely populated patches. Least cost paths between areas where little dispersal takes place (i.e., leading to unpopulated patches or between different genetic subpopulations) ran through a higher proportion of roads and human settlements. They also crossed larger maximal distances over deforested areas. We propose that, apart from supplying the basis for direct conservation efforts, LCPs can be used to determine what factors might facilitate or hinder dispersal by comparing different subsets of LCPs. The methods employed can be widely applicable to gain more in-depth information on potential dispersal barriers for large carnivores.

AB  - Urban riparian zones are highly valuable for a range of environmental, social and economic reasons. Despite their ecological complexity, legislative instruments underpinning riparian protection focus predominantly on minimum corridor widths required to fulfill environmental functions. This study sought to identify the dominant environmental variables that influence riparian corridor biodiversity in northern Sydney, Australia. Ant and plant assemblages were sampled from 18 riparian corridors of various widths. Environmental data pertaining to each corridor were collected using field and desktop surveys. Generalised Linear Modelling found perimeter:area ratio and the gradient of the slope perpendicular to the stream to predict significantly ant and plant richness. Plant richness was also influenced by vegetation community type and corridor width. When streamside vegetation communities were considered in isolation, many of the same factors were found to influence species richness. Likewise, Distance-based Linear Modelling identified vegetation community type and landscape connectivity as significant predictors of ant composition both in streamside habitats and those located across the full width of each riparian corridor sampled. While width was the best predictor of plant assemblage composition across the whole riparian corridor, streamside vegetation was influenced more significantly by soil pH. This result arose principally due to a dominance of exotic plants in alkaline soils. Although wider corridors were likely to encompass a greater variety of biotic assemblages, landscape and site scale environmental characteristics appeared to be of greater ecological significance. Environmental managers should therefore consider these factors and target weed invasion when seeking to enhance biodiversity in urban riparian corridors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban development increasingly occupies more landscape and is responsible for habitat alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystems that urban environments can no longer be excluded from the areas to be considered in conservation strategies. Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged.

AB  - Restoration of native forest vegetation in urban environments may be limited due to isolation from native seed sources and to the prevalence of exotic plant species. To investigate urban seed availability we recorded the composition of seed rain, soil seed banks and vegetation at native forest restoration plantings up to 36 years old in Hamilton City and compared these with naturally regenerating forest within the city and in a nearby rural native forest remnant. Seed rain, soil seed banks (fern spores inclusive) and understorey vegetation in urban forest were found to have higher exotic species richness and lower native species density and richness than rural forest. Both understorey vegetation and soil seed banks of urban sites >20 years old had lower exotic species richness than younger (10-20 years) sites, indicating a developmental threshold that provided some resistance to exotic species establishment. However, the prevalence of exotic species in urban seed rain will allow reinvasion through edge habitat and following disturbance to canopy vegetation. Persistent soil seed banks from both urban and rural sites were dominated by exotic herbaceous species and native fern species, while few other native forest species were found to persist for >1 year in the seed bank. Enrichment planting will be required for those native species with limited dispersal or short-lived seeds, thus improving native seed availability in urban forests as more planted species mature reproductively. Further research into species seed traits and seedling establishment is needed to refine effective management strategies for successful restoration of urban native forests.

AB  - The farm pond system for irrigation is the most prominent feature in the Taoyuan area, Taiwan, giving the region a unique landscape and hydrological character. Although this area had more than 3,290 ponds in the 1970s, fewer than 1,800 now remain. This study analyzes changes in irrigation farm ponds and the canal network landscape in the Taoyuan area. The spatial and temporal changes to ponds and the canal network on the Taoyuan plain were examined graphically for each spatial unit (2,765 m x 2,525 m) using aerial photographs for 1979 and 2005. Landscape metrics were calculated to analyze landscape change associated with increased urbanization. Landscape indices of connectivity and circuitry were utilized to describe changes in the configuration of ponds and canal networks. The total length of canals and total number of ponds in the study area decreased significantly during 1979-2005. The average values of connectivity indices (gamma- and alpha-index) also decreased during 1979-2005, reflecting degradation of canal networks due to urban sprawl. A multivariate technique was applied to portion the study area into three zones according to changes to land cover, ponds, and canal networks. The effects of urban sprawl on the spatial pattern of ponds and canal networks are discussed.

AB  - The road network has both positive and negative ecological effects, and understanding these helps identify environmentally preferable solutions for transportation policy and planning. We investigated the relationship between road density and habitat type richness of Greek protected areas. We used digital vector maps of 214 sites included in the Greek Natura 2000 network. We calculated road density for the terrestrial part of each site and correlated it with habitat type richness. Average road density of protected areas (0.377 km/km(2)) was significantly lower than the national road density of Greece (0.446 km/km(2)). We identified 32 sites that were not intersected by roads. These roadless sites were located at mountain tops, at islets, or in remote coastal zones. Overall we found no significant correlation between road density and habitat type richness. We suggest that the effect of road networks on habitat type richness is less apparent at landscapes with long history of human presence, because the landscape (and its habitat diversity) has coevolved with human activities over the past millennia. Our analysis provides a step towards quantifying the effect of road density on the diversity of habitats and consequently on species of conservation interest in international networks of protected areas such as the European Natura 2000 network.

AB  - In fragmented landscapes the matrix, i.e. the surrounding but different habitat, can have a strong influence on the biodiversity in fragments. The amount of natural habitat converted for urban use is increasing on every continent, so fragments of natural habitat are becoming more likely to be embedded in a matrix of human-made habitat, rather than other natural habitats. This is particularly prevalent on urbanised coastlines. Yet there has been little research to help us understand the dynamics and consequences of fragmented coastal landscapes. In Sydney, Australia, most of the natural intertidal landscape of Sydney Harbour (a mosaic of rocky shore, mudflats and sandflats) has been replaced by artificial habitat (such as seawalls). I tested the hypothesis that biota on rocky shores in Sydney Harbour would differ depending on whether shores were embedded in a matrix of artificial habitat (here called 'complete fragments'), natural habitat (here called 'natural patches'), or a mixture of the 2 types of matrix (called mixed fragments). Assemblages at mid-shore levels were significantly different among these types of fragments. At mid- and low-shore levels, assemblages were more variable in mixed fragments than in complete fragments and natural patches. The kinds of mobile and sessile taxa that contributed most to differences among fragments differed, depending on which types of fragments were compared. Many taxa were found in greater abundance in natural patches than in mixed or complete fragments, although not all comparisons were statistically significant. Artificial habitat seems to interrupt natural connectivity among local populations of intertidal marine organisms in this urbanised estuary.

AB  - Context. Urbanisation is recognised as a primary cause of biodiversity loss. Roads are an inherent element of this, creating partial or complete barriers to animal movement. Urban landscapes of eastern Australia are typified by a dense road network interspersed with remnant patches of bushland. Inter-patch movement by tree-dependent gliding mammals may be halted and, consequently, population viability threatened, when canopy gaps over roads exceed gliding ability.
   Aims. We test the notion that a metapopulation of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in southern Brisbane can persist within a highly fragmented urban landscape with large road canopy gaps.
   Methods. We used the population modelling software VORTEX to investigate the influence of inter-patch movement (dispersal) and wildfire on the probability of extinction. Wildfire is an inherent characteristic of this landscape.
   Key results. Our modelling suggests that a lack of inter-patch movement as a result of road barriers, in tandem with wildfire, is associated with a high probability of local extinction. However, a small rate of inter-patch movement can substantially reduce the likelihood of extinction.
   Conclusions. Road-crossing structures are the most plausible means available to link remnants to enable inter-patch movement for squirrel gliders in this landscape because of inadequate road-side tree height. Simulation studies such as the present study that test population viability are critical to convince land managers that action must be taken.
   Implications. The need to conserve urban biodiversity will increase over time, so land managers must consider the likely benefits to population persistence conferred by installing wildlife crossing structures into existing roads.

AB  - With increasing road encroachment, habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructures has been a serious threat for European biodiversity. Areas with no roads or little traffic ("roadless and low-traffic areas") represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.

AB  - Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow among local populations, and has implications for the spread of infectious agents and the control of pest species. Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (similar to 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion.

AB  - Farmland ponds represent habitats with a high conservation value that make a significant contribution to regional biodiversity. Understanding the influence of plant species composition and environmental variables in driving variations in animal species composition in ponds is an important issue in the fields of ecological research and conservation biology. Using variance partitioning techniques to quantify independent effects, we examined how plant species composition, local-landscape configuration and physicochemical variables interact in influencing aquatic insect and amphibian community composition. The ponds investigated in this study were located in the Site of Community Importance - Special Protected Area (Natura 2000 Network) "Monte Labbro - Alta Valle dell'Albegna" (Tuscany, central Italy). Our results showed that: (i) plant community composition (such as Carex hirta, Glicerya fluitans, Potamogeton natans, Typha latifolia) is a good predictor for amphibian but not for aquatic insect species composition; (ii) aquatic insect species composition was more strongly affected by the landscape context, whereas for amphibians the local characteristics of the ponds were determining; (iii) the physicochemical context is a poor predictor for these animal taxa; (iv) lastly, and notably, the explanatory variables explained a high proportion of the total variation in amphibian and aquatic insect species composition. Our results have important implications with respect to the creation of new ponds, which should preferentially take place close to semi-natural grasslands and other wetlands, in order to maintain greater connectivity, and away from urban areas. Moreover, larger ponds are preferable for the preservation of pond biodiversity. The management and conservation of ponds is necessary to ensure the protection of habitats, the survival of individual species and overall pond biodiversity.

AB  - The fragmentation, isolation and sparseness of vegetation in urban areas gives small patches of vegetation enhanced ecological value as habitat islands, compared with rural areas. Habitats as small as an individual tree may provide important landscape linkages across a densely urbanized city. Thus there is a need for micro-scale inventories of whole cities, which should incorporate not just biomass, but also vegetation of different life form, to support different habitat structural requirements. A combination of fine resolution multispectral satellite images from Ikonos, with the image processing technique of Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) permits the identification of different types of urban vegetation at sub-pixel level. Any fractional amount of grass and/or trees respectively within each 4 m Ikonos pixel can be identified.
   To evaluate such fine scale inventory, least cost path (LCP) analysis was performed using pixel fractions representing micro-scale tree habitats. This study adopts an innovative approach by allocating variable weightings to the vegetation fraction amounts within each pixel, rather than to whole pixels. The result is a fuzzy friction surface, which constitutes a very high-resolution database for input to fuzzy querying and decision-making. The friction values represent species' preferences or tolerance levels, and may be varied according to the fraction amounts within a pixel. Automated mapping of least cost pathways over different friction surfaces produced different routes across the study area, the densely urbanized Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong. Comparison of the results with field data of bird sightings indicates the need for high detail in urban ecological analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forests and woodlands are under continuing pressure from urban and agricultural development. Tree-dependent mammals that rarely venture to the ground are likely to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales. Such studies are required to examine the generality of our findings for other tree-dependent species.

AB  - 1. Urban environments are fragmented habitats characterised by the presence of physical barriers, which may negatively affect dispersal and colonisation by insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Conversely, plants growing along pavements may function as dispersal corridors, helping to moderate the harmful effects of resource patch isolation on organism movement and population persistence.
   2. We experimentally tested the effects of walls as physical barriers to the dispersal of the leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae Frost and colonisation of its host plant, Commelina erecta L., in urban habitats. We also evaluated whether plants along pavements could act as corridors for this species.
   3. We exposed experimental host plants to the leaf miner in houses with front gardens and back yards, the latter being completely surrounded by walls. The front gardens had walls but none separating them from the pavement. Previously mined plants were also exposed to parasitoids in the yards to determine parasitoid attack.
   4. Liriomyza commelinae took longer to colonise back yards with higher walls, and the abundance of mined plants along pavements reduced the colonisation time. Leafminer abundance was marginally affected by the yard type, and was lower in back yards. Cumulative parasitism rates decreased with increasing distance at which mined plants were placed from pavements.
   5. Constructions act as physical barriers, having a negative impact on colonisation of host plants by leaf miners. The function of pavements as corridors seems to depend on the abundance of mined plants. Parasitism may be affected by distance from the corridor rather than physical barriers or other potential hosts.

AB  - Urban ecological networks are defined differently in ecology, urban planning and landscape ecology, but they all have linearity and linkage in common. Early urban representations evolved from the constraints of deep ecological structure in the landscape to built elements that must work around natural linear obstacles-rivers, coastlines, dunes, cliffs, hills and valley swamps. Village commons were linked by roads. The Industrial Revolution led to accelerating urban growth, where the role of open space focussed on public health and transport. The Renaissance, Baroque and Picturesque movements accentuated networks in wooded parks, boulevards and sweeping riverine vistas. These provided a new aesthetic and sense of grandeur in the urban centres of European empires and later their colonies. Grafted onto this visual connectivity has been an awakened ecological understanding of spatial dynamics. The emergent notion of ecological corridor functionality provided support for green linear features, although initially this was based on untested theory. The idea of organisms moving along green highways seemed logical, but only recently has unequivocal empirical evidence emerged that demonstrates this functionality. Nevertheless, the main role of corridors may be to provide habitat rather than to act as connectors of nodal habitats. Most organisms can utilise stepping stones, and these may accommodate desired meta-populations while deterring pest movement. Swale drains and treatment wetlands provide riparian services and serve as biodiversity corridors. However, to most people the obvious function is visual-providing green fingers through what would otherwise be urban grey. The health benefits of these are have been demonstrated to be psychological as much as biophysical.

AB  - The concept of greenways becomes relevant also in town and challenges researchers and practitioners. We asked about the construction of this field and its disciplinary origins. For that we have found the scientific literature on the subject over the past three decades and developed a bibliographic corpus has identified the main lexical richness. Our results show that ecosystem services and the inclusion of urban biodiversity increasingly structure the scientific field of urban greenway. Issues of ecological connectivity and reports of humans with nature in cities gradually enrich the issue of green belt. The latest writings particularly emphasize the origin and the multidisciplinary construction of the term, combining ecological, geographical and sociological notions.

AB  - With increasing urbanization the importance of cities for biodiversity conservation grows. This paper reviews the ways in which biodiversity is affected by urbanization and discusses the consequences of different conservation approaches. Cities can be richer in plant species, including in native species. than rural areas. Alien species can lead to both homogenization and differentiation among urban regions. Urban habitats can harbor self-sustaining populations of rare and endangered native species, but cannot replace the complete functionality of (semi-)natural remnants. While many conservation approaches tend to focus on such relict habitats and native species in urban settings, this paper argues for a paradigm shift towards considering the whole range of urban ecosystems. Although conservation attitudes may be challenged by the novelty of some urban ecosystems, which are often linked to high numbers of nonnative species, it is promising to consider their associated ecosystem services, social benefits, and possible contribution to biodiversity conservation.

However, another important question is to what extent humans shape plant distributions by acting as dispersal vectors. In order to answer this question we developed a simulation model for the spread of plant species between human settlements. This was done on the basis of extensive sociological and ecological data on a regional scale. With regard to the sociological data, human movement behaviour defined the amount of exchange between the settlements. Gardening types represented the potential habitat in our model. The ecological data was derived from a vegetation survey carried out in 2003, which was a repeat of a survey between 1974 and 1981 along the same transects. From these surveys, we studied the distributions of 13 species in 67 settlements. In our model, the earlier survey provided the data for the initial distribution. The simulated pattern was consequently compared with the distribution pattern in 2003. In the model, dispersal kernels based on patterns of human movement between settlements led to a better match with the distribution patterns than a null model simulating pure distance dependent dispersal for all species. This was statistically significant for seven of the thirteen species. A striking result was that alien species seem to benefit more from human dispersal than native species. We emphasize the importance of the sociological data on human movement behaviour in parameterizing our regional scale model. This study provides quantitative evidence on the impact of human movement behaviour on the distribution of plant species in suburban areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the impact of recent anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) breeding sites in Wellington County of Ontario, Canada. In addition to geographic distance (average pairwise distance similar to 22 km, greatest distance similar to 50.22 km), four landscape features hypothesized to contribute to genetic differentiation between breeding sites were considered: road density, a major highway (highway 401), canopy cover, and watershed discontinuity. Analysis of data from 396 samples across nine breeding sites using eight microsatellite DNA loci, revealed a small degree of significant genetic structure between breeding sites. The presence of highway 401 and road density were correlated with small but statistically significant structure observed between several groups of sites. One outlier breeding site outside of Wellington County located within the city of Toronto, had significantly lower allelic richness and much larger population differentiation with the Wellington sites. Our data suggest that recent fragmentation has had an effect on wood frog population structure and also demonstrate the importance of dispersal for this species in maintaining levels of genetic diversity.

AB  - With the interactions of river discharge and tide, the balances between water and saline in estuaries are helpful for maintaining biodiversity and landscape diversity. However, the delicate balances have been broken in many estuaries especially in some areas where prosperous cities have been developed. Saltwater intrusion causes serious adverse effects on estuary ecosystems in Pearl River estuary (PRE), China. This paper tries to use a wetland network which is a methodology to divert saltwater to explain how to address the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion and aims to mitigate such intrusion. The existing wetland patches and corridors are connected and form a wetland network with structural and functional connectivity. The patches in the wetland network are assigned to attributes that represent storage capacity of wetlands, and the corridors are assigned to attributes that represent water flow of channels. The results demonstrated that the saltwater intrusion length follows a linear relationship with tidal discharge in the southern part of Guangzhou (SPG, a part of PRE). When the upstream discharge changed slightly, saltwater intrusion cannot be effectively mitigated merely by diverting water from river channels to wetland network during spring tides. This paper provides new insight for management of saltwater intrusion in estuaries.

AB  - The urbanization process is the motor of deep environmental changes at both local and landscape levels. Although more and more studies are investigating the ecological consequences of urbanization, only a few have studied small-scale responses of biodiversity to urban-rural boundary gradients, and even fewer have compared different model groups synchronically. In this study, we compared the responses of two invertebrate groups often used as bioindicators, spiders and carabid beetles, along small-scale boundaries (around 1 km). The following parameters were estimated: assemblage composition, species richness, and activity-densities overall and per life history trait (habitat preference, dispersal abilities for carabid beetles and hunting guilds for spiders). The field data were collected in 2009 using pitfall traps set randomly in hedgerows within urban, boundary and rural zones (30 traps in total). 924 adult spiders belonging to 78 species were collected, whereas the 330 captured carabid beetles belonged to 25 species. We found no evidence of any significant change in carabid beetle activity-density (overall and for most life history traits) or in species richness along the urban-rural gradient. Conversely, there was a significant change in spider activity-density, both per habitat preference and per hunting guild. We also found a progressive change in community composition for spiders. Our results suggest that studying different model groups can provide complementary information about urbanization.

AB  - In South Korea, woodlands are considered to be the most important biotope type for biodiversity conservation. However, they are suffering loss and degradation under strong pressure from urbanisation and agricultural expansion. In this paper, we assessed to what extent the overall decrease in woodland area in the Kwangju City region, South Korea, over a period of 26 years has modified the spatial characteristics of the woodlands at the landscape level. Four landscape types in the Kwangju City region were analysed based on aerial photographs from 1976, 1983, 1994 and 2002. Three landscape ecological metrics were used to monitor the change of ecological woodland conditions. The results indicated that woodland patches have remained very dynamic features over the past 26 years in the case study region. Scattered residential developments and roads were the main causes of woodland loss and fragmentation in the urban and urban fringe landscapes, while the expansion of agricultural activities reduced the average size of woodland patches in the agricultural landscape. The results indicated that the mountain landscape has the greatest value for biodiversity conservation in Kwangju. However, in recent times, woodlands have come under pressure in this landscape type due to the development of tourist infrastructure. This information was used to identify the potential and specific needs for landscape planning in a rapidly developing urban region in South Korea.

The study was divided into two; 1st stage of the classification of the types of greens and 2nd stage of the evaluation of connectivity. In the stage of classification of the type of the greens, the research evaluated the diversity of the vegetation and the value of the possibility of inhabitation of wild birds and then, classified the greens into a core green, which is a patch, base green, and connecting or stepping stone-type green, which is a corridor, in aspect of the landscape ecology. In the evaluation of connectivity, the research also selected and classified the areas for ecological network and suggested the connecting method by conducting the evaluation based on a gravity model with indexes such as area index, conference index, and fractal index, in order to find the relationship between the greens.

AB  - Urban forests adjacent to interstate corridors are understudied ecosystems across cities. Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e.g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape.

AB  - Fishes were sampled from Gillam Park Wetland, a small cypress swamp located within the city limits of Little Rock, AR during Fall 2005. The objectives of this research were to contribute to our knowledge of understudied wetland habitats in Arkansas, determine the status of the fish community in an urban wetland, and provide baseline data for future monitoring of this unique site. We collected 20 total species from three wetland sections (lower, middle, upper). Although fish community composition varied among the sections, species richness was similar across wetland sections. Fyke nets were more effective at capturing fish along the heavily vegetated and structured shorelines than either seines or funnel traps. The fish community residing in Gillam Park Wetland indicates that this "urban wetland" is functioning and seemingly healthy despite its proximity to anthropogenic impacts. Furthermore, Gillam Park Wetland is located along a major physiogeographic boundary that may play an important role in the distribution and conservation of several swamp specialist species in Arkansas.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships across a diverse array of taxa, yet many studies typically focus on conspicuous fauna. Using systematic acoustic surveys, we examine the response of insectivorous bat species to urbanization and quantify species-habitat relationships to classify species in terms of their tolerance or sensitivity. Surveys were conducted in Sydney. Australia, during spring-summer of 2008 in 29 defined 25 km(2) landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bat-habitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each species. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geologies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 12-28% bushland cover within 5 km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix.

AB  - Urban development is increasing across the globe. This poses a major threat to biodiversity, which is often relatively poor in towns and cities. Despite much interest in identifying species' traits that can predict their responses to environmental degradation this approach has seldom been used to assess which species are particularly vulnerable to urban development. Here we explore this issue, exploiting one of the best available datasets on species' responses to towns and cities in a highly urbanized region, comprising avian densities across approximately 3000 British urban and rural 1 km x 1 km grid cells. We find that the manner in which species' responses to urbanization is measured has a marked influence on the nature of associations between these responses and species' ecological and life history traits. We advocate that future studies should use continuous indices of responses that take relative urban and rural densities into account, rather than using urban densities in isolation, or a binary response recording the presence/absence of a species in towns and cities. Contrary to previous studies we find that urban development does not select against avian long-distance migrants and insectivores, or species with limited annual fecundity and dispersal capacity. There was no evidence that behavioural flexibility, as measured by relative brain size, influenced species' responses to urban environments. In Britain, generalist species, as measured by niche position rather than breadth, are favoured by urban development as are, albeit to a lesser extent, those that feed on plant material and nest above the ground. Our results suggest that avian biodiversity in towns and cities in urbanizing regions will be promoted by providing additional resources that are currently scarce in urban areas, and developing suitable environments for ground-nesting species.

AB  - In the United States multispecies habitat conservation plans were meant to be the solution to conflicts between economic development and protection of biological diversity. Although now widely applied, questions exist concerning the scientific credibility of the conservation planning process and effectiveness of the plans. We used ants to assess performance of one of the first regional conservation plans developed in the United States, the Orange County Central-Coastal Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP), in meeting its broader conservation objectives of biodiversity and ecosystem-level protection. We collected pitfall data on ants for over 3 years on 172 sites established across a network of conservation lands in coastal southern California. Although recovered native ant diversity for the study area was high, site-occupancy models indicated the invasive and ecologically disruptive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was present at 29% of sites, and sites located within 200 m of urban and agricultural areas were more likely to have been invaded. Within invaded sites, native ants were largely displaced, and their median species richness declined by more than 60% compared with uninvaded sites. At the time of planning, 24% of the 15,133-ha reserve system established by Orange County NCCP fell within 200 m of an urban or agricultural edge. With complete build out of lands surrounding the reserve, the proportion of the reserve system vulnerable to invasion will grow to 44%. Our data indicate that simply protecting designated areas from development is not enough. If habitat conservation plans are to fulfill their conservation promise of ecosystem-level protection, a more-integrated and systematic approach to the process of habitat conservation planning is needed.

AB  - In urban areas, the requirements of social, economic, and ecological sustainable development are usually intertwined with the problems of land-use intransigence, fragmentation, and deterioration of quality of natural systems. This study aims at the application of ecological principles to develop an integrated urban land-use planning for Panyu case that could optimize the urban ecosystem. Panyu is classified into four functional zones: (1) ecological protection areas, which are important to maintain regional ecological process; (2) restricted construction areas, which can be changed and adjusted over time without losing the conservation potential; (3) suitable construction areas, which are set aside for future development; and (4) built-up areas. Different land-use management measures with emphases either on ecological aims or on construction are proposed. Ecological patches are connected by corridors to form an ecological network, which is spatially flexible and has the potential to integrate development and conservation and make conservation of species diversity adaptive. The writers predict that ecosystem service will increase by 16.91% after the implementation of their plan. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000074. (C) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Cities contain only a low representation of natural and semi-natural habitats, existing in fragments surrounded by built-up areas. In 2003-2004, we surveyed butterflies and Zygaenidae moths in 21 reserves and 4 parks within the city of Prague, Czech Republic, situated from the periphery to city centre. A total of 85 species (47% of the Czech fauna of the study groups) was detected, 22 of them being of conservation concern. Ordination analyses of the local assemblages revealed that the richest sites were large, situated far from the city centre, on alkaline bedrocks, south- to southwest oriented, and hosting high numbers of vegetation types and vascular plant species. We then used generalised linear models to fit responses of individual species to the main ordination gradient, corresponding to increasing urbanisation. Out of 60 species that met criteria for the modelling, none responded positively to urbanisation. Twenty displayed negative linear response; these urban avoiders contained a surplus of mesophilous species presumably preferring rural landscapes. Further 29 species (suburban adaptable) responded in domed manners, peaking at the city periphery. Prevailing among them were xerophilous specialists inhabiting large grassland reserves at the Prague outskirts. Finally, eleven urban tolerant species did not respond to urbanisation at all, containing three highly mobile species, three xerothermophilous specialists, and five species utilising shrubs or trees and finding suitable conditions even in urban parks. Suburban adaptable butterflies apparently benefit from such suburban environments as gardens, road or railway verges, collectively increasing the connectivity of remnants of seminatural habitats. The fact that arboreal species persist even in urban parks, whereas common grassland species are absent there, implies that the quality of urban habitats might be increased by a more sensitive management of urban green spaces, such as leaving aside small temporary fallows or adapting lawns mowing schemes.

AB  - Life on earth is remarkably diverse. Plants, animals, and microorganisms, in response to local and regional environmental conditions have created distinct adaptations that collectively form the interconnected "web of life." This biological diversity and its associated ecological processes represent the planets "natural capital" that underpins human activities, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the materials that clothe and shelter us, countless medical remedies, and the cathartic psychological relief green spaces provide for us. This biological diversity also helps shape our "sense of place."
   There is a growing awareness that the health of the planets biological diversity will to a large degree, determine our own destiny. There is also a growing sense of urgency that biodiversity requires substantially more protection than has occurred to date (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), adopted by over 150 countries, provided a strategy for addressing the decline in biodiversity around the world. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development identified the centrality of biodiversity and the importance of setting conservation targets. And the IUCNs Countdown 2010 program was established to help monitor progress toward stemming biodiversity loss.
   In terms of urban biodiversity the Curitiba Declaration on Cities and Biodiversity (2007) affirmed the importance of biodiversity within cities, signalling the need "to integrate biodiversity concerns into urban planning and development, with a view to improving the lives of urban residents..." Yet, while enhancing biodiversity within cities is a laudable goal, it is a daunting challenge. The scale and pace of urban growth is responsible for the radical transformation of the spatial configuration and ecological processes of local and regional landscapes around the world (Alberti 2005, Dale et al. 2000, McDonnell et al. 1997 Dramstad et al. 1996, McDonnel and Pickett 1990). Natural areas are fragmented. Indigenous fauna are marginalised and extirpated. Hydrologic cycles are irrevocably altered while impervious surfaces increase. Productive soils, centuries in the making, are contaminated compacted, and/or removed.
   One key challenge in addressing urban biodiversity is overcoming the misunderstanding that biodiversity conservation is an optional field of action, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Few local governments have dedicated resources to establishing planning frameworks and implementation strategies to explicitly address biodiversity. This complacency can he attributed, in part, to the complexity and abstraction as to what constitutes biodiversity. Consequently urban planners, elected officials, the development community, and the public continue to focus on land use, zoning, transportation, and infrastructure in isolation of their ecological consequences.
   Fortunately in North America some local governments have begun to engage the complexities of biodiversity conservation by developing regionally integrated spatial frameworks based in large part on Landscape Ecology's patch-corridor-matrix principles (Forman 1995). Simultaneously, proactive site planning and design practices at the neighbourhood and site scale are including biodiversity conservation as an essential program objective. Collectively these initiatives begin to illustrate bow urban design can conserve and enhance biodiversity across a region.

AB  - Taking Xuzhou City as a case, the studies of landscape classification, pattern analysis and eco-environmental impacts evaluation are made using Landsat TM/ETM+ images in this paper. For this purpose, firstly urban landscape information is extracted from Landsat TM/ETM+ images using C5.0 decision tree classification method based on spectral features, texture features and shape information. The results prove that the classification accuracy can meet the requirements of landscape patterns analyzing and evaluating. Then according to classified images, urban landscape pattern is analyzed based transfer matrix and landscape pattern metrics at the scale of landscape and class. Finally, based on the analysis, urban landscape pattern impacts on environment are evaluated qualitatively from three angles: heterogeneity, fragmentation, and edge effect. The results, which indicate that the level of fragmentation, diversity and connectivity of Xuzhou landscape in 2005 is higher than in 1987, but the level of congregation in 2005 is lower than in 1987, can reflect the urban expansion and the change of landscape patterns effectively.

AB  - Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus (BHGs) in urban areas are a public nuisance. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of the BHG foraging in urban areas in winter. The study was conducted in the city of Krakow (southern Poland) in four easily identifiable urban habitats: (1) areas with blocks of flats, (2) areas with congested housing, (3) detached single-family housing and (4) green areas. In each of these four habitats, 60 small (1-ha) plots were randomly chosen, and the bird's presence and abundance were noted. Results revealed that birds occurred most frequently and in the largest numbers in plots with blocks of flats and green areas as well as plots located close to rivers and water reservoirs. This highlights the importance of ecological corridors and stepping-stones for the presence of this species in the city. Food resources had no effect on the presence of the gulls but the abundance of the species was positively correlated with the number of litter-bins. This indicates that local food resources could be more important than large landfills for this species in urban habitats during winter. No human disturbance indices had an effect on the occurrence and abundance of the BHG. Higher temperature and lack of snow cover positively affected utilization of the urban habitats by the species that indicates that global warming may speed up synurbanization of the BHG. To control the number of BHGs in urban areas, we suggest preventing access to local food resources by placing litter bins with waste baskets that are inaccessible to animals. Also, the public should behave appropriately towards gulls and refrain from feeding them intentionally.

AB  - Information on mechanisms of differentiation or homogenization of urban floras is deficient, despite their importance for urban nature conservation and urban land management. Roads, as a major human promoter of urbanization, can be an initial habitat for plants dispersed by transportations. We assumed that variation in weed vegetation along urban-rural roadside gradients is small, particularly in curbside cracks. We classified vegetation occurring in curbside cracks along the National Route 3 in southern japan and compared the characteristics of the vegetation types recognized. Species in curbside cracks were recorded on 40 plots. Three vegetation types were classified, in part related to surrounding land-use types. Although the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the number of native species clearly differed among the vegetation types in the curbside cracks, no significant differences between the three floristic vegetation types were found in the number of non-natives and invasive alien species. This may result from the small specificity and complexity of landscape structures, due to the continuity and connectivity of paved-road networks. Of the 122 species, 44 were non-natives or invasive alien species. The vegetation types generally involved the same plant families, with large numbers of species from the Asteraceae and Poaceae, regardless of vegetation types, but frequency of occurrence of the two families clearly differed between natives and non-natives and invasive alien species. Ephemeral non-natives and invasive alien species. particularly Asteraceae and Poaceae, seem to have advantageous dispersal strategies or low habitat dependency facilitating their occurrence in curbside cracks, regardless of adjacent land uses and the urban-rural landscape gradient. Expansion of these species may cause a homogenization of regional floras along roads. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Linear green infrastructures along rivers and canals serve different functions: Green corridors, or ecological network, maintain biological diversity, improve water quality, and provide areas for fauna and flora to grow and thrive. Greenways connect people with landscape resources and serve as recreational areas that are easy to use and accessible to the greatest number of potential human users. Both ecological networks and greenways are linear structures crossing the landscape, both perform a connecting function in that they are elements created for migration and movement (in one case of flora and fauna and in the other of humans), and both generally contain vegetation. Greenways can be divided into three major categories: ecological greenways, recreational greenways, and greenways with historical/cultural value. When an ecological greenway is planned and designed, human-wildlife conflicts must be minimised.

AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure.

AB  - Coastal vegetation is under increasing pressure with the expansion of urban developments, tourism, population and changing climates. This study sought to examine the effects of fragmentation on the threatened plant community, Coastal Moonah Woodland, in southern Victoria, Australia. We examined the effects on community composition of surrounding land use (urban, rural, native vegetation), remnant size and environmental attributes at three spatial scales. At larger scales, geographic and environmental attributes, such as annual rainfall and temperature, were important drivers of community composition. At finer scales, remnant size, disturbance, weed invasion, connectivity, and immediate surrounding land use impacted more on community composition. At these scales, increasing native vegetation cover in the landscape, remnant connectivity and size positively influenced community composition. If coastal development continues at the current rate, all but a few remnants of this community will be surrounded by the urban landscape. Thus, planning for the integration of these remnants in the urban landscape through long-term management plans and community involvement is essential for the survival of these remnants.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and increasing land use changes due to population and economic growth in selected landscapes is being witnessed of late in India and other developing countries. The cities are expanding in all directions resulting in large-scale urban sprawl and changes in urban land use. The spatial pattern of such changes is clearly noticed on the urban fringes or city peripheral rural areas than in the city center. In fact, this is reflected in changing urban land use patterns. There is an urgent need to accurately describe land use changes for planning and sustainable management. In the recent times, remote sensing is gaining importance as vital tool in the analysis and integration of spatial data. This study intends to estimate land use pattern in a planned and unplanned urban setup and also to analyze the impact of change in land use pattern in the Varanasi urban environment. The results indicate that the planned urban setup had a higher tree cover to that of unplanned area in the Varanasi City, although a considerable disparity existed within the planned urban setups. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts of urban planning and give more consideration to the preservation and management of urban tree cover/greenspace.

AB  - It is currently admitted that developping countries (in particular those of Africa) are witnessing an unprecedented movement of concentration (populations and activities) in urban zones. Although the tendency for population gathering is secular, this movement surprises at the same time by its scale and its rate: the cities have reached dimensions never equalized before while the rhythm of concentration continue to accelerate. The quality of life and the local ecosystems are the first to suffer. This situation has been accompanied by some acute problems like a forte consumption of space and misuse of natural resources.
   Actually, and with the new researchs that have been conducted within the last decade, it has been proven that the idea of city is contradictory with dispersion. The current tendency stresses the concept of 'compacte city'. This concept refers ineluctably to the notion of urban renewal which points up as a primary objective to 'rebuild the city on the city'. This urban policy comes exactly to stand against two logics: the non-controlled expansion of the cities and the deepening of social inequalities within a spatial segregation. It also stands as a new model for the development of the city aiming at saving space and energy, regenerating the degraded urban territories and increasing social diversity.
   In Algeria, it seems that the urban situation of big cities (especially those occupying the coastal fringe of the country) obeys to the same criteria that are enumerated above: flagrant concentration of people and activities, limitless sprawl of agglomerations invading whole agricultural zones, exhaustion and bad exploitation of natural resources... etc. This paper focuses on the impact that the newly launched instruments of town and country planning in Algeria will perhaps have to adjust a critical urban situation. It also emphasises on the role they must play to allow the emergence of real sustainable cities with regard to protecting the environemet and natural resources. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban nature, including residential gardens, can promote biodiversity and increase human wellbeing. Understanding factors that encourage the spread of gardening within cities may help planners facilitate healthier and more biodiverse urban communities. This study characterizes the spatial distribution and attributes of gardens found in easement areas of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Spatial analyses of these privately managed public spaces provide evidence of clustering for both presence of gardens and their esthetic quality. Data collected on the location and attributes of easements from 22,562 properties during summer of 2009, show that 11% of these properties held an easement garden. Results of multiple spatial analyses, each targeting a different aspect of garden distribution, show that (a) the most intense easement garden clustering occurs among neighbors with direct visual access to nearest neighbors' easement areas; (b) it is 2.4 times as likely that a property holds an easement garden if a property within 30 m holds one; (c) although clustering is measureable for all neighborhood sizes up to 610 m from home, peak clustering happens within 91 m of home; and (d) clustering of easement gardens are clustered in terms of quality (appeal), and greatest clustering occurs between pairs of adjacent neighbors. While larger scale factors may play a role in where a garden cluster is initiated, the dominant occurrence of relatively small cluster sizes indicates that social contagion is in play. The potential value of social contagion is discussed as a mechanism for spread sustainable behaviors that support ecological resilience in urban areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temporary aquatic environments are widespread in the world, and although there are considerable regional differences in their type and method of formation they have many physical, chemical and biological properties in common. With the aim to increase knowledge of urban temporary pool fauna, the objectives of this work were to assess the seasonal patterns of species composition, richness, and diversity of the aquatic insect community inhabiting rain pools in urban temperate Argentina, and to identify the environmental variables associated to these patterns. Four temporary pools of an urban green space in Buenos Aires City were studied throughout a 1-year period. Eleven flood cycles with very varied hydroperiods and dry periods, mainly associated with rainfall, were identified. Insect species richness in these temporary urban pools, 86 taxa were documented, was found to be within the range reported for wild temporary water bodies of other regions of the world. The present results provide evidence for the existence of a clear link between habitat and community variability. Hydroperiod and seasonality were the main environmental factors involved in structuring the insect communities of the studied water bodies. Urban pools in green spaces have the potential to act to its dwellers like corridors through the urban matrix. Taking into account these characteristics and their accessibility, urban temporary pools can be considered as promising habitats for the study of ecological processes involving the insect community.

AB  - The current trend towards promoting the conservation of ecosystems has resulted in various studies conducted to determine ways to establish an ecological network. As such, urban ecological networks challenge popular perceptions regarding green space planning and protection. They also emphasize the importance of green spaces as parts of an interconnected system for sustainable urban development. However, until now urban ecological networks have not been applied in urban planning.
   As a result, this study developed an urban ecological network planning (UENP) method based on urban ecology and landscape ecology theory in order to improve the stability of urban ecosystems. First, the evolving definition of an ecological network was examined. Next, the UENP model was established with a focus on green space and land management. Finally, as a case study, a UENP for northeastern cities within the Seoul Metropolitan Area was conducted. Policy implications of these results are also presented. The UENP developed in this study consists of three stages of analysis: 1) green space assessment for urban ecological stability, naturalness, and biodiversity with consideration to development risks; 2) development of an urban ecological network using least-cost path analysis; and 3) examination results with a land use plan to minimize possible conflict. As an approach in urban sustainability, the UENP suggested in this study can be applied to urban green network planning and be used to control urban sprawl and promote biodiversity.

AB  - In Japan, forests associated with shrines and temples are recognized as important components of urban green space, which can potentially function as centers for ecosystem conservation in rapidly urbanizing Japanese cities. In addition to their ecological value, shrine/temple forests have social value, providing recreational and aesthetic needs to residents of urban areas. We review the historical development of shrine/temple forests in Japan and discuss current conservation issues from both ecological and sociological perspectives. Generally, shrine forests are minimally managed and public access is discouraged, whereas temple forests are intensively managed for public display. Shrines tend to be spatially scattered across the landscape but associated with specific geographical features, whereas temples tend to be clustered. Their wide and random distribution in urban areas suggests that shrine forests can potentially be used as stepping stones in the urban green space network, whereas spatially clustered temple forests can be integrated to form large areas of green space. Species diversity of shrine/temple forests declines with decreasing area. The distribution pattern of species is not completely nested, indicating that although conservation of large forest fragments may be effective for maintaining landscape-level biodiversity, smaller forest fragments and adjacent precincts are sometimes significant because rare species occasionally inhabit them. Active management and ecological restoration, such as removal of invasive species, are also important to maintain the desirable near-natural forest conditions. A working group including the owner, community, regional government, and ecologists should be involved in creating an effective, long-term management plan. Because social and cultural values are diverse, basic ecological studies of shrine/temple forests would contribute a scientific basis that fosters public confidence in the process.

AB  - Although the loss of species is often attributed to reductions in habitat area, heterogeneity and connectivity, species specific traits and taxonomic relatedness can be important in explaining which species groups may be most impacted by the fragmentation process. In this study, using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae, Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size, dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time) explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially, with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and mixed-feeders, respectively). Species that differed in body size and dispersal ability did not display differential responses to reductions in habitat area.

AB  - This paper explores the rapid urbanization of Chinese cities with a focus on the plans for a new urban sub-centre in the north-west of Shanghai: Zhenru Urban Sub-Centre. The study relates to the development of new urban sub-centres and the relationship of these sub-centres to `Network City' theory. Urbanization is a defining feature of the 21st century, reshaping cities and communities in countries around the world. Between 2010 and 2030, over 80 per cent of total global urban growth will take place in developing countries - projected to triple their entire urban area (UN-Habitat, 2008) (The World Bank, 2009). This unprecedented urban expansion poses a historic challenge and opportunity to cities, nations and the international development community, and provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to plan, develop, build and manage cities that are ecologically and economically sustainable, and socially more inclusive. As a more urban world emerges, we can see a historic shift occurring, one which will cause dramatic effects on human well-being and the environment. The world is undergoing a massive urbanization process - in certain areas it is happening rapidly - and the number of city dwellers is predicted to increase from 3 to over 4 billion within the next 15 years. Most of this increase will occur in the developing (transitional) world. The trend towards urban network configurations, away from the mono-centric city centre model, can be observed in many large cities around the world. This can be seen both in urban structures and their underlying patterns of activity and mobility, but also in relation to the increasingly pluri-centric nature of decision-making structures. This paper compares two cases of urban patterns for new sub-centres for poly-centric city structures: It relates to the development of new urban sub-centres in Berlin (Germany) and Shanghai (China), and the relationship of these sub-centres to `Network City' theory. As cities move towards more polycentric systems, the case of Potsdamer Platz Berlin, compared to Zhenru Sub-Centre in Shanghai, is discussed. Both are transport-oriented developments promoting mixed-use density and transport-oriented development. According to the documentation by Shanghai municipality, this new urban centre, which is currently in its planning phase, is supposed to become a `sustainable sub-centre for a growing metropolis'. Based on the Potsdamer Platz experience, where a `City within the City' was developed, a series of careful recommendations are formulated for the design and development of the Zhenru Sub-Centre, knowing that it is rather difficult to translate from one case to the other. The conclusion includes five recommendations from Potsdamer Platz for the urban design of such new sub-centres to ensure a delivery of economical, social and environmental sustainable outcomes.

AB  - The rapid growth of cities around the world is now seen as a major contributor to global biodiversity loss and many governments include biodiversity conservation as an explicit policy goal. To help prevent further loss of biodiversity, there is an urgent need for more strategic approaches to conservation planning in urban environments based on a scientific understanding of landscape patterns, species requirements and development pressures. In this study, we demonstrate the use of new conservation planning tools to better integrate information on threatened species into landuse planning. We present a case study in the Greater Melbourne area that utilises the Zonation conservation planning tool with data for 30 threatened fauna species. We perform a multi-species spatial prioritisation that incorporates species-specific connectivity requirements and demonstrate the use of this information in a number of landuse planning contexts. First, we quantitatively assess the differences between Melbourne's current conservation areas with the locations prioritised by Zonation and determine priority areas for their extension. We then show how the prioritisation can be used in decisions regarding Melbourne's Urban Growth Boundary and in rezoning land for development. Finally, we demonstrate how the prioritisation can be used to identify areas of conservation significance within individual developments that account for the wider landscape context. These results demonstrate how conservation planning tools can be better integrated into the different stages of landuse planning for future urban growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In human-dominated landscapes (semi)natural habitats are typically embedded in tracts of unsuitable habitat. Under such conditions, habitat characteristics and grain size of the surrounding landscape may affect how much food, and at what cost, is available for sedentary species with low home-range plasticity. Here we combine behavioural radio-tracking, feather ptilochronology, and landscape analysis to test how nutritional condition varies with home range size in 13 house sparrow [Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)] populations along an urban gradient. Urban individuals occupied smaller home ranges than conspecifics from rural areas, most distinctly if key cover was highly scattered. In urban plots, patch connectivity, home range sizes, and activity areas were positively correlated, indicating that individual ranging behaviour was related to the spatial distribution of suitable habitat. Urban House sparrows also showed the smallest feather growth bars, which were positively related to home range size at plot level. In contrast, growth bar widths and home range sizes were negatively related in rural populations, whereas in suburban populations, both variables varied independently. We conclude that individuals from progressively more built-up areas show a restricted ability to adjust their daily ranging behaviour to the scattered distribution of critical resources. This may complement other putative causes of the widespread population decline of urban house sparrows.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services are crucial for human well-being and the livability of cities. A central challenge for sustaining ecosystem services lies in addressing scale mismatches between ecological processes on one hand, and social processes of governance on the other. This article synthesizes a set of case studies from urban green areas in Stockholm, Sweden-allotment gardens, urban parks, cemeteries and protected areas-and discusses how governmental agencies and civil society groups engaged in urban green area management can be linked through social networks so as to better match spatial scales of ecosystem processes. The article develops a framework that combines ecological scales with social network structure, with the latter being taken as the patterns of interaction between actor groups. Based on this framework, the article (1) assesses current ecosystem governance, and (2) develops a theoretical understanding of how social network structure influences ecosystem governance and how certain actors can work as agents to promote beneficial network structures. The main results show that the mesoscale of what is conceptualized as city scale green networks (i.e., functionally interconnected local green areas) is not addressed by any actor in Stockholm, and that the management practices of civil society groups engaged in local ecosystem management play a crucial but neglected role in upholding ecosystem services. The article proposes an alternative network structure and discusses the role of midscale managers (for improving ecological functioning) and scale-crossing brokers (engaged in practices to connect actors across ecological scales). Dilemmas, strategies, and practices for establishing this governance system are discussed.

AB  - Spatial and seasonal distribution of amphibians in four ponds at mountainous region in southeastern of Brazil: influence of forest corridor. This study evaluated the composition of anuran assemblages, and also the spatial and temporal distribution of those species in four permanent ponds. Two of these ponds are connected to Atlantic rainforest fragments by forest corridor and the other two are surrounded by Eucalyptus plantation and human settlement. Twenty-two species from five families were recorded from December 2003 to November 2004. Most species and individuals collected belong to Hylidae, which presented pronounced spatial overlap. Vegetation under 0.60 m was the most used calling site. Although not statistically supported, species richness and abundance were higher in rainy than dry months. Ponds with corridors had higher species richness and fourteen species were exclusively found on these ponds. The community structure of anurans in permanent ponds at this fragmented landscape is apparently dictated by the presence or absence of forest corridors connecting ponds to forest fragments.

AB  - 1. The spatial structure of plant patches has been shown to affect host-parasitoid interactions, but its influence on parasitoid diversity remains largely ignored. Here we tested the prediction that parasitoid species richness of the specialist leafminer Liriomyza commelinae increases in larger and less isolated patches of its host plant Commelina erecta. We also explored whether parasitoid abundance and body size affected the occurrence of parasitoid species in local assemblages.
   2. A total of 893 naturally established C. erecta patches were sampled on 18 sites around Cordoba city (Argentina). Also, two experiments were performed by creating patches differing in the number of plants and the distance from a parasitoid source. For these tests, plants were infected with the miner in the laboratory prior to placement in the field.
   3. Plant patch size, independently of host abundance, positively affected the number of parasitoid species in both survey observations and experimental data. However, plant patch isolation did not influence parasitoid species richness.
   4. The probability of finding rare parasitoid species increased with patch size, whereas occupation of isolated patches was independent of dispersal abilities (body size) of parasitoid species.
   5. Overall, the results highlight the importance of considering spatial aspects such as the size of plant patches in the study of parasitoid communities.

AB  - Land-use change is a major driver of the global biodiversity crisis, mainly via the fragmentation and loss of natural habitat. Although land-use changes will accelerate to meet humankind's growing demand for agricultural products, conservation planning rarely considers future land uses and how they may affect the connectivity of ecological networks. Here, we integrate land-use models with landscape fragmentation and connectivity analyses, to assess the effects of past and future land-use changes on the connectivity of protected area networks for a highly dynamic region in southeast Spain. Our results show a continued geographical polarisation of land use, with agricultural intensification and urban development in the coastal areas, and the abandonment of traditional land use in the mountains (e. g., 1100 km(2) of natural vegetation are projected to be lost in coastal areas whereas 32 km2 of natural vegetation would recover in interior areas from 1991 to 2015). As a result, coastal protected areas will experience increasing isolation. The connectivity analyses reveal that the two protected area networks in place in the study area, the European "Natura 2000" and the Andalusian "RENPA" networks, include many landscape connectors. However, we identify two areas that currently lack protection but contain several important patches for maintaining the region's habitat connectivity: the northwestern and the southwestern slopes of the Sierra Cabrera and Bedar protected area. Our results highlight the importance of considering future land-use trajectories in conservation planning to maintain connectivity at the regional scale, and to improve the resilience of conservation networks.

AB  - Some structures developed for particular technical anthropogenic uses are colonized by biodiversity, but their potential roles have not been seriously considered. Here, we examined whether and how highway stormwater retention ponds are colonized by amphibians and are used as reproduction sites in human-dominated landscapes.
   We addressed their role as habitats for amphibians by sampling amphibians in highway ponds (n = 58) and in surrounding non-highway ponds (n = 45) and comparing the species richness and the amphibian abundance using occupancy models that take detectability into account.
   As expected, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. Surprisingly, we found seven different amphibian species with breeding populations, including one emblematic rare species (Triturus cristatus), in these artificial ponds. Further, the proportion of the highway ponds where amphibians were detected was about similar to that of surrounding ponds. Note, however, that the amphibian abundances were lower in highway ponds.
   Surprisingly, our results suggest that highway ponds may contribute in altered landscapes to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Because the adoption of biodiversity-friendly management measures for these artificial ponds could promote biodiversity in such landscapes, we highlight the most important factors driving amphibian distribution in these ponds. Due to the importance of these issues, we stress the need for complementary studies to continue to precisely examine the potential roles of these ponds as habitats for amphibians and then to propose, if useful, technical pond design and management recommendations relevant for common biodiversity.

AB  - The ocelot Leopardus pardalis has become a conservation priority in the US as a result of severe population decline and loss of habitat during the 20th century. Only two small populations remain in this country. Their short-term viability is threatened by the disappearance of dense thornshrub communities, human-caused mortality and demographic stochasticity. The influence these factors have on ocelot persistence must be considered to develop effective conservation initiatives. We therefore examined neutral genetic diversity and connectivity among ocelots in the US and northeastern Mexico using 25 autosomal microsatellites and a 395-bp segment of the mitochondrial control region. Genetic variation was lowest in the population occurring on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Texas (autosomal microsatellite HE=0.399 and mtDNA-haplotype diversity=0) and highest in northeastern Mexico (0.637 and 0.73, respectively), while intermediate on private lands in Willacy County, Texas (0.553 and 0.252, respectively). Significant genetic differentiation between the two Texas populations was observed, despite their close proximity (similar to 30 km). Both populations were also significantly divergent from northeastern Mexico. The absence of any detectable gene flow implies that the human modified landscape of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas acts as a strong barrier to ocelot movement, disrupting metapopulation dynamics and contributing to loss of diversity. As a consequence, continued genetic erosion among the Texas populations is expected. The lack of movement through the fragmented landscape also suggests it is unlikely ocelots will recolonize unoccupied habitat patches along the Lower Rio Grande and the delta interior where agriculture and urban land uses predominate. The continued rapid development will exacerbate this problem. These factors threaten the persistence of the Texas populations and limit their recovery. Translocations are necessary to link ocelot populations in the US.

AB  - Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations.

AB  - After the eruption of the Chaiten Volcano (Chile) and the destruction of the neighboring Chaiten city, some alternative sites were evaluated for the relocation of administrative facilities and housing for the displaced. Three towns (Fandango, Santa Barbara and Bahia Pumalin) were evaluated by means of a multi-criteria analysis, including the impact that a new urban development would have on local biodiversity. This impact was evaluated through a landscape analysis. The landscape attributes studied were (1) composition and representation of each ecosystem type, (2) connectivity, and (3) environmental value, based on a classification of the prevailing ecosystems and their respective stages of succession, defined as a function of ecosystem heterogeneity and maturity. Landscape metrics were calculated from LANDSAT 5 satellite imagery (November 17(th), 2008) with ArcView (R) 3.2 (ESRI) and Fragstats, including the surface cover of each ecosystem type, the number of patches and the cohesion index (CI). Environmental value was determined qualitatively in situ. Santa Barbara was selected by authorities as the best place for New Chaiten City. Over 70% of this is area is covered by forest, achieving a high degree of forest connectivity (CI > 99.0) and shrubs (CI > 94.0), with an advanced stage of succession, a high level of heterogeneity (species and strata) and a high level of inland environmental value. On the coast, Santa Barbara has anthropic influence, but maintains an advanced state of succession, a high level of heterogeneity, and a medium-high degree of environmental value. Regarding the future urban development at this location, the recommendations were: maintenance of riverside integrity and the continuity of forests in Santa Barbara. The proposed methodology proved to be: (1) useful for biodiversity assessment, despite the lack of information at species level, (2) easily replicable, due to the use of standard categories (ecosystem types) and easier access to satellite images, and (3) able to integrate environmental criteria at early stages of decision making in land use and urban planning processes

AB  - The spatial arrangement of reserves within a network is critical to the long-term persistence of dispersing species. In this paper, based on network environ analysis, an approach is presented to explicitly measure such ecological function, in which the dispersal-based interactions between reserves are considered from a holistic view by exploring not only species' direct dispersals but also their indirect ones. The proposed method first defines the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserves as the probability that a species will survive for long time in a reserve network, and then expands this function by taking the reserve loss into account when evaluating a species' extinction probability at each reserve. A case study for L. nycthemera and M. thibetana from Wuyishan Nature Reserve, Fujian Province, China, is further conducted. The highest probabilities of lone-term survival are identified for both species in the reserve networks that contain several migrations with high successful dispersal probability. In addition, the path number of each common reserve under neighboring scenarios is found to be influenced by the changes of direct dispersal, from which the criteria for protecting and optimizing the spatial configuration of reserves in a nature reserve are derived. For Wuyishan Nature Reserve, these criteria may act as important bases to restrict and guide the development of tourism of surrounding cities and the socio-economic activities of local residents. It is concluded that the proposed method can provide an effective way to examine the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserve network and contribute to species' long-term persistence in nature reserves.

AB  - Land use rules in the Brazilian environmental legislation were not explicitly designed to protect key areas for biodiversity In this paper, we evaluated the degree to which areas legally protected as 'Permanent Preservation Areas' (PPA) match key areas for biodiversity conservation in the suburbs of Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. The analysis was based on the structure and spatial context of natural biotopes and the distribution of potential habitats of endangered species. Urban areas cover 22% of the study area, while PPAs cover 25.8%. Of the total area, 21.5% and 28% were considered, respectively, important for biodiversity according to coarse and fine filter approaches. Forty percent of the PPAs coincide with important areas for biodiversity, protecting 27.5% of them. Banks of bodies of water more than expectedly contributed for the protection of important areas. We conclude that the current Brazilian legislation on land usage is not enough to protect key areas for biodiversity We discuss complementary approaches and the challenges to fulfilling biodiversity conservation needs.

AB  - While food webs have provided a rich vein of research material over the last 50 years, they have largely been the subject matter of the pure ecologist working in natural habitats. While there are some notable exceptions to this trend, there are, as I explain in this paper, many applied questions that could be answered using a food web approach. The paper is divided into two halves. The first half provides a brief review of six areas where food webs have begun to be used as an applied tool: restoration ecology, alien species, biological control, conservation ecology, habitat management and global warming. The second half outlines five areas in which a food web approach could prove very rewarding: urban ecology, agroecology, habitat fragmentation, cross-habitat food webs and ecosystem services.

AB  - The Alliance for Healthy Cities is an international network of cities and organizations aiming at protecting and enhancing the health of city dwellers. It was founded by following the global movement of Healthy Cities and scaling up this movement in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization. To cope with the adverse effects of an urban environment on health, the network encourages information sharing within cities and between cities, both nationally and internationally. This network emphasizes learning from diversity; city-to-city exchanges; exchanges of experiences in various sectors/levels; sharing practical procedures; learning from communities; recognition of, and learning from, good practices and progress; sharing evidence based on actual practices and scientific evaluation; linking global and local agendas; and international activities to expand capacities in local settings. Evaluation by the members of this network was carried out to identify progress in cities, the advantages of being part of a network, measures to strengthen Healthy Cities initiatives, and areas for research by taking advantage of a network of Healthy Cities. Activities of the network have expanded the interests of various stakeholders at the local, national, and international levels, and have involved government, academic, community, and private sectors.

AB  - Most propagule bank research has been conducted in rural areas and has emphasised agricultural soils, although research on rural riparian propagule banks has expanded rapidly over the last decade. This paper presents observations of the species abundance of plant propagules in urban riparian soils along the River Brent, Greater London, UK. The data are analysed to explore changes in species abundance of the propagule bank with depth (0-5 cm compared with 5-10 cm soil layer), with distance from the river (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m), and at different locations on the river network. No significant differences were found in propagule abundance with soil depth or distance from the river's edge, but significantly more species were found in the propagule bank close to the river's edge. The species composition of the Brent's propagule bank is then compared with riparian propagule banks from the rural rivers Dove, Frome and Tern, UK. Species richness of the Brent propagule bank samples was generally lower than was found in the three rural rivers and, in total, 21%, 4%, 5% and 4% of observed species were aliens in the Brent, Dove, Frome and Tern soil samples, respectively. When the species present in the Brent's propagule bank were compared with published data on urban garden soils in another UK city, the latter were found to support a higher number of alien species, suggesting that other propagule sources to urban river systems support lower numbers of alien species in riparian zones than domestic gardens.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of landscape on the distribution of Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus Temminck, 1845 hares along a rural-urban gradient. We surveyed the presence of hares in 62 forest patches in the Tama Hills, which spreads from forested mountains to the urban core, and found signs of hares in 23 patches. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size, connectivity, and land cover of the surrounding area (forest, residential and few agricultural area) by logistic regression. To select the most appropriate spatial scale and time period, we conducted a variable selection for all combinations of buffer size (250-, 500-, 1000- and 2000-m radius), and year (1974, 1984 and 1994). We calculated Akaike weight for the best model to measure the importance of each variable. The model for the best combination of buffer size and year was 500 m in 1994. We conclude that recent landscape determines the occurrence of hares. Forest patch size and percentage of forest cover were important variables in the best model. To protect the wild hare population in suburban areas, it is important to conserve areas of forest that have at least 500 m radius. These areas must be continuously maintained, as hares respond rapidly-to changes in landscape.

AB  - P>1. Linear features associated with transportation and riparian corridors are known to inhibit the mobility of birds and other wildlife, yet the factors contributing to their barrier effects are poorly understood. The diversity of roads in urban landscapes provides an opportunity for elucidating the relative importance of factors such as noise, traffic volume, gap width and adjacent vegetation on animal movement.
   2. Using an avian mobbing call as a lure, we tested the willingness of forest songbirds to cross four types of linear features in the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: (1) roads of varying widths and traffic volumes, (2) conventional railways and light transit lines, (3) transportation bridges across riparian corridors, and (4) rivers.
   3. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement (P < 0 center dot 001). As the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m, the likelihood of movement decreased dramatically and by 45 m, birds were only half as likely to move across gaps as they were to move an equivalent distance in continuous tree cover. Traffic volume also had a significant dampening effect on movement (odds ratio = 0 center dot 952 per 1000 vehicle per day increase; P < 0 center dot 001) and generally explained more variation in the data than noise levels.
   4. Railroads proved to be the most permeable of the features we tested, probably owing to their relatively narrow width, which never exceeded 30 m. Surprisingly, rivers were less permeable than the anthropogenic linear features we tested, with a significant barrier effect evident even at widths < 50 m.
   5. The birds in our study showed a marked preference for flying over, rather than under, transportation bridges, particularly when adjacent vegetation was available.
   6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that linear features, both anthropogenic and natural, can significantly impede the movements of forest songbirds and that managing adjacent vegetation is a potentially effective way to mitigate these barrier effects in cities and other fragmented landscapes.

AB  - In this paper we propose to leverage the public transportation system of any given city to obtain a scalable and efficient urban backbone by deploying an opportunistic network on buses. The paper proves that Bus Switched Networks (BSNs) are feasible for deployment in real cities and that they can meet the application level requirements for a large class of applications by ensuring high delivery ratio and acceptable delays under different conditions of packet load. We envision a multi-platform metropolitan network backhaul where BSNs play a relevant role and focus on a novel and lightweight probabilistic routing protocol. We prove that the protocol is highly effective in satisfying the loose QoS required by urban-wide delay-tolerant information services and perfectly scales to urban level. The protocol performance evaluation derives from an benchmark analysis of the protocol on three cities which have been selected to explore geo and structural diversity. Finally, the paper presents URBeS, an analysis platform that, given a specific city served by public transportation, produces bus mobility traces and traffic analysis for any given routing protocol.

AB  - This study utilized a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) to identify the distribution of bird diversity in urban and suburban areas of the Taipei basin. The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands. The maps could also be utilized in network planning of green belts or corridors for ecological conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An increasing proportion of refugees worldwide now live in urban spaces, where their rights to adequate shelter, education and employment opportunities must be considered. In the European Union, a number of countries have tightened their immigration policies and adopted dispersal schemes which disperse refugees to urban environments. However, little is known about the circumstances of refugees once they have moved into permanent accommodation in these cities, how they cope and whether they stay or move on. This paper explores the impact of dispersing refugees to urban areas by drawing on a case study of refugees living in Glasgow, a major dispersal site for refugees in the UK. It reveals the diversity and complexity of the unique challenges that refugees face, including within the home and the neighbourhood. Four strands of policy implications flow from this: the need to facilitate refugee identification in urban areas; the importance of ensuring protection from racial harassment; the need for diversified approaches towards tenancy sustainment and the difficulty of predicting the impact of 'no-choice' dispersal policies.

AB  - The metapopulation framework considers that the spatiotemporal distribution of organisms results from a balance between the colonization and extinction of populations in a suitable and discrete habitat network. Recent spatially realistic metapopulation models have allowed patch dynamics to be investigated in natural populations but such models have rarely been applied to plants. Using a simple urban fragmented population system in which favourable habitat can be easily mapped, we studied patch dynamics in the annual plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). Using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) and multi-year occupancy data we dissected extinction and colonization patterns in our system. Overall, our data were consistent with two distinct metapopulation scenarios. A metapopulation (sensu stricto) dynamic in which colonization occurs over a short distance and extinction is lowered by nearby occupied patches (rescue effect) was found in a set of patches close to the city centre, while a propagule rain model in which colonization occurs from a large external population was most consistent with data from other networks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of external seed sources in urban patch dynamics. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that plant distributions are governed not only by habitat properties but also by the intrinsic properties of colonization and dispersal of species. The metapopulation approach provides a valuable tool for understanding how colonization and extinction shape occupancy patterns in highly fragmented plant populations. Finally, this study points to the potential utility of more complex plant metapopulation models than traditionally used for analysing ecological and evolutionary processes in natural metapopulations.

AB  - Revealing the dispersal of dengue viruses (DENV) in time and space is central to understanding their epidemiology. However, the processes that shape DENV transmission patterns at the scale of local populations are not well understood, particularly the impact of such factors as human population movement and urbanization. Herein, we investigated trends in the spatial dynamics of DENV-2 transmission in the highly endemic setting of southern Viet Nam. Through a phylogeographic analysis of 168 full-length DENV-2 genome sequences obtained from hospitalized dengue cases from 10 provinces in southern Viet Nam, we reveal substantial genetic diversity in both urban and rural areas, with multiple lineages identified in individual provinces within a single season, and indicative of frequent viral migration among communities. Focusing on the recently introduced Asian I genotype, we observed particularly high rates of viral exchange between adjacent geographic areas, and between Ho Chi Minh City, the primary urban center of this region, and populations across southern Viet Nam. Within Ho Chi Minh City, patterns of DENV movement appear consistent with a gravity model of virus dispersal, with viruses traveling across a gradient of population density. Overall, our analysis suggests that Ho Chi Minh City may act as a source population for the dispersal of DENV across southern Viet Nam, and provides further evidence that urban areas of Southeast Asia play a primary role in DENV transmission. However, these data also indicate that more rural areas are also capable of maintaining virus populations and hence fueling DENV evolution over multiple seasons.

AB  - Based on GIS and CBERS/CCD which was obtained on June 16, 2006, patches of urban green in the main urban areas of Chengdu are extracted using many quantitative indicators and by method of decision tree classification, according to principles and methods of landscape ecology. Patches of urban green are divided into four grades, and they are respectively small-scale patch, medium-scale patch, large-scale patch and special large-scale patch. The area proportion of small-scale patch is 3.8%, and that of medium-scale patch is 11.1%, that of large-scale patch is 22.3% and that of special large-scale patch is 62.8%. The results of fragmentation, contagion, diversity index, dominance and evenness are obtained. They are 0.854, 0.600, 0.657, 0.730 and 0.690 respectively. The research results think that scalability characteristics and divisional differences of green patches are obvious. A little number of green whose area is bigger mainly is composed of scenic spots, gardens and universities. There are many problems, for example, connectivity of urban green is low, structure of landscape is single, and spatial distribution is unbalanced. So, the government should attach importance to greening and management of urban and rural transitional zone which is being developed now.

AB  - This paper assesses the response of four common species of forest dependant insectivorous birds to an urban-forest gradient. The presence or absence was recorded for each species in landscapes that varied in landscape and site level attributes. Landscapes were classified into three categories based on their level of urbanisation. Broad comparisons across the landscapes were used to determine species specific response to increasing levels of urbanisation. Site level attributes were modelled to predict the patch occupancy for each species in each of the landscape types. Two broad trends were identified: the superb fairy wren (Malurus cyaneus) and white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) displayed a tolerance to urbanisation and the eastern yellow robin (Eosaltrica australis) and white throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaeus) demonstrated a threshold response to urbanisation. The density of roads (-ve) and the extent of tree cover (+ve) in a landscape were highly correlated with the occurrence of urban sensitive species while at the site level the density of roads and density of rivers were the strongest contributors to their presence. The marked differences in the isolation and connectivity of patches where the threshold for urban sensitive species ceases are the likely contributors to their decline and sensitivity to suburban habitats. Conservation and management of urban sensitive species is largely dependant on the way urban development is managed. Of critical importance is careful planning in urban-fringe environments.

AB  - Slovenia has one of the most extensive Natura 2000 networks in Europe with 259 SAC's covering 31.4% of the country. To determine how well does the current network cover the areas of high butterfly diversity and/or aggregation of the butterfly species of conservation concern, the data from the recent survey for a distribution atlas were used. Altogether 99,423 records of 173 species collated after 1979 were used. The data distribution is slightly biased towards SAC's, with 44.8% of localities within them, most likely due to sparsely sampled urban areas and intensive farmland areas which are found only outside SAC's. The diversity and distribution of red listed species was evaluated at a 5 x 5 km grid square level. Additionally the importance of the size of the SAC's was compared to their butterfly species diversity. In general the high diversity areas also hold the largest aggregation of red listed species with core areas concentrated in SW Slovenia. The SAC's cover majority of areas with high diversity and the distribution of all but one threatened butterfly species. That species is Colias myrmidone, which is now considered extinct in Slovenia with no records after 1993. The most prominent areas with high conservation value in Slovenia not included in the SAC's network are the Koroka region, Gorika Brda region, lower Sava River valley and Slovenske Gorice region. The butterfly diversity in small SAC's is relatively high with increases in size only gradually increasing the species numbers, thus emphasizing the importance and conservation value of small SAC's for sustaining high butterfly diversity in Slovenia.

AB  - Urbanisation is a significant threatening process for amphibians, causing loss of habitat, altered hydrology and increased mortality. Impacts operate at different spatial scales and consequences vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. Most studies of the impact of urbanisation on anurans have occurred in large metropolitan cities. There is a paucity of research in smaller urban settlements where the impacts of development may be less pronounced. We examined the richness and occurrence of anuran species in wetlands in regional towns in south-eastern Australia as a factor of natural and built features occurring at multiple spatial scales, and the socio-economic characteristics of surrounding neighbourhoods. Anuran species richness declined with increasing isolation of wetlands and reduced cover of terrestrial vegetation. The occurrence of two wide-spread anuran species was negatively related to level of urban intensity and positively related to neighbourhood vegetation cover, whereas the converse was true for a third common species. Vegetation cover was greater in neighbourhoods with 'higher' socioeconomic status (e.g. more disposable income). These less developed neighbourhoods occurred on the fringes of towns, often in elevated locations, and tended to support more anuran species. The level of urban intensity increased closer to town centres and more developed neighbourhoods with lower socio-economic status were often built in low-lying areas where wetlands tend to form naturally. Yet, these neighbourhoods harboured few anuran species.
   Our study suggests that careful planning of low-lying neighbourhoods near town centres and periurban neighbourhoods on town fringes is required to ensure anuran conservation in urban settlements. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A modified social network analysis model was designed in this study for use in the examination of the international air network. By using this model in analyzing the networkability of cities, the connectivity of the air routes was estimated, using the air traffic and the number of air routes. Networkability is the quantitative measurement of the spatial interaction relationships in the international air network. Through this process, this study aims to analyze the structural changes of the global network in 1992 and 2004. As a result, it was observed that London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and New York were class 1 cities that were at the top in both years. Tokyo was included in class I in 1992, but not in 2004. Rome, Zurich, Singapore, Los Angeles, and other cities were identified as the class 2 cities in 1992, while Singapore, Tokyo, Madrid, Hong Kong, Bangkok, etc. were identified as the class 2 cities in 2004. These cities occupy the center of the global network, and the class 1 cities are connected to the class 2 cities, which perform the function of hubs in each continent, thus uniting the whole world as one network.

AB  - Fire causes a reduction of plant cover due to the death of several structures, especially of those that are not isolated from high temperatures; such as seeds and fruits. After a disturbance the availability of diaspores is crucial for the recovery of the community. This work studied the composition and abundance of the seed rain in the xerophytic shrubland of the Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve, located at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico campus in Mexico City, which was affected by a surface fire. In order to understand the role of diaspores in the natural regeneration of a burned site, seed traps were placed on 2 sites, one affected by the fire and the other in an unburned location. During 1 year the dispersed seeds and fruits were collected and identified. Results showed that species richness, life forms, and dispersal syndromes were different between sites. The highest abundance and richness values were observed in the burned site. This work offers basic data on the availability of species as diaspores, information which is useful for potential restoration strategies especially in those areas under constant anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Protecting riparian corridors is a commonly applied environmental policy in urban landscapes. However, empirical data demonstrating their efficacy for biodiversity conservation outcomes is scarce. In this study we investigated whether riparian corridor width influences the diversity and community structure of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and vascular plant assemblages therein. Eighteen corridors of differing widths were selected from within the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area, Sydney Australia. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps positioned within rectangular vegetation transects (30x10 m). Both ant and plant species richness, when standardised for sampling effort, were unrelated to riparian corridor width. However, significant compositional differences between sites were evident with increased width up to similar to 50 m. Narrow corridors contained greater abundances of opportunistic ant species and higher proportions of exotic plants. We interpret this to be the result of the greater disturbance/edge influence derived from adjacent upland urban environments. Site beta diversity did not increase with corridor width, suggesting that the exclusion of novel upslope habitats in narrow riparian corridors is not a significant cause of community assemblage modification at these sites. To minimise the impact of deleterious edge effects on ant fauna, environmental managers should seek to retain riparian corridors wider than similar to 50 m. However, we observed substantial between-site variability of biotic assemblages, irrespective of corridor width. Therefore we recommend that environmental management practice needs to take a catchment-wide approach and consider other parameters that may contribute to riparian health so as to optimise the protection of riparian biodiversity.

AB  - Scholars from a range of disciplines have long recognized that a city's economic fortunes are closely tied to its position in networks of interurban exchanges. However, it remains unclear whether cities occupy a central position in the network because they are sites of significant economic activity (i.e., a flow generation hypothesis), or whether they experience greater economic growth because they occupy a central position in the network (i.e., a structural advantage hypothesis). This article tests these complementary hypotheses by examining the total nonfarm employment in, and air travel patterns of business passengers among, 128 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1993 to 2008 using a series of lagged regression models. Results lend support to the structural advantage hypothesis, but not for the flow generation hypothesis: centrality drives employment, but not vice versa. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for infrastructure-focused approaches to economic development.

AB  - Stormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines.

AB  - Land cover and land use surrounding, fragmented habitat can greatly impact species persistence by altering resource availability, edge effects, or the movement of individuals throughout a landscape. Despite the potential importance of the landscape matrix, ecologists still have limited understanding of the relative effects of different types of land cover and land uses on species patterns and processes in natural systems. Here we investigated whether Neotropical resident bird communities in limestone forest patches differed if they were embedded in three different human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, pert-urban development, and bauxite mining) relative to sites in continuous forest in central Jamaica. We found that species richness, community composition, and abundances were matrix-dependent, with agricultural landscapes supporting greater avian diversity and more intact community assemblages than either pen-urban or bauxite landscapes. Abundance of almost 70% of species differed in forest embedded in the different landscape matrix types. Traits related to resource use best predicted species responses, including diet guild, nest height, habitat association, and foraging strata. Insectivores, frugivores, canopy nesters, understory and canopy foragers, and forest-restricted species rarely observed in matrix habitats had lower abundances in forest fragments embedded in human-dominated matrix types than in continuous forest. In contrast, nectarivores, omnivores, granivores, ground and multi-strata nesters, ground foragers, and species regularly in matrix habitats were least sensitive to forest fragmentation. Results suggest that structure, composition, and land use disturbance regimes in matrix areas impact overall habitat quality in landscapes by potentially mediating resource availability inside as well as outside forest habitat. This study reinforces the importance of differentiating among land cover and land uses in fragmentation research and lends support to the hypothesis that resource availability may be a primary factor driving Neotropical bird responses to fragmentation.

AB  - Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) is endangered primarily because of habitat loss and fragmentation, and overhunting throughout its distribution range (ca. 21,000 km(2)) in the Mexican states of Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and possibly Yucatan and Tabasco. The number of tapirs occurring in Mexico is estimated around 2,600 individuals, which are also threatened by factors such as forest fires, large-scale infrastructure projects (building of dams and highways), disease transmission from domestic animals, pollution of water bodies, and global climatic change effects. A strategy for tapir conservation in Mexico should include: 1) protection and management of extant habitat; 2) creation and maintaining of corridors among isolated forest fragments containing tapirs; 3) community-based control of poaching; 4) development of economic alternatives for people living near tapir habitat; 5) captive breeding programs with educational, scientific, and conservationist purposes; 6) environmental education and communication programs in rural and urban areas near tapir habitat; and 7) research on distribution, abundance, habitat use and availability, population status, movement patterns, feeding habits, genetic variability, interactions with domestic species, diseases, and responses to habitat fragmentation, hunting, and global climatic change.

AB  - Tree-dwelling mammals are potentially highly vulnerable to discontinuities in habitat created by roads. We used population modeling to assess the viability of a metapopulation of Australia's largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastest-urbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with metal flashing prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This can be reduced to an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat.

AB  - South Africa's moist grassland harbours globally significant biodiversity, supplies essential ecosystem services, supports crop and livestock agriculture, forestry and settlement, yet is poorly conserved. Ongoing transformation and limited opportunity for expanding the protected area network require instead that biodiversity conservation is 'mainstreamed' within other land uses. This exercise sought to identify the relative compatibility of 10 land uses (conservation, livestock or game ranching, tourism/recreation, rural settlement, dryland cropping, irrigated cropping, dairy farming, plantation forestry, and urban settlement) with maintaining biodiversity integrity. This was assessed using 46 indicators for biodiversity integrity that covered landscape composition, structure, and functioning. Data was integrated into a single measure per land use through application of the analytic hierarchy process, with supporting information gained from interviews with experts. The rank order of importance amongst indicators was landscape structure. functioning and composition. Consistent differences among land use, for all three categories revealed two clear groupings. Conservation, livestock or game ranching had the lowest impact and retained substantial natural asset. while that for tourism/recreation was intermediate. All other land uses had a severe impact. Impact on biodiversity integrity depended mainly on the extent of transformation and fragmentation, which accounted for the greatest impact on habitats and species, and impairment of landscape functioning. It is suggested that a strategic intervention for maintaining biodiversity integrity of moist grassland is to support livestock or game ranching and limit ongoing urban sprawl. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest cover in the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana was fragmented due to agricultural conversion beginning more than 175 years ago. Currently, urban expansion is an important driver of land-use change in the basin. A land transformation model was applied to the basin to forecast land use from 2000 to 2020. We assessed the effect of this projected land-use change scenario on five forest rodent species at three scales: using occupancy models at the patch level, proportional occupancy models at the landscape level, and ecologically scaled landscape indices to assess the change in connectivity at the watershed level. At the patch and landscape scales, occupancy models had low predictability but suggest that gray squirrels are most susceptible to land-use change. At the watershed scale, declines in connectivity did not correspond with the decline of forest. This study highlights the importance of map resolution and consideration of matrix elements in constructing forecast models. Unforeseen drivers of land use, such as changing economic incentives, may also have important ramifications.

Our objectives were to determine the effect and relative importance of local and landscape factors on plant species richness, diversity and composition of different functional groups (i.e. total, wetland-dependent, perennial, annual and exotic species) in recently inundated playa wetlands.
   2. We surveyed plant communities in 80 wet playas in the Southern High Plains, USA, and measured local factors: water depth, playa volume loss, sediment depth and playa area. We included landscape variables within 3 km: number of playas, edge density, percentage urban area and percentage Conservation Reserve Program area (CRP; conversion from highly erodible cropland to mostly introduced perennial grassland). We also recorded dominant land use as native grassland or cropland.
   3. Water depth negatively influenced all plant community metrics (i. e. richness, diversity and cover) while playa volume loss (sediment eroded from watershed filling the basin) had a negative influence on total, wetland-dependent and perennial richness and cover. Playas with more cropland within their watersheds had greater annual and exotic richness and cover, suggesting that agricultural activities within playa watersheds have changed plant composition and facilitated biological invasion.
   4. Playa area was less important in predicting plant community metrics in playas. Although not as dominant as local variables, edge density had a positive influence on species richness. Other landscape factors such as number of playas, percentage urban area and percentage CRP area were less important and consistent among different plant community metrics.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that continued unsustainable sedimentation will result in loss of perennial species and promotion of exotic and annual species in playas. Watershed management to limit unsustainable sedimentation has the potential to maintain original playa plant communities dominated by perennial / native species and should also reduce the loss of playa functionality.

AB  - In this article, we examine the spatial regulation of homeless people by National Capital Commission (NCC) conservation officers in Canada's capital city, Ottawa. We explore NCC officer practices by analyzing occurrence reports obtained through access to information (ATI) requests and interview transcripts. We contend that policing of NCC parks is organized according to a logic of dispersal. Dispersal policing aims to preserve an aesthetic for public consumption and ceremonial nationalism, entails specific temporalities, and is actuated through a public/private policing network. We argue that dispersal more accurately conceptualizes the spatial regulation in this case compared with alternative concepts (ie banishment) and thus supplements existing typologies of spatial regulation. We conclude with a discussion of these typologies and of the worth of ATI for future research on urban policing and regulation.

AB  - Natural areas and urban green structure are essential parts of the urban tissues with which, in their different morphologies and central levels, cities are organized, built and operated. The presence of natural elements results of the implementation of various approaches to land management, or simply pragmatic decisions you resources management. The presence of natural elements in the urban landscape allows low stress processes of urbanization and rehabilitation and regeneration and more respect to the environmental balance that contribute to urban sustainability. The open spaces system created by the presence of natural elements allows the existence of ecological corridors for biodiversity conservation, land and building structure and urban green areas organization. What means that to organize urban expansion or requalification is above all to integrate nature and built areas in an entity with own identity, structure and mode of operation.

AB  - Fragmentation has negative effects on ecosystems and can cause loss of habitats, increase of edges and isolation. Forests in northern Italy have strongly declined, because of the development of urban land, infrastructures and crops. In suburban areas forest patches often perform a variety of functions. This study used scenarios integrating both ecological and social principles to improve landscape multifunctionality in a suburban area of Northern Italy, with a special focus on the role of woody patches. We evaluated how improving some functions of woody patches (suitability for forest species, mitigation for road impact and recreation) can help creating a multifunctional landscape. We combined the scenario visualisation through GIS, the maximization of functions based on ecological principles, and the use of fuzzy logic. The scenarios obtained show that improving existing woods can help to maximize multiple functions. The scenario improving recreation is the most suitable to increase biodiversity, and it can also help to mitigate road impact. The scenario approach can help decision-makers during the planning process, because it is user-friendly. Comparing multiple scenarios can allow assessing if managing the landscape for one function may also accomplish other function(s).

TI  - Squatting and Urban Renewal: The Interaction of Squatter Movements and Strategies of Urban Restructuring in Berlin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Squatting as a housing strategy and as a tool of urban social movements accompanies the development of capitalist cities worldwide. We argue that the dynamics of squatter movements are directly connected to strategies of urban renewal in that movement conjunctures occur when urban regimes are in crisis. An analysis of the history of Berlin squatter movements, their political context and their effects on urban policies since the 1970s, clearly shows how massive mobilizations at the beginning of the 1980s and in the early 1990s developed in a context of transition in regimes of urban renewal. The crisis of Fordist city planning at the end of the 1970s provoked a movement of 'rehab squatting' (Instandbesetzung), which contributed to the institutionalization of 'cautious urban renewal'(behutsame Stadterneuerung) in an important way. The second rupture in Berlin's urban renewal became apparent in 1989 and 1990, when the necessity of restoring whole inner-city districts constituted a new, budget-straining challenge for urban policymaking. Whilst in the 1980s the squatter movement became a central condition for and a political factor of the transition to 'cautious urban renewal', in the 1990s large-scale squatting - mainly in the eastern parts of the city - is better understood as an alien element in times of neoliberal urban restructuring.

AB  - Motorized transportation of freight and passengers is one of most highly pollutant urban activities. Relationships between transport and the environment are mediated by styles of management of distance's friction, which derive from forms and functionality of cities and regions. Both urban form and functionality are vectors and results of the modes of production and social occupation of space, associated patterns of mobility and energy consumption at each moment and place.. Redesign and planning of spatial and functional territorial rationalities - central locations, localization and space allocation to diverse activities, connectivity, land policies, technological, social and spatial management of distances, urban networks - are a prerequisite for a progressive 'virtuous' transformation of that original conflict and for guiding transitions of urban-regional systems towards more sustainable structuration, functioning and growth patterns, much more effectively than 'merely' technological improvements.

The performance of the black movement in the metropolitan region of Goiania is materialized in the urban space through the trajectories in the neighborhood, at work, at school, at university, in places of leisure, in local activism, which spatial distribution. The complexity and diversity of discovered, produced and strengthened places by (the) militants of the movement, refers to understanding the city from a race and in a sense of the construction of black territoriality and the African matrix in the city. New/old territories are discovered, sustained and produced in the city by whom participate in the black movement.

AB  - The wild boar is the target species selected for developing a GIS model of potential habitat for big game species, mainly using many GIS layers and kilometric abundance indices (KAI). We identify and weight environmental factors that determine the suitability for wild boar populations in a Mediterranean region, highly influenced by urban and agro-forestry activities. Marina Baja region (Spain) is selected to make a regional analysis. In the GIS modelling process, a suitability value is assigned to each pixel, which represents the habitat preference of the species. In the potential habitat model some variables were considered, the most important being land use. Voronoi polygons are generated by calculating the centroid of census transects located with GPS. These polygons are combined with the 'suitability' layer to obtain potentiality values, involving the displacement of the wild boar impedances within each Voronoi polygon. Finally, it performs the cartographic generalization process to obtain the resulting potential areas. We have obtained six potential areas that represent 39% of the region and they are best for the species. Natural vegetation is the most important landcover type in these areas. The cost-distance model is an efficient tool that gives good results in line with existing knowledge of species distribution. The model is constructed in order to explain, understand and predict the relations of analysed species using a determinate number of environmental variables. Thus, the use of GIS has allowed the information coming from different sources to be integrated in a simple way, allowing wild boar observations (KAI) to be combined with the cost-distance analysis result.

AB  - Being able to predict the potential impacts of urban growth on the environment is a critical requirement for both urban developers and policymakers. The Korean national government recently announced a long-term urban plan, called the "Metropolitan Plan for the Greater Seoul Area 2020." The fundamentals of the plan can be summarized as an urban development strategy that leads toward multinucleated urban centers with an easing of the greenbelt designations (area designated for preservation around a town or a city where development is strictly restricted by law). The objectives of this study are threefold: (1) to formulate urban development scenarios on the basis of the Metropolitan Plan for the Greater Seoul Area 2020, (2) to construct models to predict the future urban growth pattern in the greater Seoul metropolitan area, and (3) to analyze forest structural changes from the perspective of landscape ecology. This study first formulates four different urban development scenarios to provide a broader array of policy alternatives. On the basis of the respective scenarios formulated, this study attempts to predict the future urban growth by integrating a system dynamics (SD) model and a multilayer perceptrons (MLP) model. Furthermore, this study attempts to calculate the forest mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size, and uses the gravity-based metrics, connectivity between patch centroids (CCE) and connectivity between circular patches (CCI), to assess the structural changes of forests that would occur under each respective scenario. The system dynamic model developed in this study successfully predicted the future urban growth area by incorporating not only economic elements but also political elements simulated under multiple scenarios. On the other hand, the spatial-allocation model successfully predicted that active large-scale urban development is likely to take place largely in the southeastern part of the greater Seoul metropolitan area under all four scenarios by the year 2020. This study concludes with a recommendation of which the easing of the greenbelt designation will inevitably cause adverse impacts on forest structure. In addition, this study suggests that effective multilateral policy alternatives can be discovered by formulating a variety of scenarios. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000090.

AB  - Amphibians are good indicators of human impact, declining steadily worldwide. We explored the relationships between the ponds and nearby landscape parameters and population size of the Agile Frog (Rana dalmatina), estimated from the number of egg masses, in a cultural landscape within the central section of Tarnava Mare Basin, Romania, Forty-three permanent ponds were surveyed in a 2600 km(2) area. The average number of egg masses per pond was 211.13 (SD = 426.41). The egg mass number was significantly and positively related to the emergent aquatic macrophyte cover (its effect peaks at around 50%) and the green connecting corridors between the ponds and forests, and negatively related to the extent of nearby urban areas. The proximity of the forest (positive effect) and the presence of high traffic roads (negative effect) were highly correlated with green corridors and further eliminated from the model due to multicollinearity. Both these variables had significant effects when incorporated in univariate models and multivariate models without green corridors. Since a large part of our study area was currently declared as Natura 2000 site, there is an increased need for management proposals and conservation applications for biodiversity, including amphibians. Rana dalmatina is an important species for monitoring because it is common in the studied area and is suited for short surveys. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation is a well-recognized threat to the long-term survivability of many plant and animal species. As a complex concept, fragmentation has multiple spatial and functional components, of which spatial contiguity is of great importance. A contiguous landscape provides physical condition and increases the opportunities for species dispersal and migration. However, in real planning situations, contiguity is either too expensive to achieve or impractical because of barriers of urban landscapes. As such, the traditional yes/no function of contiguity has been extended into a notion of relative contiguity which has the value range between zero and one. Relative contiguity measures levels of interconnectivity of landscapes based on graph theory and spatial interaction. It takes into account both inner-reserve relationship (i.e. reserve sizes) and inter-reserve spatial proximity. This paper presents a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm approach to maximizing relative contiguity in reserve network design. This approach obtains solutions that maximize the measure of relative contiguity, minimize the total acquisition area, and satisfy constraints on the coverage of individual species. Application results show the developed algorithm has significant advantages in optimizing relative contiguity and generating a variety of alternative solutions.

AB  - With the expansion of human activities, human-dominated land cover conversion has become the most prominent cause of habitat fragmentation. Urbanization is currently one of the most significant factors driving land conversion and causing habitat fragmentation. Habitat isolation, as one major component of habitat fragmentation, is a dynamic process and complicated to evaluate and quantify. This paper intends to investigate habitat isolation due to rapid urbanization. Two new metrics, Urbanization Isolation Effect (UIE) and Habitat Isolation Degree (HID), are proposed to incorporate urban sprawl and population increase into the quantification of habitat isolation, and demonstrate its spatio-temporal variation. The Shenzhen River catchment, a cross-boundary region shared by Hong Kong and Shenzhen SEZ in China, has been used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed metrics. The results show that (1) extensive land conversion to urban utility has occurred since 1988, especially on the Shenzhen side of the catchment; (2) the metrics of UIE and HID exhibited remarkable spatial and temporal variations in the whole catchment and also displayed a significant discrepancy between Hong Kong and Shenzhen; and (3) urban sprawl on the Shenzhen side exerted trans-boundary influences on habitats of the Hong Kong side. In summary, the two proposed metrics are proved to be effective in demonstrating the spatio-temporal variation of habitat isolation and its causes, as well as identifying the extent and intensity of the urbanization isolation effect. These metrics may be useful for regional planning and natural landscape conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rivers with a natural flow regime strongly influence the dynamics of riparian plant communities through hydrological and geomorphological processes. In this study, associations between fluvial landforms and vegetation are investigated on three near-natural rivers in the Czech Republic a decade after a 500-year return period flood in July 1997. This extreme disturbance destroyed the anthropogenically modified river channels and created suitable conditions for a range of ecosystems with high diversity and ecological stability. Field surveys were conducted on fluvial landforms (bars, islands, banks, floodplains and terraces) along three renaturalized rivers, where no technical modifications had subsequently been made to their channels outside urban areas and the floodplains had been left in a post-flood state. Vegetation species abundance and 13 environmental variables (topographical, hydrological and soil) were investigated in summer 2007, 10 years after the extreme flood disturbance. The results suggest that the recently created fluvial geomorphic forms are key environmental determinants of riparian vegetation distribution patterns. A range of statistical analyses illustrate that some plant species show predictable patterns of occurrence that correspond with the fluvial forms, supporting a fourfold grouping of herbaceous and woody species and the identification of typical plant communities associated with gravel bars, islands, banks, floodplains and terraces. An investigation of the species richness found on different fluvial landforms showed that the highest number of species occurred on the floodplain and decreased gradually towards the channel bed and towards terraces. Investigation of existing conditions in reaches of rivers with natural dynamics of fluvial processes provides valuable information that can be used as an effective tool for planning restoration strategies and precise management. However, the most important finding of this study is the remarkable establishment of complex river corridor vegetationlandform associations within 10 years of a 500-year flood that removed the heavily cultivated landscape that had existed before the event.

AB  - The land form is a basis for urban planning. The most decisive characteristics of land form are shortly described. The protection of cultural landscape and historical monuments needs an objective description of landscape perception and urban morphology, including inter-subjective aspects of cognition. Urban planning and design must take into account objective aspects like filters of perception. Aesthetic evaluation is containing more subjective aspects (inter-subjective and personal ones): emotions, gestalt psychology, imaginary superficial resemblances, intangible resources. The scenic beauty estimation attempts to define the visual preferences of humans. Easy schemes are given. Conclusions are also possible for maximum heights of new planned high rise buildings in the vicinity of HUL/monuments depending on distance and relief position. The distance zones could be low building areas or free open space. Further studies should be done by international stakeholder groups. The network of deeper areas of valleys / depressions and the complementary network of higher areas of hill chains / elevations are the most sensitive areas for town planning and free open space design.

AB  - Documents on historical floras provide unique opportunities to analyze past changes and to show trends in biodiversity. We studied the historical and recent flora of the city of Halle in Central Germany. Our earliest records date back to the year 1687; the youngest were sampled in 2008. More than 20 other floras provide information for time in-between, covering ca. 320 years in total. We checked all historical plant occurrences for plausibility. The species turnover of 22% that took place in the study period should also yield changes in the functional composition of the flora. We identified native species and archaeophytes that went extinct since 1689 and 1856, respectively, and all neophytes that were introduced since 1689 or 1856. This 'double' calculation minimized the influence of so-called possible pseudo-absences. Contingency tables assisted to identify trait states which were associated with extinction or introduction. Time-series analysis identified temporal trends in trait state ratio development after testing for temporal autocorrelation. Within the study period, species of bogs, nitrogen-poor habitats or plants with helomorphic leaves got extinct more often than expected by chance. Species dispersed by humans, plants preferring nitrogen-rich or warm habitats, shrubs and trees, and species with mesomorphic leaves were, amongst others, over-represented among introduced neophytes. Land-use changes such as the transformation from agriculture to urban land use or the drainage of bogs are discussed as main drivers of these developments. Additionally, climatic changes, contamination of habitats and gardeners' preferences for specific plants are presumed to having caused floristic changes. Our study shows the vast influence humans had and still have on biodiversity by intentionally or unintentionally selecting specific functional plant types and thus changing the composition of the flora.

AB  - Understanding the factors related to invasive exotic species distributions at broad spatial scales has important theoretical and management implications, because biological invasions are detrimental to many ecosystem functions and processes. Housing development facilitates invasions by disturbing land cover, introducing nonnative landscaping plants, and facilitating dispersal of propagules along roads. To evaluate relationships between housing and the distribution of invasive exotic plants, we asked (1) how strongly is housing associated with the spatial distribution of invasive exotic plants compared to other anthropogenic and environmental factors; (2) what type of housing pattern is related to the richness of invasive exotic plants; and (3) do invasive plants represent ecological traits associated with specific housing patterns? Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e. g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e. g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity. Plant life history traits were not strongly related to housing patterns. We expect the number of invasive exotic plants to increase as a result of future housing growth and suggest that housing development be considered a primary factor in plans to manage and monitor invasive exotic plant species.

AB  - Roads facilitate access by deforestation agents, being relevant in studies approaching conservationist matters in rainforests. It is important to understand the relationship between road distribution, relief, land use, and forest coverage in order to evaluate where forests are more vulnerable. This study aimed at: 1) understanding the relationship between relief and density and road connectivity in three moments in time; and 2) evaluating the relationship between distance from roads and forest coverage, farmlands and rural and urban facilities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape in three moments in time. Maps of roads, altitude, and land use and coverage were used. Chi-square tests showed that: 1) density and road connectivity did not present significant relationship with the relief; and 2) forest areas occupy areas distant from the roads, while farmlands and rural and urban facilities occupy areas nearer the roads. Roads and land use, regardless of relief, influence forest coverage distribution. Thus, we suggest that roads are taken into account in conservationist strategies and environmental planning.

AB  - Fragmentation is a critical issue for tree populations because the creation of small patches can reduce local population size and increase isolation, both of which can promote inbreeding and its negative consequences, as well as loss of genetic diversity. To test the hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches, with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge distance index) ranging from 37.5 m to 245.8 m. We examined the average number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selling, the amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources (N-ep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selling and immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen, intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest N-ep among the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less connectivity than trees within continuous forest. These findings indicate that forest management practices should emphasize the maintenance of an optimal patch size because, despite the fact that tree species show the potential for long distance pollen movement, the number of local trees strongly influences the mating patterns.

AB  - House flies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), are of medical and veterinary importance due to their capacity to act as mechanical vectors of microorganisms originating in animal manure and other decaying organic substrates. House flies that disperse from rural to urban areas may also transport antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. To assess the potential of house flies to disperse from rural to urban areas and distribute antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we undertook a two part study: (i) we quantified the dispersal rate of house flies from farms (rural areas) into a city (urban area) using multilocus DNA fingerprinting and (ii) we profiled the antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci harbored by house flies collected in rural and urban environments. The population genetic analysis indicated that there was considerable dispersal between rural and urban habitats. Although there was a significant difference in allele frequency between the urban and rural samples, genetic divergence was low (mean F-ST = 0.07) and migration rate relatively high (N-m = 3 individuals per generation). Almost 95% of the genetic diversity occurred within populations, suggesting a nearly panmictic population. Profiling of antibiotic resistance of enterococci isolated from house fly guts showed that house flies collected in all five urban sites carried substantial numbers of antibiotic-resistant enterococci, supporting the results of the population genetic analyses. The results of this study imply that house flies, because of their dispersal behavior and capacity to transport antibiotic-resistant bacteria, pose a serious threat to public health. We suggest that area wide management of house fly populations is therefore likely to be the most effective strategy for minimizing public health risks.

AB  - This study deals with the influence of habitat enrichment through landscape heterogeneity on avian diversity in suburban habitat (human habitat) versus pine forest and open exposed shrub land (non-human habitat) at the G.B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development (GBPIHED) campus (1100-1250 m asl), Kosi-Katarmal, Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Bird diversity on fruiting plants was also studied to know the occurrence and richness of fruit plants on overall bird diversity. The study area, which consisted of the then degraded gentle slopes, has transformed into thick vegetation cover due to plantation of a large number of fruit and ornamental plants. Line transect and stationary point count methods were followed during the entire study. Out of a total of 61 bird species observed, 28 are new reports from the study site. The human habitat has a higher avian species richness (S = 50) in comparison to non-human habitat (S = 44). A significantly higher density of Jungle Myna, Common Myna and Red-billed Blue Magpie in suburban habitat, and restricted distribution of House Sparrow and Blue Rock Pigeon in the same habitat may be due to availability of high feeding and nesting opportunities. Increase in the number of human-associated species in suburban habitat indicates progressive urbanization of the area. However, lack of significant difference in Shannon diversity index between the two habitats indicates that homogenization due to urbanization is still at a low level.

AB  - Recent ecological studies have identified human activity as a relevant dimension of current evolutionary processes. However, most of these studies rely on socioeconomic indicators that consider the impact of activities on ecosystems but have only limited informative value on the effects of concrete patterns of action. This paper focuses on the concept of style as a tool for the study of the interface between society and nature. We exemplify our thesis with reference to changes in plant biodiversity in settlements, and start by summing up the methods and findings of our interdisciplinary research project that aimed to explain the distribution of native and alien plants. Since the findings indicate that styles of living and acting influence plant species composition, we apply the findings of our research strategy beyond the narrow focus of our study. Finally, we comment on methodological implications for the study of the societal aspects of social-ecological systems.

AB  - Despite expanding urban areas and increased awareness of urbanization impacts on wildlife, trends in urban wildlife studies have not been evaluated systematically. We performed a thorough assessment of such research, evaluating urban wildlife publications from 16 leading journals in animal behavior, conservation, ecology, general science, landscape ecology, and wildlife biology from 1971 to 2010. Using a systematic review process, we quantified trends in urban wildlife research over time and in different scientific fields, and also assessed author affiliations, geographic and taxonomic focus, research topics, and study site types. In general, rates of publication for urban wildlife research have been increasing, although still remain low (<2% of publication volume) considering urban growth and its impacts on biodiversity are accelerating globally. Landscape ecology and wildlife biology journals, followed by conservation journals, published the highest percentage of urban wildlife publications, whereas such studies were rare in animal behavior, ecology, and general science journals. Academics were first-authors on ca. 75% of urban wildlife publications, whereas research directed by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private industry were less common, with little evidence of temporal shifts in these patterns. The majority of urban research studied birds or mammals, and nearly all was conducted in North America, Europe, or Australia, as expected given expansive urban development and associated research focus. Animal behavior was the most common scientific topic in urban wildlife research, followed by conservation, landscape ecology, wildlife management, and population ecology. While suburban and exurban development have been recently identified as an important issue, we found no evidence that research in these study systems has increased. Author affiliation, geographic location, taxonomic focus, and research topics of urban wildlife studies were generally similar to those conducted in non-urban systems, although avian studies were more common, and African and community ecology studies less common, in urban compared to non-urban areas. We suggest that the most critical gaps for urban wildlife researchers are in rapidly urbanizing areas in South America, Africa, and Asia, and on understudied taxa such as herpetiles, fish, and arthropods. Research conducted on multiple taxa and across continents is also rare, but will be necessary for global understanding of ecological dynamics of urban systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim Human activities have weakened biogeographical barriers to dispersal, increasing the rate of introduction of alien plants. However, their impact on beta diversity and floristic homogenization is poorly understood. Our goal is to compare the phylogenetic beta diversity of native species with that of two groups of alien species, archaeophytes and neophytes (introduced before and after ad 1500, respectively), across European urban floras to explore how biological invasions affect phylogenetic turnover at a continental scale. Location Twenty European cities located in six countries between 49 and 53 degrees N latitude in continental Europe and the British Isles. Methods To compare the phylogenetic beta diversity of native and alien species we use the average phylogenetic dissimilarity of individual floras from their group centroid in multivariate space. Differences in phylogenetic beta diversity among different species groups are then assessed using a randomization test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions. Results Across European urban floras, and when contrasted with natives, archaeophytes are usually associated with lower levels of phylogenetic beta diversity while neophytes tend to increase phylogenetic differentiation. Main conclusions While archaeophytes tend to promote limited homogenization in phylogenetic beta diversity, because of their diverse geographical origin together with short residence times in the invaded regions, neophytes are not promoting biotic homogenization of urban floras across Europe. Therefore, in spite of the increasing rate of alien invasion, an intense phylogenetic homogenization of urban cities is not to be expected soon.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are the most complex mosaics of vegetative land cover that can be found. In a recent paper. Francis and Lorimer (2011) evaluated the reconciliation potential of living roofs and walls. For these authors, these two techniques for habitat improvement have strong potential for urban reconciliation ecology. However they have some ecological and societal limitations such as the physical extreme environmental characteristics, the monetary investment and the cultural perceptions of urban nature. We are interested in their results and support their conclusions. However, for a considerable time, green roofs have been designed to provide urban greenery for buildings and the green roof market has only focused on extensive roof at a restricted scale within cities. Thus, we have strong doubts about the relevance of their use as possible integrated elements of the network. Furthermore, without dynamic progress in research and the implementation of well-thought-out policies, what will be the real capital gain from green roofs with respect to land-use complementation in cities? If we agree with Francis and Lorimer (2011) considering that urban reconciliation ecology between nature and citizens is a current major challenge, then "adaptive collaborative management" is a fundamental requirement.

AB  - Urbanization has destroyed and fragmented previously large areas of habitat. Small remnants that still exist in numerous cities will be unable to sustain many viable wild plant populations if they do not expand into the surrounding urban matrix. Residential gardens form a significant component of urban green space in many cities and therefore could play a role in redressing this problem. Our ecological and social scientific study examined factors influencing the dispersal and regeneration of 12 bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton Bush, a 7.8 ha urban forest remnant, into surrounding residential properties in Christchurch, New Zealand. Over 125 years, the reported number of native vascular plant species in the Bush has declined by a third. Some species, particularly Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, the dominant woody species in the Bush, are being dispersed by birds and establishing in residential gardens predominantly within 250 m of the forest margin. These juveniles are not reaching maturity as most gardeners tend to remove all non-planted woody species. This suggests natural potential for regeneration exists but is insufficient without active human intervention. Our survey results show people are supportive of native plants in general but lack knowledge of the species. They are willing to plant locally appropriate woody species if provided with plants, information, and, most importantly, control over the location of plantings. Residential gardens consequently have the potential to play a major role in the conservation of urban biodiversity especially for species suited to the functions and size of gardens.

AB  - The text analyzes the landscape relations defined over an approach to the study area in the urban perimeter axis situated between Colonia Valentina Sur and Balsa Las Perlas. The space was approached in detail because of its characteristics and the dynamic in the transformation of the agriculture production system and the natural coastal ecosystem to urban uses. Satellite images CBERS - 2B were analyzed and processed with ENVI and restitutions of the ex Enterprise HIDRONOR SE. A non supervised classification ISODATA was made, adopting the MUC classes and field data. Four metrics of landscape were stated in different scales as measure of the relation of different components that form complexity.
   The results allow us to establish that special processes of different scales merge in a synchronic way and favour the invasion conditions of exotic species that heighten the structural heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The abandon of productive lands and windbreaker curtains, the control of flows incurred by the presses up Limay and the refunction of the lands for Real Estate speculation configure the space conditions of the formation of new vegetation patches and functional types of the coastal and urban perimeter neo ecosystem. The distribution of ruderal and arvense vegetation, the invasions that domain the most of the shrub stratum and the coastal woods and secondary in abandon farms, express a measure of the connectivity established by the nets of water fluxes. The geometry of fluvial geoforms and the irrigation system favoured the invasions directed by Populus nigra and Salix alba. The indexes of complexity of landscape explain the diversity and dominant covertures. The patches distributions that increase the global diversity of the system correspond to abrupt gradients of wood pastureland, depending on how surface and irregular geometries are distributed.

AB  - Changes in land-use practices have affected the integrity and quality of water resources worldwide. In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Democratic Vistas: Frederick Law Olmsted's Parks as Spatial Mediation of Urban Diversity

KW  - parks
AB  - This article examines how Frederick Law Olmsted's parks, especially Prospect Park in Brooklyn, can be thought of as spatial technologies that mediate between individuals and their urban environment to foster an open, creative, and democratic relationship with the differences of their fellow city dwellers. The park accomplishes this spatially by encouraging citizens to journey through distinct geographies that enable associational styles Olmsted calls the "neighborly" and the "gregarious." Through alternating between environments conducive to intimate, reassuring neighborly groupings and exciting, superficial, gregarious interaction, the park user encounters others within distinct spatial and temporal qualities that allow them to appreciate otherness without being overwhelmed by it. The spatial techniques derived from Olmsted's work challenge accounts in political theory and urban planning that contend free movement through cities encourages tolerance and fluid identities and instead contends that structured, mediating spatial structures might be necessary to facilitate the cultivation of such characteristics.

AB  - The present paper aims to find the methodology of designing sustainable open urban spaces. At first, threats of nature that occurs because of population growth and unlimited urban development over the land are reviewed. It usually happens, even in open spaces like streets, squares and plazas, by covering the whole place by stones and bricks over layers of mortar and concrete as the bedding. Contemplating on these facts, one wonders how we can have sustainable city's open public plazas to lessen negative effects on environments. Due to the importance of Landscape Ecology and the emphases are left to the preservation of natural patches and corridors; one of the most important urban design considerations is to detect remnant patches or corridors within urban places. Preserving the natural properties of patches with consideration of human needs in urban places is analyzed as the integrative sustainable way to avoid expanding disturbed patches in the cities. As a case, ABBAS-ABAD HILLS development plan is introduced and AB-o-ATASH Entrance Plaza is analyzed. Regarding the nature of the project, the chosen design methodology is to preserve natural properties of site.

AB  - The capital City of Prague (Czech Republic), like other large cities of the former Eastern block, has been for a long time one of the most dynamically growing urban areas. In the recent years, the city is particularly affected by building of the suburban areas, where a number of valuable sites with the status of nature reserves and parks is to be found. In these suburban parts of the undeveloped land the conflict of negative urban trends and requirements for conservation of valuable landscape features has grown. For the purpose of this article case studies were carried out, which deal with the extension of building areas into the forest adjacent to the City of Prague and its surroundings. The so-called Klanovice Forest is the largest forest complex of the City of Prague, located at its northeastern border. The area belongs to several categories of nature protection including the European network Natura 2000. In the studies the changes in the proportion of build-up areas were investigated in three time periods, which correspond with the basic map data available (1841, 1953 and 2011, i.e. the Imperial Imprints of Stabile Cadastre, historic aerial photographs and current orthophotomap). The maps were imported to and processed in the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The maps were interpreted in the categories of land cover and the current land cover data were verified by a field survey. The basic characteristics of landscape macrostructure (area in hectares by category represented in %) and microstructure (number of patches, the average size of patches, diversity indices) were computed for each period and the changes in land cover were analysed. The special attention was paid to the urban areas (area and shape indices, nearest neighbour analysis) and its penetration into the forest complex of Klanovice. The results can bring useful information for future sustainable development of the area and for current issue of process of environmental impact assessment which is being carried out. In such cases it is necessary to take into account the conclusions of this investigation that show significant changes and significant expansion of suburbia at the expense of the semi-natural forested areas playing a key role in the outskirts of the city.

AB  - Whilst there are a number of mapping methods available for determining important areas for conservation within protected areas, there are few tools available for assessing the ecological value of landscapes that are 'beyond the reserves'. A systematic tool for determining the ecological value of landscapes outside of protected areas could be relevant to any development that results in a parcel of land being transformed from its 'natural' state to an alternative state (e.g., industrial, agricultural). Specifically what is needed is a method to determine which landscapes beyond protected areas are important for the ecological processes that they support and the threatened and vulnerable species that they contain. This paper presents the results of a project to develop a method for mapping ecologically important landscapes beyond protected areas; a Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT). The method uses existing globally available web-based databases and models to provide an ecological score based on :five key ecological features (biodiversity, vulnerability, fragmentation, connectivity and resilience) for every 300 m parcel within a given region. The end product is a map indicating ecological value across the landscape. We demonstrate the potential of this method through its application to three study regions in Canada, Algeria and the Russian Federation. The primary audience of this tool are those practitioners involved in planning the location of any landscape scale industrial/business or urban (e.g., new town) facility outside of protected areas. It provides a pre-planning tool, for use before undertaking a more costly field-based environmental impact assessment, and quickly highlights areas of high ecological value to avoid in the location of facilities.

AB  - Very little little is known about how lizards respond to urbanization. Given their small space requirements, opportunist lizard species can potentially exist in small patches of suitable urban habitat. This study identified the relative importance of landscape and habitat-level factors that influenced the occurrence of an opportunist and generally abundant species, the common skink Oligosoma nigriplantare polychrome in suburban private gardens in New Zealand. Private gardens are potentially important in sustaining urban wildlife as they make up a significant proportion of the total area of many cities. Common skinks were largely absent from the central suburbs and distributed in less highly ordered gardens around the city edge. Skink occurrence was influenced mainly by landscape-level features that reflect opportunities for dispersal into gardens from source populations (distance to city edge; presence of an adjacent grassy paddock) and habitat quality (messiness). To a lesser extent skink occurrence was associated with lower cat densities, less native vegetation and south-facing sites. Within private gardens common skinks were associated with areas with a high proportion of basking surfaces, lower plant species diversity, shorter distances to potential cover, and vegetation that was low in height and made up mainly of long exotic grasses. Despite common skinks' ability to thrive in exotic vegetation and their small spatial requirements, it is unlikely that they will thrive in urban areas unless gardening practices change to increase resource availability and provide refuges from predators.

AB  - Government and academic studies indicate that many streams in the Appalachian Mountains have degraded biological communities stemming from a variety of regional landuses. Headwater stonefly (Plecoptera) and caddisfly (Trichoptera) assemblages were assessed between 1999 and 2004 in relation to pervasive landuse disturbances (coal mining and residential) in mountainous areas of eastern Kentucky, USA. Indicator metrics (richness, abundance, tolerance, and an observed/expected (O/E) null model) were compared among 94 sites with different land use pressures including least disturbed reference, residential, mining, and mixed mining and residential categories. Thirty-three stonefly species from 26 genera and 9 families were identified; Leuctra, Acroneuria, Haploperla, and Isoperla comprised the core genera that commonly decreased with disturbance. Caddisflies were represented by 48 species, 32 genera, and 14 families. Core caddisfly genera (Neophylax, Pycnopsyche, Rhyacophila, Lepidostoma, and Wormaldia) were extirpated from most disturbed sites. Species richness was significantly higher at reference sites and reference site mean tolerance value was lowest compared to all other categories; relative abundance of both orders was variable between disturbance groups. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (for riffle-dwelling stonefly and caddisfly genera) clustered reference sites distinctly from most other sites. The O/E index was highly correlated with individual habitat and chemical stressors (pH, conductivity) and on average, it estimated similar to 70% loss of common stoneflies and caddisflies across all disturbed landuse categories. Expected plecopteran and trichopteran communities were radically altered in streams draining mining and residential disturbance. Long-term impacts incurred by both landuses will continue to depress these vulnerable indigenous fauna.

AB  - Accurate, time dependent control options are required to halt biological invasions prior to equilibrium establishment, beyond which control efforts are often impractical. Although invasions have been successfully modeled using diffusion theory, diffusion models are typically confined to providing simple range expansion estimates. In this work, we use a Susceptible/Infected cellular automaton (CA) to simulate diffusion. The CA model is coupled with a network model to track the speed and direction of simulated invasions across heterogeneous landscapes, allowing for identification of locations for targeted control in both time and space. We evaluated the role of the location of initial establishment insofar as it affected the pattern and rate of spread and how these are influenced by patch attributes such as size. Our results show that the location of initial establishment can significantly affect the temporal dynamics of an invasion. Traditional network metrics such as degree and measures of topological distance were insufficient for predicting the direction and speed of the invasion. Our coupled models allow the dynamic tracking of invasions across fragmented landscapes for both theoretical and practical applications.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding rapidly, but a few native species have successfully colonized them. The processes underlying such colonization events are poorly understood. Using the blackbird Turdus merula, a former forest specialist that is now one of the most common urban birds in its range, we provide the first assessment of two contrasting urban colonization models. First, that urbanization occurred independently. Second, that following initial urbanization, urban-adapted individuals colonized other urban areas in a leapfrog manner. Previous analyses of spatial patterns in the timing of blackbird urbanization, and experimental introductions of urban and rural blackbirds to uncolonized cities, suggest that the leapfrog model is likely to apply. We found that, across the western Palaearctic, urban blackbird populations contain less genetic diversity than rural ones, urban populations are more strongly differentiated from each other than from rural populations and assignment tests support a rural source population for most urban individuals. In combination, these results provide much stronger support for the independent urbanization model than the leapfrog one. If the former model predominates, colonization of multiple urban centres will be particularly difficult when urbanization requires genetic adaptations, having implications for urban species diversity.

AB  - In this paper, we present a review of city logistics modeling efforts reported in the literature for urban freight analysis. The review framework takes into account the diversity and complexity found in the present-day city logistics practice. Next, it covers the different aspects in the modeling selection process that includes (1) the stakeholders' involvement (2) the objective of modeling (3) the defining criteria i.e. the descriptor for modeling purpose and (4) the viewpoint for achieving objective i.e. the perceptive. This review argues that these factors are evidently demonstrating forces behind urban freight transportation and thus are more determinative for carrying out urban freight modeling. The review analyzes the trends of city logistics modeling research in terms of its relevance to city logistics problems and attempts to identify gaps in modeling urban freight domain.

AB  - The ruderal habitats in cities, extending from the ground level to buildings and walls, are colonized by a special flora which adds a new dimension to urban ecology and urban biodiversity. This study investigates the spontaneous arboreal flora on buildings of different configurations and ages in compact urban Hong Kong. The hanging plants' association with intrinsic building bioreceptivity traits, extrinsic environmental factors and human intervention were evaluated. Building plants in three districts with varied urban form and building type were assessed in the field. They cling on diverse microhabitats led by vertical wall faces and roof, and a group of horizontal substrates accommodating 57% of the plants. The flora is dictated by the tree growth form, contributing 10 of the 11 species. Moraceae (76.2%) and its seven Ficus species (74.4%) are dominant. The most abundant members are pan-tropical native tree Ficus microcarpa, and the exotic but naturalized para-shrub Catharanthus roseus. Species composition on buildings is mainly native and is similar to the ground-level ruderal sites. Their successful growth on buildings is attributed to the strangler habit that is pre-adapted to grip building appendages, and the initial epiphytic existence. The host trees in their natural tropical forest abode have been substituted by buildings niches in the city. The copious fig crops are consumed by frugivorous birds and bats serving as effective dispersal agent and germination mediator. Solar access, debris pockets, damp surfaces, and leakage from drain pipes foster germination and establishment. The bioreceptivity of old buildings with poor construction materials and maintenance is enhanced by weathered substrates to facilitate colonization. Erratic shoot removal by building management has suppressed crown size of most trees. The findings improve understanding of the intricate ecological-cum-cultural dynamics and nature-in-city enrichment of a marginal but notable urban habitat, and contribute to their conservation.

AB  - Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are valuable indicators of connectivity in the highly fragmented landscape of coastal Southern California, yet their population sizes and densities are largely unknown. Using noninvasive scat sampling in It capture-recapture framework, we estimated population sizes for 2 similar areas of natural habitat with differing levels of isolation by human development in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, California. We used scat transects with geographic information system land-use layers and home-range sizes of bobcats to estimate effective sampling area and Population densities. Estimates of population size in the study area connected to I much larger habitat area (26-31 individuals) were similar to estimates for the area that was completely surrounded by development (25-28 individuals). Bobcat densities for the 2 Study areas also were similar (ranging from 0.25 to 0.42 bobcat/km(2)) and likely represent recent population declines because of notoedric mange likely interacting with toxicants. These methods proved effective despite particularly low densities of bobcats and may be especially useful when Study areas are geographically isolated, reducing the uncertainty in size of the sampling area.

TI  - Mediation in Local Educational Governance: the Educating Cities movement in a Portuguese town
T2  - EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Educational processes have had to deal with the significant changes that have been occurring throughout the world, at different levels, in the last few decades. The Educating Cities movement, which has been followed by cities from all over the world - from Rwanda to Denmark, through Mexico, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Italy - is an attempt to deal with such changes. The movement defines the deepening of the practice of democratic values as the greatest challenge of the twenty-first century. This article explores the role of social and educational mediation in the Educating Cities movement. Its empirical focus is on some of the experiences of the cities that belong to this network, with a special emphasis on the city of Porto, Portugal.

AB  - This article aims at contributing to the understanding of the socio-environmental conflicts that take place within cities, mainly those connected to urban fluvial environments in Brazil. Therefore, a historical assessment of land use was conducted, analysing the process of urbanization and its influences upon the denial of fluvial courses as an element of urban spaces. The chosen case study was the drainage network of Recife fluvial plain, where the core area of the homonymous metropolis is located, State of Pernambuco, Brazil. It is concluded that controversial scenarios co-exist, juxtaposing intense socio-environmental degradation to fragmented sectors with better infra-structure offer, reduced socio-environmental inequalities, recreation areas and riverine requalification. In the latter context, the adequate environment is created to promote public and private investments, that aggregate scenic and, invariably, real estate value to the fluvial landscape.

AB  - While sacred groves (forest fragments protected for religious reasons) are widely acknowledged to have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation, the ecological benefits of individual sacred trees remain unknown. Fig trees are present as sacred trees in human-dominated landscapes across South Asia and are considered keystone species for wildlife in tropical forests. If frugivores continue to visit fig trees in disturbed landscapes, they may deposit seeds of other tree species beneath fig canopies, ultimately facilitating forest regeneration. We studied whether sacred fig trees in Tamil Nadu, India can facilitate seed dispersal in human-dominated landscapes. We quantified abundance of sacred fig trees at the study site, assessed whether seed-dispersing frugivore visitation to fig trees is affected by human disturbance, and compared tree seedling density beneath fig trees and open areas. We found that some species of frugivorous birds and bats will visit large fig trees in conditions of high human disturbance and that tree seedling density is significantly higher under sacred trees compared to open areas. By promoting frugivore activity, sacred fig trees may have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - We have proposed a framework for transforming landscapes to improve performance by integrating ecological principles into landscape design. This effort would focus on the development of multifunctional landscapes, guided by the rapidly growing knowledge base of ecosystem services provided by landscape features. Although the conventional approach to landscape ecology is based on a model that assumes poor ecological quality in the human-dominated matrix, a review of recent literature reveals important opportunities to improve the quality of the landscape matrix by increasing spatial heterogeneity through the addition of seminatural landscape elements designed to provide multiple ecosystem services. Taken alone, these individual elements might not appear to have a large impact on the environment, but when considered together within the entire landscape, the contribution could be significant, particularly when these elements are intentionally designed to improve landscape performance. Previous attention has focused on the value of large patches of native vegetation for conservation efforts. These efforts have included preserving those areas that still remain, restoring those that once existed, and providing connectivity between them. But great opportunities exist to improve the quality of the matrix by designing multifunctional elements throughout the landscape. Through a synthesis of knowledge in landscape architecture and landscape ecology, we have demonstrated some important applications of the landscape performance framework in urban and agricultural settings. Based on a review of the literature, we have suggested several methods of evaluating and monitoring landscape performance to determine the relative success of a designed landscape.

AB  - Urbanization may have a large affect on biodiversity patterns by enhancing biological invasions. Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

We found three close connected haplotypes, with low nucleotide diversity and a haplotype diversity of 59.1% and confirmed sympatry between D. albiventris and D. aurita in this region. The clear phylogenetic separation shows the appropriateness of DNA barcode identification methodology for effectively discriminating between these opossum species.

AB  - Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) functional assessment models were used to assess whether function in created wetlands of two ages (1 year old and > 12 years old) was equivalent to that of natural (reference) mainstem floodplain wetlands. Reference wetlands scored higher than both created age classes for providing energy dissipation and short-term surface water storage. Reference wetlands scored higher in maintaining native plant community and structure than 1-year-old sites, and 12-year-old wetlands scored higher than reference sites for providing vertebrate habitat structure. Analysis of individual model variables showed that reference wetlands had greater vegetative biomass and higher soil organic matter content than both created wetland age classes. Created wetlands were farther from natural wetlands and had smaller mean forest patch sizes within a 1-km-radius circle around the site than did the reference sites, indicating less hydrologic connectivity. Created wetlands also had less microtopographic variation than reference wetlands. The 1-year-old created sites were placed in landscape settings with greater land use diversity and road density than reference sites. The 12-year-old sites had a higher gradient and a higher percentage of their surrounding area in urban land use. These results show that the created wetlands were significantly structurally different (if not functionally so) from reference wetlands even after 12 years. The most profound differences were in hydrology and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. More attention needs to be focused on placing created wetlands in appropriate settings to encourage proper hydrodynamics, eliminate habitat fragmentation, and minimize the effects of stressors to the site.

AB  - This paper examines the role of urban agriculture (UA) projects in relieving food insecurity in lower-income neighborhoods of post-industrial U.S. cities, using Philadelphia as a case study. Based on food justice literature and mixed-methods such as GIS, survey, field observations, and interviews, we discuss how neighborhoods, nearby residents, and the local food economy interact with UA projects. Our findings suggest that, although UA projects occupy a vital place in the fight against community food insecurity in disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods, there are debates and concerns associated with the movement. These concerns include geographic, economic, and informational accessibility of UA projects; social exclusion in the movement; spatial mismatch between UA participants and neighborhood socioeconomic and racial profiles; distribution of fresh produce to populations under poverty and hunger; and UA's economic contributions in underprivileged neighborhoods. Finally, we outline future research directions that are significant to understanding the practice of UA.

AB  - What are the social and economic consequences of massive destruction of housing? A case study of the New York City fire epidemic of the 1970s is presented. Decision-makers regarded old neighbourhoods (with low-income families and/or racial minorities) as wastelands and developed policies such as urban renewal and reductions in public services ('planned shrinkage') which negatively impacted on the physical and social fabrics. Structural and functional continuity even after a disturbance - ecological resilience - depends on many non-disjunctive 'loose' relationships to diffuse these impacts. Systems based on 'tight' relationships amplify impacts. Families with resources relocate and reduce the community diversity and the density of loose ties. Low-income families whose homes are destroyed weaken the remaining social networks. The remnant cannot maintain social norms. This displacement leads to two possibilities: many small social networks that do not interact; or one large tight network with low diversity. The former confers pathological resilience; the latter, extreme fragility. Neither enforces social norms or generates political power. Both foster risk behaviours and hamper socialization of youth. Thus, concentrated housing destruction destroys healthy resilience and social control and support. Indirectly, it elevates the mortality rate through increased risk behaviours, high death rates among vulnerable elderly, and infectious and chronic diseases.

AB  - The historic cities of Brazil, despite its colonial structure, don't fail to go through transformations that affect contemporary cities, which is the main source of problems, leading to new approaches to urban issues such as mobility and accessibility. The uncontrolled growth of tourism in the historic cities can be considered as a big problem, because at the same time, they have committed to the conservation of its built heritage and demand control of the activities that occur in their areas without harm. Then, a permanent dialogue between conservatives and planners could be accomplished by joining the various sectoral policies. The study of urban mobility in historical sites was in fact the focus of this work because of their peculiarities, such as its specific characteristics of urban structure, morphology and occupation. In fact, the development of tourism in historic centers generates specific demands, such as adaptation to new uses of the houses, intensive movement of people and vehicles, illegal parking, among others. Beyond threatening the city preservation, does not provide mobility and accessibility to tourists, because these cities were not designed for the tourism conditions and needs of contemporary life. Characteristic features of Brazilian baroque cities, such as topography, the narrow streets, narrow or nonexistent sidewalks, steep turns and ramps strong, are not suitable for heavy vehicles, traffic and pedestrian circulation. Thus, studies concerning conservation urban integrated are aimed at an approach to interaction between historic preservation of the environment with the dynamic socio-economic of the local.

AB  - Conservation of critical habitats for shorebirds (Charadriiformes : Charadrii), usually requires spatially explicit identification of each habitat. Most non-breeding shorebirds depend on two critical habitats: foraging (intertidal flats) and roosting (safe and open supratidal sites). We used published information on use of high-tide roosts by shorebirds to develop models of roost selection (probability of occurrence) and usage (mean abundance) for 12 species of shorebirds spending the non-breeding season in Moreton Bay, in subtropical eastern Australia. Selection of roosts was most strongly affected by the proximity to a large foraging area, field of view and to a lesser extent by composition of the surrounding landscape. Abundance of the most common species, such as Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica), Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) and Whimbrel (N. phaeopus), depended on distance to the nearest large foraging area or the size of the roost per se. Our results suggest that the shorebird species occurring in a subtropical Australian estuary use two generalised types of roosts: exposed ocean-front roosts typified by supratidal spits and sandbars and patches of claypan saltmarsh in the upper reaches of the tidal range surrounded by mangroves. The amount of these habitats available in Moreton Bay was examined by visiting unmonitored sites with a predicted high probability of occupancy by two key species, Eastern Curlew and Bar-tailed Godwit. Few of the unmonitored sites currently supported many shorebirds. These data suggest that despite the high demand on coastal land for urban development in Moreton Bay, suitable roosting habitat is still available near their foraging areas.

AB  - Similarity in species composition among different areas plays an essential task in biodiversity management and conservation since it allows the identification of those environmental gradients that functionally operate in determining variation in species composition across spatial scale. The decay of compositional similarity with increasing spatial or environmental distance derives from: 1) the presence of spatial constraints which create a physical separation among habitats, or 2) the decrease in environmental similarity with increasing distance. Even if the distance decay of compositional similarity represents a well known pattern characterising all types of biological communities, few attempts were made to examine this pattern at small spatial scales with respect to both grain and extent. Aim of this work was to test whether the distance decay of similarity 1) can be observed at a local scale in situations where environmental conditions are relatively homogeneous and ecological barriers are absent, and 2) is dependent on the grain size at which plant community data are recorded. We selected two urban brownfields located at Bremen university campus, Germany, of 40 m x 20 m each, systematically divided in nested plots with an increasing spatial scale of 0.25 m(2), 1 m(2), 4 m(2) and 16 m(2). Both plant species composition and soil variables were recorded in each cell. Linear and logarithmic least squares regression models were applied in order to examine the decay of similarity due to spatial distance (calculated as the Euclidean distance among pairs of plots) and environmental distance (calculated as the Euclidean distance among PCA-transformed soil variables). A general lack of distance decay was observed, irrespective of the type of distance (spatial or environmental) or the grain size. We argue that this is probably due to a random variation both of the important environmental parameters and of the local distribution patterns of individual species, the latter mainly caused by the high dispersal abilities of the majority of species occurring in the brownfields.

AB  - The extent to which the 21st century world will be "sustainable" depends in large part on the sustainability of cities. Early ideas on implementing sustainability focused on concepts of achieving stability, practicing effective management and the control of change and growth - a "fail-safe" mentality. More recent thinking about change, disturbance, uncertainty, and adaptability is fundamental to the emerging science of resilience, the capacity of systems to reorganize and recover from change and disturbance without changing to other states - in other words, systems that are "safe to fail." While the concept of resilience is intellectually intriguing, it remains largely unpracticed in contemporary urban planning and design. This essay discusses the theory of resilience as it applies to urban conditions, and offers a suite of strategies intended to build urban resilience capacity: multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization, (bio and social) diversity, multi-scale networks and connectivity, and adaptive planning and design. The strategies are discussed in the context of resilience theory and sustainability science, and are illustrated with innovative policies, projects, and programs selected from international examples.

AB  - Little is known about changes in the significance of environmental filtering and neutral processes during the succession of plant communities. Generally, a succession is expected to be trait-driven and a shift is predicted from high importance of seed dispersal ability in initial phases to importance of strong competitive ability in later stages. In this study, we consider a community assembly trait-driven in the case of a shift in functional traits during succession and randomly assembled in the case there is no shift in functional traits during succession. We therefore tested whether urban plant communities show trait convergence or trait divergence in relation of successional stage, water and nutrient availability. At two scales (100 x 100 cm and 10 x 10 cm), we analysed traits relevant to seed dispersal, stress tolerance and competitive ability and compared real data with null models. We subsequently used regression trees to associate convergence and divergence to plot age and stress due to low water and soil nutrient availability. Most traits were neither significantly convergent nor divergent and the variance explained by the regression trees was often lower than 20%. We found divergence in seed number instead of the expected convergence towards high seed number. In accord with expectations we found low seed terminal velocity and annual life span in early succession. Convergence in seed bank longevity occurred at intermediate plot age, and convergence in the combination of life span and lateral spread showed the relevance of competition filtering in the most fertile plots. On the other hand, competition-induced convergence in canopy height or specific leaf area was not supported by our results. We concluded that, based on the traits considered in this study, the overwhelming evidence was that community assembly during the first 40 years of succession was driven by trait-neutral mechanisms.

AB  - The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes, creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Because wildlife ecology, behavior, and evolution at this interface are shaped by both natural and human phenomena, this requires greater understanding of how diverse factors affect ecosystem and population processes. We illustrate the challenge of understanding and managing a frequent and often undesired inhabitant of the wildland-urban landscape, the cougar (Puma concolor). In wildland and residential areas of western Washington State, USA, we captured and radiotracked 27 cougars to model space use and understand the role of landscape features in interactions (sightings, encounters, and depredations) between cougars and humans. Resource utilization functions (RUFs) identified cougar use of areas with features that were probably attractive to prey, influential on prey vulnerability, and associated with limited or no residential development. Early-successional forest (+), conifer forest (+), distance to road ( ), residential density ( ), and elevation ( ) were significant positive and negative predictors of use for the population, whereas use of other landscape features was highly variable. Space use and movement rates in wildland and residential areas were similar because cougars used wildland-like forest patches, reserves, and corridors in residential portions of their home range. The population RUF was a good predictor of confirmed cougar interactions, with 72% of confirmed reports occurring in the 50% of the landscape predicted to be medium-high and high cougar use areas. We believe that there is a threshold residential density at which the level of development modifies the habitat but maintains enough wildland characteristics to encourage moderate levels of cougar use and maximize the probability of interaction. Wildlife managers trying to reduce interactions between cougars and people should incorporate information on spatial ecology and landscape characteristics to identify areas with the highest overlap of human and cougar use to focus management, education, and landscape planning. Resource utilization functions provide a proactive tool to guide these activities for improved coexistence with wildlife using both wildland and residential portions of the landscape.

AB  - Floristic and structural patterns of a forest fragment in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Urban areas result in fragmentation, species loss and ecosystem changes. However, natural ecosystem remnants in urban zones may be refuges or corridors for many species. This study presents floristic and structural features of the tree and understory strata of an urban forest fragment in Cachoeirinha, Rio Grande do Sul. Ninety tree and 15 shrub species were recorded, of which two were endangered, two protected, and nine exotic. In the quantitative sample, 54 species were contemplated in the tree stratum and 45 in the understory. The fragment is characterized as a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest and presents high tree species diversity, reflecting density evenness. Structurally, there are no features of a more conserved core area, although some species tend to occur close to the edges. We believe that conserving semi-natural urban areas like this contributes to maintaining habitats, species diversity, and connectivity among forest remnants in the regional extent, because it maintains the features of the regional forests, including the flora.

AB  - Linear plant compositions establish a connection between rural and urban landscapes. The green fields, which are abundant in rural areas, are diminished in urban spaces due to rapid urbanization. This problem can be solved by using linear planting techniques in urbanized places. Nearby establishing green corridors in cities, linear planting serve as very nice visual compositions and provide functionalities. Linear plant compositions, which are quite important for the city, were examined owing to 3 different purposes. The first is the identifying of the plants having been used in linear green compositions. The second is the determining of the functional differences while the last one is preference and visual perception differences depending on users. In this study, totally 32 species were identified. Ligustrum japonicum, Biota orientalis and Hydrangea macrophylla were recorded as the most common species. The se linear compositions were used as barrier with the rate of 78% in residential areas and 50% in open green spaces, as border with the rate of 40% in public spaces, as curtain with the rate of 86 in public areas, as separator with the rate of 87% in transportation areas. Visual quality of linear compositions was assessed by using chi(2) analysis. Statistically reliable (%95) P<0.005 results were found between user and visual quality As a result, linear plant compositions in Trabzon possess evergreen plant species by 70%. In addition, the linear plant compositions looking aesthetic were identified to be preferred more according to Semantical Differential Technique.

AB  - Restoring longitudinal connectivity is a key river restoration goal. This study tested the efficacy of a fish ramp and spoiler baffles for restoring indigenous fish communities upstream of a culvert. Beforeafter monitoring showed that installation of the ramp and spoiler baffles increased species richness (mean increase 80%) and total fish density (mean increase 45%) upstream of the culvert. Passage trials on the ramp and baffled culvert were carried out using inanga, Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns), a commonly occurring weak-swimming migratory fish. The trials showed that inanga were capable of successfully ascending both the ramp (overall 27.1% success) and culvert with baffles (overall 6.2% success) under the conditions tested (cf. 0% success for this species before retrofitting), but passage efficiency was still relatively low in both cases. Retrofitting of culverts can therefore be effective for restoring upstream fish passage. However, to maximize effectiveness it is essential that restoration goals are well defined and retrofitting solutions are designed appropriately for the target species.

AB  - We examined the assemblage of bats in a fragmented landscape along the northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico, West Indies, by mist netting and acoustic monitoring over a period of 25 months. Twelve of the 13 species present in the region were detected. It took nine nights of net and acoustic monitoring to detect 69% of the species, and 44 nights to reach 92%. Diversity was high, considering the insular nature of the assemblage and the fragmented nature of the ecosystem. We did not detect any important seasonal pattern in bat activity. The fruit eating bats at this study site are important importers of various seeds. Artibetis jamaicensis was most frequently captured and it appears to breed throughout the year at this location. Our results have important implications for management and conservation of biological diversity on tropical islands, and set a baseline against which the effect of further urban encroachment can be compared.

AB  - We investigated the genetic structure and diversity of an endangered Canadian population of the Mormon metalmark butterfly (Apodemia mormo) using, for the first time, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers generated from non-lethal samples of butterfly wing tissue. Based on 326 loci, our analyses show a high degree of spatial genetic structure within the population, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic range (< 20 km). We found that geographic distance, particularly measured along valley bottoms, restricts gene flow within this population. However, other potential barriers to movement and genetic exchange were also identified, in particular urban development. Overall, the population exhibited low levels of genetic diversity. Future management should focus on increasing gene flow between the most isolated sub-populations, and through urban areas, by preserving and restoring as many habitat patches as possible.

AB  - Balancing the needs of biodiversity in the context of ecologically sustainable development remains a challenging and ongoing issue for consent authorities, developers and scientists alike. This article explores some of the practical, scientific, legislative and policy issues facing the protection of biodiversity in the context of urbanisation. The application of legislative and policy instruments to environmental decision-making needs to be complemented with more site-specific, evidenced-based research and with regard to the biodiversity of the broader landscape. It is argued that such an approach will help determine more accurately the likely long-term environmental outcomes that can be expected from setbacks, offsets, buffers and corridors within urban landscapes. In examining the question of setbacks adjacent to development, various relevant examples of court decisions are considered. In addition, a range of recent research studies are used to show that riparian zones are ecologically distinct as compared with non-riparian bushland. In addition, riparian corridor width is shown to influence the composition of flora and invertebrate fauna communities, supporting the use of wide buffers to maximise biodiversity outcomes. The application of site-specific empirical findings in biodiversity planning and decision-making will help limit and mitigate the key threatening processes of clearing and fragmentation.

AB  - Species with highly restricted distributions are vulnerable to extinction, and modification of natural habitats within their small ranges is a primary threat to their persistence. Expansion of urban development significantly impacts natural habitats and, therefore, threatens local diversity. The Mexican axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, is a strictly aquatic species that persists currently in two highly threatened and isolated populations. The current habitat remaining for these species are remnants of a historically extensive lacustrine system that occupied the entire Valley of Mexico, but has been destroyed by the growth of Mexico City. Unexpectedly, a third viable population of axolotls has been found in Chapultepec Park, a public recreational area in the heart of Mexico City. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences confirmed low genetic differentiation and a recurrent lack of monophyly in many of the taxa belonging to the Ambystoma tigrinum species group, including A. mexicanum, but clustered the Chapultepec samples with other A. mexicanum samples. Our data revealed higher haplotypic diversity in A. mexicanum populations than previously recorded, due to new haplotypes from Chapultepec Park. We found high incidence of parasites and deformities among individuals in this population, which could negatively impact their viability. Our results emphasize the important role that artificial or semi-natural urban habitats can play in the conservation of highly threatened species.

AB  - A landscape planning approach and a landscape management model, based on "landscape ecology", have been developed in this study. First, natural process (disturbance), human activity (disturbance) and habitat patches have been determined as criterias of the definitive space in landscape planning and this criterias, has been analysed in terms of "landscape fragility". Analysis have been conducted in ecological units that have been determined by six criteria (climate, dominant soil groups, aspect, land capacity, land cover, geology). Then, by using the data and the results of the analysis, "landscape management model" have been formed and some suggestions have been made for the research area. By using ecological units in planning, problems have been determined in the smallest homogen units and suggestions have been made. By using tables, that have been formed during the implementation phase, planning decisions have been transferred to the case study area. By the introduction of landscape ecology in planning, the traditional ecological planning approach that has been institutionalized by Overlay model, has been changed. Being a human centered ecological planning model, this approach focuses on landscape suitability for human uses. Introduction of idea and concepts related to landscape ecology has initiated a shift towards some values in planning; such as, environmental ethics, sustainability, ecological fit, ecological integrity and diversity, ecological aesthetics and maintenance of functional landscapes. As a conclucion, it has been proved that, the results of the analysis that have been obtained by landscape fragility, can be used in various planning and management disciplines, including natural resource management (forestry ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, etc.), landscape planning and urban and regional planning.

AB  - The study develops an approach adopted by artificial neural networks (ANN) to model the relationship between pondscape and waterbird diversity. Study areas with thousands of irrigation ponds are unique geographic features from the original functions of irrigation converted to waterbird refuges. The model considers pond shape and size, neighboring farmlands, and constructed areas in calculating parameters pertaining to the interactive influences on avian diversity, among them the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Results indicate that irrigation ponds adjacent to farmland benefited waterbird diversity. On the other hand, urban development leads to the reduction of pond numbers, which reduces waterbird diversity. By running the ANN model, the resulting index shows a good-fit prediction of bird diversity against pond size, shape, neighboring farmlands, and neighboring developed areas with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.72, in contrast to the results from a linear regression model (r < 0.28).

AB  - Biodiversity goals are becoming increasingly important in stream restoration. Typical models of stream restoration are based on the assumption that if habitat is restored then species will return and ecological processes will re-establish. However, a range of constraints at different scales can affect restoration success. Much of the research in stream restoration ecology has focused on habitat constraints, namely the in-stream and riparian conditions required to restore biota. Dispersal constraints are also integral to determining the timescales, trajectory and potential endpoints of a restored ecosystem. Dispersal is both a means of organism recolonization of restored sites and a vital ecological process that maintains viable populations. We review knowledge of dispersal pathways and explore the factors influencing stream invertebrate dispersal. From empirical and modeling studies of restoration in warm-temperate zones of New Zealand, we make predictions about the timescales of stream ecological restoration under differing levels of dispersal constraints. This process of constraints identification and timescale prediction is proposed as a practical step for resource managers to prioritize and appropriately monitor restoration sites and highlights that in some instances, natural recolonization and achievement of biodiversity goals may not occur.

AB  - Corridors such as roads and trails can facilitate invasions by non-native plant species. The open, disturbed habitat associated with corridors provides favorable growing conditions for many non-native plant species. Bike trails are a corridor system common to many urban areas that have not been studied for their potential role in plant invasions. We sampled five linear segments of urban forest along bike trails in Lincoln, Nebraska to assess the invasion of woody non-native species relative to corridors and to assess the composition of these urban forests. The most abundant plant species were generally native species, but five non-native species were also present: white mulberry (Morus alba), common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) and elm (Ulmus spp.). The distribution of two of the woody species sampled, common buckthorn and honeysuckle, significantly decreased with increasing distance from a source patch of vegetation (P = 0.031 and 0.030). These linear habitats are being invaded by non-native tree and shrub species, which may change the structure of these urban forest corridors. If non-native woody plant species become abundant in the future, they may homogenize the plant community and reduce native biodiversity in these areas.

AB  - Propagule pressure can determine the success or failure of invasive plant range expansion. Range expansion takes place at large spatial scales, often encompassing many types of land cover, yet the effect of landscape context on propagule pressure remains largely unknown. Many studies have reported a positive correlation between invasive plant abundance and human land use; increased propagule pressure in these landscapes may be responsible for this correlation. We tested the hypothesis that increased rates of seed dispersal by fig-eating birds, which are more common in urban habitats, result in an increase in invasive strangler fig abundance in landscapes dominated by human land use. We quantified abundance of an invasive species (Ficus microcarpa) and a native species (F. aurea) of strangler fig in plots spanning the entire range of human land use in South Florida, USA, from urban parking lots to native forest. We then compared models that predicted juvenile fig abundance based on distance to adult fig seed sources and fig-eating bird habitat quality with models that lacked one or both of these terms. The best model for juvenile invasive fig abundance included both distance to adult and fig-eating bird habitat terms, suggesting that landscape effects on invasive fig abundance are mediated by seed-dispersing birds. In contrast, the best model for juvenile native fig abundance included only presence/absence of adults, suggesting that distance from individual adult trees may have less effect on seed limitation for a native species compared to an invasive species undergoing range expansion. However, models for both species included significant effects of adult seed sources, implying that juvenile abundance is limited by seed arrival. This result was corroborated by a seed addition experiment that indicated that both native and invasive strangler figs were strongly seed limited. Understanding how landscape context affects the mechanisms of plant invasion may lead to better management techniques. Our results suggest that prioritizing removal of adult trees in sites with high fig-eating bird habitat may be the most effective method to control F. microcarpa abundance.

AB  - Migration routes of many Nearctic-Neotropical landbirds pass through the most urbanized regions of North America. Migrants are known to use urban habitats as stopover sites and often occur in cities at exceptional density: yet knowledge of migrant behaviour and ecology in such places is surprisingly limited. We radio-tracked ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) during stopovers in a New York City park to obtain some of the first detailed information on how landbird migrants utilize an urban habitat as a stopover site. We examined fine-scale movement patterns, home range sizes, stopover durations, and how arrival condition affected each of these metrics. During both seasons, most birds moved widely throughout the site upon presumed arrival and then either continued migration that night or settled into a more defined area on subsequent days. Area usage varied markedly among individuals during both seasons, ranging 1-16 ha. Stopover durations averaged 3.0 days (range = 1-10 days) during spring and 2.9 days (range = 1-14 days) during autumn. Spatial behaviours and stopover durations were not influenced by arrival condition during spring, and during autumn only movement rates and displacement distances were significantly (negatively) condition-related. Our findings do not support previous assumptions that urban stopover habitats are only used by migrants briefly in times of urgency when alternatives are unavailable. At least half of the birds we studied stopped over for multiple days during both seasons, and bird movements were indicative of an ability to search for, locate, and occupy suitable micro-sites. Ovenbird behaviour in our study site was similar in many ways to what has been observed in recent telemetry studies of ovenbirds and other passerine migrants at various non-urban stopover sites.

KW  - gender
KW  - feminist theory
AB  - The right to the city is a collective right in construction proposed in 2005 in the World Charter for the Right to the City. It is the result of various social, economic, cultural and collective vindicating processes of rights, led by social movements worldwide, who assembled in the various Social Forum meetings have approached its definition, which still in conception includes: the equitable usufruct of cities, goods, services, and opportunities they offer to all residents within the principles of sustainability, support, democracy, equity and social justice.
   This article highlights the contributions that to the definition of this new law makes the women's movement, in all its diversity and heterogeneity, which previously to the consecration of the World Charter for the Right to the City provided significant contributions to the definition of its content, revealing how and to what degree gender differences lead to different ways of living the city for both men and women and, up to distinguishing the reasons why poverty and inequality affects them differently.
   The article, finally, approaches the particular content of the right to the city for women, and for this it turns up to the category of gender and to the concept of human security, from which questionings to the overall and universalistic look of human rights arise, aiming to make out of this reflection a path for the creation of a legal and political strategy to prevent manifestations of injustice and that gains a distributive justice in the urban contexts, in which the social goods are equitably distributed in society between men and women, diminishing the limitations that the latter have to access the resources, goods and services the city has to offer.

AB  - The evolution of ports in modern times has been defined by a change in port functions, caused by such factors as the development of technology on ships, of support equipment for the transport of merchandise or storage techniques, changes in the standards of international commerce, changes to the organisation of maritime transportation or the growth and increased complexity of global logistic chains. As a result of these changes, there has been a simultaneous evolution in the structure, morphology and extent of the spaces occupied by ports and complementary activities. In this context, the relationship between the port and city of Lisbon ( Portugal) is characterised by a great complexity imprinted from the onset through the historic traditions that it holds and through the magnitude and intensity of a process that involves the main infrastructure of the national port system and the country's largest city. It can be noted, however, that a symbiotic port-city relationship, in which the port exerted a structural role in the organisation of the city and its functions, has developed into a relationship where the city, the hub of a regional urban system and a main element within the peninsular and European urban network, has become autonomous and developed a generalised character, economically diverse and functionally complex. Despite this evolution, the port remains a nodal point in the integration of the city-region in global systems of physical and non-physical fluxes. As it becomes increasingly less integrated in the urban and functional structure of the city, the port continues to keep the pace of important changes and transformations In effect, in light of theoretical conceptualisation and systemisation and analyses of empirical evidence, the evolution of the relationship between the port and the city of Lisbon (focussing on functional, urban and economic dimensions) can be analysed and a plan outlined to determine an original model that identifies, explains and characterises the main phases of the relationship dynamic.

AB  - Temperature is one of the most important environmental influences on aquatic organisms. It is a primary driver of physiological rates and many abiotic processes. However, despite extensive research and measurements, synoptic estimates of water temperature are not available for most regions, limiting our ability to make systemwide and large-scale assessments of aquatic resources or estimates of aquatic species abundance and biodiversity. We used subwatershed averaging of point temperature measurements and associated multiscale landscape habitat conditions from over 3,300 lotic sites throughout New York State to develop and train artificial neural network models. Separate models predicting water temperature (in cold, cool, and warm temperature classes) within small catchment-stream order groups were developed for four modeling units, which together encompassed the entire state. Water temperature predictions were then made for each stream segment in the state. All models explained more than 90% of data variation. Elevation, riparian forest cover, landscape slope, and growing degree-days were among the most important model predictors of water temperature classes. Geological influences varied among regions. Predicted temperature distributions within stream networks displayed patterns of generally increasing temperature downstream but were patchy due to the averaging of water temperatures within stream size-classes of small drainages. Models predicted coldwater streams to be most numerous and warmwater streams to be generally associated with the largest rivers and relatively flat agricultural areas and urban areas. Model predictions provide a complete, georeferenced map of summer daytime mean stream temperature potential throughout New York State that can be used for planning and assessment at spatial scales from the stream segment class to the entire state.

AB  - Kucukcekmece, is one of the important districts to define the city of Istanbul at the international level with its historical, cultural, and natural values. In this study, the parks in Kucukcekmece District were examined in terms of ecological quality, principles, and standards. Ecological quality is a composite of the structural and functional features determining the habitat values of a landscape. An objective evaluation on the ecological quality of parks is important from the point of rehabilitation from an existing situation, and providing areas which will have high habitat value in the future. Recovery in the existing park area will generate a livable urban atmosphere. In line with this basic comprehension, the ecological quality of the parks in Istanbul's Kucukcekmece District was examined. There are four principles determining ecological quality of an area: vegetative production, water, permeability (soil), and natural vegetation cover (biological diversity). This research was done in two phases regarding the permeability and natural vegetation cover using ecological quality principles.
   In the first phase of the study, a vegetation list was provided by the Park and Garden Department of the Kucukcekmece Municipality, The park names and size were acquired from the "Kucukcekmece District green corridor Transformation Project". The space where the soil surface is covered by soil material, or is suppressed because of overuse and can not sustain plant growth is accepted as an impermeable soil surface. Whether there is a relation between park areas and permeable surface areas was examined using the Spearman correlation test. Whether permeability ratio of parks changes according to their location was analyzed using the Chi-Square test.
   In the second stage of the study, the existing vegetation cover was analyzed on-site. Existing vegetation cover analysis is made according to trees, shrubs, bushes, flowers, and trailings.
   Findings of, this study show that the average permeability ratio is 35.19% and the naturality ratio is 52% in the 63 parks under examination. This study shows that the permeable land surfaces of the parks remain incapable of sustaining vegetative growth and therefore the habitat values of the park areas, which can have an economic, social and ecologic contribution to the urban environment, will reduce.
   Result of this study will contribute to the sampling used for the ecological quality principles in other parks in other districts. The study reveals the importance of the ecological quality factors that need to be taken into consideration in the design and planning of parks.

AB  - Effective planning to support and enhance ecological values in sites of conservation interest requires accurate, comprehensive and detailed ecologically based maps and data, not only for the conservation site but for the wider landscape in which such sites are situated. In this paper we present an efficient and low cost method for combining appropriate technologies and available data to produce such maps at a landscape level. This method is described and evaluated using a case study of a land use and habitat map, with an associated geographic information system (GIS). The map was created for the district of Dunedin, New Zealand, an area of approximately 3340 km2. This paper demonstrates how the map can be adapted for use by small, locally based conservation organisations that typically do not have the resources to obtain detailed, consistent and comprehensive spatial data for the areas they manage. The example of Orokonui Ecosanctuary is used to illustrate the potential applications of the map including mapping assets and habitats within a site and for exploring the relationship between the Ecosanctuary's internal and external habitats. External habitats can form a vital habitat network for many of the endangered species being reintroduced into the Ecosanctuary as well as a source of threats through potential reinvasion by pests and land use change. Though the mapping method presented in this paper is not necessarily new, it demonstrates the potential for utilising advances in mapping techniques and available data sets to offer a pragmatic support mechanism of practical value for small conservation organisations.

AB  - Peri-urban areas are sites currently experiencing the most active urbanization. In order to quantify the complexity in urban growth patterns and processes, based on the common boundary and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI) analysis, we developed six spatial rules to identify three urban growth types of infilling, edge-expansion and outlying in 2000-2008. In addition, growth density (GD) with buffer zone analysis was applied to ascertain urban movement from the city center. Results indicated the prominent urban growth type was edge-expansion, with continued urbanization most prominently in the peri-urban areas. The infilling growth increment proportion in the second study period (2004-2008) suggested the study area was experiencing an increased coalescence pattern and declined diffusion pattern. However, the highest infilling GD zones that occurred primarily near the city center did not vary significantly in 2000-2008. The intensive urban growth zones in the first study period (2000-2004) followed by later efficient infill growth also suggested urban growth was more compact in the second study period. Furthermore, two land use change maps showed that substantial arable land was lost by urban growth in 2000-2008, and the establishment of industrial parks encroached on large salt marsh in the second study period. Further research is required to delineate a suitable development management plan to sustain a baseline for urban growth. Furthermore, the integration of a zoning approach associated with the green belt is suggested to play a key role in a transition to continued urbanization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) woodlands are the focus of intensive conservation efforts. However, little is known about regeneration in protected oak stands, particularly in small stands surrounded by residential and commercial development. This study investigates the relationship between habitat and landscape structure and patterns of oak seedling and sapling abundance. Specifically, I ask whether patterns of oak seedling and sapling abundance reflect the habitat preferences of animals that disperse acorns and whether seedling and sapling abundance differ in urban versus non-urban landscapes. I conducted vegetation surveys within 30 oak woodlands with natural understory distributed across a gradient of urban development. I used general linear mixed models to determine relationships between oak seedling and sapling abundance and habitat and landscape features. Seedling and sapling patterns showed different relationships to habitat and landscape structure, suggesting that different factors mediate the transition between each stage. I found that seedlings are most abundant under oak and non-oak forest canopy and least abundant under no forest canopy, possibly reflecting dispersal patterns. I found no relationship between seedling abundance and urban development, but young saplings show a negative relationship with urban development. These results suggest that seed dispersers influence seedling spatial patterns, but that this influence is reduced in later life history stages. Although urban development is not related to seedling production, young sapling abundance was significantly lower in urban landscapes. Improved understanding of how habitat and landscape structure influence forest regeneration processes is needed in order to create effective forest restoration and management plans.

AB  - Wave- and current-protected shallows have been constructed in the heavily modified, urban River Spree to create a littoral habitat with reduced hydrodynamical disturbances by navigation. Five years after construction and an initial planting of various macrophytes, abiotic conditions were measured and the establishment of aquatic and riparian vegetation was assessed. This study aimed to quantify the effective reduction of hydrodynamic disturbances and to assess the rehabilitation of aquatic plants and the improvement of the macrophytes-based ecological status by means of the reference index (RI).
   Wave stress has been successfully reduced and a diverse, abundant community of aquatic and riparian plants developed resembling the vegetation of natural oxbows. Most of the planted species were still present after five years, and in addition, several new species became established. The aquatic plants at the rehabilitated site indicated a "good" ecological status and even the "high" status if planted species were excluded from the RI. In contrast, the control site remained largely unvegetated indicating a "bad" status.
   Abiotic conditions other than wave action confirmed low hydrological connectivity and the ecosystem-engineering capabilities of vegetation. Low oxygen saturation and the accumulation of organic material limit the habitat suitability for other biota. Principally, wave-protected shallows are well suited to improve aquatic macrophytes in urban waterways. They will be rapidly naturally colonized, while planting of macrophytes, especially of species typical for advanced stages of succession should be omitted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural systems undergo processes, flows, and rhythms that differ from those of urban sociocultural systems. While the former takes place over eras or many generations, the latter may occur within years or even months. Natural systems change includes no principle of intentional progress or enhancement of complexity. In contrast, sociocultural systems change occurs through inherited characteristics, learning, and cultural transmission [1]. Both are dynamic, heterogeneous, and vulnerable to regime shifts, and are inextricably linked. The interrelations among natural and anthropogenic factors affecting sustainability vary spatially and temporally. This paper focuses on landscape changes along the Carioca River valley in Rio de Janeiro, located in the Brazilian Neotropical Southeastern Region, and its implications for local urban sustainability. The study incorporates a transdisciplinary approach that integrates landscape ecology and urban morphology methodologies to gauge landscape change and assess social-ecological systems dynamics. The methodology includes a variety of landscape change assessments; including on-site landscape ecological, landscape morphology, biological and urbanistic surveys, to gauge urban watershed quality. It presents an adapted inventory for assessment of urban tropical rivers, Neotropical Urban Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (NUSVAP), and correlates the level of stream and rainforest integrity to local urban environmental patterns and processes. How can urban regional land managers, planners and communities work together to promote shifts toward more desirable configurations and processes? An understanding of the transient behavior of social-ecological systems and how they respond to change and disturbance is fundamental to building appropriate management strategies and fostering resilience, regenerative capacity, and sustainable development in urban watersheds. The sociocultural patterns, processes and dynamics of Rio's hillsides suggest that increasing the multifunctionality, flexibility, adaptability and connectivity of open spaces may influence carrying, adaptive and regenerative capacities of urban landscape systems.

AB  - Recent research has proposed a scale-dependence to relationships between native diversity and exotic invasions. At fine spatial scales, native-exotic richness relationships should be negative as higher native richness confers resistance to invasion. At broad scales, relationships should be positive if natives and exotics respond similarly to extrinsic factors. Yet few studies have examined both native and exotic richness patterns across gradients of human influence, where impacts could affect native and exotic species differently. We examined native-exotic richness relationships and extrinsic drivers of plant species richness and distributions across an urban development gradient in remnant oak savanna patches. In sharp contrast to most reported results, we found a negative relationship at the regional scale, and no relationship at the local scale. The negative regional-scale relationship was best explained by extrinsic factors, surrounding road density and climate, affecting natives and exotics in opposite ways, rather than a direct effect of native on exotic richness, or vice versa. Models of individual species distributions also support the result that road density and climate have largely opposite effects on native and exotic species, although simple life history traits (life form, dispersal mode) do not predict which habitat characteristics are important for particular species. Roads likely influence distributions and species richness by increasing both exotic propagule pressure and disturbance to native species. Climate may partially explain the negative relationship due to differing climatic preferences within the native and exotic species pools. As gradients of human influence are increasingly common, negative broad-scale native-exotic richness relationships may be frequent in such landscapes.

AB  - This article examines the evolution of the current legal and planning system influencing urban rivers in New South Wales. A future direction for legislators and policy makers is presented as a means to improve the condition of urban waterways. Ensuring water management professionals appropriately value river systems is a key element. Waterways occupy a tenuous position in the urban landscape despite their ecological significance, often providing the last refuges for biodiversity. Smaller waterways are often piped to improve stormwater drainage, while larger systems are chemically, physically and biologically degraded as a result of development within the catchment. Legal, planning and policy arrangements have historically provided limited protection for urban waterways and riparian environments. This is due to four main factors: rivers are traditionally valued for their utility as conduits for stormwater to manage flooding; the biodiversity value of riparian areas is not widely understood and acknowledged; the cumulative impacts of development on river health are not recognised; and an inadequate legal definition for river in legislation and at common law. The fate of many urban riparian environments is often determined due to death by a thousand pipes.

AB  - The model of a suburban growth, in its continuous and messy expansion, erodes the rural territories that characterize the Mediterranean area, creating processes of modernization, where the consolidated models of development are undermined by regressive phenomena. The condition of being a border area can produce many critical knots with a strong environmental impact on the territory. In order to promote a sustainable growth of the Mediterranean city, therefore, rethinking the city border, meant as a crucial interface among the complex relationships of interchange between the urban/rural system, play today a key role in restoring the levels of liveability in the "sensitive" zones. In these areas, interventions of environmental rehabilitation and design of common spaces represent functional tools to define innovative methods for the control of the territorial transformation and management, able to directly affect the changes of the environmental micro and macro-systems. Through aimed actions the constitution of an ecological peri-urban network is configured, which can allow the restoration of the ecosystems compromised by now, the constitution of new natural units and, above all, the progressive recreation of the connections among such units as essential condition to the preservation and improvement of the values of territorial biodiversity.

AB  - We investigated the effects of human trampling on boreal forest understory vegetation on, and off paths from suburban forest edges towards the interiors and on the likelihood of trampling-aided dispersal into the forests for three years by carrying out a trampling experiment. We showed that the vegetation was highly sensitive to trampling. Even low levels of trampling considerably decreased covers of the most abundant species on the paths. Cover decreased between 10 and 30% on paths which had been trampled 35 times, and at least by 50% on those trampled 70-270 times. On-path vegetation cover decreased similarly at forest edges and in the interiors. However, some open habitat plant species that occurred outside the forest patches and at forest edges dispersed into the forests, possibly through the action of trampling. A higher cover percentage of an open habitat species at the forest edge line increased its probability to disperse into the forest interior. The vegetation community on, next to, and away from lightly trampled paths remained the same throughout the trampling experiment. For heavily trampled paths, the community changed drastically on the paths, but stayed relatively similar next to and away from the paths. As boreal vegetation is highly sensitive to the effects of trampling, overall ease of access throughout the forest floor should be restricted to avoid the excessive creation of spontaneous paths. To minimize the effects of trampling, recreational use could be guided to the maintained path network in heavily used areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies using vegetation plots have demonstrated that habitat type is a good predictor of the level of plant invasion, expressed as the proportion of alien to all species. At local scale, habitat types explain the level of invasion much better than alien propagule pressure. Moreover, it has been shown that patterns of habitat invasion are consistent among European regions with contrasting climates, biogeography, history and socioeconomic background. Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe.
   European Union and some adjacent countries.
   We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class. We projected the levels of invasion on the CORINE land-cover map of Europe, extrapolating Catalonian data to the Mediterranean bioregion, Czech data to the Continental bioregion, British data to the British Isles and combined Czech-British data to the Atlantic and Boreal bioregions.
   The highest levels of invasion were predicted for agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes, low levels for natural and semi-natural grasslands and most woodlands, and the lowest levels for sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands. The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe.
   High level of invasion is predicted in lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe and low level in the boreal zone and mountain regions across the continent. Low level of invasion is also predicted in the Mediterranean region except its coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land.

AB  - This study comprised an inventory of vascular plants in 450 small water reservoirs (up to 1 ha in size). Most water bodies (76%) in the study area (Krajenskie Lakeland, NW, Poland) were located in an agricultural landscape, typical of the region. A total of 576 species of vascular plants were recorded. Of these, about 76% were native species, 34 taxa were listed as legally protected in Poland and endangered in the region (Western Pomerania) or in Poland. 201 plant communities were identified, including 128 associations.
   Depending on the surrounding habitat, the following groups of ponds were identified: (1) mid-forest ponds; (2) mid-wetland ponds; ponds between arable fields, including (3) water basins with wide, well developed ecotone zones and (4) ponds with narrow or disturbed contact zones; and (5) ponds in urban areas. 30 ponds of each type were compared in detail. Differentiation and plant species richness of small water reservoirs was dependent on landscape type. The richest ponds were located within fields but isolated from their surroundings by a natural belt of rushes or trees, whilst mid-forest ponds were the poorest. Valorization was based on the presence of valuable flora (e.g. native, rare, and endangered species) and plant communities. This revealed that mid-forest and mid-wetland ponds were the most natural, while ponds in urban areas were the most strongly transformed.
   Ponds in the study area (n = 450) were also analysed for anthropogenic impacts. Anthropogenic stressors were observed in 51% of ponds. The most serious threats to the ponds of the Krajenskie Lakeland were deterioration due to drainage and eutrophication. Over 35% of ponds were connected to a network of drainage ditches, with the highest percentage (57.1%) found in mid-forest ponds type. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Investigations on the ichthyofauna in the Vit River basin were carried out in 2007 and 2008 at 15 sampling points covering the Vit River itself and 5 tributaries in its upper stretch. Fish were sampled applying electricity according to the Standard EN14011. The results obtained were analyzed together with the data of earlier studies. Totally, 45 fish species were recorded in the basin of the Vit River until now. Twenty five of them are considered of conservation significance according to the referred national and international sources. Some of species are enlisted in several sources. Thus, 13 species are enlisted in the Bulgarian Biodiversity Act (Annexes 2 and 4), 14 are in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 19 are in Bern Convention (Annex 3), 10 are in the IUCN Red List, and 14 are in the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC). The most part of the Vit River basin is covered by 4 proposed protected areas of the NATURA'2000 National Network after the Directive 92/43/EEC.
   The species composition of the ichthyofauna remained almost unchanged during the last 35 years. The occurrence of fish species along the river conformed to the hydro-morphological continuum depending on the habitat distribution. Significant changes were found in the recent spatial distribution of fishes in comparison with those recorded in 1970s and 1980s as a result mainly of human activities. As a whole, qualitative and quantitative impoverishment of the ichthyofauna in the upper stretch occurred due to the increasing direct and indirect human pressure. At the same time, a recovery of the fish community downstream the city of Pleven was recorded after the municipal sewage treatment plant had been put in operation.

AB  - Future force networks of the types envisioned for the network centric warfare (NCW) paradigm will be highly diverse, with the diversity spanning a wide range of (a) requirements (e.g., need for capacity, connectivity, survivability), (b) resources (e.g., radios with widely different capabilities and 'smart' (e.g., Software Defined Radios (SDRs)), and (c) environments (e.g., urban, rural). The need to facilitate robust and adaptable communications in such networks has in turn triggered research in the area of cognitive networks that have the ability to 'learn' and generate real-time control actions to adapt to the wide diversity of requirements, resources and environments. However, the combination of diversity and "smart" networking exacerbates the problem of generating reliable and robust network designs. We present in this paper, our work on the use of cognitive mechanisms to assist with the design and analysis of robust NCW-like networks. Based on formal network-science based approaches, our Cognitive Network Engineering Design Analytic Toolset (C-NEDAT) provides for a systematic way to design, analyze and maintain robustness of future force MANETs. We provide in this paper an overview of the key functional modules and design capabilities of C-NEDAT and present example results.

AB  - In Ireland the profile of golf has increased significantly over the last decade. Today golf course superintendents are aware of the need to manage their golf courses in an environmentally friendly manner, to improve existing habitats, plant indigenous trees to increase biodiversity and create wildlife reservoirs. Four parkland golf courses comprising two rural (Gowran Park, "K Club") and two urban/(Elm Park, and Rockmount) were selected to determine the range, selection, management and use of native Irish trees on Irish golf courses in 2005. The courses were selected on the basis of their age, location and land area. A system was developed to grade native material based on the number of insects that different trees support, thus valuing the potential of a particular tree species on its ability to increase biodiversity. Using this method, a table was developed to classify the biodiversity potential of the existing trees on each of the four golf courses. The results show that native Irish tree species such as Quercus, Salix and Betula support more than two hundred insect species while Fraxinus, Sorbus and Taxus support between ten and sixty nine. It was also found that the cultivation of native trees on Irish golf courses was low, with non-native material accounting for most of the tree species found in each of the golf courses thereby limiting the potential to enhance biodiversity. The haphazard nature of the plantings and the lack of connectivity between tree stands indicated little planning of new planting schemes. It is recommended that native trees with local provenance be planted on Irish golf courses to increase biological diversity to create an environment where land use and habitat work harmoniously.

AB  - This paper illustrates a set of simple tools that may be used to assess and communicate the biophysical condition of river and riparian habitat in urban catchments. The tools are based upon information collected using the Urban River Survey (URS), a habitat survey designed for application to 500 m stretches of urban river corridor, and comprise (i) a series of aggregate indices, (ii) three classifications relating to the materials, habitat and vegetation characteristics of urban river stretches, which contribute to an overall score, the Stretch Habitat Quality Index (SHQI), and (iii) two environmental gradients which define a URS matrix of engineering:habitat associations. This toolkit may be used to gather and exchange knowledge about urban river habitat quality to a wide range of specialist or non-technical stakeholders and local community members. It may be used to provide information at the catchment and reach scales to support stakeholder discussions and decision making relating to initial site selection for restoration works; to post project appraisal; and to track changes in river character across space and through time. Example applications of the tools are provided using URS surveys undertaken on tributaries of the River Thames within London in comparison with an archive of previous surveys from three other urban river systems. These tools are being validated in London as part of a larger interdisciplinary research project that is testing the suitability of this type of approach in the context of the London Rivers Action Plan, Water Framework Directive, and urban green space regeneration.

AB  - The closure of the 'public' Paternoster Square, or more accurately, the fortifying of the space with police, private security and metal barriers, was a moment when the real nature of this 'public' space was revealed-only a very specific type of public was welcome, and their activities are restricted to those of work and consumption. The sudden transformation of Paternoster from public to private reflects, in fast-forward mode, the process of the privatization of urban space that is happening in the City of London and beyond. This privatization of vast swathes of the City makes it out of bounds to ordinary people and protest, which greatly undermines the state of our democracy. Armed with picnic baskets, Twister, badminton racquets and our own 'Street Bingo!' a group set off to walk and play in the City in order to explore and challenge the increasingly blurred boundaries between public and private space, and with the aims of creating and reclaiming public space. The City of London is predominantly used as a space of financial accumulation for the elite, however, we reckoned, using the City in different ways would displace and disrupt this primary (dys) function. This paper draws from this action-walk around the City of London using it to discuss the changing nature of urban space that has been central to people's discussions and experiences at Occupy London. The paper also argues that the walk can be a powerful action in which people can begin to re-imagine and re-create urban space.

AB  - Aim
   Mediterranean coastal sand dunes are characterized by both very stressful environmental conditions and intense human pressure. This work aims to separate the relative contributions of environmental and human factors in determining the presence/abundance of native and alien plant species in such an extreme environment at a regional scale.
   Location
   250 km of the Italian Tyrrhenian coast (Region Lazio).
   Methods
   We analysed alien and native plant richness and fitted generalized additive models in a multimodel-inference framework with comprehensive randomizations to evaluate the relative contribution of environmental and human correlates in explaining the observed patterns.
   Results
   Native and alien richness are positively correlated, but different variables influence their spatial patterns. For natives, human population density is the most important factor and is negatively related to richness. Numbers of natives are unexpectedly lower in areas with a high proportion of natural land cover (probably attributable to local farming practices) and, to a lesser degree, affected by the movement of the coastline. On the other hand, alien species richness is strongly related to climatic factors, and more aliens are found in sectors with high rainfall. Secondarily, alien introductions appear to be related to recent urban sprawl and associated gardening.
   Main conclusions
   Well-adapted native species in a fragile equilibrium with their natural environment are extremely sensitive to human-driven modifications. On the contrary, for more generalist alien species, the availability of limited resources plays a predominant role.

AB  - This article aims to present some particularities of spatial articulation of the Northern Amazon called Amapa, mainly from the dynamics of urbanization in the state of Amapa and structure of its urban network. This dynamic will be dealt with through consideration of the urbanization of the Amazon and the complex condition of its urban network, the process of urbanization concentrated occurred in Amapa, the centrality exerted by urban conurbation Macapa-Santana and characterization of a network composed of small urban cities. As methodological orientation this study had the scale of analysis the notion of territorial proximity networks and search for indirect data obtained from the Brazilian Demographic Census 2010, the study of the Region of Influence of Cities, of bibliographic references on urbanization, cities and urban network in the Amazon, as well as empirical observations made during field work by the main river and road axes of movement and articulation of the urban centers of that portion of the Amazon region.

AB  - Question How is the abundance of exotic plants within urban forest remnants influenced by distance to the edges of forest boundaries and recreational trails? Location Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Methods Gradients in the cover of exotic plants, as well as the richness of exotic and native vascular species, were examined as a function of distance from anthropogenic forest boundaries and recreational trails. Plants were sampled in 2 m x 10 m and 10 m x 10 m plots distributed among 11 urban forest remnants. Randomization tests were used to quantify the distance of edge influence from both forest boundaries and trails, and to determine if there was an interaction between them. Results The cover and richness of exotic plants and richness of native species decreased with increasing distance from forest boundaries and trails. Edge influences extended to distances of ca. 50 and 3 m for forest boundaries and trails, respectively, and were stronger for measures of understorey than of overstorey vegetation. Vegetation was simultaneously influenced by both edge types such that exotic cover and richness were higher when in close proximity to two edges than when subject to either edge alone (i.e. a positive interaction). Conclusions It is important to consider the influence of edges in the design and management of forest remnants to improve the ability to conserve native biodiversity within cities. Results from this study may be used to guide the design of such systems, particularly by suggesting appropriately sized patches and trail densities.

AB  - In the natural world, the transfer of resources between landscape features such as the corridors and patches that make up the mosaic of ecological niches is increased where those boundaries are more complex. This article explores this as an analogue for the relationship between natural landscapes and human communities and the possible link between those landscapes greater human diversity and innovation. Using Canadian case study research this article explores the potential link between landscape and human creativity. The case studies are all examples of human communities with higher than average populations of the creative class and with noted landscapes that have influenced the nature and direction of development. We explore the possibility that there is a link between landscape and creativity, and consider how this may reflect the potential for cultural diversity and thus the sustainable community development.

AB  - This paper makes a contribution to the fledgling literature on policy mobilities and mutations. Using the example of the internationalization of the Business Improvement District (BID) model, it argues that conferences constitute important arenas in and through which both the mobilizing and embedding of urban policies can occur. Focusing on a two-day conference that took place in Sweden in 2009, it uses the language of trans-urban policy pipelines in order to capture the formation of relationships over distance as a means of comparing, educating and learning about the experiences of other cities. Revealing the complex architectures and ecologies that have underpinned the movement of this model from one country to another and from one city to another over the last two decades or so, the paper uses a combination of ethnographic techniques together with semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with organizers and participants to produce a single-site but relationally thickened description of the place of conferences in facilitating the movement of policies across space.

AB  - The need for suitable planning strategies to reduce landscape fragmentation favoring energy and matter fluxes between ecosystems and preserving biodiversity, is a key issue of nature conservation and sustainable development. Human interventions may represent obstacles to such fluxes between ecosystems and they may affect landscape evolution and equilibrium conditions in terms of biodiversity reduction, accelerated erosion phenomena, hydrological instability and flood events that are well recognized consequences of anthropic impact.
   In this work an innovative procedure, called PANDORA, Procedure for mAthernatical aNalysis of lanD-scape evOlution and equilibRium scenarios Assessment, is presented to assess the effects of different planning strategies on final possible equilibrium states that are energetically stable. It provides a tool for the evaluation of landscape functionality and its resilience. PANDORA, linking together thermodynamic concepts, mathematical equilibrium, metabolic theory and landscape metrics, allows to model landscape evolution in time under the impact of external constraints and giving a unique response from it in terms of energy. An application of PANDORA is here proposed as a Decision Support System for choosing among possible urban planning strategies in a Mediterranean watershed of Central Italy.
   PANDORA model, allows to evaluate an analytical solution of landscape time-evolution problem and to study its stability depending on parameters obtained from GIS data, available, usually, by land managers.

AB  - Urban landscapes often expose wildlife populations to enhanced edge effects where the biotic and abiotic attributes of native ecosystems have been significantly altered. While some species may respond favourably to edges, there are likely to be varying negative consequences for many forest-dependent species. In particular, marsupial gliders are influenced by changes in forest composition and structure near edges due to highly specific feeding and nesting requirements, and a high reliance on tree cover to traverse a landscape. We addressed this problem using the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in the fragmented urban landscape of southeast Queensland, Australia. Analysis of variance was applied to determine differences in habitat resources and structure in relation to glider presence and trap success rates in forest fragment interiors compared with road (minor & major) and residential edge habitats. We postulate that an increased presence of squirrel gliders in sites adjacent to minor road and residential edges may be due to the availability of additional resources and/or varying dispersal opportunities. Conversely, forest fragment interiors contain a higher abundance of nest hollows and large trees, together with a greater floristic species richness providing more reliable seasonal foraging sources, which may explain the greater trap success rates of squirrel gliders in these sites. We conclude that while forest fragment interiors provide habitat suitable for year-round use by greater numbers of squirrel gliders, the conservation value of some edge habitats that provide additional resources and dispersal opportunities should not be underestimated for forest-dependent mammals; however, each edge type must be assessed individually.

KW  - Sustainable development

KW  - slow city movement
AB  - The "speed" concept, as being one of the significant phenomena that shaped industrial cities, creates a significant obstacle for sustainability. The speed that was gained with mechanization and industrialization resulted in disintegration in urban environment, disrupted the relation between place and the individual, and caused the rapid transformation of cultural and environmental values that once belonged to the place. At this point, "slowing down" emerges as a significant concept in the quest for sustainability and for regaining the relationship between the urban environment and the individual. This study puts forward Slow Urbanism as an alternative approach in sustainable planning as it forms the antithesis of "speed" and confronts the deformations of global culture shaped by fast consumption. Following a brief discussion of the transformations caused by "speed" in built environments; this study aims to draw attention to new challenges of "Slow Urbanization" model by highlighting its adaptability and flexibility through focusing on three different slow city experiences: Midden-Delfland (The Netherlands), Hersbruck (Germany) and Seferihisar (Turkey). The evaluation of these cases displayed that the adaptability and flexibility of the model makes it unique as it can be implemented in settlements that have different characteristics. The findings also revealed that the model focuses on originality, diversity, heterogeneity, a sense of belonging and appropriation instead of homogeneity, monotony, and uniformity. It replaces the "destroy and construct" philosophy of consumption culture with "re-explore and reconstruct" approach and in this way encourages cities to use and develop their distinctive social, economic and cultural potentials.

AB  - By using microsatellite markers, we investigated the population genetic structure of three mainly clonally propagating bryophyte species-the hepatic Plagiochila asplenioides (L.) Dumort and the mosses Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst-that occupy habitats differing in the level of human disturbance. Sampled populations, located in southern Finland, were classified as natural or disturbed. All species possessed a fair amount of genetic variation both within populations (mean diversities per population of 0: 411 +/- 0: 118, 0: 403 +/- 0: 111, and 0: 307 +/- 0: 077, respectively) and across populations (0.599, 0.618, and 0.400, respectively). On average, natural and disturbed populations possessed similar levels of genetic diversity. Differentiation levels (F-ST values of 0.356, 0.298, and 0.302, respectively) were significant but showed that there is some gene flow taking place. The Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis provided additional information on the population genetic structures. Although R. squarrosus was the species with the lowest level of genetic variation, its populations inhabiting urban, disturbed habitats tended to contain highly differentiated genotypes of different origins, which suggests that human-mediated dispersal is important in urban habitats. In addition, detailed analyses of the spatial genetic structure of R. squarrosus showed that at short distances (1 to <30 m) individuals are more closely related than expected, while at greater distances (30 to 500 m) kinship decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the rarity of sexual reproduction was visible in the spatial genetic structure within R. squarrosus populations, as aggregations of similar genotypes were found at short distances in populations otherwise showing isolation-by-distance effect.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation can act to cause reproductive isolation between conspecifics and undermine species' persistence, though most studies have reported the genetic condition of populations that have already declined to a very small size. We examined genetic diversity within the vulnerable, declining koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population in Southeast Queensland, Australia to determine the genetic impact of ongoing threatening processes. Five hundred and twelve koalas from ten Southeast Queensland Local Government Areas on the mainland and one island were genotyped at six polymorphic microsatellite loci. Based on Bayesian cluster analysis incorporating spatial data, the regional koala population was subdivided into six clusters, with location of major roads and rivers appearing to be consistent with being barriers to gene flow. The distribution of mtDNA control region haplotypes identified distinct coastal and inland clades suggesting that historically there was gene flow between koalas along the coast (though little interchange between coastal and inland animals). In contrast, koalas from the Koala Coast (Brisbane City, Logan City and Redland Shire) were shown by microsatellite analysis to be genetically distinct from adjacent areas. It is likely, therefore, that more recent reductions in population size and restricted gene flow through urbanisation have contributed to the genetic differentiation of koalas in the Koala Coast region.

AB  - In this paper we illustrate the distinctive settlement patterns of the city of Chunchucmil during its largest occupation in the middle of the Classic period (A.D. 400-650). The unusually dense urban settlement showcased a network of boundary walls and chichbes surrounding residential groups and narrow streets winding between the tightly bounded houselots. Using a sample of 392 completely and unambiguously bounded houselots, we review the basic characteristics, the structural composition, and variability of late Early Classic and early Late Classic residential groups. Then, we explore how these city dwellers may have experienced their urban environment. Our focus is on understanding how the material aspects of the socially constructed space affected people's practices and how this materiality helped create and define specific household identities as well as extra-household social bonds.

AB  - Dundee has a small black and minority ethnic (BME) population, which has been neglected by previous research, as have BME populations in small towns and cities generally. As in other British cities, the residential locations of the main BME groups are distinct from that of the white population. After briefly reviewing the history of settlement in Dundee, this paper examines the extent to which patterns of ethnic segregation have changed between 1991 and 2001. Some moves towards dispersal and suburbanisation are identified but there are important contrasts between different BME groups. The implications of segregation for housing availability are assessed through Census of Population data. The hypothesis is posed that the consequences of segregation for housing disadvantage are greater in small cities such as Dundee.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - Urban ecosystems represent unique habitats that might be more or less suitable than natural systems for many species. The Mediterranean Gecko, Hemidactylus turcicus is a synanthropic species that has successfully colonized many urban and suburban areas outside its natural range. In the United States, H. turcicus has been found predominantly in southern states on exterior surfaces of buildings. We compared population density, demographics, and extent of dispersal of populations of H. turcicus at two anthropogenic sites in a temperate region of the United States. The University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) had higher building density and greater cover by anthropogenic surfaces and the Oklahoma City Zoo (ZOO) had lower building density and greater cover by vegetation. Mark and recapture sampling was conducted at UCO from 2006 to 2007 and during 2008 at ZOO. The sizes of the populations at the two sites were estimated using the Schnabel method and population densities were calculated using those estimates. Age class of captured animals, sex of adults, and gravid status of adult females were determined at both sites. We assumed that greater exterior wall surface area of individual buildings at UCO and greater land cover by anthropogenic surfaces might 1) reduce population density and 2) facilitate dispersal there relative to the ZOO. Population sizes and density in animals per ha of land and building cover and demographics were similar at the two sites. Population density per ha of building exterior wall area was higher at ZOO than at UCO. The higher density of animals on buildings, lower proportion of subadults in the population and lower maximum dispersal distance at ZOO suggest that successful diffusion dispersal might be limited at that site relative to UCO.

AB  - Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) theory predicts the number of animals choosing habitats of differing quality. Most experimental tests of the IFD have been conducted at small spatial scales (i.e. smaller than maximum daily movement of animals) by comparing the number of animals foraging at adjacent food patches of different quality. Urban pigeons (Columba livia) feed in large, open aggregations, and can distribute according to predictions of the IFD at alternative food patches. In this study, we test IFD predictions over a much larger spatial scale by comparing the abundance of urban feral pigeons at four sites spread over the city centre of MontrEal, QuEbec, Canada, to the amount of anthropogenically provided food in each site. We found that the pigeons' distribution among the four sites qualitatively matched that of resources available at these sites. After controlling for the effect of stochastic variation in food resources, two pair-wise comparisons between sites indicated undermatching, one indicated matching and three indicated overmatching of consumers to resources. These results suggest that the pigeons inhabiting the downtown area of MontrEal may behave as a single population that distributes qualitatively among foraging sites in proportion to the quantity of food offered, and that deviations from expectations cannot be attributed simply to stochastic variation in the food levels at the sites.

AB  - Since 2000, the UK Home Office has implemented a policy of dispersal whereby asylum seekers are housed on a no choice basis in locations around the country. Although the aim of dispersal is to determine local and national movements of asylum seekers, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role played by dispersal in onward migration flows. Indeed, the majority of literature on UK dispersal has focused upon critiquing the policy for being driven by void housing and concentrating vulnerable populations in deprived, inner city neighbourhoods. Dislocated from existing social networks, asylum seekers have experienced prejudice, racial harassment and isolation. The aim of this article is to sketch out the current state of knowledge on onward migration in the context of UK dispersal policy. Based upon quantitative data analysis and case study material, the complexity of onward migration flows is examined. This includes identifying the geography of onward migration flows as well as the diversity of individuals engaged in movement around the UK, both during the asylum process and after being granted or refused refugee status. Along with relevant literature on past dispersal schemes in the UK, quantitative data is employed to highlight gaps in knowledge as well as discussing ways forward for future data collection and analysis.

AB  - River corridors, even if highly modified or degraded, still provide important habitats for numerous biological species, and carry high aesthetic and economic values. One of the keys to urban stream restoration is recovery and maintenance of ecological flows sufficient to sustain aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the Hongje Stream in the Seoul metropolitan area of Korea was selected for evaluating a physically-based habitat with and without habitat structures. The potential value of the aquatic habitat was evaluated by a weighted usable area (WUA) using River2D, a two-dimensional hydraulic model. The habitat suitability for Zacco platypus in the Hongje Stream was simulated with and without habitat structures. The computed WUA values for the boulder, spur dike, and riffle increased by about 2%, 7%, and 131%, respectively, after their construction. Also, the three habitat structures, especially the riffle, can contribute to increasing hydraulic heterogeneity and enhancing habitat diversity.

AB  - Urbanization is a significant cause of change in the urban landscape. Landscape analysis and remote sensing provide effective means for researching the process of urbanization, but the problems of scale and accuracy in landscape studies are yet to be resolved. In particular, the impacts of sensor spatial resolutions and classification themes on the urban landscape with changing scale size have rarely been reported. Roads are an important land-use type in urban areas. Unfortunately, this is also one of the land-use types that are relatively easy to neglect because of sensor resolutions and classification themes. To better understand the characteristics of the urban landscape, the landscape pattern of Shanghai was analyzed using land-use maps produced from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian Remote Sensing satellite PAN (IRS-PAN) images with changing grain size (i.e., resolution) and extent size (i.e., size of study area). Landscape metrics were computed along a 51 km(2) transect cutting across Shanghai with a moving window. The results showed that both sensor spatial resolutions and classification themes provide incomplete information, such as missing linearity corridors, from urban landscape analysis. This could greatly affect urban landscape analysis and planning. The missing information may be detected by changing both the grain and extent sizes in the analysis parameters. However, varying the sensor resolutions did not produce the same effects as varying the classification themes. Varying the classification themes led to within-class variance, and thus was more significant in fine-resolution imagery than in coarse-resolution imagery. Linearity corridors such as urban roads should be identified and classified in research focusing on the details of urban fragmentation, urban ecologies related to road corridors, and urbanization issues.

AB  - Internal migration is responsible for the changing geography of Britain's ethnic group populations. Although this changing geography is at the centre of heated debates of social policy, relatively little is known about the internal migration behaviour of different ethnic groups. This paper reviews existing evidence and analyses 1991 and 2001 Census data to provide an overview of patterns and trends in the geographies of migration for each ethnic group. It finds that counter-urbanisation is common to all ethnic groups except Chinese. Both White and minority groups have on balance moved from the most non-White areas in similar proportions, with some exceptions including White movement into the most concentrated Black areas, and Chinese movement towards its own urban concentrations. 'White flight' is not an appropriate term to describe White movement, nor to explain the growth of ethnically diverse urban areas. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim As accurate and up-to-date distribution data for plant species are rarely available, cumulative records over long periods of time are frequently used for mapping distributions, without taking into account that species do not persist in their historical localities forever. However, persistence is highly relevant in changing modern landscapes, especially for invasive species that dynamically spread in unstable human-made habitats. We studied how an invasive species, Heracleum mantegazzianum, persists at sites once colonized and how its ability to persist affects its distribution. Location The Czech Republic. Methods We visited 521 localities of H. mantegazzianum occurrence reported in the literature and herbaria to determine whether the species still occurs at these sites. By using G-tests and classification trees, we explored the roles of various factors affecting its persistence at a site. Results Of the total number of 521 historical sites at which the species has occurred since the end of the 19th century, it persists at only 124 (23.8%). The persistence rate differs with respect to habitat type and is highest in meadows and forest margins. Analysis using classification trees indicated that the factors that best explain persistence are: type of habitat (with meadow and forest margins over-represented); urbanity (with a higher persistence outside urban areas); proximity to the place of the species introduction into the country; metapopulation connectivity; and distance to the nearest neighbouring population. Main conclusions The use of cumulative historical records as a measure of species distribution, which is common in invasion literature, can seriously overestimate the actual distribution of alien plant species with low persistence. In the case of alien species such as H. mantegazzanium, which is non-clonal and reproduces only by seed, estimates of distribution and spread based on historical data are informative about potentially suitable habitat but may be unreliable as indicators of current occurrence and invasion dynamics.

AB  - Urbanization is a pervasive and growing threat to amphibian populations globally. Although the number of studies is increasing, many aspects of basic amphibian biology have not been investigated in urban settings. We reviewed 32 urban studies from North America and quantified the number of species studied and their response to urbanization. We examined existing research on breeding habitats, life-history stages, movement patterns, and habitat use relative to urbanization. We found amphibians as a whole respond negatively to urbanization (69 reported responses were negative, 6 were positive and 35 showed no effect). We caution, however, that many North American species still lack or are associated with conflicting information regarding species-specific responses (e.g., 89 potential responses were unknown). Approximately 40% of all anuran and 14% of caudate species in North America were investigated in the literature; however, the most diverse genera (e.g., Plethodon and Eurycea) were the most understudied likely due to their cryptic terrestrial lifestyles and biases in sampling protocols that assess wetland habitats via call surveys. Research on movement and small scale habitat use was deficient. Adult, juvenile, tadpole, and egg mass life-history stages commonly served as direct measures of species presence and abundance; however, such data do not accurately reflect recruitment into subsequent age classes and population persistence. The lack of data on many North American species may be contributing to poor management of urban amphibian populations and their habitats.

AB  - Inland pine barrens offer the rarest type of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States and may contribute disproportionately to the regional diversity and conservation of shrubland birds. Testing local habitat specialization and estimating survey effort is needed to inform management of pine barrens for this rapidly declining avian group. We evaluated shrubland bird habitat associations in a heavily urbanized pine barrens of the northeastern United States, and used occupancy-detection sampling and analysis to estimate the number of sample points and surveys for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens. Although forest area was significantly greater than shrubland area, 8 of 11 reliably modeled species showed evidence of association for shrubland, and are thus potentially useful as indicators of pine barrens shrubland quality and management to avert succession. From the analysis of survey effort. we suggest two design options for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens: (1) include enough points to cover at least similar to 3% of the study area and survey each point >= 5 times preferably during 05:00-08:00 hr. or (2) reduce the point sample, to no less than about 2% of study area, and increase the survey replication to >= 10 surveys. Three surveys, as suggested by shrubland bird experts for anthropogenic early-successional habitats (e.g., utility corridors) and by others as a general rule, may require too many sample points to feasibly monitor shrubland birds in pine barrens.

AB  - Disturbance resulting from urbanization is a leading cause of biotic homogenization worldwide. Native species are replaced with widespread non-native species and ants are among the world's most notorious invaders. To date, all documented cases of ant invasions involve exotic introduced species that are spread around the world by human-mediated dispersal. I investigated the effect of urbanization on the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant species, the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say). Colony social structure, life history traits, and the spatial pattern of nest distribution were compared by sampling T. sessile across a gradient of three distinct habitats: natural, semi-natural, and urban. Results demonstrate a remarkable transition in colony social and spatial structure and life history traits between natural and urban environments. In natural habitats, T. sessile colonies are comprised of small, monogyne (single queen), and monodomous (single nest) colonies. In urban areas, T. sessile often exhibit extreme polygyny and polydomy, form large supercolonies, and become a dominant pest. Results also suggest that urban T. sessile colonies may have a negative impact on native ant abundance and diversity. In the natural environment T. sessile coexisted with a wide array of other ant species, while very few ant species were present in the urban environment invaded by T. sessile. Habitat degradation and urbanization can lead to extreme changes in social and spatial colony structure and life history traits in a native ant species and can promote the evolution of invasive characteristics such as polygyny, polydomy, and supercolonial colony structure.

AB  - P>1. Current views of anthropogenic environments emphasize the extreme novelty of urban and industrial ecosystems. Proponents of reconciliation ecology argue that we need to use such habitats to conserve biodiversity, given the inadequacy of natural reserve systems.
   2. Some of the harshest anthropogenic ecosystems may be able to support indigenous biodiversity due to their structural or functional resemblance to natural ecosystems, habitats, or microsites that may be present in the region but not part of the historic ecosystem on a particular site. Here we review recent work that evaluates similarities between urban and industrial ecosystems and natural analogues, and explore the potential for these in reconciliation ecology.
   3. We find that artificial habitats represent a gradient of ecological novelty which may be independent of the degree of human influence. While hard-surfaced habitats such as walls and quarries are the most investigated artificial analogues (of natural rock pavements and cliffs), there are many other examples spanning a range of habitats in both terrestrial and marine settings. Analogous ecosystems may be present in the region but limits to dispersal can prevent appropriate species from reaching urban or industrial sites, and small differences in abiotic conditions can sometimes prevent colonization by native biota in otherwise similar artificial habitats. We suggest that a search for habitat analogues represents an important principle to guide reconciliation ecology in urban and industrial lands. In constrast, analogous ecosystems may also support pest species that exploit the similarities between anthropogenic habitats and their ancestral habitats.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Identifying analogous habitats and ecosystems could enhance biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services in anthropogenic environments. Abiotic and biotic differences between artificial analogues and natural systems can be frequently overcome by ecological engineering to make the environment more suitable for native biodiversity, and/or assisted dispersal to allow suitable native organisms to reach appropriate sites within artificial ecosystems. Altering some habitats to become less analogous may help reduce impacts of pest species in urban and industrial areas.

AB  - The northern mockingbird Mimus polyglottos is a native species that is more abundant in urban than non-urban habitats (i.e. an urban-positive species). Abundance alone, however, is not an accurate index of habitat quality because urban habitats could represent ecological traps (attractive sink habitat) for urban-positive species. We compared mockingbird nesting productivity, apparent survival, and decision rules governing site fidelity in urban and rural habitats. If the higher abundance of mockingbirds in urban habitats is driven by higher quality urban habitat, then we predicted that productivity of urban mockingbirds would exceed the estimated source-sink threshold and productivity of non-urban mockingbirds. If, on the other hand, urban habitats act as ecological traps, productivity would be lower in urban habitats and would fall below the estimated source-sink threshold. Productivity of urban pairs exceeded that of non-urban pairs and more than offset estimated adult mortality, which makes urban habitat a likely source habitat. Apparent adult survival was higher in urban habitats than in non-urban habitats, although this could be driven by dispersal more than mortality. Decision rules also appeared to differ between urban and non-urban populations. Females in urban habitats with successful nests were more likely to return than those with unsuccessful nests, whereas return rates of females in nonurban habitats were unrelated to nesting success and may be more related to nesting habitat availability. We conclude that urban habitats do not act as ecological traps that lure mockingbirds into sink habitat and that increased breeding productivity contributes to their success in urban habitats.

The overall objective of the analysis is to characterise the temporal and spatial pattern of change and to explore its potential ecological impact. We used three original land cover layers and a set of landscape metrics to describe variations in composition and pattern of land cover types. We then built change trajectories for patches derived from the spatial intersection of land cover data. These trajectories were ecologically assessed using expert judgement and indicators of naturalness such as deviation from potential natural vegetation. The results revealed that approximately 62% of the study area maintained the same land cover type from 1954 to 2001 as a result of composition continuity at the patch level. Urbanisation was by far the most important change process and the main cause of fragmentation of agricultural land and loss of coastal habitats, which imply possible negative effects for biodiversity and ecological processes. However, the star-shaped pattern of urbanisation favoured natural vegetation dynamics, marked persistence of woodlands, and significant stability of agricultural land in peripheral areas, with positive effects in terms of ecological connectivity and vegetation recovery potential. Despite the general nature of land cover data, the spatially explicit ecological assessment of transitions provides a reference layer that can effectively address territorial policies towards urban sustainability and that helps stratification for areas requiring direct investigation of impacts.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel approach in order to simulate the impacts of urban goods transport on road occupancy. It combines both inter-establishments flows and households' motorized shopping trips, as well as B2C flows. After a general description of the method resulting in an estimation of the movements, an actual example is implemented (city of Lyon, in France). Four scenarios are described and simulated, and then their results are compared. These results are promising and they take into account a large variety of flows (about 90% of the urban goods movement flows according to the classification of Patier, 2002). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Riparian zones are important for the many ecosystem services they supply. In settled areas, the vegetation of such zones is shaped by human land-use; this often creates conditions under which alien plant species thrive. Alien plants have been shown to induce large-scale changes in riparian habitats, and they pose a major threat to the continued provision of key ecosystem services. We used direct gradient analysis to assess correlations between land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian river corridor in the highly transformed landscape surrounding Stellenbosch in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Vegetation plots were sampled along the entire length of the river from headwaters to estuary (ca. 40 km). Plant community composition was analyzed in relation to land-use data collected in the field, and additional land-use variables computed from digital land-cover data. Patterns of plant community structure were found to be directly related to land-use, with measures of cover, richness, and diversity differing significantly among land-use types. Portions of the riparian zone adjacent to agricultural land had the greatest level of alien plant cover, while areas bordered by urban land maintained the highest alien species richness. Areas adjacent to grazing and natural lands showed intermediate and low levels of invasion, respectively. Several native species were found to persist in areas with high abundance and diversity of invasive alien plants, suggesting that they will be valuable focal species for future restoration attempts. Due to the level of human-mediated change in many areas of the riparian zone, restoration to historic conditions over most of the river is not considered feasible. These areas should be recognized as examples of novel ecosystems, and management efforts should focus on restoring or creating desirable ecosystem functions, rather than on achieving assemblages comprising only native species.

AB  - We study whether butterfly diet predicts butterfly distribution along an urban gradient. Data come from a large scale participatory scheme involving the general public reporting butterfly abundance in their gardens (more than 6000 gardens), completed by a special survey on the relationship between butterfly species and flower species based on amateur pictures (more than 3500 pictures). Many studies show that urbanization promotes the loss of native plant species and their replacement by non-native species, so in this context we addressed the question of butterfly diet impacts provided by exotic and native plants in urban landscapes and we quantified diet diversity to identify specialist and generalist butterflies. Diet specialists had a longer proboscis and both specialization and proboscis length were positively correlated to preferences for exotic flowers. Nevertheless, diet specialist butterflies tended to avoid urban areas more strongly than diet generalists, while preference for exotic flowers was surprisingly not correlated to preferences for urban life in butterflies. All together this suggests that diet preferences do not play a strong part in determining butterfly distribution along urban gradients but also that diet specialization must be correlated to other life history traits such as dispersal ability or flexibility in habitat selection.

AB  - Introduction: Dengue viruses transmitted principally by the urban mosquito Aedes aegypti, cause one of the major public health problems confronting tropical cities. Insecticide spraying has been the mainstay of mosquito control; however, its continuous use has selected for resistance. Other important methods of control involve community participation.
   Objective: This study evaluated two control methods for Ae. aegypti that can be used by the community: Lethal ovitraps (LOs) and Bacillus thuringiensis var israeliensis (Bti) briquettes.
   Materials and methods: The project study was carried out in four similar neighborhoods within a representative district in the city of Cali, Colombia. Three interventions (LO, Bti, LO+Bti plus education and one control (education only) area were evaluated for efficacy in post-intervention entomological surveys. Additionally, entomological indices were also compared to results from a pre-intervention survey carried out on a sample of city blocks in the same neighborhoods. Relative vector abundance in relation to weather conditions using the same entomological sampling methods was compared.
   Results: The interventions did not achieve significant differences in vector abundance among the treatments. However, the interventions achieved a significant reduction in entomological indices compared with those observed during the pre-intervention survey: House index 15.1% vs. 8.5%, mean pupae per house 1.15 vs. 0.073, and Adult index 56.3% vs. 34.8% (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: The lack of significant differences among the interventions, and between treated and control blocks suggested that educational activities together with periodic visits to the houses produced similar reductions of immature and adult Aedes aegypti.

AB  - We used the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique to decipher the genetic structure of the Bank Myna (Acridotheres ginginisnus) in Pakistan. The samples were collected from four cities namely: Dera Ghazi Khan, Jahanian, Khanewal and Gujranwala. The analysis showed a high genetic diversity at species level (H = 0.318, S = 0.467) but low levels at population levels (H = 0.047, S = 0.069 to H = 0.195, S = 0.283). The four populations analyzed were genetically distant from each other and hinted the effect of urbanization role in isolating the urban dwelling species. The genetic distances between populations ranged from D = 0.2403 to D = 0.3419 and the similarity coefficient showed low range from 0.66 to 0.70. This study will help in future conservation plans and also help the understanding of the role of urbanization on fragmentation of species' natural distribution and dispersal mechanism.

AB  - Reptiles have an amazing diversity of life-history attributes ranging from the shortest- to longest-lived of vertebrate species. Estimating survival in wild populations is of key importance when understanding population dynamics and life-history evolution. However, data are lacking for a large and charismatic group of lizards, the chameleons. We conducted a Robust Design (RD) capture-mark-recapture (CMR) experiment on the Cape dwarf chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, at two nested sites within the Cape Town Metropolitan Area, South Africa, in order to estimate survival and movement of adults in and around an isolated 3.5 ha patch of suitable habitat. Over a nine-week period, 97 individuals were identified in 379 captures from five primary capture sessions with three secondary events each. Analysis of CMR data provided evidence that smaller chameleons have a substantially lower survival per 10-day period than larger chameleons. RD analysis showed that males were more prone to temporary emigration than females, while open multi-strata analysis revealed that smaller chameleons more readily moved between the sites than larger chameleons. Our findings offer first important insights into chameleon survival and life-history dynamics, which suggest a more vagile subadult population and the possibility of male biased dispersal. Our results have implications for managing the conservation of threatened chameleon populations in highly fragmented urban habitats.

AB  - Given that urban landscapes often act as a point of entry for many non-native species and urban development continues to increase as the human population rapidly expands, an understanding of the interaction between urbanization and non-native plant species is important both in the control of potentially invasive species and in the conservation of native biodiversity. We investigated the spatial and temporal relationship between urban land cover and the distribution of non-native species in Britain using two floristic data sets collected at two different time periods: 1987-88 and 2003-04.
   UK.
   Using floristic data collected by the Botanical Society of the British Isles in 1987-88 (Monitoring Scheme) and 2003-04 (Local Change) in conjunction with habitat data obtained from the Land Cover Map of the UK, we conducted multiple regression analyses both within and between years on both groups of species (natives, neophytes and archaeophytes) and individual species.
   Neophytes (alien species introduced after 1500) were very strongly associated with urban land cover in both time periods and do not appear to be spreading out of urban habitats into the wider countryside. Archaeophytes (alien species introduced before 1500), however, showed a strong association with urban habitats in the earlier 1988 data set but no longer showed this association in the 2004 data set. Analysis at the individual species level showed that a large percentage of alien plant species, particularly archaeophytes, were not strongly associated with urban land cover or were negatively associated with such habitats.
   Our results suggest that there has been a reduction in the urban association of archaeophytes that is likely to have resulted from the recovery of archaeophytes associated with non-urban (especially arable) habitats, following their decline in mid-20th century, rather than from the movement of aliens into the wider countryside from urban habitats.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial for biodiversity conservation because they provide safe havens for species threatened by land-use change and resulting habitat loss. However, protected areas are only effective when they stop habitat loss within their boundaries, and are connected via corridors to other wild areas. The effectiveness of protected areas is threatened by development; however, the extent of this threat is unknown. We compiled spatially-detailed housing growth data from 1940 to 2030, and quantified growth for each wilderness area, national park, and national forest in the conterminous United States. Our findings show that housing development in the United States may severely limit the ability of protected areas to function as a modern "Noah's Ark." Between 1940 and 2000, 28 million housing units were built within 50 km of protected areas, and 940,000 were built within national forests. Housing growth rates during the 1990s within 1 km of protected areas (20% per decade) outpaced the national average (13%). If long-term trends continue, another 17 million housing units will be built within 50 km of protected areas by 2030 (1 million within 1 km), greatly diminishing their conservation value. US protected areas are increasingly isolated, housing development in their surroundings is decreasing their effective size, and national forests are even threatened by habitat loss within their administrative boundaries. Protected areas in the United States are thus threatened similarly to those in developing countries. However, housing growth poses the main threat to protected areas in the United States whereas deforestation is the main threat in developing countries.

AB  - Many species are threatened by global climate change, but plants are particularly vulnerable because, as sessile organisms, they are unable to move to areas with more suitable conditions as the climate changes. Instead they must rely on their seeds dispersing far and often to keep pace with a changing climate. This problem is exacerbated by the fragmentation of natural landscapes by clearing for agricultural or urban development, or similarly by a species requirement for particular soil types or topography.
   Models can help predict how different species will be affected by climate change. Most previous modelling work on predicting the persistence of plant and other species under climate change has been static, regression style modelling, known as climate envelope modelling. This has focussed on predicting where suitable environments for a species will likely occur under possible future climatic conditions, based on the species' distribution under current conditions. While the existence of suitable environments in a new climate is a necessary condition for a species' persistence, for sessile organisms such as plants, the ability of a species to move and colonise these suitable environments is also likely to be a major limitation. There is therefore a need for models that account for the dynamic processes involved in plant species' migration and colonisation in changing climates.
   This paper presents such a dynamic model, called PPunCC (Plant Persistence under Climate Change). We describe how the PPunCC model represents the important factors and processes likely to affect a plant species' capacity to migrate across a landscape fast enough to keep pace with a changing climate, such as the rate of climate change, the degree of landscape fragmentation, and the plant species' life history, seed production, dispersal, and establishment. We also discuss how the model could be used to inform management decisions regarding adaptation options such as assisted migration or the creation of large-scale corridors that increase the connectivity of fragmented landscapes in order to help species migrate naturally and find suitable environments in new climates.

AB  - The social, environmental, and economic benefits of urban trees can mitigate many negative aspects of the built environment. As such, disparities in the benefits of tree cover as a result of class or racial segregation represent an environmental injustice. Quantifying the ecosystem services of urban tree cover is increasingly being used to advocate urban greening and sustainability programs. Although some cities have instituted programs promoting tree planting on public property, these programs most often take place in the context of promoting sustainability rather than addressing structural inequities in the built environment. Using field and U.S. Census data, computer modeling, and online resources, this study analyzed variables such as urban forest cover, diversity of trees, and tree condition among White, African American, and Hispanic areas in Miami-Dade County. We then use these results to quantify two key ecosystem services from urban trees and discuss how their provision can be inequitable. This might be due to a failure to first address structural inequities that have been recognized by the environmental justice movement.

AB  - The alteration of landscapes by human activities worldwide has forced many animal species to persist in remnants of natural habitats. One of the best examples of this process occurs in central-east Argentina, where the original prairies were almost completely replaced by agricultural land, cattle production areas and increasing urbanization. We used nine microsatellite loci to analyze the population genetic structure of the Sigmodontine rodent Calomys musculinus in two anthropically altered habitats: an agroecosystem and a city. Rodents inhabiting urban vacant lots showed higher levels of relatedness and genetic differentiation than rodents inhabiting the agroecosystem. Urban rodents presented a pattern of isolation by distance: in the rural habitat this pattern was present only along the border of a secondary road, but not over the entire area surveyed. In the city, a spatially limited but buffered environment, populations would be small, demographically stable, and dispersal would be restricted. On the contrary, in agroecosystems populations would experience a high rate of turn over: local demes would originate each year by a mixture of overwintering individuals, and dispersal would occur preferentially along the weedy borders of fields.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the protection of Representative Landscape Ecosystem of Slovakia (RLES) on national, European, and global level. RLES (landscape types) are classified as homogeneous units considering landscape character, functions and current land-use. Each landscape type represents unique combination of land-use in different abiotic conditions and provides the unique environment for nature development. Therefore protection of the landscape is understood as maintenance of each landscape type. National level of nature protection in Slovakia is reflected in designated areas of 2(nd) - 5(th) degree of protection. Total area of protected areas is 11 438 km(2), which represents 23,29 % of Slovakia. Protection status prevails mostly at extensively used mountainous and alpine landscape types, poor protection is declared in lowland agriculture landscape types. European protection status in Slovakia is recognised by designation of NATURA 2000 network. The network consists of the Special Protection Areas (11 895 km(2); 24,26 % of Slovakia) and the Sites of Community importance (5 712 km(2); 11,65 %). The Natura 2000 protection sites are distributed more equally across the landscape types, though majority of them are extensively used mountain areas too. Besides, 4 biosphere reserves of the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme were declared in Slovakia (2473 km(2); 5,04 %) and also 14 Ramsar wetland sites (385 km(2), 0,78 %). Globally, the most valuable landscape types of Slovakia in the context of nature protection are considered subalpine and alpine landscapes on giant highlands relief, and the landcover types on karst plateaus. The basic principle of modern nature protection aims at preserving a maximal possible diversity of the living systems, upon assumption to preserve the maximum possible diversity of the conditions of their life. Considering that point of view and results of our research, improvement must be focused on the protection of landscape types of minimal or zero ratio of protection. Our assessment shows that these are mostly urban landscapes, less protected vineyard landscape types, partly agricultural-forest landscape types, and some mixed and coniferous landscape types.

AB  - Dispersal limitations contribute to shaping plant distribution patterns and thus are significant for biodiversity conservation and urban ecology. In fleshy-fruited plants, for example, any preference of frugivorous birds affects dispersal capacities of certain fruit species. We conducted a removal experiment with fruits of Hex aquifolium, a species that is currently expanding its range margin in northern Europe in response to climate change. The species is also a popular ornamental tree and naturalization has been observed in many parts of its range. Fruits of native I. aquifolium and of three cultivars were offered to birds at the expanding range margin in urban habitats in eastern Denmark. The four fruit types were removed at different rates and red fruits were preferred over a yellow cultivar. Small fruit diameter was positively related to fruit removal, and removal was faster under tree canopies compared with open habitats. The preference for red cultivars compared with native aquifolium may contribute to naturalization and potential invasion of garden escapes. Preferential foraging under closed canopies indicates trees and shrubs as recruitment foci for fleshy-fruited plants in urban landscapes. The results should be included in urban forestry and planting of potentially invasive ornamental species. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation as a result of urbanisation is a growing problem for native lizard species. The Eastern Water Dragon (Physignathus lesueurii) is a social arboreal agamid lizard, native to Australia. This species represents an ideal model species to investigate the effect of urbanisation because of their prominent abundance in the urban landscape. Here we describe the isolation and characterisation of a novel set of 74 di-, tri-, and tetra-microsatellites from which 18 were selected and optimised into two multiplexes. The 18 microsatellites generated a total 148 alleles across the two populations. The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 18 alleles and measures of Ho and He varied from 0.395 to 0.877 and from 0.441 to 0.880, respectively. We also present primers for four novel mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. The combined length of the four mtDNA marker pairs was 2,528 bp which included 15 nucleotides changes. In comparison to threatened species, which are generally characterised by small population sizes, the Eastern Water Dragon represents an ideal model species to investigate the effect of urbanisation on their behavioural ecology and connectivity patterns among populations.

AB  - This project presents a simulation tool to evaluate procedurally generated 3D city models with a set of agents representing pedestrians, the environment and urban street actors towards greenhouse gas emission from transportation. This empiric tool for architects and urban planners analyses, predicts and quantifies traffic fluctuations over time, and define the number of pedestrians, individual traffic and public transport in each area and street of a city. Examples show that the allocation of functions within a city contributes to the appearance of traffic congestion and therefore emissions. This tool simulates the decisions and returns information about the path occupants take and their individual experiences such as stress, effort and deviations. This allows planners to evaluate their design before implementation in an empirical way. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In urban areas, wetland habitats consist of small isolated remnants, embedded in an inhospitable human-used matrix, and incurring strong anthropogenic pressures (e.g., artificialization, pollution, eutrophication, and exotic species invasions). These can lead to detrimental genetic and demographic consequences for the populations, even for common species. This study investigated genetic variation and structure for 12 allozyme loci and reproductive fitness in populations of Lychnis (Caryophyllaceae), an insect-pollinated perennial herb occurring in wetland fragments and along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium), in relation to population size. No effect of population size on genetic variation and usually low between-population genetic differentiation were found for urban populations of L. flos-cuculi. A significant pattern of isolation by distance indicated that beyond a certain distance, especially along the Woluwe, populations might still exchange genes. Floral display and fruit set increased with population size, but this relationship did not seem to be predominant. Significant differences found among populations suggest that other factors (e.g., plant density, neighbour competition and habitat quality) may have a stronger impact on reproductive fitness. Some of the small populations may also be still connected through pollen flow, increasing reproductive success and preventing inbreeding depression. The present findings suggest that populations of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban zone are not prone to the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation, as we may have expected, despite the relative small size of the populations. These genetically diverse and productive populations can still be considered of conservation value, including the small ones, which within a certain spatial distance might be regarded as important connecting components of pollen-exchanging network of populations, buffering populations against the negative effects of small population size. The conservation of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban zone should favour the preservation of connected populations rather than only preserving isolated wetlands.

AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems are among the highest in species richness and endemism globally and are also among the most sensitive to climate and land-use change. Fire is an important driver of ecosystem processes in these systems; however, fire regimes have been substantially changed by human activities. Climate change is predicted to further alter fire regimes and species distributions, leading to habitat loss and threatening biodiversity. It is currently unknown what the population-level effects of these landscape-level changes will be. We linked a spatially explicit stochastic population model to dynamic bioclimate envelopes to investigate the effects of climate change, habitat loss and fragm entation and altered fire regime on population abundances of a long-lived obligate seeding shrub, Ceanothus verrucosus, a rare endemic species of southern California. We tested a range of fire return intervals under the present and two future climate scenarios. We also assessed the impact of potential anthropogenic land-use change by excluding land identified as developable by local governments. We found that the 35-50 year fire return interval resulted in the highest population abundances. Expected minimum population abundance (EMA) declined gradually as fire return interval increased, but declined dramatically for shorter fire intervals. Simulated future development resulted in a 33% decline in EMA, but relatively stable population trajectories over the time frame modeled. Relative changes in EMA for alternative fire intervals were similar for all climate and habitat loss scenarios, except under the more severe climate scenario which resulted in a change in the relative ranking of the fire scenarios. Our results show climate change to be the most serious threat facing obligate seeding shrubs embedded in urban landscapes, resulting in population decline and increased local extirpation, and that likely interactions with other threats increase risks to these species. Taking account of parameter uncertainty did not alter our conclusions.

AB  - The Wuhan Urban Green Space (UGS) involves large open areas of "river, lake, forest, farmland" with the structure of "Green Belt + Green Wedge + Green Corridor". As a pilot city of the "two-oriented society, study on the management and protection strategy of UGS in Wuhan with the goal of "low carbon" is particularly important. Nowadays the most severe problem of Wuhan UGS is structural damage and environmental pollution in the main built-up area. In this paper, firstly, by the analysis of statistical data and typical case, the conflicts between UGS and urban development are discussed in three aspects: occupied water areas by the urban expansion, UGS restoration in old urban area, and the lag of urban infrastructure construction. Secondly, the excessive development of the city and the neglect of UGS management and protection are concluded as the reason of the conflicts. Finally, a special UGS management and protection planning is suggested to draw up, and by the establishment of a coordination mechanism among the government, the experts, and the citizens to ensure effective implementation of the planning.

AB  - Since Occupy Wall Street's beginnings in September, 2011 on the streets of downtown New York City, play has been key to the success of this protest against corporate destructiveness and irresponsibility. In the initial weeks, Occupiers used play on the occasion of crisis to imagine a future beyond the exploitation of the 99% by the 1%. Having fun while taking responsibility attracted new Occupiers in large numbers and rapidly expanded the Occupy movement to more than 800 cities in the U.S. and worldwide. The author and groups of his friends, using a playful form of activism called Urban Play, improvised movements and roles in their interactions with other Occupiers. Toward the end of 2011, Occupiers became less able to access far from equilibrium states in play, instead turning their attention to how they were perceived in the media. Urban Players continued to imaginatively expand possibility by incorporating what initially threatened their capacity to play. From his experiences of Urban Play at Occupy Wall Street events, the author develops a theory of play as a form of activism. The author suggests that education, psychotherapy, politics, and other soft sciences would benefit from a greater emphasis on the affirmation, rather than the management, of crisis.

AB  - Although urban areas only occupy c. 2.8% of the earth's land surface, urbanization threatens biodiversity as areas of high human population density often coincide with high biodiversity. Therefore, nature conservation should concentrate on both remote areas and densely populated regions. Protecting rare plant species in rural and urban areas can contribute to the protection of biodiversity. We therefore need to understand why species are rare. Studies on causes of rarity often concentrate on either plant traits or extrinsic threats (such as habitat fragmentation or nitrogen enrichment). However, there are only a few studies that combine traits and extrinsic threats, although such analyses might clarify causes of rarity. We assessed how the affinity of vascular plant species to urban land use ('urbanity') interacts with plant traits in determining species frequency.
   Germany, resolution c. 12 km x 11 km.
   Species with a low frequency may be rare because they occur in rare habitats or because of other reasons, although their habitat is frequent. Therefore, we calculated the frequency of species corrected for habitat frequency, i.e. relative species frequency. We explained relative species frequency by the interactions of species traits and species affinity to urban land use using generalized linear models. Simultaneous autoregressive error models controlled for phylogenetic relationships of species.
   Relative species frequency depends on species affinity to urban land use, independent of the different interactions between traits and urbanity used as predictors. The higher the urbanity the higher is species frequency. Urbanity interacts with species preferences towards temperature and soil acidity. Moreover, dispersal, nitrogen preferences and origin explain relative species frequency, amongst others.
   Many rare species, especially those preferring cool or acidic habitats might already have disappeared from urban areas. Analyses that combine species traits and environmental effects can explain the causes of rarity and help to derive better conservation strategies.

AB  - Climate change in California is altering habitat conditions for many species and exacerbating stress from other factors such as alien invasive species, pollution, and habitat fragmentation. However, the current legal and planning framework for species protection does not explicitly take climate change into account. The regulatory framework is primarily reactive, kicking in only after species' health is gravely threatened. Neither federal nor state regulations require forward-looking, climate-sensitive species or ecosystem protection plans. Habitat planning is poorly funded and often piecemeal. In this context, the wrong lands may be protected, with development allowed to occur in areas that would be most beneficial for species conservation in the future. A more forward-looking approach to habitat conservation is needed, one based on a statewide strategy to identify and protect critical habitat areas, including corridors to enable species migration. The approach would also require development of assessment indicators and assistance strategies not dependent on current habitat structure, and a governance structure to implement regular, periodic updates of management plans in relation to agreed-upon performance indicators. Such a strategy should integrate habitat conservation planning with other state and regional plans and objectives, such as for transportation infrastructure, urban development, and mitigation of climate change.

AB  - The utility of habitat models for species conservation relies on the integration of ecological knowledge into the modeling process. However, this practice is often limited by incomplete information on the study species requirements and insufficient efforts to adopt robust inference modeling approaches. We developed occurrence and breeding habitat models for the European brown bear Ursus arctos in the Northern range of the poorly-known Carpathian population, focusing on the evaluation of a restricted set of hypotheses based on prevailing insights on the species constrains. Hypotheses were confronted using a dataset of 3151 bear observations in Poland for the period 1985-2005. Forest availability was the most important limiting factor, whereas anthropic factors (human density and urban areas) separated between suitable and non-suitable forest-rich areas. Forest composition contributed poorly to predict bear occurrence but was important to differentiate between breeding and non-breeding habitats: breeding females required a larger amount of forest cover, lower human influence and the interspersion of grassland/shrubland patches. Model transfer to the western Carpathian population in Slovakia supported the accuracy of habitat predictions and the robustness of the approach. Results highlight the need to control unplanned urban sprawl to preserve the species habitat and the connectivity between the Western and Eastern segments of the Carpathian population. Predicted but unoccupied habitats in other regions also require consideration, particularly some favorable areas of confluence with other large carnivore habitats. We encourage adopting robust hypothesis testing approaches in habitat modeling in order to support better model transferability and conservation planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Major drivers of amphibian declines via urbanization include land-use changes that cause loss, fragmentation, splits, and degradation of habitat. The effects of these changes in habitat conditions on the persistence of populations are expected to differ among species depending on their dispersal habits: species with strong site fidelity would likely be more affected by habitat loss and degradation, whereas species with highly dispersive habits would be more threatened by habitat fragmentation and split (the dispersal-dependent-decline hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution patterns of two paddy-associated frog species (Pelophylax nigromaculatus and Hyla japonica) with different dispersal habits along a rural-urban gradient of the Osaka-Kobe metropolitan area, Japan. Our results partially support the dispersal-dependent-decline hypothesis in that the species with strong site fidelity, i.e., P. nigromaculatus, was threatened by habitat-area (agricultural field) decline and habitat-quality degradation (prevalence of concrete levees) rather than by habitat fragmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first report that suggests paddy-associated amphibian declines via urbanization in the Asian region. However, the second half of the hypothesis, i.e., that the dispersive species (H. japonica) would be more strongly affected by habitat fragmentation via roads and habitat split via declines in surrounding forests was not supported. The lack of support for this portion of the hypothesis may be due to the high adaptability of H. japonica to artificial landscapes. We discuss the value of the dispersal-dependent-decline hypothesis for conservation planning in agricultural lands of urban areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Segara Anakan lagoon, Java, 21 tree species and 5 understorey genera have been identified. Average tree density is 0.80 +/- A 0.99 Ind./mA(2) with 48.71% seedlings and an average basal area of 9.86 +/- A 10.54 cmA(2)/mA(2). Tree density and diversity are high in the eastern part of the lagoon, located near the city of Cilacap. There, the dominant tree species are Aegiceras corniculatum, Nypa fruticans and Rhizophora apiculata, of which the two latter are characteristic for mature forests. By contrast, understorey species and the pioneer species (Avicennia alba, Aegiceras corniculatum and Sonneratia caseolaris) dominate the central lagoon where several rivers discharge. Compared to former studies, seedling density and tree diameter in the central lagoon has declined considerably and tree species dominance has changed. The high sedimentation rates and deforestation are likely to prevent the formation of a mature forest there. Tree communities are more equilibrated in the eastern lagoon which points to a more stable and less disturbed mangrove forest.

AB  - We present a simulation platform to evaluate procedurally generated 3d city models with a set of agents representing urban street actors and pedestrians towards greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. Our aim is to give architects and urban planners an empiric tool to analyze, predict and quantify traffic fluctuations over time, and define the number of occupants, individual traffic and public transport in a city. In this project we show that the allocation of functions within a city is an important factor for the appearance of traffic. The occupant's decisions where they want to go are defined by the allocation of functions - and the distance defines the mode of transportation. We simulate the decision processes and gain information about the path, the mode of transportation, and the emissions they produce, and individual experiences like stress and effort. The autonomous driving cars are equipped with an acceleration based emission model allowing us to evaluate the inpact of jammed streets on the emission of cars.

AB  - Research points to the increasing geographical diversity of gays and lesbians, in contrast to cultural narratives that link gay and lesbian sexualities to urban spaces. Examining the sexual identity constructions of rural gays and lesbians thus provides an opportunity to analyze the connection between cultural and personal levels of narrative identity. Drawing on data from thirty interviews with rural gays and lesbians, I address how this group negotiates cultural narratives about queerness and constructs sexual identities in rural locales. I find that their interpretations of geography make clear distinctions between urban/rural and draw on elements in rural culture. These interpretations provide resources to modify cultural understandings that narrate gay/lesbian identities in rural areas as closeted, hidden, and oppressed.

AB  - The so-called Spanish painting of the 80' meant an interesting color revolution against conceptual art and the last echoes of informality. A new type of painting emerged in which the color, the historicism, and certain private topics caused an interesting mixture between tradition and modernity.
   Within this movement various trends was revealed: abstraction, new figuration, expressionism, and even a new kind of realism. The city and the architecture, as symbols of a new modernity beyond the recent past, are revealed as two inexhaustible sources for the painting of this time. The imagined cities, the painted architectures, the Madrid of "La Movida", the cities of classical mythology, occupied much of the canvases of the eighties.

AB  - The study analyzed the frequency and exposure of extreme precipitations and their implications for assessment and zoning of mass movement processes in the Tampico city, located in the lower river basin Panuco, Mexico. The methodology employs a Geographic Information System for the aggregation of hydrometeorological and geomorphological data, making the analysis of spatio-temporal variations of extreme precipitations, and their implications for assessment and zoning of mass movement processes, necessary for urban planning in Tampico. The results indicate that the distribution of extreme precipitations favors the high aggressiveness climatic, which determines the soil erosion processes and geomorphic hazards such as falls and debris flows in the study area. Also in the coming years is expected to increase the mass movement processes related to environmental factors, for the increased occurrence and intensity of extreme precipitations, and to human factors, for the growth of population and dwellings exposed to areas unstable.

AB  - Question Is illegal garden waste dumping in mixed deciduous forests a source for establishment of non-native plants in deciduous forests? Location Northwestern Switzerland. Methods We quantified the amount of illegally dumped garden waste at 20 sites over 1 yr and compared the soil conditions, species richness and abundance of plants in the ground vegetation at disposal sites with those at 20 control sites in urban deciduous forests. Results We found that illegal garden waste dumping frequently occurs in urban forests. At single sites, 0.112.5 m3 (mean: 2.6 m3) garden waste was dumped per month, resulting in a total annual amount of 2.235.8 m3 (mean: 17.8 m3) waste deposited. Thirty-seven of the 163 plant species recorded were not native to Switzerland. All 37 non-native species were recorded in waste disposal sites, but only three of them in control sites. Thus, garden waste dumping sites harboured a larger number of non-native species than control sites, but the two groups of sites did not differ in number of native species. The species composition also differed between disposal and control sites: larger proportions of species typical of disturbed habitats, more therophytes and species with autochorous seed dispersal were recorded in disposal sites than in control sites. Conclusions We provide evidence that numerous non-native horticultural plant species escape from dumping sites and colonize forests. There is an urgent need to increase awareness of garden owners concerning problems associated with illegal garden waste dumping.

AB  - The dynamics of the Atlantic Rainforest loss and recovery are still not fully understood despite its long history of human occupation. In this study, we investigated changes in an Atlantic Rainforest region due to major biophysical and human proximate causes. First, we modeled land-cover and land-use changes from 1962 to 2000, including deforestation and forest regrowth, and thereby simulated future landscape trajectories to assess their possible effects on the conservation of forest species of the lbiuna Plateau, a region located in Southeastern Brazil within the Atlantic Rainforest biome. We modeled four scenarios (status quo, random, law enforcement, and land-use intensification) and simulated their resulting landscape trajectories for the year 2019 using DINAMICA. The landscape dynamics in the study region were particularly intense. During the first period of 1962-1981, the rate of forest regrowth (3% year(-1)) was greater than the rate of deforestation (2% year(-1)), whereas in the latter period of 1981-2000, increasing urbanization and the spreading of rural establishments resulted in more deforestation (2.9% year(-1)) than regrowth (1% year(-1)). These dynamics imprinted a heterogeneous landscape, leading to the predominance of progressively younger secondary forests with increasingly less capacity of hosting sensitive forest species. The influence of proximate causes on the dynamics of deforestation and forest regrowth showed consistent patterns, such as higher forest regrowth rates near rivers, on steep slopes and far from dirt roads, whereas losses in young secondary vegetation and forest were far from rivers, on gentle slopes and near urban areas. Of the modeled scenarios, only the law enforcement scenario may lead to the recovery of a network of interconnected forest patches, suggesting that simply the enforcement of current forest laws, which prohibit deforestation on unsuitable agricultural areas and along river margins and establish a minimum of 20% of forest remnant per rural property, may effectively favor forest species conservation in the short term (two decades) without the need of any forest restoration effort.

AB  - Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.

AB  - Invasive ants threaten native biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. Although their principal direct impact is usually the displacement of native ants, they may also affect other invertebrates. The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Dolichoderinae), one of the most widespread invasive ant species, has invaded native habitat where it abuts peri-urban development in coastal Victoria in south-eastern Australia. Here we infer impacts of the Argentine ant on native ants and other litter and ground-dwelling invertebrates by comparing their abundance and taxonomic composition in coastal scrub forest either invaded or uninvaded by the Argentine ant. Species composition of native ants at bait stations and extracted from litter differed significantly between Argentine ant-invaded and uninvaded sites and this was consistent across years. Argentine ants had a strong effect on epigeic ants, which were either displaced or reduced in abundance. The native ant Rhytidoponera victoriae (Ponerinae), numerically dominant at uninvaded sites, was completely absent from sites invaded by the Argentine ant. However, small hypogeic ants, including Solenopsis sp. (Myrmicinae) and Heteroponera imbellis (Heteroponerinae), were little affected. Linepithema humile had no detectable effect upon the abundance and richness of other litter invertebrates. However, invertebrate group composition differed significantly between invaded and uninvaded sites, owing to the varied response of several influential groups (e.g. Collembola and Acarina). Floristics, habitat structure and measured environmental factors did not differ significantly between sites either invaded or uninvaded by Argentine ants, supporting the contention that differences in native ant abundance and species composition are related to invasion. Changes in the native ant community wrought by Argentine ant invasion have important implications for invertebrate communities in southern Australia and may affect key processes, including seed dispersal.

AB  - This paper describes an operational protocol for integrating conservation and restoration with land-use planning in islands. Conservation challenges are intensified in insular systems due to higher ecosystem vulnerability, limited spatial options, low data availability, rapid land-use change and, globally, short-term vision planning. Our operational planning protocol integrates ecological and socio-economic factors to identify the best spatial options for conserving and restoring biodiversity, inside and outside extant reserves, while minimising future land-use conflicts. Conservation and restoration targets are formulated for species, habitats and ecological processes that support biodiversity. An optimal network of priority sites is selected to achieve those targets across the landscape. The prioritisation process integrates a Conservation Costs Index to optimise conservation and restoration investments. We discuss the outcomes of the planning protocol in terms of site prioritisation, stakeholders' participation and general implications for spatial planning in insular systems. As with many islands, the study area of Reunion Island has experienced rapid urban and agricultural expansion, which threatens its unique biodiversity. Forty three per cent of the island is currently protected in a National Park but only half of this reserve network contributes to the achievement of targets. An additional 21% of land should be conserved mainly to ensure the persistence of ecological connections between the marine, terrestrial and freshwater realms. Finally we emphasize that our method doesn't substitute the land-use planning debate but is aimed to better prepare the conservation sector for negotiating future land-use allocation with other socio-economic sectors in islands.

AB  - Airborne freshwater and marine microeukaryotes in the city of Thessaloniki, situated in Thermaikos Bay, Greece, were examined as sources of colonization of experimental water containers during the period autumn 2007 to spring 2008. The microeukaryote composition of the plankton in the nearby aquatic systems (distance < 1 km) was also examined. Airborne microeukaryotes were examined by morphology and 18S rRNA gene diversity. A total of 29 species of airborne microeukaryotes were identified, most of them commonly observed in aerobiological studies. Airborne organisms of only 8 taxa were also detected in the nearby aquatic systems. The algae Haematococcus lacustris, a Chlorella-like taxon, and Scenedesmus cf. obliquus, the heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) Bodo sp., Cafeteria minuta and Rynchomonas nasuta, and the ciliate Pattersoniella vitiphila were present in all 3 seasons, indicating capabilities of successful dispersal and colonization under a wide range of meteorological conditions. Rapid colonization of the water containers by the microeukaryotes occurred at the beginning of the experiment, but the rate of colonization quickly stabilized. The initial phase of colonization was dominated by HNF; subsequently, members of the Chlorophyta were the dominant autotrophs. The heterotrophic and autotrophic colonists established similar food webs in all 3 seasons, with P. vitiphila being the common top predator.

AB  - The global Slow Movement, a response to negative effects of speed on everyday life, seeks to reconnect people and their social and ecological environments. Slow Food and Cittaslow (Slow Cities) are allied Slow Movement networks operating in over 150 countries, including the United States (US). These two networks involve the interrelationship of numerous place-based factors important to socialecological resilience: local and regional food markets, recovery and protection of biodiversity and local ecologies, support for cultural traditions, agricultural policy reform, climate adaptation planning, economic development, social inclusion, quality of life in the built environment, and the politics of land development. This article presents the philosophical underpinnings of Slow Food and the associated membership requirements of Cittaslow by using the example of Sonoma Valley, California, the first certified Cittaslow in the US (2009). The article then describes Sonoma Valley's Cittaslow Pollinator Stewardship Collaborative to show how the nascent organization has begun its work by facilitating the participation of environmental professionals in community life. In its first year, Cittaslow Sonoma Valley has used a combination of pleasure and responsibility to increase both the visibility of environmental concerns and the opportunities for diverse residents to act locally and globally on issues integrating environmental and economic support. Because it offers a different approach to environmental responsibility, the Slow Movement may be of particular interest to environmental professionals who are concerned about so-cietal response to the complexity and uncertainty of global environmental change.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Between 1820 and 1860, the construction of a network of coal-carrying canals transformed the society, economy, and environment of the eastern mid-Atlantic. Artificial waterways created a new built environment for the region, an energy landscape in which anthracite coal could be transported cheaply, reliably, and in ever-increasing quantities. Flush with fossil fuel energy for the first time, mid-Atlantic residents experimented with new uses of coal in homes, iron forges, steam engines, and factories. Their efforts exceeded practically all expectations. Over the course of four decades, shipments of anthracite coal increased exponentially, helping turn a rural and commercial economy into an urban and industrial one. This article examines the development of coal canals in the antebellum period to provide new insights into how and why Americans came to adopt fossil fuels, when and where this happened, and the social consequences of these developments.

AB  - This paper aims to characterize and analyze the urban greenness change in the Baltimore-Washington corridor area. The general objectives for this study are: (1) to identify and analyze the urban greenness pattern and its changes, (2) to interpret and associate the change in urban greenness structure within its zoning area, (3) to characterize and discuss the influence of urbanization on the spatial distribution and temporal dynamic of urban green spaces. The linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) was adopted to extract the fraction maps of four endmembers (imperviousness, grassland, woodland, and soil) using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). The research results indicate that LSMA offers a better classified map than the traditional Maximum Likelihood Classification with an improved overall accuracy from 78.99% to 86.20%. The greenness dynamics within each census tract as well as planning zone were derived based on the each two successive fraction maps and fuzzy set concepts. The significant decrease of grassland in the business-based landscape (average green density decreased from 30% to 17%) with a slight decrease of woodland (from 63% to 60%) indicate the urbanization in the Baltimore-Washington corridor area impact its spatial morphology, structure, and ecological environment under the special socioeconomic development and reserve policies. The combination of remote sensing data and GIS zoning data provides us a comprehensive track on the pattern and process of urban greenness to deliver significant information for city planners and policy makers, as well as the unique dataset for other researcher to further evaluate the socioeconomic function of urban greenness.

AB  - Question
   What are the differences in trait compositions that enable native plants to colonise comparable natural and man-made habitats? Are these traits independent of phylogenetic relationships between species?
   Location
   Czech Republic.
   Methods
   The relative importance of biological, ecological and distributional traits of native species was studied, using a dataset of 75 species growing in rock and wall habitats in the Czech Republic. Species preferences for individual habitats due to climatic conditions and proportions of different vegetation types in their surroundings were partialled out using partial canonical correspondence analysis. The pattern of plant traits along a gradient from natural rock habitats to secondary wall habitats was analysed using regression trees and generalized linear models with and without phylogenetic correction.
   Results
   The most common native species colonising rock habitats are phanerophytes, mostly woody juveniles, with a CSR life strategy and most are adapted to epizoochory. Summer green leaves, annual life span, CR life strategy, reproduction mostly by seeds and dispersal by ants are all traits positively associated with the ability of species to colonise wall habitats. These species are also characterised by their high demand for nutrients, temperature, base-rich substrates and light. Biological and ecological traits are more important for colonising new habitats than traits related to species dispersal ability or phylogenetic relationships between species. Biological and ecological traits alone explained 29.3% of variability in the species dataset, while dispersal characteristics and phylogeny alone explained 9.1% and 4.8%, respectively.
   Conclusions
   We outline how the process of environmental filtering determines native species assemblages and identify a set of species traits that enable them to persist in particular habitats. We conclude that although urbanisation generally results in loss of natural habitats, there are new, man-made habitats potentially suitable for native species.

AB  - Urbanization, that is the movement of population from rural to urban locations, is a process that has been occurring for hundreds of years, but is increasingly prevalent in today's world. In 2008 most of the global population was resident in urban areas. It has been predicted that in the coming years, an increasing number of people will be living in cities; especially in the developing countries within in Asia and Latin America. This study considers the case of India, the second most populated country in the world, with a present total population exceeding I billion. It focuses on the state of Maharashtra (including the mega-city of Mumbai and its surrounds - the largest in India with a population of approximately 18.1 million). The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) is a spaceborne system that detects visible light and thermal emissions of the earth at night. The data is collected nightly, on a global basis. The aim of this paper is to correlate the values obtained from the radiance calibrated DMSP/OLS night-time images of 2001 with population data. The spatial resolution of DMSP/OLS images is approximately I Km. This paper asks the question over what range of spatial scales does DMSP/OLS have utility in retrieving metrics of urbanization.

AB  - In this work, we examined all the plots of land which appeared by the "No shantytown Program and Urban plots of land", evaluating the high and low articulation level of these plots of land with the Presidente Prudente's urban area. We watched out the occurrence and the level of sociospacial segregation, After that, we observed the level of integration among the people who live in the plots of land and the rest of the city, as well as, the grade of access that they have from the public consumption resources. We concluded that the spacial production and, specially, the no-continuing production of the urban areas, help the construction of the sociospacial segregation. It's is remarkable, when we realized the differences of accessing the city related to the plots of land already studied. At Parque Shiraiwa, a plot of land which is located in a region where there are developed plots of land, we watched that the people who live there, have a great level of consumption. However, in some cases from Conjunto Brasil Novo and, mainly, from Jardim Morada do Sol, we checked how the implantation of the housing settlements in certain areas far from the city cause a low spacial movement, creating for this reason, urban areas determined by clear conditions of sociospacial segregation.

AB  - The past few years have seen a growing interest in Open Data, a movement that encourages the sharing of public sector information for better governance, greater services and more vibrant economy. While data in government agencies are in abundance, their value and quality vary significantly. Without a structured approach, low-value and poor-quality information assets may be chosen, limiting the positive impact of Open Data. In recognizing the research gap, we propose a five-phase process of data selection, drawing insights from the domains of business architecture and information quality. The process is described and illustrated with an example of local government at the city level. It can be applied to other government agencies as they embark on Open Data initiatives.

AB  - In human dominated landscapes, ecosystems are under increasing pressures caused by urbanization and infrastructure development. In Alpine valleys remnant natural areas are increasingly affected by habitat fragmentation and loss. In these contexts, there is a growing risk of local extinction for wildlife populations; hence assessing the consequences on biodiversity of proposed land use changes is extremely important. The article presents a methodology to assess the impacts of land use changes on target species at a local scale. The approach relies on the application of ecological profiles of target species for habitat potential (HP) assessment, using high resolution GIS-data within a multiple level framework. The HP, in this framework, is based on a species-specific assessment of the suitability of a site, as well of surrounding areas. This assessment is performed through spatial rules, structured as sets of queries on landscape objects. We show that by considering spatial dependencies in habitat assessment it is possible to perform better quantification of impacts of local-level land use changes on habitats.

AB  - 1. In recent years, river restoration science has been searching for biological indicators of improvement in the physical habitats of streams. To date, research has mainly focused on the use of fish and macroinvertebrates as indicators. Despite their importance in aquatic ecosystems, the response of macrophytes to habitat restoration has been rarely studied.
   2. We investigated the macrophyte communities of 40 restored river reaches in the lowland and lower mountainous areas of Germany. Each restored reach was compared to an upstream, unrestored reach using a space-for-time-substitution approach. At each reach, a 100 m stretch was surveyed for submerged and emergent macrophytes, recording the quantity, abundance and growth form of each species. Additionally, microhabitat patterns (substrate, depth, current velocity) and channel parameters (mean and bankfull width, number of channel elements) were recorded.
   3. Restored reaches had a significantly higher macrophyte cover, richness, diversity and number of growth forms. Macrophyte diversity and richness were both positively correlated with depth, current and substrate.
   4. The analysis of growth forms showed that Lemnids, Helodids, Parvopotamids, Elodids, Peplids and Juncids are all significant indicators of restoration. These species all responded directly to the restoration measures either by highly increasing in abundance or by being present in the restored reaches and absent in the unrestored reaches. While the restored reaches of the lowland rivers were characterized by a high abundance of Peplids and Parvopotamids, the restored reaches of the mountain rivers showed a significantly higher presence and abundance of Lemnids and Helodids.
   5. Three macrophyte species (Lemna minor, Persicaria hydropiper, Potamogeton crispus) were regarded as significant indicators of restoration. No species were found to be indicators of unrestored reaches.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Macrophyte communities benefit from river restoration by showing increased cover, abundance and diversity. The main drivers of this enhancement are more natural and diverse substrates and an increased floodplain area in the restored reaches, as well as a greater variability of current and depth patterns. Monitoring of macrophytes could thus be an easy and cost-effective means to gauge the success of river restoration measures.

AB  - Background In the largely cross-sectional literature, built environment characteristics such as walkability and recreation centres are variably related to physical activity. Subgroup-specific effects could help explain inconsistent findings, yet few studies have compared built environment associations by key characteristics such as sex or life stage.
   Methods Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (wave I 1994-5, wave III 2001-2; n=12 701) and a linked geographic information system, cross-sectional relationships between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) bouts and built and socioeconomic environment measures were estimated. Negative binomial generalised estimating equation regression modelled MVPA as a function of log-transformed environment measures, controlling for individual sociodemographics and testing for interactions with sex and life stage (waves I and III, when respondents were adolescents and young adults, respectively).
   Results Higher landscape diversity (coefficient 0.040; 95% CI 0.019 to 0.062) and lower crime (coefficient -0.047; 95% CI -0.071 to -0.022) were related to greater weekly MVPA regardless of sex or life stage. Higher street connectivity was marginally related to lower MVPA (coefficient -0.176; 95% CI -0.357 to 0.005) in females but not males. Pay facilities and public facilities per 10 000 population and median household income were unrelated to MVPA.
   Conclusions Similar relationships between higher MVPA and higher landscape diversity and lower crime rate across sex and life stage suggest that application of these environment features may benefit broad populations. Sex-specific associations for street connectivity may partly account for the variation in findings across studies and have implications for targeting physical activity promotion strategies.

AB  - Family & Community Support Services (FCSS) in Calgary is a joint municipal and provincial funding program. The program is designed to develop, support, and fund preventive social services. FCSS Calgary has a number of benefits and truly makes a difference in the community. At-risk youth and vulnerable senior citizens have avenues for positive community involvement, family violence victims are safer, newcomers are welcomed and can feel at home in Calgary, citizens have access to information about the community and crisis services, and urban Aboriginal people are able to develop leadership skills within the community. FCSS programs and agencies align with at least one of the funding priorities (Strengthening Neighbourhoods and Increasing Social Inclusion, outlined in the Social Sustainability Framework). Increasing Social Inclusion concentrates on five populations: families, children and youth, seniors, immigrants, and Aboriginal people (City of Calgary, Social Sustainability, 2010).
   The new Social Sustainability Framework helps the community in a number of ways. It guides funding decisions by providing FCSS Calgary with clear and consistent principles. By aligning funded programs with identified objectives and outcomes, it helps FCSS account for and communicate its impact on the community. There is an abundance of statistics that support the need for culturally appropriate programs for urban Aboriginal peoples. Research demonstrates urgency for these programs and the current social landscape of urban Aboriginal children, youth, and families. For example, between 1996 and 2006, the Aboriginal population across Canada grew by 45% to reach close to 1.2 million persons, representing 3.8% of the Canadian population. (Statistics Canada, 2008, Canadian Demographics at a Glance, p. 34).
   Two examples of urban Aboriginal programs from Metis Calgary Family Services (MCFS) is presented within FCSS's Sustainability Framework; Native Network, and Little Dancing Buffalo.

AB  - Ongoing human-long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) conflicts in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Singapore, have seen native macaques significantly affected, as residential development encroaches into animals' habitat, destroying important wildlife corridors. The search for a more humane treatment of these transgressive animals can be seen as an attempt to extend and include non-human animals within humanistic notions of ethics and care, in the process destabilizing the assumed divide between human/animal. Yet, a feasible solution is difficult to reach as National Parks Board (NParks), the state agency overseeing the conservation of reserves and wildlife, has to negotiate constantly between their goal of maintaining biodiversity and appeasing the complaining residents. The paper seek to understand urban-wilderness conflicts between human-macaque, showing that the divide between tamed/wild is multi-sited, ambiguous and constantly shifting. In this regard, we are especially interested in the role of intermediaries in initiating actions to 'make discursive as well as material space' for macaques in the reserve. Intermediaries, here referring to NParks and animal activists, are actors who do not reside near the reserve thus having no frequent encounters with wildlife, yet are enrolled as mitigators during instances of human-animal conflicts.

AB  - Background: Dengue infection spread in naive populations occurs in an explosive and widespread fashion primarily due to the absence of population herd immunity, the population dynamics and dispersal of Ae. aegypti, and the movement of individuals within the urban space. Knowledge on the relative contribution of such factors to the spatial dimension of dengue virus spread has been limited. In the present study we analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern of a large dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) outbreak that affected the Australian city of Cairns (north Queensland) in 2003, quantified the relationship between dengue transmission and distance to the epidemic's index case (IC), evaluated the effects of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on the odds of dengue infection, and generated recommendations for city-wide dengue surveillance and control.
   Methods and Findings: We retrospectively analyzed data from 383 DENV-2 confirmed cases and 1,163 IRS applications performed during the 25-week epidemic period. Spatial (local k-function, angular wavelets) and space-time (Knox test) analyses quantified the intensity and directionality of clustering of dengue cases, whereas a semi-parametric Bayesian space-time regression assessed the impact of IRS and spatial autocorrelation in the odds of weekly dengue infection. About 63% of the cases clustered up to 800 m around the IC's house. Most cases were distributed in the NW-SE axis as a consequence of the spatial arrangement of blocks within the city and, possibly, the prevailing winds. Space-time analysis showed that DENV-2 infection spread rapidly, generating 18 clusters (comprising 65% of all cases), and that these clusters varied in extent as a function of their distance to the IC's residence. IRS applications had a significant protective effect in the further occurrence of dengue cases, but only when they reached coverage of 60% or more of the neighboring premises of a house.
   Conclusion: By applying sound statistical analysis to a very detailed dataset from one of the largest outbreaks that affected the city of Cairns in recent times, we not only described the spread of dengue virus with high detail but also quantified the spatio-temporal dimension of dengue virus transmission within this complex urban environment. In areas susceptible to non-periodic dengue epidemics, effective disease prevention and control would depend on the prompt response to introduced cases. We foresee that some of the results and recommendations derived from our study may also be applicable to other areas currently affected or potentially subject to dengue epidemics.

AB  - While urban ecology is an expanding field of study, some natural areas within the urban environment remain under-examined. These include naturally regenerating forest communities adjacent to urban interstates. In addition, the status of interstate soils and their relationships with the community composition of forested interstate verges has received little ecological study. The purpose of this study was to examine variation in soil conditions along forested interstate corridors in Louisville, KY and to explore the extent to which soil characteristics (e.g., bulk density, pH) and heavy metals (e.g., Pb, Zn) vary with respect to three factors: interstate (e.g., traffic density), surrounding urban environment (e.g., industrial land use), and interstate construction legacies. Additionally, we explored the relationships between several edaphic factors and woody vegetation structure in these forested verges. We found that the degree and direction of the slope of land towards the interstate and the distance to the interstate pavement were strong determinants of soil characteristics and heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the movement of de-icing salts, heavy metals, and other pollutants from the interstate was important in determining forest soil conditions along urban interstates. Since within our study area these highways did not extend into rural lands, variation in urban land uses and cover within 26 km of the city center was not large enough to explain variation in soil characteristics or heavy metals, except for a positive correlation between chromium and surrounding industrial land use. We did find that past physical soil disturbance caused by interstate construction (e.g., imported fill) left an important legacy on soil characteristics, heavy metal retention, and woody plant growth patterns in forests adjacent to urban interstates. The legacy of interstate construction on the current forest community structure (e.g., lower species richness) and the future forest (e.g., reduced tree regeneration) may further alter ecosystem productivity and ecosystem services provided by these forests and their soils.

AB  - In fragmented habitats, one cause of the decrease of plant diversity and abundance is the disruption of plant-animal interactions, and in particular plant-pollinator interactions. Since habitat fragmentation acts both on pollinator behaviour and plant reproduction, its consequences for the stability of such interactions are complex. An extreme case of habitat fragmentation occurs in urbanised areas where suitable habitat (in the present study small patches around ornamental trees) is embedded in a highly unsuitable environment (concrete matrix). Based on simple experiments, we ask whether pollinators can adapt their foraging behaviour in response to the amount of available resources (flowers) in the fragments and their isolation, as predicted by the optimal foraging theory. To do so we analysed the effect of fragmentation on the behaviour of pollinators visiting Crepis sancta (L.) Bornm. (Asteraceae), which forms large populations in the countryside and patchy populations in urban environments. More precisely we studied pollinator visitation rates, capitulum visit durations, capitulum search durations and capitulum size choice. Pollinators chose larger capitula in both types of populations and their foraging behaviour differed between the two population types in three ways: (1) pollinator visits were lower in urban fragmented populations, perhaps due to the lower accessibility of urban patches; (2) capitulum visit durations were longer in urban fragmented populations, a possible compensation of energy lost during flights among patches; and (3) capitulum search durations where longer in urban fragmented populations, which may represent an increase in capitulum prospecting effort. We discuss the possible impacts of such differences for plant population functioning in the two types of populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nairobi National Park (NNP) is unable to incorporate the spatial and temporal dynamics of many migratory mammals that rely on the area as a dry season refuge because of its small size. During the wet season, wildlife must be able to migrate to the south into the Kitengela dispersal area. This area is privately owned and rapidly undergoing land-use change, which affects the structure and function of the dispersal corridors, jeopardising the ecological sustainability of the park. Private landholders in Kitengela incur most of the costs of keeping the dispersal areas open, but do not receive any compensation or revenue from benefits derived from tourism in the park. Here we present an analysis of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Nairobi and Kitengela residents for a new land management scheme in the dispersal area, in which local pastoralists leave their land open to wildlife and, by not engaging in fencing, land subdivision or poaching activities, receive monetary compensation for the incremental costs derived from use of their properties as a wildlife dispersal area. The results suggest that the aggregated financial support of urban residents might represent around $1.2 million per year for 5 years. This amount exceeds the economic losses caused by wildlife in the dispersal area, and different financial schemes of fund investment and the prioritisation of conservation regions could be implemented to ensure payments and keep the dispersal corridors open in perpetuity.

AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial distribution of vegetation can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena, etc. It is required to investigate the spatial distribution of vegetation on a regional scale because there should be green corridors and wind paths in the areas between urban areas and suburbs. We have developed a spatial analysis method of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the NDVI adopted as the potential of the vegetation abundance. Application of the method leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the vegetation distributions in urbanized areas. We applied our method to the urbanization areas and analyzed the features of vegetation distributions regarding spatial continuity through the verification of its applicability. We used a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs as the reference. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas.

AB  - Within a context of deep poverty, how does one accomplish daily travel in Sub-Saharan African cities and which strategies for adaptation one is brought to develop? Far from a low uniform mobility level, household travel surveys show evidence of a diversity of mobilities, which are constrained, sometimes even hindered, and present different characteristics according to cities and individuals. Modes of transport are used in original ways and continuous adaptations and innovations are undertaken in the fields of both the supply of transport and the demand for transport. Two examples of this process are discussed in this paper. The first one deals with the great plasticity of transport services supplied by informal operators, as in the case of the motorbike-taxi in several cities. The second example concerns the relative sharing in the use of a rare asset, the personal car, which allows to extend the number of regular users towards a circle of occasional users. Both examples contribute to a two-fold movement, on the one hand the pooling of personal vehicles and in the other hand the individualisation of public transport. In conclusion, the benefits and the limits, in particular environmental limits, of these evolutions, lead to questioning theurban policies necessary for the regulation and organisation of daily mobilities.

AB  - Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a global destructive pest of potato, Solanum tuberosum L. (Solanaceae). It is also an important quarantine pest in China, but its dispersal history, occurrence, and economic impact in China have not yet been reported. We determined the current distribution of CPB and reconstructed its dispersal routes. We also investigated the density of CPB in China in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010, and estimated the economic impact of CPB in China. In 1993, CPB was first detected in Xinjiang and subsequently spread eastward. The CPB entered China at three distinct points in Xinjiang: in Huocheng County, Tacheng City, and Habahe County. As of 2010, CPB had invaded 38 counties and cities in China, with a distribution area of 277 000 km2, between 42 degrees 40'48 degrees 28'N and 80 degrees 15'90 degrees 41'E. The distribution area could be divided into four zones (from south to north): Ili River Valley, northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, Tacheng Basin, and Altay. The average annual dispersal rates in the four zones were 18, 45, 12, and 24 km year-1, respectively. In China, CPB seriously damages potato, impacts eggplant, Solanum melongena L., and occasionally harms tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L. The current annual economic loss caused by CPB in China is estimated to be 3.2 million USD. The potential annual economic losses after completion of its invasion in China is estimated to be 235 million USD. Future invasion pathways, factors affecting CPB dispersal, and control measures were discussed.

AB  - Resilient systems can absorb disturbance and persist despite variability as long as the capacity of the system to adapt is not exceeded. Riparian plant communities of dryland alluvial rivers are expected to be naturally resilient systems because they persist in the highly variable flood-plain. River modification has altered the flow regime on many dryland rivers, in some cases exceeding the adaptive capacity of the riparian vegetation, but these changes may be readily reversible. The Salt River in Phoenix, Arizona has been impounded, dewatered, channelized, but also rewatered with urban effluent and storm drain runoff. To determine whether riparian vegetation is resilient to these various perturbations, paired comparisons were made in the vegetation and seed bank between a non-diverted reference reach, a diverted reach, and a re-watered urban reach. In the diverted reach, composition had shifted to that of a stress tolerant xeroriparian shrubland with low diversity in both the seed bank and extant vegetation. Most surprisingly, few differences were observed in the composition and structure of the vegetation and soil seed banks between the reference reach and the urban reach, particularly in the wet patches, suggesting that hydric riparian plant communities have the capacity to adapt to these modified conditions. These results provide support for a process-oriented approach to restoration on the Salt River and other urban dryland rivers using patches of persisting vegetation as models for achievable restoration targets.

AB  - Severe competition for water and augmented agricultural and urban development in Israel have modified and destroyed wetland habitats. Using historical maps, we mapped the past extent of swamps and natural rain pools along the central coastal plain of Israel and compared this with the present extent as reflected in reports, field surveys and satellite images. Out of 192 swamps and rain pools recorded in historical sources, only 18% (35) still exist today. Extrapolation from 69 new records of rain pools (missing in historical sources), suggests that in the 19th century, before many of the wetlands were drained, transformed to agricultural land, or built over, the number of wetland habitats in the coastal plain was threefold higher. In addition to reduction of wetland number. human activity has also diminished wetland size. In rainy winters wetland areas in the coastal plain in the past were an order of magnitude larger than they are today (27.6 and 2.4 km(2), respectively). At present, the existing natural water bodies along the coastal plain are temporary, small, and surrounded by built-up areas and roads. The grave state of the wetlands in Israel underscores the urgent need for protection of the remnant wetland sites. Following the successful example of wetland restoration in the Hula Valley, we recommend restoring various historical wetlands that have been drained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest fragmentation of anthropogenic origin is one of the results promoted by the disorderly process of the land use and land cover, especially in intensively cultivated landscapes. In this context, this study aimed to define priority areas to facilitate connectivity among forest fragments, seeking forest recovery actions in the Pardo River Basin, SP, using the multicriteria approach (Weighted Linear Combination). The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168), slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority. The priority areas occurred in order to promote the first union of forest patches with greater nuclear area, and from this union, the successive expansion of these regions of very high priority tending to very low. The methodology was adequate to the mapping of priority areas for restoration in watersheds. Fragments with bigger nuclear areas, connected with small fragments where they are predominant in the landscape, promoting the formation of larger fragments from the formation of forest corridors and recompositon of vegetation.

AB  - Understanding the reorganisation of land in order to adapt its use and spatial structure to social demands has become crucial to management and represents a major challenge to land use planning and public policies. This study explores the temporal and spatial land use change transitions in a pen-urban area of a medium-sized city located in the central Portugal and characterised by profound changes in the last half century. The study is supported by a collection of seven years/moments of image analysis (the 1958, 1973, 1979, 1995, 2002 and 2007 maps). Cross-referencing the successive sets of images defines the percentage of land transition and provides the stability grade (SG), which expresses the total proportion of the landscape that has not experienced any transition to a different category of land use. In order to evaluate the intensity of urban expansion, an annual rate of artificialisation of surfaces (AS) indicator was used. The seven cartographic outputs highlight a decrease in the area occupied by permanent crops, an increase in urban areas, especially the continuous urban fabric, a large forest occupation involving different typologies and paths, and an increase in base soil areas. The data also shows a general increase in the number of patches recognised and in pattern complexity. The results show that land use changes are created by systematic transitions, with or without gross variations, and also by casuistic processes associated with an increase in artificialised areas and the growth of the continuous urban fabric. Land use transition reflects the internal and external inputs associated with the approval of Municipal Master Plans and the land regulatory regime, and also the consolidation of the road infrastructure network. The analysis indicates that the transfer takes place in a set of small sequential steps marking the evolution from rural characteristics to a process of peri-urbanisation, ending in urban consolidation.

AB  - Adult dispersal and completion of life cycles by aquatic insects are essential for the persistence of populations, colonization of new habitats, and maintenance of genetic diversity. However, life-cycle stages and processes associated with the terrestrial environment often are overlooked when the effect of watershed urbanization on the persistence of insects associated with streams is examined. We reviewed and synthesized current literature on the known effects of watershed urbanization on the terrestrial stage of stream insects. Some research has directly examined the effects of watershed urbanization on dispersal, but much of the evidence we present is indirect and from related studies on aquatic insect life-history traits and dispersal abilities in nonurban watersheds. Our goal is to provide examples of potential impacts that warrant further study, rather than to provide a comprehensive review of all life-history studies. We discuss how watershed land use, riparian condition, and habitat quality affect: 1) adult fitness, 2) adult dispersal, and 3) habitat fragmentation, and 4) how these factors interact with species traits. In general, we found that the local- and landscape-scale changes to stream, riparian, and upland habitats that typically result from anthropogenic activities have the potential to prevent the completion of aquatic insect life cycles and to limit adult dispersal, and therefore, can affect population persistence. When considered within the spatial context of dendritic stream networks, these effects, particularly those on adult dispersal, might have important implications for design and assessment of restoration projects. We discuss a framework for how to determine the relative importance of effects on specific life-cycle stages and processes for the absence of larval populations from urban streams. Overall, more research on terrestrial life-cycle stages and processes and on adult dispersal is required to understand how urbanization might affect population persistence of insects in urban streams.

AB  - The addition of artificial structures along urbanised shorelines is a global phenomenon. Such modifications of habitats have important consequences to the abundance of fouling organisms on primary substrata, but the influence on fouling of habitat-formers living on these structures is poorly understood. Fouling of habitat-forming kelps Ecklonia radiata on pier-pilings was compared to that on rocky reefs at three locations in Sydney Harbour. Kelps on pilings supported different assemblages of bryozoans from those on reefs. The abundances of bryozoans on kelps, in particular of the non-indigenous species Membranipora membranacea, were significantly greater on pilings. Differences were consistent in time and space. This indicates that the addition of artificial structures also affects fouling on secondary biogenic substrata, altering biodiversity and potentially facilitating the introduction and dispersal of non-indigenous epibiota. Understanding the processes that cause these patterns is necessary to allow sensible predictions about ecological effects of built structures.

AB  - 1. Vegetated islands within river corridors are pivotal landscape features and are among the first to disappear as a consequence of flow regulation and channelisation. However, how vegetated islands vary along human-impacted rivers is poorly understood. 2. We carried out a detailed analysis of the contemporary distribution, diversity and environmental state of vegetated islands within 12 human-impacted European rivers, using 75 Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images (19992002), historical maps, DEM data and landscape metrics. We tested whether channel fragmentation, catchment land use and the environmental state of fringing floodplains determine the spatial patterns of the islands. We also analysed the historical change of islands within selected sections of the Upper Danube, Upper Rhine and Olt rivers. 3. We identified 2771 islands in the contemporary landscape, varying from 0.06 to 9828 ha. Islands covered up to 21% of the active channel area and contributed up to 32% of the total riparian ecotone length. Island density ranged from 0.06 islands per river-km (River Sava) to 1.6 islands per river-km (River Tagliamento). River regulation has led to a marked loss of island density: 94% in the Upper Danube, 93% in the Upper Rhine, and 69% in the Olt. The environmental state of the islands was significantly less altered by human activity than of their fringing floodplains; 93.4% of the vegetated islands exhibited a near-natural state, while 86% of the fringing floodplains were expansively converted to agricultural and urban land uses. 4. Our results highlight the ubiquitous presence of vegetated islands, their sensitivity to river regulation and their pivotal role for the future restoration and management of river corridors.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide. Habitat loss and the isolation of habitat fragments disrupt biological communities, accelerate the extinction of populations, and often lead to the alteration of behavioral patterns typical of individuals in large, contiguous natural areas. We used radio-telemetry to study the space-use behavior of the Coachwhip, a larger-bodied, wide-ranging snake species threatened by habitat fragmentation, in fragmented and contiguous areas of coastal southern California. We tracked 24 individuals at three sites over two years. Movement patterns of Coachwhips changed in habitat fragments. As area available to the snakes was reduced, individuals faced increased crowding, had smaller home-range sizes, tolerated greater home-range overlap, and showed more concentrated movement activity and convoluted movement pathways. The behavioral response shown by Coachwhips suggests, on a regional level, area-effects alone cannot explain observed extinctions on habitat fragments but, instead, suggests changes in habitat configuration are more likely to explain the decline of this species. Ultimately, if "edge-exposure" is a common cause of decline, then isolated fragments, appropriately buffered to reduce emigration and edge effects, may support viable populations of fragmentation-sensitive species.

AB  - In Canada, habitat loss has pushed many more species to the brink of extinction than expected in a region with extensive wilderness. However, species richness gradients depend strongly on climate, so species are concentrated in southern regions, where agricultural and urban land uses are both intensive and extensive. Agricultural pesticide use is associated with increasing rates of species endangerment in the south, but long-range transport of persistent organic pollutants is an emerging issue in remote northern regions. Because their distributions reflect climate so strongly, climate change threatens species throughout Canada. Evidence indicates that species' distributions, phenologies, and interactions with pests and diseases are changing more rapidly in response to climate change than global mean values. Nevertheless, climate change is expected to impose dispersal requirements that surpass species' maximum rates. Habitat losses may interact with climate change to impair species' dispersal still further, creating the potential for widespread disruption of biological systems in the most diverse areas of Canada. New research is urgently needed to address questions, and the ethics, around species translocation, ecosystem engineering to anticipate future environmental conditions, and strategies to facilitate the persistence of rare species in landscapes dominated by human activities.

AB  - It is currently unclear if the potential for West Nile virus transmission by mosquito vectors in the eastern United States is related to landscape or climate factors or both. We compared abundance of vector species between urban and suburban neighborhoods of Henrico County, VA, in relation to the following factors: temperature, precipitation, canopy cover, building footprint, and proximity to drainage infrastructure. Mosquitoes were collected throughout the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons and tested for West Nile virus (WNV) in pools of 10-50. Test results of mosquito pools were compared to average site abundance from 37 sites in Henrico County, VA; abundance was then examined in relation to ecological variables. Urban infrastructure was positively correlated with the abundance of Culex pipiens L./Cx. restuans, and our findings implicate combined sewer overflow systems as large contributors to Culex vector populations. No measure of urbanization examined in our study was correlated with Aedes albopictus abundance. Our study showed that certain landscape variables identified using Geographic Information Systems are valuable for predicting primary WNV vector abundance in Virginia, and that temperature along with low precipitation are strong predictors of population growth. Our results support other regional studies that found WNV proliferates under drought conditions. Journal of Vector Ecology 36 (1): 75-85. 2011.

AB  - Aim
   Biological invasions pose one of the most severe threats to global biodiversity. Still, invasions can create positive ecological relationships and services, which can sometimes result in challenges for conservation efforts. A case in point is the invasion of alien plants that form mutualisms with native frugivorous birds. Here, we examined the correlation between honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.) and the bird communities in a landscape of central Pennsylvania during the fall months.
   Location
   State College area in central Pennsylvania, USA.
   Methods
   We conducted point counts to quantify the abundance of birds and fleshy-fruited plant species within a 187.5 km2 landscape that included forested, urban and agricultural lands. We also compared fruit-removal rates for a native fruiting plant under low and high Lonicera densities.
   Results
   The abundance of birds showed a strong positive association with Lonicera fruits, with the abundance of Turdus migratorius and Dumetella carolinensis showing the strongest correlations. We also found that fruit-removal rates were 30% larger for a native plant species in areas of high Lonicera density compared to a site with low density of Lonicera.
   Main conclusions
   Our results suggest that Lonicera may currently serve as a main axis for the organization of bird communities and the networks of frugivore-plant interactions in central Pennsylvania. Since populations of key bird frugivores may be currently depending on Lonicera resources, we argue that control measures should account for the negative effects that the loss of this fruit resource could have on populations of native consumers in highly invaded regions.

AB  - This article examines the rhetoric and practice of a large social movement organised around low-income housing in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Making explicit the relationship between housing and citizenship, the Uniao de Movimentos de Moradia (Alliance of Housing Movements) articulates a 'politics of rights' with which it calls on the state to uphold the constitutional right to housing, and legitimates its high-profile occupations of abandoned buildings in the centre of the city. The article engages with James Holston's historical examination of homeowners' struggles on the peripheries of Sao Paulo to assert themselves as rights-holders and to mobilise against threats of eviction. While Holston names these groups of residents 'insurgent' citizens for the way they have unsettled entrenched social inequalities, this article presents the concept of 'transgressive' citizenship to reflect the challenge the housing movement makes to the state as it uses text-based law to justify building occupations.

AB  - Despite increasing recognition of the importance of goods movement in urban areas, and a growing number of related data collection efforts, Canada's systems for moving goods in urban areas are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate options for a benchmarking system for urban goods movement.
   This paper characterizes the dimensions of goods movement that occur in urban areas, identifies performance indicators that reflect policy goals and objectives, summarizes the data requirements of state of practice urban goods movement modeling approaches, and assesses available data collection methods in Canada. The paper then outlines five alternative frameworks, each of which identifies a suite of data collection methods that, in combination, has potential to fulfill data needs for measuring performance indicators and supporting modeling for predicting those indicators. The paper concludes that a national shipper-based survey and periodic purchase of vehicle tracking data from 3rd party providers provides, on balance, a preferable combination of complementary strengths for nation-wide performance benchmarking of urban goods movement.

AB  - 1. Coastal landscapes are being transformed as a consequence of the increasing demand for urban infrastructure to sustain commercial, residential and tourist activities. A variety of man-made structures, such as breakwaters, jetties and seawalls have thus become ubiquitous features of intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. This transformation will accelerate in response to the exponential growth of human populations and to global changes, such as sea-level rise and increased frequency of extreme meteorological events (e.g. storms). Here, we provide a critical overview of the major ecological effects of increasing infrastructure to marine habitats, we identify future research directions for advancing our understanding of marine urban ecosystems and we highlight how alternative management options might mitigate their impacts.
   2. Urban infrastructure supports different epibiota and associated assemblages and does not function as surrogate of natural rocky habitats. Its introduction in the intertidal zone or in near-shore waters can cause fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. Furthermore, the provision of novel habitat (hard substrata) along sedimentary shores can alter local and regional biodiversity by modifying natural patterns of dispersal of species, or by facilitating the establishment and spread of exotic species.
   3. Attempts to use ecological criteria to solve problems of urban infrastructure are promising. Incorporating natural elements of habitat (e.g. wetland vegetation; seagrass) into shoreline stabilization can reduce ecological impacts, without impinging on its efficacy in halting erosion. Likewise, improving the ecological value of artificial structures by adding features of habitat that are generally missing from such structures (e.g. rock-pools) can contribute to mitigation of the detrimental effects of urbanization on biodiversity. Management of anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. maintenance works; harvesting) to artificial habitat is, however, necessary if such attempts are to be successful.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Increasing our understanding of the ecological functioning of marine habitats created by urban infrastructure and incorporating ecological criteria into coastal engineering are crucial for preserving biodiversity in the face of the growth of human populations in coastal areas and of forecasted global changes. Achieving this goal will need strong collaboration between engineers, managers and ecologists.

AB  - Article 6 of the Habitats Directive provides appropriate Management Plans (MPs) for Natura 2000 network sites which comply with ecological requirements. In Sicily, between 2000 and 2006,58 Management Plans were drawn up involving 219/233 regional sites. These drafts had to refer to regional directives, drawing on European Union and national guidelines. They require knowledge and intervention not only with reference to aspects of site biology, but also to landscape components. Landscapes should be described 'considering them as the synthesis of physical, biological, historical and cultural characteristics'. This work presents the results of a method proposed by ECOVAST (European Council for the Village and Small Town), based on a visual cognitive analysis for identifying landscapes which was tested while drafting the Natura 2000 site MP 'Torre Manfria, Biviere of Gela and seafront area' on Sicily's southern coast. The work consists of: drafting thematic maps for preliminary territorial analysis; producing a layout of routes from which the landscape was observed: identifying Landscape Units and filling analysis and assessment charts; drafting final results. The results show that the adapted ECOVAST method for the cognitive phase of the MP provided a satisfactory level of information about the landscape as expressed in the European Landscape Convention, the main reference for European Union states. The defined landscape Units and their relative characteristics provided support for geographically referencing the 'management actions'. Adapting the ECOVAST method helped identify the landscape as having an explicit role in the ELC within a plan type which subordinates protecting the landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Place and Place-Making in Cities: A Global Perspective
T2  - PLANNING THEORY & PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - Since the 1990s, interest in place (as opposed to space) has surged across a spectrum of social science disciplines including planning. But the empirical focus has been chiefly on cities along the Atlantic Rim even as vast new areas in Asia, Africa, and Latin America were undergoing accelerated urbanization. This essay outlines a planning perspective to global place-making in the face of fierce inter-city competition for footloose capital. The question of how a place can be defined, and what criteria might serve to delineate a place occupies the first part of this essay. The definition proposed encompasses both a physical/built environment at the neighborhood scale and the subjective feelings its inhabitants harbor towards each other as an emplaced community. Specific criteria are discussed, with brief illustrations from Taiwan and China. But the art of place-making has not informed planners of the swaths of the urban in the newly industrializing global regions of Asia and elsewhere. Their principal preoccupation has been with the branding of cities and the advanced infrastructure required by global capital. In the process, millions of ordinary folks have been displaced and their neighborhoods erased, as speed, movement, and power have been valued more than the fragile social infrastructure of place-based communities. The essay concludes with an argument that place-making is everyone's job, local residents as well as official planners, and that old places can be "taken back" neighborhood by neighborhood, through collaborative people-centered planning. Examples from Japan, China, and Canada are used to illustrate these propositions.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
KW  - SAFETY
AB  - Road facilities in urban areas are a major source of injury for nonmotorized road users despite the benefits of nonmotorized transportation. In particular, large Canadian cities such as Montreal face serious problems with pedestrian and cyclist safety. To address these problems, funds are continually allocated through different safety improvement programs such as reduction of speed limits, improvement of intersections, and increased traffic enforcement. However, few analytical tools help to identify and quantify the benefits of countermeasures (e.g., roadway design, speed management strategies, or land use policies) in reducing accident frequency and severity. Injury severity models were developed to determine the effects of road design, built environment, speed limits, and other factors (e.g., vehicle characteristics and movement type) on injury severity levels of pedestrians and cyclists involved in collisions with motor vehicles. Sources of data included police reports describing vehicle pedestrian and vehicle cyclist collisions, as well as information on land use, transit network, and road design attributes from the city of Montreal. The impacts of road design, land use, built environment, and other strategies on the injury severity levels of vulnerable road users were investigated. Factors such as darkness, vehicle movement, whether an accident occurred at an intersection, vehicle type, and land use mix affected the severity of pedestrian injuries from collisions. For cyclists, however, only vehicle movement and whether the accident occurred at a signalized intersection had significant effects on the severity of the injury.

AB  - In an urban landscape, population viability may require successful movement of recently fledged birds between habitat patches, yet postfledging movements are rarely studied. We used radiotelemetry to track 26 American Robin (Turdus migratorius), 15 Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), 46 Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus), and 35 Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia) fledglings across the urban gradient of the Seattle metropolis, to document the relative use of specific features of the built and forested environment and to correlate land-cover metrics with survival during the postfledging period. Survival of postfledging birds, other than American Robins, was high, and the effects of land cover on survival were limited. Across species, we observed lower survival in forested areas than in the suburban lands around them, but this may have been a function of fledgling age. Once juvenile birds became independent, they often moved into suburbs without increased risk of death. We found little consistency in relative habitat use within species, with the exception of American Robins, which used suburban residential areas more than forested areas. However, resource use by the other species was context-specific: (1) use of residential areas by Song Sparrows was highest where this habitat was least common, (2) use of forested areas by Spotted Towhees decreased with increasing level of urbanization, and (3) use of heavy-medium urban areas by Swainson's Thrush decreased with increasing abundance of roads.

AB  - The number of families in the urban fox population of Sapporo, Japan, was estimated from two sets of data reported by the public to government: records of road-killed foxes (information-A) and records of complaints about foxes (information-B). We assumed that fox populations consist of families that have exclusive home ranges, i.e., territories, during the period between gestation and dispersal. The urban area was then divided into hexagons that correspond to the territories. The locations from the two sets of records during the territorial period were plotted on the map. The number of fox families for which information-A and/or B was reported was estimated by counting the number of hexagons that include the record. The total number of families was estimated by using a double-observation method. We adopted Chapman's unbiased estimator which is based on the hypergeometric distribution that corresponds to the conditional likelihood. We demonstrated the possibility of estimating the abundance of animals from government data such as road kill and complaints if the animals have territories.

AB  - Irrigation water use in private landscapes represents an increasing share of total water use in semiarid areas. In this work, 102 households located in the Montecanal neighbourhood (Zaragoza. Spain) were analysed. Research took advantage of the dual water supply network (separate indoor and irrigation water networks). The analysis was based on bi-monthly water billing records for the period 2005-2007. The total household landscape area (93 m(2)) and the area occupied by turf, trees and shrubs were derived from aerial photographs. A method based on reference evapotranspiration was used to estimate net landscape irrigation requirements. The total average water use was 0.80 m(3) household(-1) day(-1), with irrigation water use amounting to 46% of the total water use. Average air temperature largely determined irrigation water use (the correlation coefficient was 0.958). Overirrigation was common in the three years of study, with the average irrigation water application (IWA) being much higher than the Net Irrigation Requirements (1359 and 555 mm, respectively). Only 34% of the households showed adequate irrigation, while 6% of the households underirrigated their landscape areas. In the rest of the households (60%), overirrigation was observed. Significant time correlations were found for IWA and for an adequacy index, suggesting that landowners applied their inadequate irrigation criteria in a consistent way. Local private landscape irrigation performance was found to be very poor, probably owing to low water cost and over-the-average household income. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial continuity of vegetation distributions can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena. In this paper, we develop a spatial analysis met hod of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) adopted as the proxy of vegetation abundance. Application of the met hod leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study is to verify our method through applying a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas. We use remotely sensed data collected at four different time periods at the regional scale, along with information on the seasonal fluctuations of the vegetation. As a result, the exclusion of seasonal land-cover changes, as in the reaping of agricultural fields, in the process of applying the proposed method produces an effect. The analysis reveals steady areas unaffected by the seasonal fluctuation of vegetation along the lines extracted by applying the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report the results of three mark-release-recapture experiments carried out in an urban area in Rome, Italy, to study the active dispersal of Aedes albopictus ( Diptera: Culicidae). The 4.3% recapture rate obtained supports the use of sticky traps in MRR experiments to study the dispersal of Ae. albopictus females. Most fluorescent dust-marked females were recaptured at the gravid stage at 50-200 m from the release sites during the first 9 days after release. The average of daily-MDTs ( Mean Distance Traveled) was 119 m and the maximum observed distance travelled ranged from 199 m to 290 m in the three replicates. These data provide the first information about the dispersal of Ae. albopictus in a temperate European area and appear to be consistent with the few data available on this subject from other urban areas, where dispersal was constrained by physical barriers. Although caution should be taken in generalizing these results, they should be considered when planning control activities in urban areas in Italy, as well as in other European countries. This is particularly relevant if control is intended to interrupt pathogen transmission in cases of possible arbovirus epidemics, such as the Chikungunya outbreak that occurred in Ravenna, Italy in 2007.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the floristic, structural and ecological between physiognomies in a Cerrado remnant, Monte Carmelo, MG. From the phytossociological survey, we assessed the ecological patterns related to the species dispersion guilds and deciduousness. The floristic similarity between the physiognomies was parsed using quantitative and qualitative data (presence/absence) through the Jaccard similarity coefficient and Morisita-Horn indice. The urban remnant presented four vegetable physiognomies, classified in semideciduous seasonal forest, stricto sense cerrado, cerradao and gallery forest. We sampled 153 species, distributed in 49 families. The semideciduous forest covers the largest portion of the Park and has the greatest diversity of species. The gallery forest presented the less diversity, having as main representatives species adapted to conditions of hydromorphic soil. The predominance of zoochoric species in four physiognomies confirms the importance of biological agents on gene flow of these formations. The highest percentage of species anemochoric was found in the stricto sense cerrado and cerradao. The floristic similarity between the physiognomies present in urban remnant is low, demonstrating that small environmental variations reflect major floristic changes. Each physiognomies has its peculiarities, not only in relation to physical conditions, but also in relation to fundamental ecological processes, such as biological diversity and interaction with the fauna disperser, which may explain the great beta diversity found in the Cerrado biome.

AB  - Background: Urbanization is a major cause of habitat fragmentation worldwide. Ecological and conservation theory predicts many potential impacts of habitat fragmentation on natural populations, including genetic impacts. Habitat fragmentation by urbanization causes populations of animals and plants to be isolated in patches of suitable habitat that are surrounded by non-native vegetation or severely altered vegetation, asphalt, concrete, and human structures. This can lead to genetic divergence between patches and in turn to decreased genetic diversity within patches through genetic drift and inbreeding.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined population genetic patterns using microsatellites in four common vertebrate species, three lizards and one bird, in highly fragmented urban southern California. Despite significant phylogenetic, ecological, and mobility differences between these species, all four showed similar and significant reductions in gene flow over relatively short geographic and temporal scales. For all four species, the greatest genetic divergence was found where development was oldest and most intensive. All four animals also showed significant reduction in gene flow associated with intervening roads and freeways, the degree of patch isolation, and the time since isolation.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite wide acceptance of the idea in principle, evidence of significant population genetic changes associated with fragmentation at small spatial and temporal scales has been rare, even in smaller terrestrial vertebrates, and especially for birds. Given the striking pattern of similar and rapid effects across four common and widespread species, including a volant bird, intense urbanization may represent the most severe form of fragmentation, with minimal effective movement through the urban matrix.

AB  - Having an important place in ecosystem, plants are quite valuable components of landscape in urban ecosystems in terms of ecological, economic, social and visual aspects. Therefore, it is quite important to carry Out planting design studies in urban areas according to well-established planning and design principles since plants give movement, color effects besides creating a natural environment in the surrounding urban areas. Focusing on 'visual aspects' of plants, this study investigates the effects of fruit trees and shrubs on the environment they are planted in terms of the visual quality of these places in urban areas during spring. The results of the study show that fruit trees and shrubs considerably increase the visual quality of the urban landscape they are in. The study also makes further suggestions on the use of fruit trees and shrubs in planting design studies by highlighting the characteristics of these plants as the important components of green areas, especially in urban areas.

AB  - Townsend's big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii, is distributed broadly across western North America and in two isolated, endangered populations in central and eastern United States. There are five subspecies of C. townsendii; C. t. pallescens, C. t. australis, C. t. townsendii, C. t. ingens, and C. t. virginianus with varying degrees of concern over the conservation status of each. The aim of this study was to use mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA data to examine genetic diversity, population differentiation, and dispersal of three C. townsendii subspecies. C. t. virginianus is found in isolated populations in the eastern United States and was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1979. Concern also exists about declining populations of two western subspecies, C. t. pallescens and C. t. townsendii. Using a comparative approach, estimates of the genetic diversity within populations of the endangered subspecies, C. t. virginianus, were found to be significantly lower than within populations of the two western subspecies. Further, both classes of molecular markers revealed significant differentiation among regional populations of C. t. virginianus with most genetic diversity distributed among populations. Genetic diversity was not significantly different between C. t. townsendii and C. t. pallescens. Some populations of C. t. townsendii are not genetically differentiated from populations of C. t. pallescens in areas of sympatry. For the western subspecies gene flow appears to occur primarily through male dispersal. Finally, geographic regions representing significantly differentiated and genetically unique populations of C. townsendii virginianus are recognized as distinct evolutionary significant units.

AB  - The freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca (Saussure, 1858) is common throughout North America and is a popular organism for toxicity tests and assessment of an ecosystem's health. However, recent studies suggest that this "species" may actually be a number of closely related species, possibly with distinct habitat requirements. The region in and around Sudbury, Ontario, has many lakes recovering from acidification and metal contamination with Hyalella slowly recolonizing the area. Analyzing mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences, we find two major groups of Hyalella: one group associated with recolonization of the central, historically more contaminated set of lakes and a second group associated with the more distant, less impacted, lakes. Morphologically, these inner city amphipods are significantly larger than those observed in lakes farther away from the city. This study may provide a foundation for a better understanding of Hyalella species complex, as well as colonization routes, toxicological sensitivities, habitat requirements, and dispersal capabilities.

AB  - The ecological processes responsible for the spatial assemblages of breeding bird communities in urban landscapes are more and more investigated. Indeed, understanding these processes is imperative to plan relevant management policies. We investigated breeding bird communities on 67 patches in the suburbs of Paris, France. We examined the role of patch characteristics and geographic distance between patches in determining similarity between bird assemblages. To do this, we proposed a new Sorensen similarity index based on estimators of change in community composition taking into account the detection probability of species. The patch occupancy by sedentary and migratory species was also estimated to compare their sensitivity to urbanization. Patches close to each other supported more similar bird assemblages, suggesting an effect of the spatial distribution of patches on bird dispersal and a posteriori on local community composition. Accounting for spatial location of patches, bird assemblage similarity was related to the similarity of the surrounding level of urbanization but not to the similarity of patch size or to the similarity of patch vegetation. The mean estimated occupancy rate of sedentary species was higher than that of migratory species in the whole study area. While sedentary species occupied patches surrounded by both moderate and high levels of urbanization, migratory ones primarily occupied patches surrounded by moderate levels of urbanization. Human choices in degrees, styles, and extent of urbanization, including designation and design of patches within an urban matrix, affect the composition of local bird communities.

AB  - The Powerful Owl is an elusive species inhabiting the forests of mainland eastern Australia. Obtaining crucial information on aspects of their breeding behaviour and dispersal has proven extremely difficult, even though other aspects of their ecology are well studied. Here we use molecular methods to investigate the breeding behaviour and dispersal of the Powerful Owl in two different habitats: highly fragmented forest along the urban fringe and continuous forest. DNA profiles of Powerful Owls were obtained predominately from shed feathers collected opportunistically between 1995 and 2006. Seven breeding pairs of Powerful Owls were identified, from which shed feathers were collected during 2003, 2004 and 2005. By comparing DNA profiles, one pair of Owls was found to have occupied the same breeding site for 10 years (1995-2005). The dispersal or movements of five offspring from this pair was also determined to be either of two scenarios: ( 1) the juvenile moves from the natal territory; however, isn't breeding; and ( 2) the juvenile is recovered as part of a breeding pair. Two pairs of Owls breeding in the urban fringe habitat were closely related, but no incidences of extra-pair fertilisation were detected among pairs in either habitat. This study provides new information about the breeding behaviour and dispersal of the Powerful Owl, and shows the potential of using genetic data sourced from shed feathers for studying cryptic, rare or elusive species.

AB  - We propose a system to simulate, analyze and visualize occupant behavior in urban environments by combining parametric modeling and agent-based simulation. A procedurally generated 3D city model, with semantic information about the functions and behaviors of buildings, is automatically populated with artificial agents (i.e. pedestrians, cars, and public transport vehicles). In a simulation the built environment and the agents interact with each other. The system identifies empiric correlations between properties such as: functions of buildings and other urban elements, population density, utilization and capacity of the public transport network, and congestion effect on the street network. Practical applications include the assessment of a) bottlenecks, b) public transit efficiency, c) accessibility of amenities, d) quality of service of public transport and the traffic network, as well as e) the stress level and exhaustion of pedestrians. All these aspects ultimately relate to the quality of life within the given urban areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh comprise three hill districts that make up about 10% of the total land area and 90% of the total hill area of the country, making the area different from the rest of the country in environmental, demographic and farming aspects. A mountainous area, it is geographically part of Hindu Kush-Himalaya region and inhabited by 13 ethnic communities. The traditional slash-and-burn shifting cultivation locally known as jhum is the main farming system practiced by local ethnic communities. The jhum is a unique agro-ecosystem having distinct agrobiodiversity adapted only to the fragile hill ecosystem and maintained through these communities. Cultivated biodiversity in this jhum agro-ecosystem comprises of cereals, vegetables, oil plants, spices, condiments and culinary herbs, floricultural and medicinal plants. Farmers cultivate more than 40 species in the jhums. There also exists wide genetic diversity (more than 20 varieties/cultivars of rice) within the species. Besides the agrobiodiversity farmers also use about 50 wild plant species as food plants linked with food security. Combined with other factors such as shrinkage of community land, road network development and access to urban markets, the national policies have brought changes in land uses towards permanent farming like horticulture and tree farming, ultimately resulting in decreased jhum agrobiodiversity. This paper suggests some strategies for sustainable hill farming along with preservation of jhum agrobiodiversity from extinction. This 'framework strategy' includes: land use and conservation through landscape mosaics, sequential-spatial shifting cultivation of niche jhum crops, changing or improved fallow jhum management, domestication and conservation of niche crops through incentives, market promotion of niche products, sustainable trade of product and services, and restoration and revitalization of traditional community resource management system.

AB  - This paper examines recent developments in migration studies. It reviews literature related to the potential role of internal population movement in the occurrence of schistosomiasis in Brazil and modifies Prothero's typology of population movement for use in Brazil. This modified classification system may contribute to a better understanding of schistosome transmission as well as improved research and control programs. The results of this study indicate that population movement in Brazil primarily involves economically-motivated rural-urban and interregional movement. However, several movement patterns have become increasingly important in recent years as a result of changing socioeconomic and urbanisation dynamics. These patterns include urban-urban, intracity and urban-rural movement as well as the movement of environmental refugees and tourists. Little is known about the epidemiological significance of these patterns. This paper also highlights the role of social networks in the decision to migrate and to settle. Prothero's classic population movement typology categorises movement as either one-way migrations or circulations and examines them along spatial and temporal scales. However, the typology must be modified as epidemiological information about new patterns becomes available. This paper identifies areas that require further research and offers recommendations that can improve the measurement and spatial analysis of the relationship between population movement and schistosomiasis.

AB  - The magnetic properties of tree leaves may be used to delineate the abundance and dispersal of anthropogenic airborne particulate matter (PM) in urban environments. In the city of Rome, Italy, circulating vehicles are the main source of magnetic PM, already characterized as prevalently low-coercivity, magnetite-like particles. To further constrain the nature and origin of such magnetic particles, we carried out coupled field emission scanning electron microscopy and a variety of rock magnetic analyses on PM specimens from Quercus ilex leaves and from potential PM sources in circulating motor vehicles in Rome. Fe-rich particles are mostly 0.1-5 mm in size, with irregular shapes and moss-like surface. Particles from disk brakes and diesel and gasoline exhaust pipes show distinct compositional and magnetic hysteresis signatures, suggesting that the magnetic PM collected on tree leaves consists of a mixture of particle populations deriving mostly from the abrasion of disk brakes and, to a lesser extent, from fuel combustion residuals emitted by diesel and gasoline exhausts. The contribution of fine superparamagnetic particles to the overall magnetic assemblage has been evaluated with specific rock magnetic analyses. The combined magnetic and microtextural-compositional analyses provide an effective and original tool to characterize urban PM air pollution.

AB  - The peri-urban environment of Langwarrin, near Melbourne, Australia, was used to investigate relationships between local climate and timing of movements in land and waterbirds. From 1976 to 1997, three of 12 species (25%) significantly altered the timing of their arrival, four of 11 species (36%) altered the timing of their departure, and two of 13 (15%) altered the time of their peak abundance. For many species (68%) timing of seasonal movements was significantly correlated with climate, in particular the timing of arrival, peak abundance and for movement in autumn. Minimum temperature appeared to have a greater influence on timing of avian movements than maximum temperature, rainfall or the number of rain-days, and where rainfall or the number of rain-days appeared important it was generally in the season before movement. Although based on a period and location where little warming or drying was observed, the complexity of responses seen by these species indicates that it may not be straightforward to predict the timing of movements of individuals or populations in response to climatic shifts. Given climatic projections of more pronounced warming and drying of this region, this study highlights the need to monitor bird populations continually to determine if species respond predominantly to interannual variability in climate or to, as yet unknown, climatic thresholds.

AB  - The increase of urban areas has led to a fragmentation of habitats for many forest-living species. Man-made parks might be a solution, but they can also act as sinks that are unable to maintain themselves without immigration from natural areas. Alternatively, parks might act as true metapopulations with extinctions and colonizations. In both cases, we can expect genetic variation to be reduced in the parks compared to the natural habitat. A third alternative is that the parks have sufficient reproduction to maintain themselves. To test these hypotheses, we analysed the pattern of genetic variation in the great tit (Parus major) in 12 parks in central Barcelona, and in an adjacent forest population using microsatellites. Genetic variation was not lower in the parks compared to the forest population, but larger, and gene flow was higher from the town to the forest compared to vice versa. We found a significant genetic differentiation among the parks, with a structure that only partly reflected the geographic position of the parks. Relatedness among individuals within parks was higher than expected by chance, although we found no evidence of kin groups. Assignment tests suggest that some parks are acting as net donors of individuals to other parks. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 99, 9-19.

AB  - Simard, M.-J. and Benoit, D. L. 2010. Distribution and abundance of an allergenic weed, common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), in rural settings of southern Quebec, Canada. Can. J. Plant Set. 90: 549-557. Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is an important weed of urban and rural settings in eastern Canada. Where the species is abundant, its wind-dispersed pollen is responsible for most cases of allergic rhinitis or "hayfever" in August and September. Despite its adverse health effects, there is little information on the actual abundance or distribution of ragweed plants in rural settings. Ragweed surveys were therefore done in July and August (after herbicide application) in corn and soybean fields, field borders and along rural roadsides surrounding two cities in southern Quebec. Based on zero-inflated Poisson regression models, ragweed density averaged 4.1 plants m(-2) (Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu area) and 16.1 plants m(-2) (Salaberry-de-Valleyfield area) along roadsides. Ragweed density in field borders (1.3 plants m(-2)) and fields was lower than on roadsides. Conventionally tilled fields and fields where tillage was reduced had equivalent densities of ragweed. Ragweed abundance in fields was likely related to the efficacy of herbicides used in transgenic vs. conventional crops. Transgenic herbicide-resistant corn fields had higher ragweed densities than conventional fields (0.44 vs. 0.07 plants m(-2)), while herbicide-resistant soybean fields had lower densities than conventional fields (0.02 vs. 1.33 plants m(-2)). Field borders located closer to roadsides had slightly higher ragweed counts, while roadside densities did not depend on the proximity of a field entrance. This suggests that roadsides are currently potential sources of spread into fields more than the opposite. Further research on the pollen production and dispersal of these rural populations is needed.

AB  - We investigated the strategies which make possible the coexistence of two congeneric and relatively similar species that share habitat (Turdus leucomelas and Turdus rufiventris) in an urban forest fragment with araucarias. The parameters applied were average abundance, forest stratum used by birds, forest environments, morphological aspects, and diet between the species. These parameters were assessed through samplings with mist nets in the understory, verification of abundance using transects, and acquisition of regurgitation. The species showed similar patterns of occurrence in the surveyed environments exposed border, transition, and inner forest. There was a morphological overlap of 98.67 (Bray-Curtis index), andt a test of canonical variables (F-6,F-88=25.39; p < 0.01) pointed significant difference for a set of seven morphological variables. Although there is certain similarity between species, T rufiventris showed higher extreme values and higher morphological variation. The overlap of trophic niche was elevated (Ojk = 0.76) and the species were considered as generalists, with higher extent of trophic niche for T rufiventris. A competitive exclusion based on feeding is not quite evident. Yet, the consumed items diverged when analyzed for presence/absence, the minimum of morphological evidence and variation on the consumed resources may partially explain the coexistence. Segregation between environments and occupied forest strata was not clearly demonstrated, despite detectable when regarding interior and border of the forest fragment.

AB  - A city-wide wireless sewer sensor system becomes 'intelligent' by having adaptive manhole cover antennas. Hundred and fifty wireless sensor nodes have been developed and deployed to monitor the sewer flow and to reduce the frequency of the combined sewer overflow (CSO) during heavy storm runoff in a mid-sized city: South Bend, Indiana in the US. The challenge for the wireless designer is to design a radiator that operates below ground as well as to improve the communication performance of the wireless sensor system. In this study, the authors replace a conventional cast-iron manhole cover with a composite manhole cover to create a radiator which is not only mechanically strong but electrically functional. The electrical characteristics of the composite are analysed by finding the relative permittivity and loss tangent. In addition, the effect of adaptive antennas is demonstrated to be extremely useful in terms of the packet reception rate and received signal strength. Measured results indicate that angular diversity significantly enhances received signal strength and the packet reception rate in the presence of interferers. The slot diversity antenna designed herein increased packet reception rate by 52.8% in the fielded system, compared to a uniformly radiating dipole antenna in the azimuthal plane.

CP  - 4th International Conference on Cartography and GIS
AB  - This research was developed by the Laboratory of Cartography, Department of Geography, from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the use of high resolution images (IKONOS and Geoeye), for planimetric cartographic updating of the Fundao Island area. In the last six years, the island landscape was completely changed, with the building of new and large research centers, sensibly changing the urban landscape, as well as increasing the density of flotation population and an enormous intensification of vehicles traffic. These problems show the needs to be accomplished through a cartographic updating, practically year by year, once the most actualized cartographic support came from 1998, in 1:10.000 and 1:2.000 scales. The applied methodology started covering the surface island and surrounds with a control point network acquired by GNSS. The image orthorectification was accomplished with the points. Other points were used as check points of the georeferency. The results show that independent on the spatial resolution, for each different georeferencing models and control point distribution, different relative behaviors to the check points displacements occurred For each image type it was defined the best distribution to assist the updating process. With the use of those images, an updated map will be built for each time, showing the evolution of the urban landscape.

AB  - In this paper we document a historical example of high aesthetic valuation of one urban bird species the thrush nightingale (Luscima luscinia) in the late 19th century Helsinki capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland The species is famous for its territorial song that is mostly heard at night The urban thrush nightingales were widely praised and documented in contemporary newspapers For instance the birds of the Paisaniemi Park were mentioned in 1872 26 times in 11 different Finnish newspapers Even poetry dedicated to the birds was published The urban thrush nightingales of the Finnish capital had an impact on contemporary pioneers of animal welfare bird conservation and urban ecology Bird conservation movement organized as Spring Societies (later Sylvia Society) with thrush nightingale as one of its symbols probably had an impact on legal protection granted for nearly all Finnish passerine birds in 1898 Paradoxically aesthetic improvement of the urban park favoured by nightingales destroyed their habitat and the species disappeared for this and other reasons from the capital for several decades (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - The subject of this paper is the representation of archaeological data at Pompeii by using GIS technology. The evolution of the original basic pattern of many domestic spaces (cubicula or entire dwellings) from the Samnite period to AD 79 in Regiones V (insulae V, 3 and V, 4) and VI (insulae VI, 7 and VI, 14) let us understand that they were transformed by adapting to the changes that occurred during the history of the ancient site, where building activities intensely affected the urban arrangement until the final destruction of the city in AD 79. Spatial analyses and predictive models, performed by combining excavation data and architectural studies, provide a very wide and complex range of information, such as layers of chronological phases or patterns of distribution trends, as well as 3D modeling to obtain precise and realistic 3D representations of wall-structures and the terrain (DTM). In this case study, GIS helps us understand the formation process of archaeological stratigraphy which is a result of the changes which took place during the history of the ancient site. Very different from the usual approach of intra-site GIS for archaeological excavations, this type of analysis arises from a broader perspective of the ancient urban landscape and of all those features useful for the spatial and conceptual definition of "neighbourhoods" in relation to the street network, as parsed through geoprocessing functions. The analysis conducted confirms that the distribution of architectural spaces and the evolution of the urban landscape in these cityblocks imply a close relationship with social and economic pressures. It is important to stress the value of a GIS integrated approach in the process of interpretation of an archaeological context, especially in terms of accuracy and of usability of the results for the management of a Cultural Heritage resource.

AB  - Thousands of settlements stippled the third millennium B. C. landscape of Pakistan and northwest India. These communities maintained an extensive exchange network that spanned West and South Asia. They shared remarkably consistent symbolic and ideological systems despite a vast territory, including an undeciphered script, standardized weights, measures, sanitation and subsistence systems, and settlement planning. The city of Harappa (3300-1300 B.C.) sits at the center of this Indus River Valley Civilization. The relatively large skeletal collection from Harappa offers an opportunity to examine biocultural aspects of urban life and its decline in South Asian prehistory. This paper compares evidence for cranial trauma among burial populations at Harappa through time to assess the hypothesis that Indus state formation occurred as a peaceful heterarchy. The prevalence and patterning of cranial injuries, combined with striking differences in mortuary treatment and demography among the three burial areas indicate interpersonal violence in Harappan society was structured along lines of gender and community membership. The results support a relationship at Harappa among urbanization, access to resources, social differentiation, and risk of interpersonal violence. Further, the results contradict the dehumanizing, unrealistic myth of the Indus Civilization as an exceptionally peaceful prehistoric urban civilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In flowering plants, pollen dispersal is often the major contributing component to gene flow, hence a key parameter in conservation genetics and population biology. A cost-effective method to assess pollen dispersal consists of monitoring the dispersal of fluorescent dyes used as pollen analogues. However, few comparisons between dye dispersal and realized pollen dispersal have been performed to validate the method. We investigated pollen dispersal in two small populations of the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior from urban forest fragments using direct (paternity analyses based on microsatellite DNA markers) and indirect (fluorescent dyes) methods. We compared these methods using two approaches, testing for the difference between the distance distributions of observed dispersal events and estimating parameters of a dispersal model, and related these results to dye dispersal patterns in three large populations. Dye and realized (based on paternity inference) pollen dispersal showed exponential decay distributions, with 74.2-94.8% of the depositions occurring at < 50 m and a few longer distance dispersal events (up to 151 m). No significant difference in curve shape was found between dye and realized pollen dispersal distributions. The best-fitting parameters characterizing the dye dispersal model were consistent with those obtained for realized pollen dispersal. Hence, the fluorescent dye method may be considered as reliable to infer realized pollen dispersal for forest herbs such as P. elatior. However, our simulations reveal that large sample sizes are needed to detect moderate differences between dye and realized pollen dispersal patterns because the estimation of dispersal parameters suffers low precision.

KW  - Langa
KW  - Garden City Movement
AB  - Langa, Cape Town's oldest black African township, was initially designed as a Garden Suburb aimed at re-housing residents of Ndabeni, Cape Town's first 'location'. Itsfailure - its lack of a bucolic English village aesthetic and socio-spatial structure - is significant because it lays bare the wistful ambitions at the heart of the Garden City to use the romanticised image of the English village to 'uplift' social 'others'. At the same time its lack of picturesque motifs reveals the implementation of a socio-spatial ordering strategy aimed at resolving class contradictions and tensions that the Garden City Movement's bucolic imagery tended to veil. The underlying modernist impulse for control and socio-spatial order had also manifested itself in Ndabeni - the 'native' location that preceded Langa - but most significantly in the master plan of Langa itself with its 'native'administration centre occupying the 'central square', a typical motif of Garden City Movement planning. Furthermore, the ambivalent attitude towards class at the heart of the egalitarian - yet paternalistic - Garden City Movement, and, the difficulty the colonial administrators and architects had indefining and categorising black Africans in the city of Cape Town, is also apparent in the various types of accommodation that were imagined and implemented at Langa. The colonial context of Langa, thus, defines it as an extra ordinary Garden Suburb, and yet, in its clear manifestation of social-spatial order - stripped bare of bucolic imagery - it can be understood essentially as an 'ordinary' Garden Suburb.

AB  - The Occupy encampments erupting around the world in Fall and Winter of 2011 developed into local platforms where activists from different milieus came together and forged relations and shared understandings. While Occupy protests broke out around the world in a synchronized fashion and used similar symbols and narratives, the protests were sustained by quite different local networks in different cities. We argue that the abilities of local Occupy movements to cope with challenges and magnify their resonance in the public sphere largely depended on how they were connected to local activist networks. We provide a political geography of Occupy and show how local networks in Amsterdam and Los Angeles shaped the global movement. Occupy activists were able to connect to some of the more prominent elements of Los Angeles' local activist networks and effectively formulated claims, but Occupy activists in Amsterdam were isolated and lost public support. The aims of the essay are twofold: first, to explain these divergent outcomes and second, to assess the effects of these outcomes in shaping the sustainability of Occupy struggles in these cities over the medium term.

AB  - The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum) has not yet recolonized natural cliff sites in Illinois and much of the lower Midwestern US, and remains restricted to urban areas. We constructed a landscape-linked population viability analysis using RAMAS/GIS software to compare possible reintroduction strategies for the species. Habitat-specific (i.e. cliff and urban) demographic parameters such as survival, fecundity, and dispersal rates were derived from the Midwest Peregrine Society Database for peregrines in the central Mississippi River region during 1982-2006. We simulated a base scenario of no reintroduction and 18 models of reintroduction with varying cohort sizes, supplementation schedules, and number of reintroduction sites, and used the Lake Superior population to test our model. Our analysis indicated that even without reintroductions in Illinois, the peregrine population in the lower Midwestern region is slowly increasing and is not likely to go extinct. Recolonization of cliff sites in southern Illinois likely will occur via dispersal from urban populations, however further research on dispersal rates between urban areas and cliffs is needed. Analysis indicated that the most cost-effective reintroduction strategy would be priced at approximately $280,000 and would result in only two additional breeding pairs compared to the no-action scenario. Thus, funds would be more effectively used in other management efforts such as habitat preservation. This study provides an example of how post-release monitoring can be used to inform future reintroduction plans. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Invasions are common in coastal marine environments where proximity to urban areas should influence the number of non-native organisms due to the likelihood of unintentional introductions from urban centers. Invasive species are widely recognised as important agents of global change, and can colonize new habitats and even cause local extinction of native species. This study was focused on the invasive marine macroalga Sargassum muticum, a problematic invasive species on the West coast of America and in European waters. An intensive survey was carried out along the Galician coast (North West of Spain) from March to August 2008 to determine the current distribution of this species, and its relationship with level of urbanization and native macroalgal diversity. We sampled the presence of S. muticum and native macroalgae in the mid and low intertidal zones of twenty rocky shores distributed along ten rias. Rias were grouped into high and scarcely urbanized based on their population density. Results indicated that S. muticum was present in nine out of the ten rias, confirming its presence in most of the intertidal rocky shores of Galicia twenty years after it was first observed. The presence of S. muticum was not related to the degree of urbanization of the rias, and its distribution and abundance did not seem to be influenced by diversity or functional groups of native algae. In addition, there was a great variability in the percentage cover, number and length of individuals amongst localities and rias suggesting that both large-scale and local processes may play a role in the distribution of this species.

AB  - In recent years, citizen participation in urban planning and management has experienced a further expansion in Spain. This is due to legal changes which favor their incorporation into urban planning agenda, and the interest of public authorities to develop participatory processes in the field of urbanism. The proliferation of these experiences of participation has generated a wide casuistry with very different results. However, studies on citizen participation only address this variation, focusing almost exclusively on the discussion about the goodness of incorporating the participation, without addressing the diversity of substantive performance of it. In this article, I propose to discuss this issue focusing on the results of a research on citizen participation in the urban regeneration policies of Madrid and Barcelona.

AB  - Recent reviews have suggested a vibrancy and diversity in transport geography. But these articles were the first progress reports on transport geography since 1988, indicating how the field has been relatively marginal to broader disciplinary debates. Meanwhile, a lively literature on mobilities has developed. In these contexts and as a supplement to the recent progress reports, a review of otherwise largely distinct fields reminds us how transport as a critical component of inquiry in geography is frequently taken for granted. We invite a re-engagement with transport and transport geography that opens fresh tracks for human geography.

AB  - Golf courses are often considered to be chemical-intensive ecosystems with negative impacts on fauna. Here we provide evidence that golf courses can contribute to the support and conservation of wetland fauna, i.e., amphibians and macroinvertebrates. Comparisons of amphibian occurrence, diversity of macroinvetebrates, and occurrence of species of conservation concern were made between permanent freshwater ponds surveyed on golf courses around Sweden's capital city, Stockholm, and off-course ponds in nature-protected areas and residential parklands. A total of 71 macroinvertebrate species were recorded in the field study, with no significant difference between golf course ponds and off-course ponds at the species, genus, or family levels. A within-group similarities test showed that golf course ponds have a more homogenous species composition than ponds in nature-protected areas and ponds in residential parkland. Within the macroinvertebrate group, a total of 11 species of odonates were identified, with no difference detected between the categories of ponds, nor any spatial autocorrelation. Significant differences were found between pond categories in the occurrence of five species of amphibians, although anuran occurrence did not differ between ponds. The great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) was significantly associated with golf course ponds, but the smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris) was not. We found no evidence of any correlation between pond size and occurrence of amphibians. Among the taxa of conservation concern included in the sample, all amphibians are nationally protected in Sweden, with the internationally threatened T. cristatus more frequently found in golf course ponds. Among macroinveterbrates of conservation status, the large white-faced darter dragonfly (Leucorrhinia pectoralis) was only detected in golf course ponds, and Tricholeiochiton fagesi (Trichoptera) was only found in one off-course pond. GIS results revealed that golf courses provide over a quarter of all available permanent, freshwater ponds in central greater Stockholm. We assert that golf courses have the potential to contribute to wetland fauna support, particularly in urban settings where they may significantly contribute to wetland creation. We propose a greater involvement of ecologists in the design of golf courses to further bolster this potential.

AB  - This paper provides a novel practical method for analyzing an anti-seismic reinforcement (ASR) problem involving hundreds of transportation facilities on an urban road network subject to multiple earthquake risks. The relevant properties of the present method are: (i) it evaluates the performance of an ASR strategy, taking into account traffic congestion and travelers' trip-making or route-choice behavior; (ii) it estimates the realistic damage patterns on the road network and their occurrence probabilities on the basis of recent advances in structural and earthquake engineering; (iii) it has clear, sensible logic and includes neither a black-box nor a "lottery" in the necessary procedures. We examine the computational efficiency and whether the present method is reasonable by applying it to a test scenario of the Kobe urban and suburban area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biological invasions usually start with a small number of founder individuals. These founders are likely to represent a small fraction of the total genetic diversity found in the source population. Our study set out to trace genetically the geographical origin of the horse-chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, an invasive microlepidopteran whose area of origin is still unkown. Since its discovery in Macedonia 25 years ago, this insect has experienced an explosive westward range expansion, progressively colonizing all of Central and Western Europe. We used cytochrome oxidase I sequences (DNA barcode fragment) and a set of six polymorphic microsatellites to assess the genetic variability of C. ohridella populations, and to test the hypothesis that C. ohridella derives from the southern Balkans (Albania, Macedonia and Greece). Analysis of mtDNA of 486 individuals from 88 localities allowed us to identify 25 geographically structured haplotypes. In addition, 480 individuals from 16 populations from Europe and the southern Balkans were genotyped for 6 polymorphic microsatellite loci. High haplotype diversity and low measures of nucleotide diversities including a significantly negative Tajima's D indicate that C. ohridella has experienced rapid population expansion during its dispersal across Europe. Both mtDNA and microsatellites show a reduction in genetic diversity of C. ohridella populations sampled from artificial habitats (e.g. planted trees in public parks, gardens, along roads in urban or sub-urban areas) across Europe compared with C. ohridella sampled in natural stands of horse-chestnuts in the southern Balkans. These findings suggest that European populations of C. ohridella may indeed derive from the southern Balkans.

AB  - Translocating prairie dogs from areas in or near human developments to wildlands can reduce conflicts with humans or supplement wild populations, but translocation methods differ in cost and fate of translocated individuals is often difficult to assess. We translocated 74 Gunnison's prairie dogs from 1 source colony in downtown Flagstaff, Arizona (urban) and 75 from 1 source colony in lower density housing outside the city (suburban) to 2 abandoned, recipient colonies on open grasslands 50 km north of the city (wildland). We released animals into uncaged, pre-existing burrow entrances (hard release) or into temporary cages over pre-existing burrow entrances (soft release). We captured 15 (10%) marked animals 1 year post-translocation at the 2 recipient colonies, 7 from soft release treatments and 8 from hard release treatments but visual surveys indicated a minimum of 57 adult prairie dogs and 76 pups present. Adult prairie dogs in all photographs taken by automated cameras placed at burrow entrances at each recipient colony had ear tags, suggesting that most animals at these colonies were survivors from translocation and that survival was likely higher than 10%. By 1 year post-release, recipient colonies occupied an area roughly 918 times that of source colonies. Urban Gunnison's prairie dogs can be successfully translocated to abandoned wildland colonies without using soft release methods, but animals may disperse widely. Given the cost and effort translocation requires, and the fact that all 6 confirmed mortalities were from human shooting, we recommend temporary restrictions on shooting at recipient colonies until populations have met management goals.

AB  - Anticoagulant poisoning is a common rodent control method in urban areas, but rodents may exhibit versatile feeding behavioural habits in varying environmental conditions. This study has been conducted to determine those environmental factors that could directly influence bait consumption and which therefore may affect an urban rodent control plan carried out with chemical methods. In the city of Bologna (Italy), 2500 bait stations have been monitored in various urban biotopes and the bait consumption studied in relation to several environmental factors, using both bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results reveal that the rodent patch distribution triggers the avoidance of baits placed outside of their home-range, hence the importance on bait placement. The logistic regression model confirms that vegetation, harbourage and water supplies are important variables in determining bait consumption, probably because they may spatially and temporarily facilitate the agoraphobic rodent movement, ensuring undisturbed bait consumption. The role of predators (dogs and cats) and food competitors (synanthropic birds) remains insignificant. However, bait eating invertebrates may consume part of the bait. For a proper rodent control plan the first real need is to minimize the alternative food sources, which may compete with baits. Weather conditions in which rodents could possibly pass unnoticed (fog and rainfall) may encourage bait consumption, vice versa with a cold climate. The considered environmental factors have satisfactorily explained bait consumption, highlighting the importance of human influence. The study of environmental factors may be useful in categorizing several site-specific conditions where rodent control efforts should be targeted, enhancing any intervention by matching the correct and specific strategy.

AB  - The RESRAD-RDD methodology was applied to model the short- and long-term radiation exposures after a hypothetical radiological dispersal device (RDD) event in an urban environment. It was assumed that an RDD event would result in outside surface contamination of the exterior walls and roofs of surrounding buildings, as well as associated paved areas and lawns. The contaminants also might move inside the buildings and deposit on floors and interior walls. Some important input parameters include occupancy factors, building characteristics, and weathering of surface contamination. The modeling results include predicted external dose rates, relative contributions from important surfaces, annual and cumulative doses, and radionuclide concentrations. Potential countermeasures evaluated include grass removal, soil removal, and washing of paved areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the increasing interest in biological invasions by earthworms which cause important changes in soils, biota and ecosystem processes after introduction, little is known about their history of colonisation. Population genetics tools may provide interesting insights into evolutionary processes occurring during an invasion phase; however a prerequisite is the knowledge of genetic variability within the native range of the species. The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic variation of a tropical peregrine earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus, in French Guiana, a region included within its native range. The clonal variability of this parthenogenetic species was assessed using 106 AFLP loci analysed in 113 individuals from five populations from the Nouragues reserve, in the Amazonian primary forest, and one population from the city of Cayenne. We found a higher level of genetic diversity in populations originating from the most disturbed sites, thus suggesting that dispersal events, probably linked to human activities, supplied these populations with migrants. Moreover, patterns of genetic differentiation between populations suggested accidental transfer of P corethrurus between Cayenne and the Nouragues reserve as well as between populations of the reserve. Altogether, our results highlighted that AFLPs are adequate molecular markers to trace back the history of colonisation by this species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The tree Cybistax antisyphilitica (ipe-verde) is widespread in the cerrado of the Brazilian Central Plateau, showing green flowers and dehiscent fruits with wind dispersed seeds. We studied the phenology of leaf fall, leaf flushing, flowering and fruiting in the urban area of Jatai city, Goias state. Seventeen trees were observed twice a month from May/2006 to January/2009. The trees showed high synchrony within each phenophases, and annual seasonal pattern. Leaf fall occurred in the dry season, followed by leaf flushing in late dry season. Flowering was concentrated in early wet season, soon after the vegetative events. Fruit dehiscence and dispersal of anemochoric seeds occurred at the end of dry season. Usually, events showed negative significant correlations with all environmental variables, both in the current month and up to two months prior to the event occurrence. This suggests a gradual increase in the leaf production, flowers and fruits associated with the decrease in rainfall, humidity and temperature. However, phylogenetic relationships and pollinators and dispersers interactions may also regulate the phenology of C. antisyphilitica.

AB  - There is an urgent need to thoroughly review and comprehend the effects of urbanization on wildlife in order to understand both the ecological implications of increasing urbanization and how to mitigate its threat to biodiversity globally. We examined patterns in comparative productivity of urban and non-urban passerine birds, using published estimates from paired comparisons, and by reviewing and developing explanations in terms of resources, competitors, predators and other specifically urban environmental factors. The most consistent patterns were for earlier lay dates, lower clutch size, lower nestling weight and lower productivity per nesting attempt in urban landscapes; these were supported by a formal meta-analysis. Nest failure rates did not show consistent patterns across the species considered. We suggest that food availability is a key driver of differences in passerine demography between landscapes. In urban habitats, human-provided food may improve adult condition over winter, leading to earlier lay dates and, in some species, to higher survival and higher breeding densities, but paucity of natural food may lead to lower productivity per nesting attempt. We demonstrate that additional comparative research is needed on a wider range of species, on the effects of natural and human-provided food availability, and on the differences in survival and dispersal between urban and non-urban populations. Importantly, better-targeted research and monitoring is needed in areas that are at greatest threat from urbanization, especially in the developing world.

TI  - CHRISTCHURCH CITY COUNCIL LIFELINES - PERFORMANCE OF CONCRETE POTABLE WATER RESERVOIRS IN THE FEBRUARY 2011 CHRISTCHURCH EARTHQUAKE
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE NEW ZEALAND SOCIETY FOR EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - On 22 February 2011 an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter Scale occurred in Christchurch City resulting in widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.
   Christchurch City Council (CCC) has an extensive potable water supply network including bulk storage and service reservoirs which provide water to approximately 320,000 residents. Inspections undertaken, following the 22 February earthquake, on 43 concrete reservoirs located on the Port Hills and Cashmere Hills areas noted varying extents of damage from nil through to major. Damaged roof to wall connections were observed in many reservoirs with damage to walls, base-slabs and internal columns limited to a few reservoirs only. Of the 43 reservoirs, complete functional failure occurred in only one, with reduced function and operation at other sites resulting from excessive leakage, necessity for emergency repairs, or associated pipe work damage. Those reservoirs currently out of operation for reinstatement, including Christchurch's largest, account for approximately 40% of the network's storage capacity.
   Overall, given the magnitude of earthquake accelerations that occurred on 22 February 2011, the reservoirs are considered to have performed remarkably well. Those in the Port Hills area nearest the earthquake epicentre, have expectedly, incurred the most damage.
   Reinstatement works, varying from minor crack injection and patch repair through to reconstruction and retrofit, have been developed appropriate to the extent of damage. CCC has prioritised reservoir repair to maximise available water supply for the 2011-2012 summer demand and this has required, in some instances, staging and deferring of reinstatement works.
   A summary of structural and functional performance, results of physical investigations and detailed seismic assessments, and common damage areas observed are presented in this paper along with the reinstatement options developed.

AB  - The Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) is a state-protected, threatened species in Texas. The expansion of agricultural practices and urban development are major causes of habitat degradation for the species. To provide genetic data that can inform conservation planning for this species, genetic variation, population structure, and the process that maintains the observed structure were examined in the Texas populations of G. berlandieri. Microsatellite genetic variation of 8 polymorphic loci was examined for a total of 138 individuals collected from 10 sampling areas in southern Texas. Assignment tests, F statistics, and analysis of molecular variance indicated that G. berlandieri forms weak population differentiation into northern and southern groups, with a boundary at southern Duval County. A test of isolation by distance and indirect estimation of the number of migrants (Nm) suggest recent gene flow between the 2 groups. Estimation of the extent of contemporary migration appears to be complicated by human translocation of tortoises, and an asymmetrical direction of migration needs further examination. Gopherus berlandieri is weakly differentiated because of ongoing migration as evidenced by a pattern of isolation by distance. Given the limited population structure and continuous habitat degradation, designation of 2 management units may not be warranted. Conservation efforts, rather, should emphasize connectivity between the groups to maintain genetic variation in both groups.

AB  - This paper discusses how food mapping was used to introduce Industrial Design and Landscape Architecture students to the important issues of food security and sustainability in urban design. It is based on the experiences of teachers and students in an undergraduate course, "Meals in Metropolis", at the RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Students were introduced to concepts such as localism, diversity, food security, resilience, innovation and integration. Three outcomes were produced; food chain maps, neighbourhood food maps, and redesign posters, which applied an ecological systems perspective to redesign current urban agriculture models of production. The paper has two outcomes: (1) the demonstrated uptake of new knowledge by the students and (2) the contribution of new knowledge to the Melbourne food movement. Together, these outcomes reveal an emerging landscape of innovative food production within Melbourne that could manifest into a more resilient, distributed urban food system.

AB  - Globalisation and the rise of East Asia have accelerated the migration of Chinese populations across the Asia-Pacific rim. Ethnic Chinese populations from highly diverse sub-ethnic, socio-economic and political backgrounds are increasingly aggregated in major cities throughout the region. Nonetheless, there remains insufficient attention to the implications of greater economic interdependence and accelerated population movement upon the political cultures of host nations such as Australia, especially in the context of ensuing spatial and economic concentrations of activity.
   Both articulate and interlocking relationships between political and economic fields exist in the metropolitan engagements of Chinese Australian community groups and associations. Many of these political dimensions extend into 'formal' modes of politics.
   Framed by urban regime theory and the broader notion of urban politics, this paper claims that network resource exchange within Chinese Australian communities are tied to ethnic economies, and in certain contexts global processes. These kinds of social dynamics have implications for the expression of diasporic Chinese affinity and constructions of Chineseness. Explorations of transnational political tensions, in fact, highlight the diversity and potential fragility of diasporic interdependence within ethnic Chinese communities - communities that are persistently refashioned through new waves of migration and from different points of origin.
   This paper seeks to advance these perspectives through a case study of a particular period of tension between two representative peak bodies in Brisbane, Queensland. Grounded in the testimony of elite political actors, it reflects upon the nature of ethnic Chinese community representation in contemporary Australia.

AB  - One widely asserted proposition is that land protection in a metropolitan region can contribute to a scarcity of housing by reducing the total housing stock. However, much land protection occurs on land that is less suitable for development, as slopes are too sleep or because the site is too wet. An alternate hypothesis is that development in lands with these characteristics would likely occur at a lower density, and contribute little to housing stock. This study examines these two competing hypotheses for the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area, known as the Silicon Valley. We mapped conservation and urban development in the study area from World War II to the present. We created a counterfactual map, using a regression-based model to examine a "what if" proposition - what would the density of development have been in currently preserved lands if they had been developed like other topographically-similar unprotected sites on the landscape? In our study area, there are currently 790 000 housing units. If conserved lands, which total 47 000 ha, were developed there would likely only be an additional 51 000 housing units. Most conserved land is either too wet to be developed or is of steep enough slope that housing density would likely be low. Our results suggest that land protection had a relatively minor role in limiting the total housing stock of the region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainability is a universal topic which has multidimensional effect on the environment and human life. Urban areas consume 75% of energy and produce the most greenhouse gases and pollution. The sustainability in urban built environment via improving efficiency in designing residential site and neighborhood, supports energy saving and pollution reduction. This paper tries to focus on distance to facilities to promote walkability in neighborhoods as the front line of sustainable movement in urban area. The study area is Subang Jaya Township in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with 155 neighborhoods. An empirical analysis was done to determine the factors that influence distance to facilities and daily necessary services in residential sites which support the increase of walkability and reduce car use and time used for accessibility to these services. The result shows density, land diversity, non residential land use, and employment influence the distance to facilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wildlife trade and emerging infectious diseases pose significant threats to human and animal health and global biodiversity. Legal and illegal trade in domestic and wild birds has played a significant role in the global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has killed more than 240 people, many millions of poultry, and an unknown number of wild birds and mammals, including endangered species, since 2003. This 2007 study provides evidence for a significant decline in the scale of the wild bird trade in Hanoi since previous surveys in 2000 (39.7% decline) and 2003 (74.1% decline). We attribute this to the enforcement of Vietnam's Law 169/2005/QD UBND, introduced in 2005, which prohibits the movement and sale of wild and ornamental birds in cities. Nevertheless, 91.3% (21/23) of bird vendors perceived no risk of H5N1 infection from their birds, and the trade continues, albeit at reduced levels, in open market shops. These findings highlight the importance of continued law enforcement to maintain this trade reduction and the associated benefits to human and animal health and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The history of trade in the Italian Colonial Region in the Northeast of the State of Rio Grande do Sul reflects the interests of economic classes in the occupation of the urban ground, and points out the conflicts existing in the city's urban history. Organizing trade around a strong association of traders assured the representation of their interests in the public sector to occupy space and build the town. Traders took advantage of favorable situations, driving urban growth, stimulating settlers to produce on a larger scale not only produce but also handicraft, being many processes the very origin of industries later. They invested their profit in real estate capital and, this way, were agents of change. The influence of the trader allied with his/her entrepreneurial spirit enabled the regulations of trade and colonies to grow economically, improving urban infrastructure, participating in the decisions to expand the town and, consequently, interfering in collective lives. The economic history of Caxias do Sul proves that the Traders Association followed closely everything respective to issues referring to the town's infrastructure and economic development. Since the beginning of the Association there was an organization movement of the business sector under the leadership of traders with the purpose to build a class representation to mediate the relationship among traders, industry people, public sector, and congenerous institutions existing in other municipalities.

AB  - The neotropical frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei (Anura: Eleutherodactylidae) has been referred to as a highly invasive species on grounds of its wide distribution and is expected to extend its range significantly based on recent climate model assumptions. The frog was introduced to a number of South American mainland localities, including French Guiana. Other species of the genus have become invasive on oceanic islands such as Hawaii where they pose serious biological and economical problems. No data are available on the invasion status of E. johnstonei populations from coastal South America. Here we present the first assessment of the status of a mainland population from French Guiana 10 years after the introduction of the species. We found that the species has not spread significantly within the last ten years and so far does not exhibit a high invasion potential. Frogs were restricted to urban garden habitats showing significantly higher abundance in gardens containing ornamental potted plants. Distribution patterns were best explained by two dispersal-related factors operating at different scales: (1) distance of occupied sites to nearest population indicating short-distance active dispersal using stepping stone habitats, and (2) distance of occupied sites to shore with a distinct bimodal pattern indicating long-distance passive or jump-dispersal, most likely due to the exchange or transfer of ornamental plants. Even though past and current invasion potential can be considered low, we advocate the implementation of a regional monitoring scheme and detailed studies on biotic interactions with native fauna.

AB  - The belief that it is fairer if communities are "mixed'' can be traced at least to the late nineteenth century and the founders of the Garden City Movement. The idea is now firmly established in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and national policies. This article reviews the evidence and argues that this is essentially a faith-based policy because there is scant real evidence that making communities more mixed makes the life chances of the poor any better. There is overwhelming evidence that the attributes that make neighborhoods attractive are capitalized into house prices/rents. The result is that poor people cannot afford to buy into nicer neighborhoods, which anyway have amenities of no value to them. Moreover, "specialized neighborhoods'' are an important element in agglomeration economies and seem to be welfare enhancing. Thus, policies for mixed neighborhoods treat the symptoms rather than the causes of poverty. Efforts to improve social equity would be more effectively directed toward people themselves rather than moving people around to mix neighborhoods.

AB  - The multiple-locus variable-number repeat analysis of 90 human Brucella melitensis isolates from a large urban area in central Peru revealed variations at 4 (Bruce07, Bruce09, Bruce18, and Bruce42) out of 16 loci investigated, of which 1 (Bruce42) also is used for species identification. Ten genotypes were identified, separated by the number of Bruce42 repeats into two groups that may have distinct phenotypic characteristics. Whereas genotypes with five or six Bruce42 repeats were cultured mainly from adult patients, genotypes with three Bruce42 repeats were isolated from children and young adolescents as well as from adults. In addition, the isolates with three Bruce42 repeats were obtained more often from patients with splenomegaly (P = 0.02) or hepatomegaly (P = 0.006). An annual variation in the diversity of genotypes was observed, possibly reflecting changes in sources of fresh dairy products, supply routes to city shops and markets, and the movement of infected dairy goat herds.

AB  - With expansion of urban areas worldwide, migrating songbirds increasingly encounter fragmented landscapes where habitat patches are embedded in an urban matrix, yet how migrating birds respond to urbanization is poorly understood. Our research evaluated the relative importance of patch-level effects and body condition to movement behaviour of songbirds during migratory stopover within an urban landscape. We experimentally relocated 91 migrant Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) fitted with 0.66 g radio-transmitters to seven forest patches that differed in area (0.7-38.4 ha) and degree of urbanization within central Ohio, USA, May 2004-2007. Fine-scale movement rate of thrushes (n = 55) did not differ among urban forest sites, but birds in low energetic condition moved at higher rates, indicating an energetically mediated influence on movement behaviour. In larger sites, Swainson's thrushes (n = 59) had greater coarse-level movement during the first 3 days and utilized areas farther from forest edge, indicating stronger influence by patch-level factors. Thrushes exhibited strong site tenacity, with only five individuals (7%) leaving release patches prior to migratory departure. Movement outside the release patch only occurred at the smallest forest patches (0.7 and 4.5 ha), suggesting that these sites were too small to meet needs of some individuals. Swainson's thrushes exhibited edge avoidance and apparent area sensitivity within urban forest patches during stopover, implying that conservation of larger patches within urban and other fragmented landscapes may benefit this species and other migrant forest birds.

AB  - Understanding population structure can lend insight into the spread of animal-borne disease, and the effects of anthropogenic land use on habitat. Raccoons are highly adaptive to human land development and can persist in a wide range of habitat types, making them ideal subjects for investigating the level of population structure in a highly fragmented area. A total of 323 raccoons were livetrapped from 7 locations encompassing 3 distinct habitat types (agriculture, urban forest preserves, and residential) across the Chicago metropolitan region (maximum distance between 2 sites was 128 km). Genetic analyses of 14 microsatellite loci indicate that although raccoon populations across the region share up to 50% of the allelic diversity, they segregated into at least 2 distinct subpopulations, dividing the Chicago metropolitan region into northern and southern groups with further structure occurring within these larger groups. Incorporating sample sites between the identified north south groups may provide greater resolution as to where this split occurs. Although there is evidence of population structure between all sample sites, migrant analysis suggests there is enough gene flow to preserve genetic diversity throughout the population.

AB  - The 2008 Beijing Olympic Games had a great impact on the tourism industry in Beijing, especially on tourism flows and movements. This study used content analysis and social network analysis methods to examine 500 online trip diaries and analyze overseas tourist movement patterns in Beijing during the Olympics. The result revealed that overseas tourists were most interested in famous traditional attractions, and their movements were focused in the central city area of Beijing. The study identified the diversity of tourist attractions and the expansion of main visiting areas as the two main changes during the Olympics. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), the Asian tiger mosquito, is an introduced invasive species in the United States that is responsible for a significant proportion of service requests to local mosquito control programs. This container utilizing mosquito is refractory to standard mosquito abatement measures in the United States. This study is part of a USDA-ARS project to develop an area-wide management strategy for Ae. albopictus. The goal was to identify three study sites, similar in socioeconomic parameters, geography and Ae. albopictus abundance, in urban and suburban areas in Mercer and Monmouth counties in New Jersey. Prior service requests and light trap counts and also detailed county maps were used to chose nine preliminary sites (four in Mercer and five in Monmouth) where weekly surveillance for Ae. albopictus was performed throughout the 2008 active season.
   RESULTS: Although outliers were detected, socioeconomic variables in the study sites within each county were fairly consistent. Ae. albopictus abundance was associated with poverty levels and had the highest maxima in Mercer, although average mosquito abundance was similar in urban Mercer and suburban Monmouth.
   CONCLUSION: Three study sites in each county were identified for future studies. The summer-long surveillance also revealed socioeconomic variables critical for the development of integrated mosquito management. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The process of socio-economic change, which started in Poland in 1989, began the series of modifications in the structure of Polish cities. These changes embrace the economic sphere and the social sphere, as well as the habitable environment. The changes occurring in Polish cities resemble the processes present in settlement systems in highly developed countries. They take place, however, with some delay which is caused by the movement from the centrally controlled economy to the market economy and all the problems associated with it.
   The aim of the presented article is to show the influence of occurring changes on the socio-economic development and demographic situation apparent in small towns of the Wroclaw Metropolitan Area (WrMA). The attempt of evaluation of factors promoting the development was undertaken. The value of chosen characteristics was analyzed for the set of small towns of Dolnoslaskie voivodship. The analysis of chosen quantities common for demographic phenomena in a longer time cross-section (1995-2008) pinpoints the irregularity of development of specific towns, which may result in negative effects for the whole area in the future.

AB  - Housing and services for persons with developmental disabilities (1313) have been shaped by the normalization approach, a commitment to full integration within the general community. In contrast, housing and services for persons with psychiatric disabilities (PD) have had various and sometimes conflicting goals, including provision of custodial care, promotion of therapeutic community, and community integration. This cross-field study compares the neighborhood characteristics of publicly-funded housing for the PD and DD populations in a metropolitan community. The aim of the study was to examine whether the contrasting housing approaches are reflected at an ecological level and to consider how these findings relate to the goal of community integration for people with PD and DD. Administrative databases provided residential addresses of 1932 residents with PD living in 297 locations and 1716 residents with DID living in 749 locations in the city of Philadelphia. The 2000 U.S. Census and city's police department database provided information on neighborhood characteristics. Geographic information system (GIS) methodology generated maps displaying the distribution of housing locations in relation to spatial dispersion, distress, stability, safety, and race/ethnic diversity. Statistical analyses compared neighborhood characteristics of the DID and PD populations. Findings indicated that the DID population in supportive housing was more spatially dispersed, and lived in less distressed, less unstable, more secure, but equally racially/ethnically diverse neighborhoods when compared to the PD population in supportive housing.
   Greater geographic dispersal among persons with DID may be the result of more emphasis on normalization within policies and programs determining the location of their housing. The higher funding levels for housing and residential support for persons with DID also provided programs with the option of placing people in higher income neighborhoods. Given that community integration has emerged as an organizing principle within mental health services over other models, policymakers in the field of psychiatric disabilities may have much to learn from the normalization movement for people with developmental disabilities.

AB  - Species vary in abundance and heterogeneity of spatial distribution, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such variability are poorly known. Evolutionary adaptation to heterogeneously distributed resources may arise from local adaptation with individuals of such locally adapted populations rarely dispersing long distances and hence having small populations and small overall ranges. We quantified mean population density and spatial heterogeneity in population density of 197 bird species across 12 similarly sized regions in the Western Palearctic. Variance in population density among regions differed significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting that random processes cannot explain the observed patterns. National estimates of means and variances in population density were positively correlated with continental estimates, suggesting that means and variances were maintained across spatial scales. We used Morisita's index of population abundance as an estimate of heterogeneity in distribution among regions to test a number of predictions. Heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species as reflected by Morisita's index had small populations, low population densities, and small breeding ranges. Their breeding populations had been consistently maintained at low levels for considerable periods of time, because the degree of genetic variation in a subsample of non-passerines and passerines was significantly negatively related to heterogeneity in distribution. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species were not more often habitat specialists than homogeneously distributed species. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed passerine species had high annual adult survival rates but did not differ in annual fecundity from homogeneously distributed species. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species rarely colonized urban habitats. Finally, homogeneously distributed bird species were hosts to a greater diversity of blood parasite species than heterogeneously distributed species. In conclusion, small breeding ranges, population sizes, and population densities of heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species, combined with their low degree of genetic variability, and their inability to colonize urban areas may render such species particularly susceptible to human-influenced global climatic changes.

AB  - Background: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, experienced a severe dengue fever epidemic in 2008. This was the worst epidemic ever, characterized by a sharp increase in case-fatality rate, mainly among younger individuals. A combination of factors, such as climate, mosquito abundance, buildup of the susceptible population, or viral evolution, could explain the severity of this epidemic. The main objective of this study is to model the spatial patterns of dengue seroprevalence in three neighborhoods with different socioeconomic profiles in Rio de Janeiro. As blood sampling coincided with the peak of dengue transmission, we were also able to identify recent dengue infections and visually relate them to Aedes aegypti spatial distribution abundance. We analyzed individual and spatial factors associated with seroprevalence using Generalized Additive Model (GAM).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Three neighborhoods were investigated: a central urban neighborhood, and two isolated areas characterized as a slum and a suburban area. Weekly mosquito collections started in September 2006 and continued until March 2008. In each study area, 40 adult traps and 40 egg traps were installed in a random sample of premises, and two infestation indexes calculated: mean adult density and mean egg density. Sera from individuals living in the three neighborhoods were collected before the 2008 epidemic (July through November 2007) and during the epidemic (February through April 2008). Sera were tested for DENV-reactive IgM, IgG, Nested RT-PCR, and Real Time RT-PCR. From the before-after epidemics paired data, we described seroprevalence, recent dengue infections (asymptomatic or not), and seroconversion. Recent dengue infection varied from 1.3% to 14.1% among study areas. The highest IgM seropositivity occurred in the slum, where mosquito abundance was the lowest, but household conditions were the best for promoting contact between hosts and vectors. By fitting spatial GAM we found dengue seroprevalence hotspots located at the entrances of the two isolated communities, which are commercial activity areas with high human movement. No association between recent dengue infection and household's high mosquito abundance was observed in this sample.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study contributes to better understanding the dynamics of dengue in Rio de Janeiro by assessing the relationship between dengue seroprevalence, recent dengue infection, and vector density. In conclusion, the variation in spatial seroprevalence patterns inside the neighborhoods, with significantly higher risk patches close to the areas with large human movement, suggests that humans may be responsible for virus inflow to small neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro. Surveillance guidelines should be further discussed, considering these findings, particularly the spatial patterns for both human and mosquito populations.

AB  - The concentration of airborne Didymella spores has been investigated at two monitoring sites situated along the west-south transect in Poland (Szczecin, Krakow), i.e. from a height of 100 to 219 m, respectively, above sea level. The aerobiological monitoring of fungal spores was performed by means of two Lanzoni volumetric spore traps. The high Didymella spore numbers were observed at both cities in June, July and August. Statistically significant correlations have been found mainly between the Didymella spore concentrations in the air and the minimum air temperature and relative air humidity. The spore count of Didymella is determined by the diversity of local flora and weather conditions, especially by the relative air humidity. The identification of factors that influence and shape spore concentrations may significantly improve the current methods of allergy prevention.

AB  - Broad-acre subdivisions constitute an increasing form of residential development known as exurbia. Despite significant impacts on biodiversity, exurbia is critically understudied in Australia. Exurban developments are distributed non-uniformly around city margins and are typically clustered adjacent to desirable landscape elements, such as forests and water. Forested peninsulas are thus popular sites for exurban development. Developments on these relatively insular regions have the potential to reduce local populations of species with limited dispersal capabilities and an aversion to exurbia. Two exurban regions of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, one a peninsula and one inland, were surveyed for flightless mammals using spotlight observations and a survey of landowners. The frequencies of mammals within exurbia were compared with their frequencies in wildlands and tested against life history traits. Within the exurbanised peninsula, there were disproportionately fewer individuals of species with large home range sizes. Overall, two very fecund species, including a threatened native bandicoot, Perameles were more frequent in exurbia than in wildlands. We cannot conclude that any of female body mass, female home range size and fecundity can provide consistently strong predictions of the likelihood of negative or positive effects of urbanisation, but we can conclude that each of these variables can be predictive within particular regional and faunal contexts. We suggest that, until further information is gained, planners could use fecundity as a predictor of mammal survival in exurbia, except where the exurban area is isolated from other areas that contain native vegetation, in which case, female home range negatively predicts survival.

AB  - The shift from an industrial to an information society has changed consumption as we know it. The need to consume has been replaced by the desire to do so. The changes have also occurred in urban transportation, where the private car usage has risen to new heights all around the world. These changes have revolutionised the places and modes of consumption. Personal, highly specialised small corner shops are being replaced by large shopping centres on the fringes of post-industrial cities. A. survey we conducted at Lounakeskus, one of the biggest shopping centres in Tartu, Estonia, had a goal to find out the moving habits and analyze the traffic patterns created by the customers. The results show that a majority of shoppers access the shopping centre by car. The customers themselves show great variety according to their social background, making the shopping centre truly "a place for everybody". The majority of the customers visit the centre approximately 2-3 times a week and some important differences occur between the in-week and the weekend customers. The distance dependence occurring between the region of living and the modal split seemed to have reliance on the mode of living - the car usage was at its maximum in the low-density suburban regions in the transition zone, while the bus was used much more frequently in the more distant periphery zone of high density apartment blocks. The urban fringe shopping centres are still a relatively new sight in the landscape of Tartu, while Lounakeskus was opened in 2001 as the first big shopping centre in south Estonia.

AB  - Determining what factors explain the distribution of non-native invasive plants that can spread in forest-dominated landscapes could advance understanding of the invasion process and identify forest areas most susceptible to invasion. We conducted roadside surveys to determine the presence and abundance of 15 non-native plant species known to invade forests in western North Carolina, USA. Generalized linear models were used to examine how contemporary and historic land use, landscape context, and topography influenced presence and abundance of the species at local and regional scales. The most commonly encountered species were Microstegium vimineum, Rosa multiflora, Lonicera japonica, Celastrus orbiculatus, Ligustrum sinense, and Dioscorea oppositifolia. At the regional scale, distance to city center was the most important explanatory variable, with species more likely present and more abundant in watersheds closer to Asheville, NC. Many focal species were also more common in watersheds at lower elevation and with less forest cover. At the local scale, elevation was important for explaining the species' presence, but forest cover and land-use history were more important for explaining their abundance. In general, species were more common in plots with less forest cover and more area reforested since the 1940s. Our results underscore the importance of considering both the contemporary landscape and historic land use to understand plant invasion in forest-dominated landscapes.

AB  - The main goal of the study was to obtain field data to build a baseline of fish assemblage composition that can be used comparatively for future analyses of the impact of human actions in the region. A basic network of 68 sampling stations was defined for the entire region (4 050 km(2)). F ish assemblage species and size composition was estimated using visual census methods at three different spatial scales: a) entire region, b) inside the main reef area and c) along a human impact coastal gradient. Multivariate numerical analyses revealed habitat type as the main factor inducing spatial variability of fish community composition, while the level of human impact appears to play the main role in fish assemblage composition changes along the coast. A trend of decreasing fish size toward the east supports the theory of more severe human impact due to overfishing and higher urban pollution in that direction. This is the first detailed study along the northwest coast of Cuba that focuses on fish community structure and the natural and human-induced variations at different spatial scales for the entire NW shelf. This research also provides input for a more comprehensive understanding of coastal marine fish communities' status in the Gulf of Mexico basin. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (3): 721-740.

AB  - The arundo wasp, Tetramesa romana Walker, has been permitted as a biological control agent for the invasive perennial grass, the giant reed, Arundo donax L. Evidence of adventive populations of the arundo wasp in the Lower Rio Grande Basin was confirmed with a spatio-temporal survey spanning more than 350 river miles. A total of 2,414 adult females of T. romana was collected during a 14-month period of study in 2008-2009. This study documents the initial locations and regional expansion of two adventive populations of T romana, centered around the cities of Eagle Pass and Laredo, TX. Peaks in T romana abundance in August 2008 and June 2009 indicate a region-wide positive association between abundance of T romana and warm summer temperatures. Correlations between site-specific abundance data and weather suggest the presence of population-specific associations with both temperature and rainfall.

AB  - In this paper, a modelling framework to complete the recent scientific works on urban goods modelling is proposed. More precisely, we introduce a substitution procedure that estimates the number of trips and the corresponding travelled distances for shopping drive, home delivery and reception points' strategies. Moreover, an appraisal of scenarios is proposed in order to study how these three new forms of proximity delivery services impact on the overall urban goods movement distribution. Starting from four extreme situations, we introduce more realistic scenarios in order to find a suitable combination of delivery strategies. All the scenarios are simulated using the proposed framework, and the main traffic issues related to e-commerce distribution channel are discussed. The best realistic combination promotes the joint usage of home deliveries and proximity reception points and allows a reduction of about 13% of the road occupancy rates in urban areas.

AB  - Deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) are the primary source of mortality for the endangered Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium). Of these collisions, >50% occur on United States Highway 1 (US 1), the primary roadway connecting the islands in the Florida Keys, USA. The DVCs on the 5.6-km section of US 1 on Big Pine Key are responsible for approximately 26% of annual Key deer mortality, but extensive urban development along this highway segment complicates efforts to reduce DVCs using traditional methods (e.g., fencing, underpasses). In 2002, a continuous 2.6-km system of 2.4-m fencing, 2 underpasses, and 4 experimental deer guards was completed. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of these highway improvements in reducing DVCs within an urban landscape. Deer used the underpasses all 7 postconstruction years (2003-2009) with dramatic increases in use over the course of the project. Roadway fencing largely eliminated deer intrusion onto the fenced area of US 1. Although well-maintained fencing effectively restricted deer movement onto the fenced section of US 1 (73-100% decline), other sections of US 1 experienced increases in DVCs. Overall, highway improvements along the US 1 corridor were effective in reducing Key deer mortality over the long-term. The success of deer guards in preventing deer access into the fenced section of US 1 supported the feasibility of implementing similar wildlife exclusion projects in other urban areas.

AB  - Most academic publications refer to Parkour as a subversive and embodied tactic that challenges hegemonic discourses of discipline and control. Architecture becomes the playful ground where new ways to move take form. These approaches rarely address the material and embodied relations that occur in these practices and remain on the discursive plane of cultural signifiers. A theory of movement between bodies as the founding aspect of Parkour unfolds alternative concepts of body, space, time and movement beyond the discursive. Movement becomes the leitmotif for a re-conceptualization of the relations between subjects and objects and abandons their division. With the example of Parkour, I will challenge anthropocentric approaches toward embodiment and instead foreground open-ended shifting configurations of places and their relation to movement. Parkour re-shapes rigid concepts of places and their human encounter through movement. Through its encounter with obstacles Parkour activates the silent potential for movement located in the relation between bodies and thus reaches beyond material boundaries (e.g., a wall). As a deterritorializing practice, I will use Parkour to re-consider the relations between different bodies such as architectural configurations, subjects and their urban ecologies to develop a relational model for

AB  - The term of the restructuring productive of capital is a reference to tune the changes that are occurring I the scope of labor, which since the late 1980s orients new expression lines of social conflict. The classic format capital x labor divides importance with other forms of configuration of class domination, that means new looks on the delimitations of what is working in the field (salaried, peasant), and what is working in the city (salaried, self-employed, outsourced, informal etc.), under different social relations of production and labor. The continuous flow of these relations is that indicate changes in the profile of the peasants, redefinitions the ranks of the urban and rural workers and, therefore, the plasticity that affecting hard the labor in way of consequence changes in/of social roles and political-ideological, reach and contextualize the degradation and territorial movement class the working class.

AB  - We conducted a historical (40 y) floristic assessment of a small (4 km(2)) park in eastern Canada (Bonaventure Island National Park, Quebec) to evaluate whether small protected areas located in rural landscapes suffer declines in vascular plant populations. We hypothesized that the limited park access (an island accessible only by boat) has a greater influence than the size of the park per se on the preservation of the integrity of the flora. The island flora just before the creation of the protected area (1971) was compared to the flora surveyed during 2 consecutive summers (2007-2008). Of the 358 taxa that were identified before 1971, only 21 (6% of the total) were not found in 2007-2008; of these 21, all but 1 were native taxa, and 17 are likely extirpated, which represents a "natural" extirpation rate of about 1 taxon every 2 or 3 y. Twenty-four taxa found in 2007-2008 were apparently not present before 1971, 14 native taxa and 10 exotic taxa. This represents an introduction rate of 1 native and 1 exotic species every 2 or 3 y. The creation of the protected area did not totally prevent the extinction of native plants or the introduction of exotic species, but the island lost very few species during recent decades, at least compared to small urban parks where historical floristic assessments have been conducted. These urban parks were visited much more frequently than the island, which probably accounts for most of the differences. Strict regulations for visiting the island are apparently an excellent tool for preventing plant introduction (or extirpation), although they are by no means a barrier against the most invasive species.

AB  - Awareness of environmental heterogeneity in ecosystems is critical for management and conservation. We used the Xochimilco freshwater system to describe the relationship between heterogeneity and human activities. This tropical aquatic ecosystem south of Mexico City is comprised of a network of interconnected canals and lakes that are influenced by agricultural and urban activities. Environmental heterogeneity was characterized by spatially extensive surveys within four regions of Xochimilco during rainy and dry seasons over 2 years. These surveys revealed a heterogeneous system that was shallow (1.1 m, SD = 0.4), warm (17 degrees C, SD = 2.9), well oxygenated (5.0 mg l(-1), SD = 3), turbid (45.7 NTU SD = 26.96), and extremely nutrient-rich (NO(3)-N = 15.9 mg l(-1), SD=13.7; NH(4)-N = 2.88 mg l(-1), SD = 4.24; and PO(4)-P = 8.3 mg l(-1), SD = 2.4). Most of the variables were not significantly different between years, but did differ between seasons, suggesting a dynamic system within a span of a year but with a high resilience over longer periods of time. Maps were produced using interpolations to describe distributions of all variables. There was no correlation between individual variables and land use. Consequently, we searched for relationships using all variables together by generating a combined water quality index. Significant differences in the index were apparent among the four regions. Index values also differed within individual region and individual water bodies (e.g., within canals), indicating that Xochimilco has high local heterogeneity. Using this index on a map helped to relate water quality to human activities and provides a simple and clear tool for managers and policymakers.

AB  - This study seeks to determine the distribution and diversity of yeasts in and around the Hamilton area in Canada. In light of the increasing number of fungal infections along with rising morbidity and mortality rates, especially among the immunocompromised, understanding the diversity and distribution of yeasts in natural environments close to human habitations has become an increasingly relevant topic. In this study, we analyzed 1110 samples obtained from the hollows of trees, shrubs, and avian droppings at eight geographical sites in and around Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A total of 88 positive yeast strains were isolated and identified belonging to 20 yeast species. Despite the relative proximity of the sampling sites, our DNA fingerprinting results showed that the yeast populations were highly heterogenous. Among the 14 tree species sampled, cedar, cottonwood, and basswood hollows had relatively high yeast colonization rates. Interestingly, Candida parapsilosis was isolated almost exclusively from pine trees only. Our results are consistent with microgeographic and ecological differentiation of yeast species in and around an urban environment.

To address this question, we develop three theoretical predictions regarding the distribution of output and factors across members of an integrated economic area with harmonized policies and free movement of goods and factors. Empirical tests strongly support these predictions for U. S. states and 14 EU countries. Constructing a measure of integration, we find that EU integration rose from the 1960s to equal that of U. S. states by 2000.

AB  - During the three-month long Sino-Japanese hostilities in the summer of 1937, Shanghai industries suffered the heaviest loss ever sustained during any previous military conflict in the city. Yet as has been shown in a previous study, local industries seem to have recovered fairly quickly. All statistics point to a return to pre-war levels of production in most sectors by the end of 1938 in some cases and during 1939 for most industrial branches. The purpose of this paper is to try to highlight the spatial dynamics at work in this recovery process. It relies not just on original sources, but on the unique capabilities GIS offers in processing large amounts of historical data and exploring connected issues in land use, demography, and urban life. The paper argues that Shanghai industries went through a thorough phase of relocation and migration within the city, but also of inbound migration from the surrounding regions. This study is based on a particular set of documents produced by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the largely independent body that administered the International Settlement. In this study, therefore, I shall argue that what happened in the territory of the International Settlement mirrored what happened next door and possibly in other parts of the Chinese-administered/Japanese-occupied areas. Beyond the issue of industrial movement, this paper also examines connected issues in land use, demography, and urban life. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The basin of the Sinos River, located in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly impacted by industrial and urban activities. Water quality is low because of domestic and industrial sewage discharges. Most of the tributaries have suffered drastic structural interventions like canalisations and the removal of riparian vegetation. The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4,869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat.

AB  - Through interviews with residents of an urban retirement community and users of a senior centre in an inner city neighbourhood this research uses the new mobilities paradigm to examine the relationships that exist between movement, non-movement, communicative travel and place-bound and place-creating social relations for older individuals. Our results show that these relationships can be conceptualized as forming non-linear multi-directional, locally-contingent mobility 'systems'. Two such systems were identified: the first centred on the communal area within the retirement community and the second focused on the senior centre. The types of non-movement, movement and communicative travel that form each of these mobility chains, the number and variety of spaces connected and consequently the form and nature of the social relations created exhibit both similarities and differences. The mobility systems created by residents of the retirement community connect and flow through more spaces, involve a greater variety of movement and non-movement and are more varied than the senior centre users' mobility chains. For both populations the place-bound and place-creating social relations that result from and generate movement, non-movement and communicative travel occur as individuals carry out daily errands and routines. For the users of the senior centre, interaction/participation by definition is the result of routine and repeated planned presence at the senior centre. Once at the centre, contact and participation predominately result from engaging in pre-arranged organised activities. For retirement community residents interaction occurs as a result of within-community movement, extensive travel outside the community and periods spent at home alone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The UrbanSAT (Urban System Analysis Tool), developed at the Bureau of Meteorology, is an innovative approach to analysing and reporting on the urban water cycle and links to regional water resources using data being delivered to the Bureau under the Water Act 2007. The UrbanSAT is a structured data capture and reporting tool which focuses on the movement of water through urban water distribution systems. It considers directly abstracted water in 'unconnected' areas and alternative water supplies within 'connected areas' via rainwater tanks, groundwater bore, surface water diversions or use from farm dams. Inclusion of this level of detail is, however, contingent upon data availability and estimation methods. Around Australia, annual reporting on urban water use generally focuses on the individual performance of water utilities, with respect to the service(s) they provide for water supply and wastewater collection. UrbanSAT, however, provides a nationally consistent urban water balance, analysis and presentation of water movements and use in urban centres on a whole of system basis. This is particularly useful where there are multiple utilities or suppliers operating throughout one connected system, which occurs in many of Australia's capital cities. For each urban centre considered, UrbanSAT provides information relating to the volume and source of water taken (i.e. when the urban water entitlement is fulfilled), consumption and the volume and location of water returned. The UrbanSAT accounts for the total volume of water taken, supplied and discharged with respect to the major elements of urban water distribution systems (urban water supply system, urban wastewater system, urban recycled water supply system, irrigation supply system). Deliverables of UrbanSAT are an important part of the Bureau's National Water Account 2010. The application of the UrbanSAT includes; a set of schematics illustrating the hierarchy of flows within the system, a data capture tool, urban water balance figure, series of tables summarising water flows and supporting documentation. The UrbanSAT data capture tool consists of approximately 50 system generic transactions, capturing inflows, outflows and flows between the four components of the water distribution system; the urban water supply system (potable and non-potable), wastewater system, recycled water supply system and irrigation water supply system. The Adelaide urban water system is considered as a case study in this paper with its application discussed and an extract of outcomes presented.

AB  - The ten year research (1995-2004) of adult mosquitoes in the area of Osijek by dry ice baited CDC traps has provided significant information on mosquito species, species prevalence, their dynamics and seasonal activity. A total of 207,136 adult mosquitoes comprising twenty species belonging to the following genera: Anopheles, Ochlerotatus, Aedes, Culex, Coquillettidia, Culiseta and Uranotaenia were collected. The seven most common species collected during this study were: Aedes vexans (75.6%), Ochlerotatus sticticus (13.3%), Culex pipiens complex (5.9%), Anopheles maculipennis complex (1.9%), Oc. cantans (0.9%), Oc. caspius (0.6%) and Oc. excrucians (0.6%). The temporal changes in the relative abundance of the twenty mosquito species in the Osijek area were reflected in three peaks: in May, July and September. Seasonal population dynamics differed between years and between mosquito species in relation to wetland, urban and forest habitats and was influenced by water level of the Drava and the Danube rivers.

AB  - The dispersal and survival of laboratory-reared Aedes albopictus Skuse males were investigated during the summer of 2007 in three Northern Italy urban localities by mark-release-recapture techniques. Two marking methods were compared: one group of males was dusted with fluorescent pigments on the body (FP), and the other group was obtained from a strain whose natural infection of Wolbachia had been removed (WB0). FP- and WB0-marked males were released as adults and pupae, respectively, in one fixed station at each locality. Recaptures were performed by skilled technicians, within a radius of 350 m from the release site, on days 4, 5, and 7 after the release, and the males were collected while flying around the technician's body or in swarms. Recapture rates ranged from 0.63 to 4.72% for FP males and from 2.39 to 11.05% for WBO males. The mean distance traveled for WBO males was significantly higher than for FP males; no difference was observed between the dispersal distance measured for the males recaptured on human host versus males recaptured while swarming. No further increase of the dispersal occurred during the postrelease period investigated (from day 4 to day 7 after release). The mean survival rate at the release was 0.51 for FP-marked males and 0.81 for WBO males. The data obtained are discussed for their significance in planning sterile insect technique programs against Ae. albopictus.

AB  - Urban stray cat populations have previously been shown to be organized in moderately to strongly genetically differentiated colonies. However, the spatial pattern of this genetic differentiation and the possibility that some cryptic genetic structure occurs have not been investigated. Firstly, we combine a pairwise Fst method, a fully Bayesian clustering method and a multivariate analysis to show that the spatial structure of 17 urban stray cat colonies (Nancy, France) does not match the underlying genetic structure. These colonies are structured in two clusters at the uppermost hierarchical level. Additionally, geographic proximity between colonies does not explain their genetic homogeneity. The spatial pattern in genetic differentiation seems more to be a mixture between low global structure and some highly localized structure, comprising isolated colonies. Variations in the local ecological and social constraints on immigration between colonies may explain this pattern. Secondly, we show that the overall current immigration rate is low (8%). Our results suggest that dispersal does not play a major role in the process of homogenization of allelic frequencies. Our study provides a case-study on the use of Bayesian clustering and assignment methods on a real, small data set with numerous fragmented populations; a population structure that is of high relevance in conservation biology.

AB  - Terrestrial molluscs have declined globally, often as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Many land snails are poor dispersers and exist in isolated habitat patches. The Oregon forestsnail (Allogona townsendiana (I. Lea, 1838)) coincides with the most densely populated region of British Columbia and is listed as endangered in Canada. To investigate the dispersal distances and habitat-use patterns of Oregon forestsnails, we tagged and tracked 21 adult snails at Langley, British Columbia, for up to 3 years (2005-2008). The maximum daily dispersal distance for a snail was 4.5 m and the maximum displacement that we observed for a snail was 32.2 m during 3 years. Snails occupied home-range areas of 18.4-404.4 m(2), often overlapping both forest and meadow habitat. Their home-range sizes were smaller in habitats with high availability of stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.), which may be an indicator of high-quality habitat. Our results suggest that the Oregon forestsnail is a relatively sedentary species with limited dispersal ability in its adult stage. Although Oregon forestsnails are likely unable to colonize suitable habitat independently, remnant forest meadow mosaic patches such as our study site provide valuable habitat for Oregon forestsnail, which are supplementary to large tracts of intact forest where most of their populations are found.

AB  - This paper explores the contested construction of more relational urban imaginaries within a movement that is simultaneously committed to enhanced systems of care for distant places/others, and intensified regimes of (re)localisation. Transition Culture initiatives explore how to prepare for a carbon constrained, energy lean world and stem from a concern for a post peak-oil global future. While the radical political openness of Transition Culture is in keeping with the vision of a more diverse polity imagined by advocates of relational space (for instance Amin, 2004), we argue that this openness is predicated upon an apolitical pragmatism that masks latent tensions between an environmentally benign localism and an ethics of care at-a-distance. If a transitional ethics of space occupies the uncertain ground between a relational and territorial geographical imagination, the Transition Culture movement provides a rich context within which to explore the ethical conundrums that stem from different tactics of place-making.

AB  - P>1. The Upper Yangtze River drains a catchment of c. 1 million km2 from its headwaters on the Tibetan Plateau to the city of Yichang below the Three Gorges Dam. The Upper Yangtze River Basin supports a diverse aquatic fauna, including 118 endemic fish species. The river basin has a long history of human use and environmental alteration and is further threatened by the demands of a large population and rapid economic development.
   2. We identified a set of areas that, with adequate protection and/or management, might maintain the aquatic biodiversity and ecological processes representative of the basin. Methods were developed to address the scope and scale of conservation planning across the entire Upper Yangtze Basin in a short time-frame using available data. The analytical framework is a watershed hierarchy of five catchment size classes derived from a globally available hydrography dataset called HydroSHEDs. Catchments were assigned to ecosystem types according to catchment area and patterns of climate, catchment morphology, geology and sources of water. Catchments were also ranked by ecological condition using an index of cumulative anthropogenic impacts.
   3. We defined conservation priorities as a combination of expert-designated focal areas that support endemic fish assemblages and habitat in good condition; sites selected with the conservation planning software MARXAN to meet representation targets for ecosystems and optimise ecological condition and longitudinal connectivity; and a set of rivers selected to provide refugia for fishes affected by a hydropower and flood control infrastructure development project.
   4. Areas selected as conservation priorities include 3200 km (27% of total length) of large rivers, 9900 km (39% of total length) of small rivers and 30% of small stream catchments in the basin. To evaluate the degree to which the set of conservation priority areas supports threatened and endemic fishes, we conducted a gap analysis using survey records and historic range maps of 131 threatened and/or endemic fish species. The conservation priority areas contain survey records or portions of the known historic range of 116 (88%) of the 131 species we evaluated, with an average of 49% of the survey records and/or 26% of the known historic ranges of each species.

AB  - Movement of poultry through markets is potentially important in the circulation and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza. However little is understood about poultry market chains in Cambodia. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 715 rural villagers, 123 rural, peri-urban and urban market sellers and 139 middlemen from six provinces and Phnom Penh. to evaluate live poultry movement and trading practices. Direct trade links with Thailand and Vietnam were identified via middlemen and market sellers. Most poultry movement occurs via middlemen into Phnom Penh making live bird wet markets in Phnom Penh a potential hub for the spread of H5N1 and ideal for Surveillance and control.

AB  - Over time native vegetation remnants in urban areas are typically eroded in size and number due to pressures from urban expansion and consolidation. Such remnants, frequently neglected and invaded by weeds, may constitute the last remaining habitat for some species' populations in urban areas. In the restoration of remnants for biodiversity, weed removal is often a high priority but there is a dearth of information on the role that exotic vegetation plays as habitat for fauna such as small reptiles. We investigated the vegetation type preference of urban remnants at the edge of a Sydney golf course by Amphibolurus muricatus, the native jacky lizard. The three vegetation types present were Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub (an Endangered Ecological Community) with sparse groundcover, dense stands of the introduced Eragrostis curvula African love grass, and open fairways of lawn: three structurally different habitats. Captured jacky lizards were spooled and their movements traced by following the thread left as they moved through their home range. Jacky lizards preferred areas that afford them most cover. While they foraged throughout the stands of love grass, they tended to avoid the edge of native vegetation remnants. They also basked on the lawn close to the vegetation where they had recently foraged, or traversed it to enter natural vegetation or grass. We concluded that introduced love grass offered additional habitat because of the relatively dense vegetation cover, and that areas should not be managed with the assumption that invasive weeds are detrimental to native species without appropriate assessment.

AB  - At the eastern margins of the geographical distribution in Europe, populations of Cepaea nemoralis are sparse and limited to urban environments to which they are possibly confined by relatively warmer climates. In 1999 we introduced 1101 C. nemoralis individuals originating from nine urban populations to a rural location in the area. The snails established a viable population, which suggests that confinement to urban settings is dispersal-rather than climate-limited. The snails filled available habitats at a rate of approximately 400-600 m(2) year(-1). On the whole, morph frequencies remained remarkably stable; changes that occurred are attributable to segregation of alleles or chromosomes. However, snails responded to habitat heterogeneity: consistent and predictable divergence occurred between habitat types, such that light-shelled snails were repeatedly more frequent in the open than in adjoining shaded habitats. This suggests the operation of climatic and/or visual selection. As the whole area encompassing seven distinct habitat patches was only 0.3 ha, and the maximum duration of population divergence was only 11 years ( fewer than four snail generations), these results indicate extremely small temporal and spatial scales of adaptation during initial phases of population establishment and spread.

LA  - English
AB  - Predation of Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) hatchlings by Rana clamitans (Green Frog) has not previously been reported. During Spotted Turtle nesting surveys in urban Massachusetts, a Spotted Turtle hatchling was radio-tagged and tracked to determine initial movement patterns. Fifteen days post-tagging, the Spotted Turtle hatchling was located in the gut of an adult female Green Frog. Given the abundance of Green Frogs in semi-permanent wetlands, they may be important predators on turtle hatchlings. Further studies are required to determine the frequency of Green Frog predation on turtle hatchlings and to evaluate total predation pressure on and survival of Spotted Turtle hatchlings.

TI  - Distances in Residential Space: Implications from Estimated Metric Functions for Minimum Path Distances

KW  - INFORMATION
KW  - CHOLERA
AB  - To date, theories and conceptual frameworks formulated in geography and regional science assume Euclidean space frequently, Riemannian space (i.e., a landscape occurs on a sphere, and hence great circle distance measures separation) rarely, or networks embedded in Euclidean space, which is non-Euclidean in nature. Minkowskian space furnishes another family of non-Euclidean spaces, with both Euclidean and Manhattan space being special cases of it. This paper explores the non-Euclidean nature of network spaces, including Lobachevskian space (via the Poncare disc). Metric functions for the various spaces are estimated for minimum path distances across various ideal and empirical networks, including selected regional and urban-region transport arteries, limited-access urban mass transit rail systems, and limited-access neighborhoods. The regional and urban-region landscapes involve nested transportation arteries, with findings addressing the question of whether or not increasing road density moves a network closer to Euclidean space. The general conclusion is that skewed transportation networks in large-scale regional landscapes may well be best characterized by a Lobachevskian geometry, whereas most smaller scale landscapes appear to be best characterized by a Minkowskian space whose parameters are between those of a Manhattan and a Euclidean space. The principal implication is that geography and regional science theories might furnish additional insights into the real world if the assumption of Euclidean space is replaced by one of Manhattan space.

AB  - In the 1970s and 1980s, a strong social movement of rubber tappers in the Amazonian state of Acre achieved remarkable policy goals, gaining new forms of land rights as well as political representation through their alliance with indigenous groups, environmentalists, political parties and human rights advocates. Allies of the social movement entered politics and took state power in 1999 as the "Forest Government,'' building on the rubber tapper's legacy to embrace the unique cultural and political history of the state, and implementing ambitious plans for forest-based development under the banner of ''forest citizenship.'' In the past 25 years, however, rubber tapper identity has changed rapidly as many rubber tappers migrate to urban areas, or increasingly shift from traditional rubber tapping to more intensive land uses such as commercial agriculture and small-scale animal husbandry. This paper uses data collected from household surveys, key-informant interviews and ethnographic research to explore the idea of what it means to be a ''rubber tapper'' and ''forest citizen'' today. We examine the contradictory nature of changing land-use and cultural revitalization efforts among diverse rural and urban populations, and the implications of this diversity for the future of the Forest Government's policies, and the rubber tappers.

AB  - There have been relatively few studies on airborne algae although they are known to have health implications. The aim of this study was to conduct a survey on the distribution of airborne algae within Bukit Jalil in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The sampling sites included a quiet residential area, a busy area with high human movement, a highway with heavy traffic, small roads with low traffic, a golf course, two hilly areas, and the man-made lake, Tasik Komanwel. Soils were also collected from these sites when possible. Results based on cultured samples showed that cyanobacteria were the dominant airborne algae, with a total of eight species identified. The dominant species was Phormidium tenue while other airborne algae found included P. retzii, Nostoc commune, and N. linckia. The sites with high percentage occurrence of airborne algae were near the animal holding facility of the International Medical University and the Light Railway Transit station. Human movement could be an important factor affecting the occurrence of airborne algae. A very low occurrence of airborne algae was recorded at the sites around the lake area. Some of the airborne algae were also found in the soil samples, suggesting that the algae could originate from the soil.

AB  - Anthropogenic land transformation processes in the vicinity of the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden, Johannesburg, South Africa, are a significant threat to natural vegetation and biodiversity. Breeding and feeding records of a Verreauxs' eagle (Aquila verreauxii), pair in the garden were analysed in relation to changes in the local environment due to urbanization. Natural prey-suitable habitat within a 10 km radius of the nest diminished by approximately 29.7 km(2) (9.5%) during 1984-2007. In 2007 approximately 116.7 km(2) (37.2%) of suitable prey habitat remained within this radius. Feeding data within a more recent period (1996-2008) suggest that there has been a switch from an optimal diet of rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) to less characteristic avian prey species such as helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), francolins (Francolinus spp.) and supplemented food. Annual breeding success indicated few inconsistencies in incubation period, nestling period and post-fledging dispersal period relative to breeding Verreauxs' eagle elsewhere. Despite a reduction in the suitable prey habitat and change in prey composition (including supplemental feeding), breeding has persisted successfully over a 16-year period (1993-2008). The presence of a large apex avian predator in an extensively urbanized metropolis is encouraging with regard to ecological integrity and functioning but the future prospects for these Verreauxs' eagles may depend on an as yet unknown threshold of prey abundance, both natural and supplemented, and environmental disturbance.

AB  - The environmental conflict throughout land development varies for every landform. In hilly areas, the ecological effects, such as the properties of the land surface and the diversity of flora and fauna cannot be reflected through assessment indexes, which include the building density, green areas ratio, etc. This paper is to provide the impervious index and the corridor index as a complement to the master planners. The indexes is an approach that integrates ecological landscape principles and methods for analyzing the eco-rationality of the master planning using ecological indexes which provides a measure for adjusting development density. An application of the indexes to the residential development of Kunming Expo Eco-town in Yunnan Province, China is provided. The result shows that the indexes can be used to quantify the interrelationship between the development project and the environment and that the required regulatory measures for land development can be implemented via master plans.

AB  - In Discipline and Punish Foucault famously declares that "our society is one not of spectacle, but of surveillance." Our theoretical aim in this paper is to problematize Foucault's strict demarcation between spectacle and surveillance through an analysis of urban mega-events. In the process, we detail emerging features of contemporary mega-events that shape and are shaped by shifts in the field of security and surveillance more broadly. Three dynamics in particular warrant consideration: the move toward a precautionary logic among security planners, a "semiotic shift" wherein security iconography is integrally bound up with the production of contemporary urban spectacles, and various forms of security and surveillance legacies that circulate beyond the spatial and temporal frame of the event itself. While mega-events support Foucault's assertion of the dispersal of discipline across the social field, they also suggest that this dispersal occurs in concert with, not in spite of, the power of the spectacle in contemporary society.

Through ethnography, theoretical and methodological base, we sought to investigate the use of internet and cyberspace as places of articulation and social mobilization during the protests held in 2011 in Natal - RN, asking for the impeachment of the current mayor city, Micarla de Sousa. Twitter, used as a means of articulating the movement, and Twitcam, main support for the broadcasts of the daily activities of the protesters, during the occupation camp of the City Council Chamber, corroborated for the consolidation of a heterogeneous and democratic space par excellence to contemporary political practices, what we call cyberdemocracy.

AB  - Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a phloem-feeding beetle native to Asia, has become one of the most destructive forest pests in North America. Since it was first identified in 2002 in southeast Michigan and Windsor, Ontario, dozens of isolated A. planipennis populations have been discovered throughout Michigan and Ontario, and in 12 other states and the province of Quebec. We assessed realized A. planipennis dispersal at two discrete outlier sites that originated 1 yr and 3 yr earlier from infested nursery trees. We systematically sampled ash trees within an 800 m radius of the origin of each infestation to locate galleries constructed by the progeny of dispersing A. planipennis adults. Our sampling identified eight trees at the 1 yr site infested with a mean +/- SE of 11.6 +/- 8.4 A. planipennis larvae and 12 trees at the 3 yr site with 25.8 +/- 11.1 larvae per meter squared. Dendroentomological analysis indicated that A. planipennis populations were predominantly undergoing a 2 yr (semivoltine) life cycle at both sites. Colonized trees were found out to 638 and 540 m from the epicenters at the 1 yr and 3 yr sites, respectively. Logistic regression was used to determine whether the likelihood of A. planipennis colonization was affected by wind direction, ash phloem abundance, distance from the epicenter, or land-use type (i.e., wooded, residential, agricultural, or urban). Results show that the probability of A. planipennis colonization was significantly affected by ash phloem abundance and decreased with distance from the epicenter.

AB  - There is an increasing number of rapidly growing repositories capturing the movement of people in space-time. Movement trajectory compression becomes an obvious necessity for coping with such growing data volumes. This paper introduces the concept of semantic trajectory compression (STC). STC allows for substantially compressing trajectory data with acceptable information loss. It exploits that human urban mobility typically occurs in transportation networks that define a geographic context for the movement. In STC, a semantic representation of the trajectory that consists of reference points localized in a transportation network replaces raw, highly redundant position information (e.g., from GPS receivers). An experimental evaluation with real and synthetic trajectories demonstrates the power of STC in reducing trajectories to essential information and illustrates how trajectories can be restored from compressed data. The paper discusses possible application areas of STC trajectories.

AB  - Animal mortality caused by vehicle collisions is one of the main ecological impacts of roads. Amphibians are the most affected group and road fatalities have a significant impact on population dynamics and viability. Several studies on Iberian amphibians have shown the importance of country roads on amphibian road mortality, but still, little is known about the situation in northern Portugal. By being more permeable to amphibian passage, country roads represent a greater source of mortality than highways, which act as barriers. Thus, mitigation measures should be applied, but due to the extensive road network, the identification of precise locations (hotspots) and variables related to animal-vehicle collision is needed to plan these measures successfully. The aim of the study was to analyse the spatial occurrence and related factors linked to amphibian mortality on a number of country roads in northern Portugal, using spatial statistics implemented in GIS and applying a binary logistical regression. We surveyed 631 km of road corresponding to seven transects, and observed 404 individual amphibians: 74(18.3%) alive and 330(81.7%) road-killed. Bufo bufo represented 80% of the mortality records. Three transects showed clustered distribution of road-kills, and broadleaved forests and road ditches were the most important factors associated with hotspots of road-kill. Logistic regression models showed that habitat quality, Bufo bufo's habitat preferences, and road ditches are positively associated with amphibians' road mortality in northern Portugal, whereas average altitude and length of walls were negatively associated. This study is a useful tool to understand spatial occurrence of amphibian road-kills in the face of applying mitigation measures on country roads from northern Portugal. This study also considers the necessity of assessing the condition of amphibian local populations to understand their road-kills spatial patterns and the urgency to apply mitigation measures on country roads.

ALIOTTA (Master of Science Program in Environmental Science, College of Staten Island, City University of New York, Staten Island, NY 10314). The abundance and size of annual herbs in a coastal beach community is related to their distance from seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens). J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 136: 102-109. 2009-The plant community of a coastal beach typically shows great spatial heterogeneity in distribution and abundance. Solidago sempervirens (seaside goldenrod) is a large perennial that can potentially impact the many smaller annual plants, both native and exotic, that comprise the primary vegetation in the pioneer zone. The primary question addressed was: do plants of two native and two alien annuals nearer to S. sempervirens show a detectable reduction in density and size compared to those further away? Populations of Triplasis purpurea and Cenchrus tribuloides (native grasses), and Digitaria sanguinalis and Mollugo verticillata (ruderals), were surveyed in quadrats at distances of 20-200 cm from S. sempervirens individuals at Miller Field Beach, Staten Island, NY. Densities of both native grasses and D. sanguinalis, but not M. verticillata, showed significant reductions closest to S. sempervirens. Size of C tribuloides was significantly reduced close to S. sempervirens. Intraspecific density had an effect on T. purpurea size, but not proximity to S. sempervirens. Because the opportunistic weeds were not greatly affected by S. sempervirens, it is suggested that the effect of seaside goldenrod on this beach community, whatever the mechanism, is primarily manifested by a reduction in the density of the native species T. purpurea and C tribuloides. Seaside goldenrod joins American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) as another perennial apparently structuring annual coastal plant communities.

AB  - The foraging, territoriality and displacement of the Snail Kite were studied over 232 hours of observations in an urban lake during the dry and wet seasons. The temperature and rainfall variations were used to correlate with predation rates and the correlation coefficients were 0,39 and 0,34, respectively. Snail Kites spent more time foraging during the wet than the dry season when perching is more frequently recorded. The higher predation in the wet season can be explained by the higher abundance of apple snails and the energy demand for reproduction. In the wet season, the territories were smaller and the conspecific conflicts decreased as prey were more available. However, due to the lack of food in the dry season, intra-specific conflicts and expansion of male territories were observed and the female and immatures were expelled from their foraging area to another location. In this way, site tenacity of Snail Kites should be interpreted in relation to the variations on food and dominance gradients according to the temporal changes (time) and foraging sites (space).

AB  - Background: Aedes aegypti, the major vector of dengue viruses, often breeds in water storage containers used by households without tap water supply, and occurs in high numbers even in dense urban areas. We analysed the interaction between human population density and lack of tap water as a cause of dengue fever outbreaks with the aim of identifying geographic areas at highest risk.
   Methods and Findings: We conducted an individual-level cohort study in a population of 75,000 geo-referenced households in Vietnam over the course of two epidemics, on the basis of dengue hospital admissions (n = 3,013). We applied space-time scan statistics and mathematical models to confirm the findings. We identified a surprisingly narrow range of critical human population densities between around 3,000 to 7,000 people/km(2) prone to dengue outbreaks. In the study area, this population density was typical of villages and some peri-urban areas. Scan statistics showed that areas with a high population density or adequate water supply did not experience severe outbreaks. The risk of dengue was higher in rural than in urban areas, largely explained by lack of piped water supply, and in human population densities more often falling within the critical range. Mathematical modeling suggests that simple assumptions regarding area-level vector/host ratios may explain the occurrence of outbreaks.
   Conclusions: Rural areas may contribute at least as much to the dissemination of dengue fever as cities. Improving water supply and vector control in areas with a human population density critical for dengue transmission could increase the efficiency of control efforts.

AB  - The paper analyzes the evolution of the population and its dynamic components in the metropolitan area of Madrid between 1996 and 2006. Work has been done with data from the Municipal Population Census and the Movement of Natural Population. Since they were introduced a new stage of demographic trends, consistent with the processes that are occurring in all major Spanish cities. It presents a revival of their growth rates and the emergence of a new process of recentralization, who lives with a scattering peripheral increasingly pronounced. To explain these two patterns, contradictory in principle, it goes to the influx of foreigners as a major player in the revitalization and their behavior on their spatial distribution, which explains the demographic recovery in the traditional metropolitan area. Meanwhile, the national population continues protagonizando the process of scattering in the large metropolitan peri-urban periphery.

AB  - The paper takes a case for the mountainous watershed towns in the upper reaches of Yangtze River and the traditional landscape space model for the breakthrough point. The author analyzes its natural element, ecological elements, and aesthetic elements, furthermore, has explorative thinking on the continuation and development of the Three Gorges project water storage and fell away to the landscape pattern of traditional space.
   Mountainous watershed towns, which are the area of assembly water in the type of the mountainous river, or the parts of the valley which are surrounded by the mountainous areas. The dialectical relation between the mountainous region and valley makes its unique in space structure and landscape. For the diversity of the towns' landscape matrix, the mountainous watershed towns have more sense of the third dimension and arrangement than plain towns, and have more nimbus than ordinary mountainous towns. The area which the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are the typical mountainous watershed towns in our country. It not only has the ordinary mountainous towns' regional differentiation phenomenon on the vertical direction, but also has the stretch characteristics of horizontal corridor landscape. In 2010, the Three-Gorge project made water storage to level 175 meters successfully. There is a new characteristic landscape matrix in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River:The water has been raised in winter and the fall is more than 30 meters in the summer. High gorges are beyond the broad lake. How to make the inheritance and continuous development for the traditional landscape of the reservoir area is a question which deserves to explore deeply.

AB  - In recent years populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in southeastern Mexico have decreased substantially due to the transformation and loss of natural habitats. This is especially evident in the Santa Marta mountain range, Veracruz, Mexico where several studies have evaluated the impact of fragmentation on howler monkey populations in order to propose management programs for their conservation. The conditions generated by fragmentation likely change the rates of parasitic infection and could decrease howler survival. In this study, gastrointestinal parasite species richness, prevalence, and egg density of infection were determined in howler groups inhabiting five forest fragments at the Santa Marta mountain range. Two hundred and seventy-eight fresh fecal samples were collected between October 2002 and April 2003. Three parasite species were found during the dry and the wet season in all forest fragments sampled: one unidentified species of Eimeriidae; Topanoxyuris minutus (Oxyuridae); and Controrchis biliophilus (Dicrocoeliidae). Both the prevalence of T. minutus and infection density for all parasites differed between seasons and fragments (the largest fragment consistently differed from other fragments). Host density, distance to the nearest town, fragment size, fragment shape, and total basal area of food trees explained parasite prevalence, but each species had a different pattern. Although parasite richness was lower, prevalence and density were higher than values reported for howlers in conserved forests. These results suggest that the establishment of biological corridors and animal translocation programs must take into account the parasite ecology of each fragment to avoid higher infection rates and preclude potential consequent mortality.

AB  - The genetic diversity within and among populations of Xanthoria parietina was studied at the subspecific level with a fingerprinting technique (RAPD-PCR) applied to sterile cultured multispore isolates, each being derived from a single apothecium. Populations from coastal, rural and urban sites from NW, SW and central France and from NE Switzerland were investigated. Between 1 and 8 microsites of a few decimetres square, each comprising 13 to 27 thalli of X. parietina, were analysed per population. A total of 132 isolates from epiphytic and 3 isolates from epilithic specimens were investigated. Phenotypic variation was recorded among some of the thalli in the field and among sterile cultured isolates in the laboratory. A high diversity of genotypes was observed, even among thalli growing side by side in phenotypically homogenous populations. An average of 73.5% polymorphism was found in all samples. As shown with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO), most of the genetic variation (90%) resided within, not among, populations. As X. parietina had previously been shown with molecular and fingerprinting techniques to be homothallic, the potential genetic background of this diversity is discussed. Intense genotype rather than gene (allele) flow seems to be an important element in X. parietina populations.

AB  - Memphis, the largest city in the state of Tennessee, and its surrounding suburbs depend on a confined aquifer, the Memphis aquifer, for drinking water. Concern over the potential for downward movement of water from an overlying shallow aquifer to the underlying Memphis aquifer provided impetus for monitoring groundwater quality within the shallow aquifer. The occurrence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrate, and pesticides in samples from the shallow well network indicate a widespread affect on water quality from the overlying urban land use. Total pesticide concentration was generally higher in more recently recharged groundwater indicating that as the proportion of recent water increases, the occurrence of pesticides related to the current urban land use also increases. Groundwater samples with nitrate concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/l and detectable concentrations of the pesticides atrazine and simazine also had higher concentrations of chloroform, a VOC primarily associated with urban land use, than in other samples. The age of the water from these wells indicates that these concentrations are most likely not representative of past agricultural use, but of more recent urban use of these chemicals. Given that the median age of water represented by the shallow well network was 21 years, a lag time likely exists between changes in land use and the occurrence of constituents related to urbanization in shallow groundwater.

AB  - Sisterhood and After: The Women's Liberation Oral History Project has attempted to capture regional and national as well as ethnic diversity within the complex geographical and political entities of the United Kingdom. We argue against generalising about the UK or 'British' movement, important as the cities of England and specifically London have been to the development of political mass, acknowledging the independent networks in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Our findings suggest that in contrast to English activists' tendency to be suspicious of the state, in the 'Celtic periphery' of Wales, Scotland and - more complicatedly - Northern Ireland, feminists have more often sought state-level political opportunities to advance claims within these jurisdictions.

KW  - MOVEMENT
AB  - Urban design has always been a challenging task and will remain one because of its inherent complexities and the diversity of the issues that are associated with it. A competent, experienced urban designer can use intuitive methods to deal with these complexities and still achieve a good design, but when projects become more complicated and multifaceted the intuition of the designer is not always adequate to ensure a successful design. This article argues that urban design process can be enhanced effectively by analytical methods that are applied at the specific stages of a design process. These methods can impact the inception of the design ideas, evaluate objectively the design outputs at different stages, assist the further development of the design solutions and reduce the risk of failure during the design process or project implementation. The article argues that for these methods to engage with the design process they have to be spatial in nature, as urban design is eventually manifested in a spatial entity. It is further argued that the analysis of space could bridge between space and the ultimate users of the design - or the people - if space is understood through an analysis of its 'configurational' properties. Finally, a configurational approach to analytical urban design is introduced, which is based on the theoretical foundations, analytical methods and modelling techniques of space syntax. The application of the methods, their role in urban design process and their contribution to urban design projects are all discussed through the review of a selected number of real-life projects.

AB  - Dispersal is a crucial process for population exchange and expansion, and traits that facilitate dispersal may be positively selected during biological invasions. Here, we performed a basic study on differences in behavior between the slug Arion lusitanicus auct. non MABILLE, 1868 (Gastropoda: Pulmonata), which is considered to be one of the 100 worst invasive species in Europe, and native gastropods. We assumed that the species is more active and less sensitive to otherwise aversive stimuli, and thus more likely to utilize novel environments. We quantified field densities and performed pitfall trap studies in 15 differently-structured habitats (urban, grassland, succession, riverine forest) in the floodplain of the LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) site 'Rhine-Main-Observatory' in Hesse, Germany. Here, A. lusitanicus was naturalized and scored 15 in terms of abundance rank, but was the dominant species in terms of trappability with the acidic Renner solution. A more detailed approach with a set of different baits showed that individuals of the invader were attracted to the acidic Renner solution, mustard oil, and garlic extract, all of which the native snails and slugs avoided. The results support the hypothesis that the invasive slug differs from other gastropods in its behavioral response to unusual, novel stimuli that may indicate some potential threat to other gastropod species. Future studies are needed to show if this behavior is related to personality traits such as exploration, boldness and risk-taking, and if it may have been positively selected in the context of the slug being passively spread in severely-transformed habitats such as gardens and greenhouses.

TI  - Relation of Flow, Speed, and Density of Urban Freeways to Functional Form of a Safety Performance Function
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Constructive discussion of the appropriate choice for the functional form of safety performance functions (SPFs) is generally absent from research literature on road safety. Among researchers who develop SPFs, there appears to be a consensus that the underlying randomness in accident counts is well described by the negative binomial (NB) distribution. The underlying phenomenon itself, however, is not well understood and is rarely discussed. The choice of the regression equation is usually not explained or documented. Researchers most commonly use the power function, possibly because most generalized linear modeling (GLM) statistical packages can accommodate the power function with little effort. The modeling process, however statistically rigorous, at times seems disconnected from the physical phenomenon that it is trying to describe. The disconnect, however, has attracted only limited interest from researchers to date. Accidents on an urban freeway are a by-product of traffic flow; therefore, changes in the flow parameters may give clues about the probability of accident occurrence and changes in accident frequency. This study related traffic flow parameters, such as speed and density, to the choice of the functional form of the SPF. It compared SPF models for urban freeways developed with sigmoid and exponential functional forms with the use of data from Colorado and California and contrasted the cumulative residual (CURE) plots of the models. SPFs developed around a sigmoid functional form through the use of neural network (NN) methodology suggested underlying relationships between safety and traffic flow characteristics. CURE plots for NN-generated SPFs generally showed a better-quality model tit when compared with power-function SPFs, which were developed in the GLM framework with an NB error structure.

AB  - The Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera Culicidae) control program currently applied in the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) is based on the use of ovitraps as a tool for mosquito population density estimation. During the favourable season 2008 (May-October), 2,741 ovitraps were activated in the urban areas of 242 municipalities according to standard criteria and were checked weekly. The universal kriging interpolation was used to estimate the seasonal abundance of the species at unsampled locations, and spatial cluster analysis was used to identify particular areas that had statistically significant high or low mosquito density. The overall data pattern was highly clustered and autocorrelated, and the choropleth and LISA cluster maps showed high egg density in the North, North-East and in the South-West areas of the region. The cross-validation statistics and results showed that the predicted values were reasonable for map production. The characterization of large geographic areas with high or low abundance of Ae. albopictus may provide information both on the environmental variables that promote species dispersion, and on the epidemic diseases risk, essential to develop effective disease surveillance programs, particularly for Chikungunya and Dengue.

AB  - The theory of protest cycles has informed us that the external political environment and the internal competition among social movement organizations are distinct elements leading to the emergence, development, and decline of popular protest. This theory, however, has not been examined systematically. I conduct an event-history analysis to test and refine the theory of protest cycles using a well-known new social movement event dataset. While proposing a general way of operationalizing the core concepts in social movement studies, I show that political opportunity only matters during the initial phase of social movement mobilization, rather than throughout the movement's lifespan. What explains declining frequencies of protest occurrence during the demobilization phase is the joint effect of two internal factors: the institutionalization of social movements and the growing violence during protests.

AB  - In present study horizontal and vertical distribution of traffic-related pollutants (CO and SO2) within the street canyons in (CO and SO2) Varanasi, India was monitored. The results showed that average horizontal profiles of traffic-related pollutant concentrations within street canyon at leeward side were approximately same as that of windward side. However, the vertical concentration of both the pollutants decreases with height above the ground and study indicated that CO and SO2 concentrations at different heights below the roof showed clear vertical self-gradient. CO and SO2 concentration decreased with height and the minimum value occurred at the roof. It was concluded from the observed results that pollutants from vehicular exhaust emissions in the street canyon of Varanasi were evenly distributed. This result may be due to the fact that wind vortices are not formed. Therefore, urban planners can use this type of streets so that there is proper ventilation and dispersal of pollutants.

AB  - We document the isolation and characterization of 19 tetra-nucleotide microsatellite DNA markers in northern snakehead (Channa argus) fish that recently colonized Meadow Lake, New York City, New York. These markers displayed moderate levels of allelic diversity (averaging 6.8 alleles/locus) and heterozygosity (averaging 74.2%). Demographic analyses suggested that the Meadow Lake collection has not achieved mutation-drift equilibrium. These results were consistent with instances of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the presence of some linkage disequilibrium. A comparison of individual pair-wise distances suggested the presence of multiple differentiated groups of related individuals. Results of all analyses are consistent with a pattern of multiple, recent introductions. The microsatellite markers developed for C. argus yielded sufficient genetic diversity to potentially: (1) delineate kinship; (2) elucidate fine-scale population structure; (3) define management (eradication) units; (4) estimate dispersal rates; (5) estimate population sizes; and (6) provide unique demographic perspectives of control or eradication effectiveness.

AB  - The Sierra de Guadalupe, located north of Mexico City, is an important geoecological system of the dry Mexican basin. Its topographical features, lithological materials and soil characteristics influence its biodiversity and ecosystem processes; conversely, patterns of biodiversity affect the soil properties at different scales. Unfortunately, although widespread land disturbance, severe soil degradation, and slopes severely affected by slumps and landslides are present in this region, soil and landscape preservation strategies have received surprisingly little attention. This paper attempts to examine and define the pedodiversity context that characterizes the geoecological system of the Sierra de Guadalupe. We consider that characterizing this system provides a unique and indispensable tool for evaluating the environmental risks of the geoecosystem as well as the interactions and interrelations in the environment. The goals of this paper center on the rationale to identify soil units, determine their spatial distribution, define their variation in soil morphology and properties, and to classify them appropriately.
   Our results revealed that the studied soils are derived from volcanogenic materials that are too young to be strongly weathered Uncultivated and incipiently developed soils, polycyclic soils and buried soils were detected in the study area. Their soil characteristics and properties are ascribed mainly to successive processes of mass movement, erosion and redeposition (K cycles) as well as to their spatial arrangement on the slope profile. Laboratory analyses showed that these soils are slightly acid and rich in organic matter In addition, they have high cation exchange capacity saturated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. The clay fraction is composed of halloysite > kaolinite > smectite. The soils exhibit large quantities of SiO2, besides total oxides abundances in the order SiO2>Al2O3>Fe2O3, which indicates their incipient degree of weathering. We conclude that the characteristics of the Sierra de Guadalupe soils can be explained within the context of a slope model, with an erosional and depositional toposequence pattern, common in the dry lands of the Mexican basin.

AB  - House sparrow (Passer domesticus) populations have suffered major declines in urban as well as rural areas, while remaining relatively stable in suburban ones. Yet, to date no exhaustive attempt has been made to examine how, and to what extent, spatial variation in population demography is reflected in genetic population structuring along contemporary urbanization gradients. Here we use putatively neutral microsatellite loci to study if and how genetic variation can be partitioned in a hierarchical way among different urbanization classes. Principal coordinate analyses did not support the hypothesis that urban/suburban and rural populations comprise two distinct genetic clusters. Comparison of F-ST values at different hierarchical scales revealed drift as an important force of population differentiation. Redundancy analyses revealed that genetic structure was strongly affected by both spatial variation and level of urbanization. The results shown here can be used as baseline information for future genetic monitoring programmes and provide additional insights into contemporary house sparrow dynamics along urbanization gradients.

AB  - Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are special cases of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) where nodes are highly mobile, so network topology is changing very fast. In VANET, vehicles move non-randomly along roads. Inter-vehicle communication is wirelessly connected using multi-hop communication without access to some fixed infrastructure. Because of the rapid movement of vehicles and the frequent topology change of VANET, link breakages occur repeatedly and the packet loss rate increases. Geographical routing protocols such as greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) are known to be very suitable and useful for VANET. However, they can select stale nodes for relay nodes and generate the local maximum problem. This paper presents an inter-vehicle routing protocol based on mobility information of vehicles and digital map on city roads to solve those problems in urban area. Mobility information includes the position, velocity, and direction of vehicles. Road topology is used to obtain the location of intersections and whether it is an overpass or a dead end road. Simulation results using ns-2 show performance improvement in terms of packet delivery ratio than existing routing protocols.

AB  - River Restoration represents an important domain for water authorities in Europe, especially due to the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE which aims at improving the status of rivers ecosystems in a broad, integrated, ecological perspective and to the new Flood Directive. Development of infra-structure projects associated with power supply, abstractions, waste disposal and both rural and urban land-use can all have impacts on the river systems and they threat the bio-diversity and sustainability of flora and fauna including the fish populations. Barriers to fish migration have profound consequences for hydrology and habitats, revering fisheries and upstream and downstream migration of fish. Flood protection is one of the key driving forces causing river and habitat continuity interruption in the Romania country. In Romania there are a small number of fish's passes in four river basins. Most structures, including large barrages, flood-control dams, sluices, flood gates etc., have been built for floods control, water conservation during dry periods, for hydropower, irrigation, for safety or for water supply.
   This paper focuses on ecological solutions for the fish migration, representing a limited effort related to the achievement of a good ecological status for the heavy modified bodies. Connectivity is crucial in the context of restoration. From a list of 788 reservoirs, only 77 dams/weirs were analyzed, being characterized by surface area above 50 ha and height of the dams until 15 m.
   The study case has been identified taking into account several criteria such as: the historical fish zone, the present monitoring fish data and the ecological prioritization criteria recommended by the International Commission for the Danube River Protection. The paper presents the ecological solution for the Abramut Crestur reservoir, created in 1976 year, after the sluicing of the Fancica river (total length: 25 km, surface: 100 km(2)) from the Cris River basin. The reservoir is situated in an agriculture area, characterized by low flows and two species of migratory fishes: Barbus barbus and Chondrostoma nasus. Before the embankment the floodplain provided an important habitat and food source (marshland and wet zone covered with reed) for migratory birds and fishes.
   The proposed ecological solution is to restore natural hydrological functions of the Fancica River by creating a lateral "natural bypass channel" for the fish, on the left side of the reservoir, all along the reservoir. Taking into account the neighborhoods of the dams it is enough space for the construction of the fish passes in "cascade", being equipped with artificial or natural obstacles such as weirs, stone-blocks and alluvial material mimicking a natural watercourse. The slope of such fish facility will be very slow, and long enough for providing resting areas for the fish. This way the proposedfish way could be an important means of redressing the detrimental effects of obstructions.

AB  - Alternaria is a common airborne phytopathogenic fungus that may affect crops in the field or can cause decay of plant products. It can also cause diseases in animals and humans. The study of airborne Alternaria conidia is a necessary step for the control and prevention of the agricultural damage they can provoke. The aim of this paper is to contribute to model the presence and levels of Alternaria conidia in the air using a logistic regression model. Our study is conducted in 12 monitoring stations in Spain corresponding to three geographic regions with different bio-climatic characteristics, which show three different patterns of Alternaria conidia dynamics: a unique main sporulation season from mid spring to autumn in NE Spain, two defined periods (spring and autumn) in SE Spain and a uniform and constant presence in the Canary Islands. Regarding the abundance, NE Spain shows the highest values and the Canary Islands the lowest.
   Daily Alternaria conidia concentration is positively correlated to daily minimum temperature and daily temperature variation and negatively correlated to daily precipitation. Also, the occurrence of rain in the 3 previous days has a positive effect on Alternaria levels. These effects are modelled in this paper by means of logit regression equations. The three equations used apply to the presence of Altemaria conidia, and to the exceedance of thresholds of 10 and 30 conidia/m(3). The model is calibrated in the 12 stations using data from years 1995 to 2008 and validated with data from 2009 in 7 stations, showing a reasonable percentage of right prediction (average 78.6%, ranging from 61.3% to 92.5%).

AB  - The use of associated support centers in the offering of courses at a distance is part in the operational structure in a number of well known institutions in that kind of educational modality, as is the case of the British Open University OU, and the Spanish Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia - UNED. Functioning as a privileged space in which students can find help to solve their doubts and to deal with administrative and academic matters, such support centers, in the case of Brazil and for the system of the Universidade Aberta do Brasil - UAB, were called Polos de Apoio Presencial (Local Support Centers). These poles originated from the articulation and interaction among three governmental levels (federal, state and city) with the Instituicoes Publicas de Ensino Superior - IPES (Public Institutions for Higher Education) linked to UAB. The (Local Support Centers) pole in the UAB is a fundamental element in the structure of that DE program, turned into an operational extension of the Instituicao Publica de Ensino Superior (Public Institution for Higher Education) IPES, which is linked to the system, in the student's city or at the city closest to his home; it is at the poles that face-to-face meetings occur, as well as following up and guidance for the studies, lab practices and face-to-face evaluation tests. For the UAB Program it is necessary that each support pole answers to a set of references, which allow the adjustment and composition of an infrastructure model and a management structure that takes into account the characteristics of each institution offering the course, with a view to assure the thorough development of the activities in the courses at a distance, and to offer adequate services and conditions in order to promote the social inclusion through distance education and to increase the access to Public Higher Education, stimulating regional development. The presence of the support pole for face-to-face support together with a number of structural and organizational factors, and with the offering of courses by the Instituicoes Publicas de Ensino Superior - IPES, a new social movement was created, with human development in the city and region where it is located. The present paper aims at making a list of the essential aspects and the main consequences of the establishment of the Local Support Centers of the UAB in the cities in which the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC) and the Instituto Federal de Tecnologia de Santa Catarina (IFSC) are situated.

AB  - Movement is one of the most fundamental demographic variables affecting the distribution and abundance of populations, but movement patterns for exploited populations of coral reef fish have not been studied extensively. Obtaining movement data for many species by means of traditional tagging methods can be difficult because of high tagging-induced mortality and low recapture rates. We used an age-structured population dynamics model parameterised using data from different regions to explore potential movement patterns for the red throat emperor Lethrinus miniatus, an exploited coral reef fish species for which traditional tagging studies have been unsuccessful. The model used a Gaussian function to describe the proportion of fish of a given age moving to or from 1 of 3 regions (Townsville, Mackay and Storm Cay) of the Great Barrier Reef. The model was fitted with and without movement to empirical age frequency data from each region over a 5 yr period (1995 to 1999). Including movement in the model led to significantly better fits to the data and revealed discrete movement patterns within each region. The model predicted net immigration to the Townsville region and net emigration from the Mackay and Storm Cay regions. We present alternative hypotheses about migration patterns of L. miniatus and highlight the importance of determining the scales at which movement in larger, exploited coral reef fishes occurs.

CP  - 6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)
AB  - This study describes the seismic retrofit and structural strengthening campaign for large scale bridges in Istanbul. Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey, with a history and cultural heritage that extends over twenty-six centuries. The two main motorways namely O-1 and O-2 motorways connect Europe and Asia continents each other and these motorways are the main transportation arteries of the city. There are two suspension bridges and several large scale steel and concrete bridges on the motorways. Istanbul is located on high seismic zone and investigations show that a major earthquake may occur with a high probability in the near future. These bridges are the critical nodes of this highway network and any broken link due to the bridges failure during a destructive earthquake may totally paralyze the whole transportation system in the city. Therefore to avoid negative condition and provide transportation continuity, serious studies have been started after 1999 Marmara earthquake. In this study, the methodology to determine the seismic performance and retrofitting requirements were elaborated and retrofit analysis and retrofit design criteria of the bridges were presented.

AB  - Intensification of farming over the past 50 years has homogenised the landscape structure and contributed to the decline of bird populations in Europe. To better target the conservation of the Barn Owl Tyto alba, we assessed the influence of the landscape structure on breeding performance in western Switzerland. The analyses considered a 23-year dataset of breeding parameters collected in an area dominated by intensive agriculture. Using a Geographic Information System approach, landscape characteristics were described around 194 nest sites. Our analyses showed that nest-box occupancy, laying date, clutch and brood size, egg volume and probability of producing a second annual clutch were not significantly associated with any of the eight principal landscape variables (agricultural land, woodland, urban area, hedgerows, cereals, sugar beet, maize and meadow). Nevertheless, the probability that a breeding pair occupied a nest-box decreased the more roads there were surrounding the nest-box. The absence of strong associations between habitat features and breeding parameters suggests that prey availability may be relatively similar between the different breeding sites. In our study area, Barn Owls can always find suitable foraging habitats around most nest-boxes.

AB  - The paper presents our efforts to establish a model for urban space interpretation (IMUSC -Interpretation Model of Urban Spatial Coherence), intended as a pragmatic instrument for recognizing elements and phenomena that affect actual use of urban spaces. The initial premise proposes the mechanism for traceable linkage between the basic, mostly visible elements and features in the urban space, and three qualities concerning actual use: (a) access to the space, (b) movement within and through the space and (c) permitted/tolerated and stimulated sojourning of the users in the space. The model aims to assist with bridging the communicational gap between expert and lay public occurring in the formal or informal process of spatial co-deciding, by increasing comprehension of spatial complexities and hence developing common priorities concerning spatial values.

AB  - Behaviour is generally plastic to some degree and allows an animal to react appropriately to changing and novel conditions. Consequently, a degree of plasticity is predicted to be a key determinant of an organism's ability to cope with novel (e. g. urban) environments. Yet behavioural plasticity is often genetically determined and many animals exhibit personalities (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in behaviours). We explored the degree of behavioural plasticity versus personality in the bridge spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, which occurs in extremely high densities in urban areas over the Holarctic. The spiders show extraordinary plasticity in life history. We investigated between-and within-individual variability, correlations and heritability for aggressiveness, boldness, behaviours in novel environment, and voracity towards prey. We predicted that these spiders would show high individual behavioural plasticity or that there would be a mix of individuals with different personalities. We found temporal consistency and moderate heritability in intra-sex aggressiveness and boldness, whereas behaviours in novel environment were repeatable but not heritable. Most behavioural traits showed high between-individual variability. We discuss the idea that low heritability of behaviours related to foraging success and a lack of behavioural correlations may be a result of developmental plasticity as a mechanism that promotes success in cities. In the next step, we experimentally tested whether composition of aggressiveness types affects spiders' mass gain and survival in a high-density group. Groups of only aggressive types had highest mass but also showed highest mortality, although not significantly. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that living in high densities does not necessarily require a reduction of mean aggressiveness levels but that a polymorphism in aggressive personalities maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection would be a possible scenario.

AB  - In this paper an effort was made to define the actual state of the distribution of social activities in the Croatian part of Baranja in regard to the social functions' development trends and current demo-geographic occurrences. First part of the text studies the relationship between the distribution of social activities and settlements' ( administrative units) net in Baranja based on the idea of spatial reflections of legislative settings. The research includes ranking settlements according to their population and according to the provision of social activities, resulting in the density of social activities. The differentiation of ranks following the listed criteria detected problem spots in Baranja's space. In the second part of the text a basis for social activities' growth potential was researched based on natural and structural population migration. Using graphic and tabular descriptions of the administrative units' hierarchy one can transparently distinguish Baranja's two urban focal points (Osijek and Beli Manastir). Results of the research described in the paper present a strong argument for further scientific analysis of the settlement network in Croatian parts of Baranja with the aim of differentiating their specific potential and evaluation of urban and rural "locuses".

AB  - Urban areas have both positive and negative influences on wildlife. For terrestrial mammals, one of the principal problems is the risk associated with moving through the environment while foraging. We examined nocturnal patterns of movement of urban-dwelling hedgehogs in relation to (1) the risks posed by predators and motor vehicles and (2) nightly weather patterns. Hedgehogs preferentially utilized the gardens of semidetached and terraced houses. However, females, but not males, avoided the larger back gardens of detached houses, which contain more of the habitat features selected by badgers. This difference in the avoidance of predation risk is probably associated with sex differences in breeding behaviour. Differences in nightly movement patterns were consistent with strategies associated with mating behaviour and the accumulation of fat reserves for hibernation. Hedgehogs also differed in behaviour associated with the risks posed by humans; they avoided actively foraging near roads and road verges, but did not avoid crossing roads per se. They were, however, significantly more active after midnight when there was a marked reduction in vehicle and foot traffic. In particular, responses to increased temperature, which is associated with increased abundance of invertebrate prey, were only observed after midnight. This variation in the timing of bouts of activity would reduce the risks associated with human activities. There were also profound differences in both area ranged and activity between years which warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Background: The population genetic structure of subterranean rodent species is strongly affected by demographic (e.g. rates of dispersal and social structure) and stochastic factors (e.g. random genetic drift among subpopulations and habitat fragmentation). In particular, gene flow estimates at different spatial scales are essential to understand genetic differentiation among populations of a species living in a highly fragmented landscape. Ctenomys australis (the sand dune tuco-tuco) is a territorial subterranean rodent that inhabits a relatively secure, permanently sealed burrow system, occurring in sand dune habitats on the coastal landscape in the south-east of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Currently, this habitat is threatened by urban development and forestry and, therefore, the survival of this endemic species is at risk. Here, we assess population genetic structure and patterns of dispersal among individuals of this species at different spatial scales using 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Furthermore, we evaluate the relative importance of sex and habitat configuration in modulating the dispersal patterns at these geographical scales.
   Results: Our results show that dispersal in C. australis is not restricted at regional spatial scales (similar to 4 km). Assignment tests revealed significant population substructure within the study area, providing support for the presence of two subpopulations from three original sampling sites. Finally, male-biased dispersal was found in the Western side of our study area, but in the Eastern side no apparent philopatric pattern was found, suggesting that in a more continuous habitat males might move longer distances than females.
   Conclusions: Overall, the assignment-based approaches were able to detect population substructure at fine geographical scales. Additionally, the maintenance of a significant genetic structure at regional (similar to 4 km) and small (less than 1 km) spatial scales despite apparently moderate to high levels of gene flow between local sampling sites could not be explained simply by the linear distance among them. On the whole, our results support the hypothesis that males disperse more frequently than females; however they do not provide support for strict philopatry within females.

AB  - Global increases in urban development have resulted in severe habitat modification in many estuaries. Most are now dominated by artificial structures, which might have a myriad of effects on native species. The provision of extra hard substrata presents additional free space, and recent research suggests non-indigenous epifauna may be able to exploit these artificial structures (particularly pontoons) more effectively than native species. The early development of fouling assemblages was compared on settlement plates attached to fixed or moving experimental structures at depths of 0.5 m and 2 m. Invertebrate invaders as a group were disproportionately more numerous on shallow, moving plates (essentially floating surfaces) than on deeper plates, whereas native epifauna were less numerous than invaders in all treatments. Importantly, however, individual invasive species showed differing effects of movement and depth. Future management strategies should take into account the potential for shallow, moving structures to enhance invader dominance and strongly consider using fixed structures to reduce opportunities for invaders.

AB  - This article is informed by multiliteracies pedagogy which recognizes the dynamic nature of reading and writing, particularly in relation to the multiple languages, literacy practices, texts, modalities, and interactions that are part of our world. This framework offers educators a greater appreciation of students' collaborations and text productions in music, image, movement, and voice, as well as print texts. It also provides opportunities to highlight and learn from students' diverse knowledges. Collaborations extend the potential to expand cultural knowledges, an aspect evident in the story creation of 4 urban girls presented in this article. Also evident, however, is the ease with which collaborations lead to inequitable reproductions that privilege dominant discourses while labeling others problematic or "crazy." These findings demonstrate the need for educators to explicitly recognize and support learners' diverse knowledges. Specific steps educators can take in order to create educational contexts that support more equitable collaborations are provided.

AB  - Drawing on a recently completed qualitative study in a northern English city, this paper explores motivations and experiences of Accession 8 (A8) migrants who have entered the United Kingdom following the expansion of the European Union in 2004. The paper considers commonalities and differences among the group of migrants routinely referred to as A8 migrant workers/labourers. Diversity is apparent in three particular respects: first, the motivations and forms of movement undertaken; second, their experiences of work within the UK paid labour market; and third, the extent to which the act and experience of migration offers new individual and collective opportunities and potentially opens up spaces for people to negotiate structural constraints and reconfigure aspects of their identity.

AB  - Population monitoring and evaluation of spatial requirements of species are key actions for the conservation of wild populations, especially for endemic and threatened species. We estimated the abundance of the endemic species Mesoclemmys dahli in 2 streams in Cesar, Colombia, from February 2008 to February 2009, by using aquatic sampling. We monitored fluctuations in abundance through the year and used mark recapture sampling and the Jolly Seber model to estimate population size and density. Home ranges and movement patterns were studied by using very high frequency (VHF) radio telemetry. We calculated home ranges for the year and for the wet and dry season independently. Estimated population size for the 2 streams varied during the year from 16 (95% Cl, 7-30) to 175 (95% CI, 32-298) turtles. Densities ranged from 16 turtles/ha in April to approximately 170 turtles/ha in June, which is lower than other populations of M. dahli in Colombia as well as other South American chelids. Individuals captured during the wet season had a significantly higher mean body mass than those captured during the dry season, which suggests that larger animals may leave the streams during the dry months or that animals may lose weight during this period. Home ranges for 1 year varied from 1.6 to 30.8 ha when using the minimum convex polygon method and from 9.2 to 22.5 ha when using the fixed kernel density estimator. There were no significant differences in the mean movements during the dry and wet seasons. However, the greatest movements were documented either during the transition from wet to dry months or during the dry months. Conservation of M. dahli will require protection of the few streams where it occurs, as well as the associated riparian vegetation and surrounding areas used by the species.

The proposed method was used to build the road network in a zone of Montevideo. Four types of errors were detected: two of them can be avoided and two are inherent to NNI method. The best performance of the method exposed occurred in the operative system Linux Mint. NNI method is functional, though it is less efficient than handmade digitalization; performance of NNI method can be improved using topology plugin for gvSIG.

TI  - Sign Visibility for Pedestrians Assessed with Agent-Based Simulation
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

AB  - As cities and urban centers become bigger and as building spaces become larger, the need for correctly designed and located signage becomes paramount. The geometry of these urban or architectural spaces is becoming more complex because of traffic flow in multiple directions, several obstructions, and nonconvex spaces. The complex architecture makes the determination of the optimal locations for the placement of signs in these spaces more difficult. This paper provides a framework for the rational location of signs in public spaces to increase their detectability through the consideration of the geometric configuration of the space, the occupant or pedestrian travel flow patterns, the locations of obstructions, the legibility distance, and the sign design. The framework used an agent-based simulation model, in which occupants or pedestrians were modeled as intelligent agents that moved in the space according to predefined traffic patterns. The social force model was used to simulate the microscopic movement behavior of the agents in the space. In addition, the perceptual attention of the pedestrians was modeled by consideration of the field of view of the agents as well as sign location and design. A computer simulation model was developed and tested in a real-life case study to demonstrate the applicability of the model. The research presented here should be of interest to practicing architects and engineers as well as researchers.

AB  - At present, there is great concern about limited water resources and water quality, which require a more advanced technology. The Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) has been shown to be an efficient technology for removal of organic matter and nutrients in industrial and urban wastewater treatment. However, there are some pollutants which are more difficult to remove by biological processes, so this process can be improved with additional physical and chemical treatments such as electrocoagulation, which appears to be a promising technology in electrochemical treatments. In this research, urban wastewater was treated in an MBBR plant with an electrocoagulation pre-treatment. K1 from AnoxKaldnes (R) and AQWISE ABC5 from Aqwise were the carriers studied under three different filling ratios (20, 35, and 50%). The experimental pilot plant had four bioreactors with 20 L of operation volume and a common feed tank with 100 L of operation volume. The movement of the carriers was generated by aeration and stirrer systems. Organic matter removal was studied by analysis of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD). The maximum organic matter removal in this MBBR system was 65.8% +/- 1.4% and 78.4% +/- 0.1% for K1 and Aqwise ABC5 carriers, respectively. Moreover, the bacterial diversity of the biofilm was studied by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes. 20 prominent TGGE bands were successfully reamplified and sequenced, being the predominant population: beta-Proteobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria.

AB  - The mean objective of this article is to problematize the utilization of the posters of the British government propaganda in the Second World War. This posters were produced by the Ministry of Information, and they took various elements of the British imaginary, in a thorough semiotic, to make new meanings of these elements. Creating intentions of maintaining the social and cultural life. The poster occupies a space of great importance in the modern city, mainly after the changes of the First World War, when it became a frame of pictures and texts, articulated in the same speech. These posters were posted in place of greatest movement in the cities, these pieces of propaganda of the State entering directly into the daily lives of British citizens, who experience the war in many ways. The work with the posters can open up ways of research and investigation regarding the forms of change and attempts at social control by the state, the reception of messages from the people, its tensions and its forms of representation.

AB  - Eighty-seven Planktothrix (Anagnostidis and Komrek 1988) strains isolated from 13 lakes in Scandinavia and Finland between 1964 and 2007 were screened for oligopeptides. Forty-six individual compounds were detected in total, belonging to the structural classes anabaenopeptins (six variants), aeruginosins (six variants), cyanopeptolins (21 variants), microcystins (five variants), microginins (two variants), and microviridins (two variants). Oscillatorin was also found. Three additional compounds could not be assigned to known oligopeptide classes. Thirty oligopeptides have not been described in previous studies. Of these new compounds, five were aeruginosins and 20 cyanopeptolins. The number of oligopeptides per strain ranged from one to 13. No oligopeptide-free strains were found, suggesting that oligopeptide production is vital for Planktothrix. On the basis of their oligopeptide patterns, the Planktothrix strains of the present study were assigned to 17 chemotypes. Three major chemotypes occurred in up to six lakes. One chemotype occurred in lakes around the city of Oslo (Norway), on the Finnish island Fasta Aland, which is situated in the Baltic Sea, and on the Finnish mainland. This wide distribution suggests that chemotypes can be subjects of recurrent dispersal and/or strong directional selection. Lake size, maximum depth, and nutrient availability appeared to be of minor importance for the ability of some chemotypes to colonize a water body successfully as long as the general requirements of Planktothrix were met. Four chemotypes were reisolated from the Oslo lake district over a period of 33-40 years, suggesting that they have been members of local Planktothrix populations for decades.

AB  - As a progressive policy platform and radical political programme, the right to the city suggests that the formulation of specific policy demands for affordable housing, free transit or municipal services can advance in tandem with a shared political understanding of the underlying roots of inequality and exclusion. The right to the city offers a useful, twofold challenge to the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement: to more clearly motivate its tactics in the reclamation of city space; and to cultivate openness to collective political transformation in the midst of struggle. This paper argues that the practical questions associated with OWS encampments-and particularly, the relationship between public space occupations and homelessness-are an opportunity to advance a shared political analysis across an ideologically and tactically fragmented left.

AB  - Genetic variation and population structure of the leaf-nosed bat Hipposideros speoris were estimated using 16S rRNA sequence and microsatellite analysis. Twenty seven distinct mitochondrial haplotypes were identified from 186 individuals, sampled from eleven populations. F-ST test revealed significant variations between populations in the overall pairwise estimation (F-ST = 0.710; p < 0.001). In addition, haplotype network and analysis of molecular variation analysis (AMOVA) consistently suggest the prevalence of genetic structure in the sampled populations. However, the mtDNA data was not significantly different in few closely located urban populations, but significant difference has been observed with the use of microsatellite data. The Bayesian clustering analysis identified eight clusters among the populations; the clustering pattern also corresponded to the haplotype networks. Overall, the present study suggests a "macrogeographic genetic isolation-by-distance" and possibility of gene flow among closely located populations.

AB  - Many species are becoming active earlier in the season as the climate becomes warmer. In parallel to phenological responses to climate change, many species have also been affected by habitat changes due to anthropogenic land use. As habitat type can directly affect microclimatic conditions, concurrent changes in climate and habitat could have interacting effects on the phenology of species. Temperature-related shifts in phenology, however, have mostly been studied independent of habitat types. Here, I used long-term data from a highly standardized monitoring program with 519 transects to study how phenology of butterflies is affected by ambient temperature and habitat type. I compared forests, agricultural areas and settlements, reflecting three major land use forms, and considered butterfly species that were observed in all three of these habitats. Seasonal appearance of the butterflies was affected both by the ambient temperature and the habitat type. As expected, warmer temperatures led to an overall advancement of the appearance and flight period of most species. Surprisingly, however, phenology of species was delayed in settlement habitats, even though this habitat type is generally associated with higher temperatures. A possible explanation is dispersal among habitat types, such that sourcesink effects affect local phenology. When there is little productivity in settlement areas, observed butterflies may have immigrated from forest or agricultural habitats and thus appear later in settlements. My findings suggest that a spillover of individuals among habitats may affect phenology trends and indicate that phenological studies need to be interpreted in the context of habitat types. This becomes especially important when defining strategies to prevent or mitigate effects of climate and land-use changes on phenology and abundance of species.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to quantify rates of nitrogen inputs to the forest floor, determine rates of nitrogen losses via leaching and to partition the sources of NO3 (-) from healthy, declining, and salvage or preemptively cut eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands in both an urban forest at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, MA and a rural forest at Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA. Rates of nitrogen inputs (NH4 (+) and NO3 (-)) to the forest floor were 4-5 times greater, and rates of nitrogen losses via leachate were more than ten times greater, at the Arnold Arboretum compared to Harvard Forest. Nitrate that was lost via leachate at Harvard Forest came predominantly from atmospheric deposition inputs, whereas NO3 (-) losses at the Arnold Arboretum came predominantly from nitrification. Although our study was limited to one urban and one rural site, our results suggest that current management regimes used to control the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), such as salvage cutting, may be reducing nitrogen losses in urban areas due to rapid regrowth of vegetation and uptake of nitrogen by those plants. In contrast, preemptive cutting of trees in rural areas may be leading to proportionately greater losses of nitrogen in those sites, though the total magnitude of nitrogen lost is still smaller than in urban sites. Results of our study suggest that the combination of the hemlock woolly adelgid, nitrogen inputs, and management practices lead to changes in the movement and source of NO3 (-) losses from eastern hemlock forest ecosystems.

AB  - This paper demonstrates a computer-based design approach that is used for the generation of circulation diagrams, and the spatial organization of functional areas in macro-scale level. The paper introduces a computer model that simulates the human movement behavior in real time and in parallel, based on simple rules of interaction between particles. This is called a 'virtual force' model, since the interaction between particles, and hence human movement behavior modeling, is achieved by using various forces that are acting upon each particle. Any changes on the rules of interaction can produce different results, allowing architects to investigate various design possibilities and study the movement behavior in different case studies. In this paper the idea of modeling such behavior is investigated and developed further, in order for it to be used for the design of circulation systems, and to suggest solutions to problems that occur in public areas of cities.

AB  - Limonium barceloi (Plumbaginaceae) is a narrow endemic seasonal halophytic plant, uniquely found in a highly degraded urban wetland in the Bay of Palma Mallorca, located in the northwest Mediterranean. It was awarded critically endangered status in 2004 and is the subject of a recovery plan administered by local government. Despite this, the last ten years have seen a dramatic decline in the population from ca. 3,000 individuals to just ca. 300; reasons for this decline are principally anthropogenic disturbance. Here we present the results of an investigation into some aspects of the reproductive biology of this species in the last remaining in situ population, in order to gain insight into its limited distribution and abundance, and to guide further development of management strategies. Findings indicate that although it provides important floral resources to a number of insect visitors, the plant is an autonomous apomictic that may also be functioning as an obligate asexual reproducer, and low genetic variation is suspected. Germinability is observed to be at ca. 70% and was positively correlated with maternal plant size characteristics. Two seed predators, the moth Goniodoma limoniella (Coleophoridae) and the ant Messor bouvieri (Myrmicinae), were discovered affecting both pre- and post-dispersal seeds. Rate of removal was high, although it is hypothesised that at this time species recruitment is not seed limited, but rather restricted by lack of suitable microsites. The results of this study are used to make recommendations for the species recovery.

AB  - Mutual interactions between frugivorous birds and plants in an urban fragment of Atlantic Forest, Salvador, BA. This study was developed between October 2009 and September 2010 in an urban fragment of Atlantic Florest, Parque Metropolitano de Pituacu (PMP), Salvador, BA. The objective was to identify potential dispersers of seeds, as well as species of plants that can have great importance in maintaining the community of birds that occur in this park. A further objective was to identify seasonal variations between mutual interactions. In order to register the interactions, a track of 2 km had been crossed on a weekly basis. When a feeding event was observed, the behavior used by the bird to remove and ingest the fruits was registered. Twenty-two species of birds were observed consuming fruits. However, one of them was considered a predator (Sporophila nigricollis), resulting in 17 species of birds present in the mutualism network. Twenty-seven species of plants had their fruits consumed. Of those, five species had their predated fruits or pulp consumed. Tangara palmarum was the most remarkable bird, consuming four times more fruits that any another and reaching the highest index of importance (Ij = 0.208). Among the species of plants, Miconia minutiflora (Melastomataceae) reached the greater index of importance (Ij = 0.246) and together with Didymopanax morototoni constituted 50.27% of the interactions. The second highest index of importance was reached by Pera glabrata (Ij = 0.154). It was registered in spring, and the largest amount of fruit was consumed from that species. The results of this study reinforce the importance of activities carried out by small size generalist birds, particularly in seed dispersion within much altered forest fragments. This is fundamental in accelerating the mechanisms of natural regeneration.

AB  - We describe use of Fort Collins, Colorado, and nearby areas by bats in 2001-2005, and link patterns in bat ecology with concurrent public health surveillance for rabies. Our analyses are based on evaluation of summary statistics, and information-theoretic support for results of simple logistic regression. Based on captures in mist nets, the city bat fauna differed from that of the adjacent mountains, and was dominated by big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Species, age, and sex composition of bats submitted for rabies testing locally and along the urbanizing Front Range Corridor were similar to those of the mist-net captures and reflected the annual cycle of reproduction and activity of big brown bats. Few submissions occurred November- March, when these bats hibernated elsewhere. In summer females roosted in buildings in colonies and dominated health samples; fledging of young corresponded to a summer peak in health submissions with no increase in rabies prevalence. Roosting ecology of big brown bats in buildings was similar to that reported for natural sites, including colony size, roost-switching behavior, fidelity to roosts in a small area, and attributes important for roost selection. Attrition in roosts occurred from structural modifications of buildings to exclude colonies by citizens, but without major effects on long-term bat reproduction or survival. Bats foraged in areas set aside for nature conservation. A pattern of lower diversity in urban bat communities with dominance by big brown bats may occur widely in the USA, and is consistent with national public health records for rabies surveillance.

AB  - This article analyses migration histories of residents in rural settlements of the Brazilian Amazon that resulted from direct action land reform (DALR), which involves organised land occupations. Our analysis evaluates two hypotheses. The 'urban migration' expectation asserts that urban experience is important for DALR participation, which links rural and urban areas via migration for land occupations. The 'DALR efficacy' hypothesis argues that migration and DALR are complementary livelihood strategies, such that participation in DALR obviates the need for further migration. Our findings support both hypotheses and bear implications for regional development and environmental change in the Amazon.

AB  - One potential contributor to the worldwide decline of bird populations is the increasing prevalence of roads, which have several negative effects on birds and other vertebrates. We synthesized the results of studies and reviews that explore the effects of roads on birds with an emphasis on paved roads. The well-known direct effects of roads on birds include habitat loss and fragmentation, vehicle-caused mortality, pollution, and poisoning. Nevertheless, indirect effects may exert a greater influence on bird populations. These effects include noise, artificial light, barriers to movement, and edges associated with roads. Moreover, indirect and direct effects may act synergistically to cause decreases in population density and species richness. Of the many effects of roads, it appears that road mortality and traffic noise may have the most substantial effects on birds relative to other effects and taxonomic groups. Potential measures for mitigating the detrimental effects of roads include noise-reduction strategies and changes to roadway lighting and vegetation and traffic flow. Road networks and traffic volumes are projected to increase in many countries around the world. Increasing habitat loss and fragmentation and predicted species distribution shifts due to climate change are likely to compound the overall effects of roads on birds.

AB  - Throughout the 1960s, educators and planners envisioned new occupational opportunities for Chicagoans in the city's emerging high-tech industries. In many of their forecasts, the least complex, rewarding, and remunerative jobs associated with Chicago's projected industrial renewal were destined primarily for women and non-white populations, especially black and Hispanic Chicagoans living in the racially fraught inner-city. New engineering jobs, by contrast, seemed best suited for white, and typically male citizens. Thus, the modernizing city would perpetuate old social divisions. This essay considers how engineering was naturalized, by engineers and their corporate and civic patrons, as an occupation distinct from those of technicians and shop-floor workers in Chicago of the 1960s. The city in those years faced commercial decline and the social unrest accompanying a growing civil rights movement; that hierarchical organization of technical labor answered both employers' desire for modern managerial techniques and the policy makers' preference that Chicago's workforce remain, enduringly, a racially stratified one.

AB  - Artificial substrates in and near ports and marinas commonly have many non-indigenous species and are the first stepping stone for the establishment of bioinvasors. Substrate movement influences fouling communities and so understanding of how species assemblages are related to specific substrate conditions is crucial as a management tool. Here we describe the species assemblage of the community after six months of development on granite plates in Paranagua Bay. Species richness was similar in the two treatments, with 12 species on floating (constant depth) plates and 15 on stationary (variable depth) plates. However, species composition differed, with the community on floating plates being dominated by the native bivalve Mytella charruana (66.1 +/- 5.5% cover) and that on stationary plates dominated by the barnacles Fistulobalanus citerosum (49.8 +/- 3.5% cover) and the introduced Amphibalanus reticulatus (33.9 +/- 3.7% cover). Other introduced species were Garveia franciscana, on one stationary plate, and Megabalanus coccopoma also on one stationary plate and not very abundant on half of the floating plates (< 2%). Thus, stationary plates were more susceptible to introduced species that may become very abundant, suggesting that this type of substrate should be a priority in management for bioinvasion control. We also hypothesize that the native bivalve M. charruana is the dominant competitor for space on floating substrates, thereby reducing the invasiveness of that type of substrate.

AB  - We highlight three areas of significant progress in ecology since 1989 which are particularly relevant to New Zealand, and three major challenges for the next two decades. Progress: (1) The unusual life histories of New Zealand organisms, including extreme longevity and low reproductive rates, are now seen as efficient responses to the low-disturbance environment present before the arrival of large mammals, including humans. (2) Recent data show that long distance dispersal has been far more common than previously supposed, changing our image of New Zealand from a Gondwanan ark to the "flypaper of the Pacific". (3) Greatly improved techniques for pest control, and innovative species management, have stabilised numbers of many of the most charismatic of New Zealand's threatened species. Problems: (1) Native species continue to decline, including many previously thought to be stable, and improved phylogenetics and new discoveries have added threatened species. (2) Despite increased etriphasis on biosecurity, biological invasions are continuing, driven by increased trade and lags in naturalisation. (3) Conservation efforts risk being overwhelmed by the direct effects of increasing human population, resource use, invasions, and global climate change at a time when human food supplies and economies are coming under increasing pressure from environmental constraints. Conclusions: (1) We need improved ecological understanding and more management tools for invasive and threatened species, especially for species other than birds. (2) In these decades of rapid climate change and habitat conversion, there is an urgent need for more widespread and sustainable integration of native species into New Zealand's rural and urban lowland landscapes.

AB  - This text focuses on a concrete example of the political struggle of migrants which, beginning in the last decade and continuing to the present, occupies Catalan public space in the form of an extremely novel social movement led by migrants from the post-colonial peripheries. These migrants, upon installing themselves in the Spanish state and more specifically in the city of Barcelona, choose to escape the position of victim assigned to them by the "miserablist" representation of immigration to become agents and political subjects. This article is a socio-analytic reconstruction about this social movement which demands the unconditional regularization of all migrants without papers who live in Spain.

AB  - The bed bug, Cimex lectularius L. (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), has experienced an extraordinary global resurgence in recent years, the reasons for which remain poorly understood. Once considered a pest of lower socioeconomic classes, bed bugs are now found extensively across all residential settings, with widespread infestations established in multiapartment buildings. Within such buildings, understanding the population genetic structure and patterns of dispersal may prove critical to the development of effective control strategies. Here, we describe the development of 24 high-resolution microsatellite markers through next generation 454 pyrosequencing and their application to elucidate infestation dynamics within three multistory apartment buildings in the United States. Results reveal contrasting characteristics potentially representative of geographic or locale differences. In Raleigh, NC, an infestation within an apartment building seemed to have started from a single introduction followed by extensive spread. In Jersey City, NJ, two or more introductions followed by spread are evident in two buildings. Populations within single apartments in all buildings were characterized by high levels of relatedness and low levels of diversity, indicative of foundation from small, genetically depauperate propagules. Regardless of the number of unique introductions, genetic data indicate that spread within buildings is extensive, supporting both active and human-mediated dispersal within and between adjacent rooms or apartments spanning multiple floors.

AB  - A detailed knowledge of the habitat requirements of steppe birds living in farmland habitats is necessary to identify agricultural practices compatible with their conservation. The globally threatened Great Bustard Otis tarda is a partial migrant in central Iberia, but factors affecting its winter habitat use have not been identified. We assessed habitat differences between breeding and wintering areas and winter habitat selection of radiotagged migrant female Great Bustards in central Spain. Of 68 tagged females, 35% moved to wintering areas located 64.3 +/- 24.0 km south of their breeding areas, and 80% wintered in a single area of c. 236 km2. A census of the population in this area identified it as one of the most important wintering areas of this species in the world, holding c. 1500 individuals. There were significant differences between breeding and wintering habitats of individually marked migrant females. Compared with breeding areas, wintering areas of migrant females were located further from roads and urban nuclei, had lower human population densities and area of urban developments, and a higher diversity of land-use types, with less cover of cereals and more vineyards and olive groves. Within this area, radiotracked migrant females preferred sites with more vineyards and a lower land-use diversity. Our results highlight the importance of traditional Mediterranean dry farmland mosaics, and suggest that different conservation strategies are needed for migrant and resident populations in winter to secure the conservation of suitable wintering habitat for Great Bustards in the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - The Antillean subspecies of the West Indian manatee Trichechus manatus is found throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean. Because of severe hunting pressure during the 17th through 19th centuries, only small populations of the once widespread aquatic mammal remain. Fortunately, protections in Belize reduced hunting in the 1930s and allowed the country's manatee population to become the largest breeding population in the Wider Caribbean. However, increasing and emerging anthropogenic threats such as coastal development, pollution, watercraft collision and net entanglement represent challenges to this ecologically important population. To inform conservation and management decisions, a comprehensive molecular investigation of the genetic diversity, relatedness and population structure of the Belize manatee population was conducted using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. Compared with other mammal populations, a low degree of genetic diversity was detected (H(E)=0.455; N(A)=3.4), corresponding to the small population size and long-term exploitation. Manatees from the Belize City Cayes and Southern Lagoon system were genetically different, with microsatellite and mitochondrial F(ST) values of 0.029 and 0.078, respectively (P < 0.05). This, along with the distinct habitats and threats, indicates that separate protection of these two groups would best preserve the region's diversity. The Belize population and Florida subspecies appear to be unrelated with microsatellite and mitochondrial F(ST) values of 0.141 and 0.63, respectively (P < 0.001), supporting the subspecies designations and suggesting low vagility throughout the northern Caribbean habitat. Further monitoring and protection may allow an increase in the Belize manatee genetic diversity and population size. A large and expanding Belize population could potentially assist in the recovery of other threatened or functionally extinct Central American Antillean manatee populations.

AB  - Context. House cats are increasingly suggested as having major ecological impacts in semiurban environments. Information on the activity of house cats is relatively scarce, especially in habitats such as wetlands.
   Aims. This study examines the movement and foraging behaviour of house cats living on the periphery of a wetland reserve in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   Methods. Twenty-one domestic cats living in a suburban residential area were studied using radiotelemetry to determine home-range size, mean and maximum distances travelled into the adjacent wetland, and the proportion of time spent in the wetland over a 12-month period. Surveys of prey retrieval for 88 cats were also carried out by cat owners over the same 12-month period.
   Key results. Cat age and the distance of the cat's home from the periphery of the wetland were highly correlated with cat movement and hunting activity. These movements were not markedly influenced by season or time of day. Younger cats (<6 years of age) living on the periphery of the wetland had larger home-range sizes, moved significantly further into the wetland and spent a significantly greater proportion of time in the wetland. Cats living close to the wetland also brought a greater diversity and a greater total number of prey items to their home-site. Rates of predation were not significantly influenced by sex or whether the cat was wearing a bell. The most common prey items were introduced rodents and birds; however, 172 of 981 prey items were identified as a native common skink.
   Conclusions. Consequently, cats living in households on the wetland periphery currently pose a predation risk for the wetland species, and the impact of cats on the native skink population warrants further investigation.
   Implications. This study suggests that domestic cats will exploit wild habitats but that their potential impact will have both positive (predation of introduced pest species) and negative (occasional direct predation) effects on native wildlife.

AB  - The problem of liquefaction of soil during seismic event is one of the important topics in the field of Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering. Liquefaction of soil is generally occurs in loose cohesionless saturated soil when pore water pressure increases suddenly due to induced ground motion and shear strength of soil decreases to zero and leading the structure situated above to undergo a large settlement, or failure. The failures took place due to liquefaction induced soil movement spread over few square km area continuously. Hence this is a problem where spatial variation involves and to represent this spatial variation Geographic Information System (GIS) is very useful in decision making about the area subjected to liquefaction. In this paper, GIS software GRAM++ is used to prepare soil liquefaction susceptibility map for entire Mumbai city in India by marking three zones viz, critically liquefiable soil, moderately liquefiable soil and non liquefiable soil. Extensive field borehole test data for groundwater depth, standard penetration test (SPT) blow counts, dry density, wet density and specific gravity, etc. have been collected from different parts of Mumbai. Simplified procedure of Youd et al. (2001) is used for calculation of factor of safety against soil liquefaction potential. Mumbai city and suburban area are formed by reclaiming lands around seven islands since 1865 till current date and still it is progressing in the area such as Navi Mumbai and beyond Borivali to Mira road suburban area. The factors of safety against soil liquefaction were determined for earthquake moment magnitude ranging from M-w = 5.0 to 7.5. It is found that the areas like Borivali, Malad, Dahisar, Bhandup may prone to liquefaction for earthquake moment magnitude ranging from M-w = 5.0 to 7.5. The liquefaction susceptibility maps were created by using GRAM++ by showing the areas where the factor of safety against the soil liquefaction is less than one. Proposed liquefaction susceptibility map of Mumbai city can be used by researchers for earthquake hazard analysis, for the preventive measures in disaster management, for urban planning and further development of Mumbai city and suburban area.

AB  - Although there is only one geopark in Australia, there are many geosites and associated clusters. These geosites form the base of geotourism in Australian national and provincial parks and in nature conservation areas. According to the geosites' geographical range and the networks they generate, Australian geotourism can be divided into three types: small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale geotourism.
   Small-scale geotourism is characterized by the local distribution of geosites and of the networks they form. In the Willandra Lakes Region, for example, the regional development of geotourism is limited to a local cluster of geosites and their immediate surroundings. At such a local scale, geotourism does not contribute much to the sustainability of regional development because the relationship between geosites and other regional resources is not strong and does not generate organic networks. This type of geotourism is similar to ecotourism, and the linkage with ecosites and conservation is important. Medium-scale geotourism is characterized by a broader regional distribution and occurs in combination with a small number of national and provincial parks, and with nature conservation areas such as the Greater Blue Mountain Region. Although geosites and their clusters are linked with some other kinds of regional resource in this type of geotourism, they remain dominated by bio-resources and the natural landscape. This type of geotourism generally complements mass-tourism in areas that are easily accessible from urban areas. On the other hand, large-scale geotourism is characterized by its broader spread and a wider network of geosites such as the Kanawinka Region, where the geopark is located, stretching over large areas of Victoria and South Australia Provinces. In spite of the dispersion of geosites, the relationships among them are strong and the linkage with additional regional resources contributes to the development of geotourism. Therefore, this type of geotourism makes an important contribution to the sustainability of regional development because the relationships among geosites and other regional resources generate multi-functional networks, and thus offers a diversity of tourism options.

AB  - In this combined field and laboratory study, we assessed whether populations of native walleye in the Upper Mississippi River experienced altered genetic diversity correlated with exposure to estrogenic endocrine-active compounds (EACs). We collected fin-clips for genetic analysis from almost 600 walleye (13 sites) and subsampled 377 of these fish (6 sites) for blood and reproductive organs. Finally, we caged male fathead minnows at 5 sampling sites to confirm the presence of estrogenic EACs. Our findings indicate that male walleye in four river segments produced measurable concentrations of plasma vitellogenin (an egg-yolk protein and, when expressed in male fish, a biomarker of acute estrogenic exposure), a finding consistent with the presence of estrogenic EACs and consistent with published historical data for at least three of these study sites (Grand Rapids, St. Paul, and Lake City on Lake Pepin). Patterns of vitellogenin induction were consistent for native walleye and caged fathead minnows. No widespread occurrence of histopathological changes, such as intersex was found compared with published reports of intersex at the furthest downstream study site. To assess possible effects of estrogenic exposure on the genetic diversity of walleye populations at the study sites, we DNA-fingerprinted individual fish using 10 microsatellite loci. Genetic differences were observed between populations; however, these differences were consistent with geographic distance between populations, with the largest observed difference in genetic diversity found between fish upstream and downstream of St. Anthony Falls (and/or Lock and Dam 1 of the Mississippi River), traditionally a historical barrier to upstream fish movement. Although the persistent occurrence of endocrine disruption in wild fish populations is troubling, we did not detect degradation of reproductive organs in individual walleye or alteration in genetic diversity of walleye populations.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of prediction of probability of successful radio communication of any mobile or stationary subscriber located in areas of service such as complex urban environments characterized by nonline-of-sight propagation conditions, which limit GPS, Low Earth Orbit, and Medium Earth Orbit services in land-satellite communications. It presents a self-consistent physical-statistical approach for predicting fading phenomena usually occurring in land-satellite communication links caused by influence of the terrain features on radio signal propagation from the ground-based to the satellite antenna. This approach combines (1) the statistical description of the buildings array located on the rough terrain and the buildings' overlay profile, based on special probabilistic distributions of built-up terrain parameters, and (2) the theoretical description of propagation phenomena, taking into account multiple scattering, reflection, and diffraction mechanisms. A new technique is proposed for predicting the probability of fading phenomena occurring in land-satellite links using the so-called stochastic multiparametric model. Results of theoretical predictions are compared with those obtained from the "pure statistical" Lutz model and physical-statistical Saunders-Evans model, and then with experimental data obtained for different European cities. Obtained results show that the proposed stochastic approach can be used as a good predictor of fading phenomena in land-satellite communication links for different satellite constellation scenarios and elevations of satellites during their movement surrounding the Earth, with respect to the ground-based antenna for different land environments: rural, mixed residential, suburban, and urban.

AB  - South Africa's history of diverse traditional medical practices gives rise to an emergent bush ethnomedicine in the Western Cape, where the consumption, trade and sale of herbs are dominated by Rastas. Rastafari, a sociopolitical movement and eco-religion, is combined with Khoisan healing tradition to synthesize an alternative lifestyle to dysfunctional township realities. Bush doctors lead this syncretic movement by gathering knowledge of medicinal plants from community elders. Local plant materials are collected to provide affordable medicines to the disadvantaged. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a third of the estimated 200 bush doctors during 2006-2010. This homogenous group of middle-aged coloured urban males have transformed from gangsters to herbalists with a stated mission "to heal all people." To the mixed race coloured community, who rejected their Khoisan indigenous ancestry during apartheid, bush medicine reasserts indigenous rights to resources, instills pride in coloured traditions and reclaims positive male roles. Rasta bush doctors employ indigenous healing methods as a method of legitimizing this historically marginalized community. Bush medicine presents a racially equitable socialist platform for health care within the shifting racial milieu in a post-apartheid South Africa.

AB  - Research strategies for investigating the freshwater-inflow requirements of estuarine fishes often integrate life-history information and correlative analyses of inflow and fish abundance. In tidal rivers, however, some fish have affinities for embayments, oxbows, and smaller tributaries, often referred to collectively as river "back-waters". The objective of this study was to determine whether freshwater and estuarine fish assemblages differed between backwaters and the mainstem of the tidal Caloosahatchee River, a highly managed river system located in an urban setting in southwest Florida. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of 21.3-m seine data revealed that fish assemblages did indeed differ between the backwater and mainstem habitats in each of three river sections. Univariate analyses identified species that differed in abundance between the habitats, which included ecologically and economically important fishes in the region. For example, striped mullet Mugil cephalus and pinfish Lagodon rhomboides were more abundant along the river's mainstem; common snook Centropomus undecimalis and bluegill Lepomis macrochirus were more abundant in the river's backwaters. For those species that were more abundant along the mainstem of the river or showed no difference, studies that measure changes in the distribution and abundance of these species with varying inflow along the mainstem of the river are justified. However, for species that were more abundant in backwater areas, geomorphological features should be considered in the design of studies that assess factors affecting fish use.

AB  - Many cluster of sand extend along the Mediterranean coast from the Maghreb. They occupy the most sprinkled areas and contain important groundwater resources. Their privileged situation near the sea has caused a real invasion by urbanization, generally without network of adequate cleansing. To identify this problem, the massive dune of Bouteldja is taken as example. The study consists in locating the zones vulnerable to the urban development; so a new data interpretation with REHESE method is applied. Thus, unsaturated zones, physical parameters, movement of groundwater and chemical characteristics are taken into account. So, we propose a better urban planning for a durable development.

AB  - Legislative norms developed at the end of the 1970s, structural changes in the economy, and the implementation of filters in both vehicles and industries improved the air quality of North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest western state in Germany in terms of population and economic output. Because these changes occurred unevenly across the state, the main aim of the given study is to analyse the historical development of air pollutants in the various environments (e.g., industrial, traffic or rural background) within the state.
   NO, NO2 and O-3 concentrations observed at six stations (one industrial, two traffic, one urban and two rural background) from 1981 to 2007 have been obtained from the Environmental State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection (LANUV NRW). These data have been evaluated to investigate time trends of these pollutants and the impact of weekly cycles on ozone formation in NOx-limited areas (rural background) and VOC-limited areas (urban areas with traffic network). The relationships between ozone production mechanisms and ozone precursors (NO, NO2 and their ratio) have also been taken into account.
   In contrast to the sharp decrease in NO concentrations (65%), only a moderate, insignificant decrease in NO2 (10%) was observed because catalytic filters in vehicles support emissions of NO2 as a primary pollutant. Changes in NO/NO2 ratio and higher temperature favoured an increase in ozone concentrations (20%), which appears to be the indicator of summer smog. The results showed that, although ozone forming potential is higher at background stations due to higher biogenic VOC and lower NO emissions, time trends were steeper at the industrial stations because of radical changes in NOx concentrations.
   Examination of the weekly and diurnal cycles of NO and NO2 showed that not only the absolute average values of the pollution levels decreased (with a turning point in 1998) but also the shape of the diurnal cycle (differences between primary and secondary peaks) changed in response to developed legislative norms (Bayerisches Landesamt fur Umweltschutz, 2011).

AB  - This paper demonstrates an ongoing research investigation, which is the continuation of the author's doctoral research on a computer-based design approach that is used for the generation of circulation diagrams, and the spatial organization of functional areas in macro-scale design level. The paper introduces a computer program that is based on the idea of particle behavior modeling. The program simulates the human movement behavior in real time and in parallel, based on simple rules of interaction between particles. The model is called a 'virtual force' model, since the interaction between particles, and hence human movement behavior modeling, is achieved by using various forces that are acting upon each particle. Any changes on the rules of interaction can produce different results, allowing architects to investigate various design possibilities and study the human movement behavior in different design case studies. In this paper the idea of modeling such movement behavior is investigated and developed further, in order for it to be used for the design of circulation systems, and to suggest solutions to problems that occur in public areas of cities.

AB  - Through qualitative analyses of 50 in-depth interviews with Catholics in three Midwestern cities, I investigate the role of religious movement organizations in the formation of Catholic identities. I find that movement organizations and elites tend to have little direct impact on the formation of Catholic parishioners' identities in my sample. While movements' disruptions and interactions with media are useful for generating debate and wider recognition of religious disagreements, my respondents are not usually socialized by nor do they identify with familiar movements when they call themselves traditional, moderate, and liberal. Most are uninterested in and unacquainted with movement organizations and publications. Instead, their religious identification is a form of religious mapping, which reflects their self-understood position vis-A -vis recognized cultural conflicts within the larger religious community. While movements play a limited role, I argue that we should be wary of conceptualizing Catholic identities as products of movement groups or parachurch networks since most Catholic identity-work occurs within families and parishes, as opposed to movements or parachurch organizations.

AB  - Change and movement across space and over time are observed in our everyday lives, with people commuting, traveling, communicating, moving, migrating, etc. Understanding how and why such change occurs is important for various reasons, including management of resources, planning for service improvements, detecting whether there are anomalies of some sort, etc. The analysis of spatial information associated with change and movement continues to be supported by a range of techniques, most notably cartography-based exploratory methods. Somewhat lacking, however, are confirmatory and predictive methods to support such analysis. This paper details a suite of approaches implemented in the Python programming language for exploratory analysis, as well as measures that enable statistical testing for pattern significance. Application results for housing movement in an urban region are used to demonstrate the efficacy and functionality of these methods.

AB  - Background: A. aegypti production and human density may vary considerably in dengue endemic areas. Understanding how interactions between these factors influence the risk of transmission could improve the effectiveness of the allocation of vector control resources. To evaluate the combined impacts of variation in A. aegypti production and human density we integrated field data with simulation modeling.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using data from seven censuses of A. aegypti pupae (2007-2009) and from demographic surveys, we developed an agent-based transmission model of the dengue transmission cycle across houses in 16 dengue-endemic urban 'patches' (1-3 city blocks each) of Armenia, Colombia. Our field data showed that 92% of pupae concentrated in only 5% of houses, defined as super-producers. Average secondary infections (R-0) depended on infrequent, but highly explosive transmission events. These super-spreading events occurred almost exclusively when the introduced infectious person infected mosquitoes that were produced in super-productive containers. Increased human density favored R-0, and when the likelihood of human introduction of virus was incorporated into risk, a strong interaction arose between vector production and human density. Simulated intervention of super-productive containers was substantially more effective in reducing dengue risk at higher human densities.
   Significance/Conclusions: These results show significant interactions between human population density and the natural regulatory pattern of A. aegypti in the dynamics of dengue transmission. The large epidemiological significance of super-productive containers suggests that they have the potential to influence dengue viral adaptation to mosquitoes. Human population density plays a major role in dengue transmission, due to its potential impact on human-A. aegypti contact, both within a person's home and when visiting others. The large variation in population density within typical dengue endemic cities suggests that it should be a major consideration in dengue control policy.

AB  - We reviewed concepts of patch dynamics and environmental heterogeneity and their applications to the study of fluvial ecosystems, with emphasis on research published in J-NABS We discuss several important papers synthesizing theories and findings on this topic and reports of descriptive and experimental research A large body of research, much of it published in J-NABS, has demonstrated how spatial and temporal variation influences population, community, and ecosystem patterns and processes in fluvial ecosystems Conceptual models of patch dynamics can be traced to 2 basic approaches. 1) the landscape ecology perspective and 2) the metacommunity perspective The former focuses on how spatial patterns are created and affect ecological processes over variable scales of space and time, whereas the latter emphasizes the important influence of periodic disturbances, refugia, and dispersal in maintaining nonequilibrium communities within patch mosaics. The origin of the metacommunity Patch Dynamics Concept can be traced to G. Evelyn Hutchinson's ideas about nonequilibrium Communities, and a key contribution was Townsend's (1989(4)) J-NABS review of the Patch Dynamics Concept in stream community ecology The study Of fluvial ecosystem ecology from a patch-dynamics landscape perspective is well represented by empirical studies published in J-NABS, but some emerging topics remain little studied, including 1) experiments designed to test predictions of the Patch Dynamics Concept of metacommunities vs alternative models, 2) empirical documentation of patch dynamics and their effects on ecological processes across longitudinal, lateral, and temporal gradients, 3) the Influence Of Species' life-history attributes on community dynamics in relation to habitat characteristics and aspects of disturbance; and 4) the manner in which landscape patterns, patch dynamics, and metacommunity dynamics affect foodweb patterns and processes

AB  - Plum pox virus (PPV) was first detected in Japan in April 2009 in orchards of Japanese apricot (Prunus mume) in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Symptoms comprised ring spots on leaves, color breaking on petals, and pale rings and deformities on the fruit. All isolates were confirmed as strain "D". After the first detection in Tokyo, a nationwide survey for PPV was conducted. As a result, PPV infection was detected in five cities within the Tokyo metropolitan area and two cities outside the area in 2009; by July 2010, PPV was found in two additional cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area and four additional cities outside the area. Infected nursery stock in five cities outside the Tokyo area originated from the infected nursery stock in the Tokyo area. All PPV-infected trees outside the Tokyo area were eliminated immediately or soon after and a subsequent intensive survey confirmed that there was no infection in the surrounding areas. Infected areas were specified based on delimiting surveys conducted until September 2009. The MAFF established regulated areas under a ministerial ordinance enforced in February 2010. The ordinance prohibits the movement of PPV host plants from the regulated areas and stipulates the elimination of PPV-infected plants. Monitoring surveys in the regulated areas and nationwide detection surveys for PPV will be continued after 2010. The MAFF concludes that the status of PPV in Japan is 'Present: under eradication', under IPPC standards (ISPM No. 8).

AB  - An influenza pandemic-an outbreak of a novel influenza virus that spreads around the world-is a real threat. To predict the spread of an influenza pandemic across the whole of Japan, this study applies a real individual-based model (ribm) to the whole of Japan and simulates how a single case of influenza could spark pandemic influenza throughout Japan. We used Person-Trip (PT) data for nine regions (the Tokyo metropolitan area, Kansai, Chukyo, Fukuoka, Sendai, Sapporo, Miyazaki, Okinawa, and northern Ibaragi). PT data were collected from randomly chosen persons and contain information on their locations and their uses of all transportation modes including trains, cars, buses, bicycles, and walking. In total, the nine regions have a population of about 72 million, of whom more than 2.20 million individuals participated in the PT surveys. Estimates on the probability of movement among the nine PT regions are based on the results of the Third National Survey for Movement in 2003. Disease transmission in each region or on a train is assumed to occur within a 1-m radius. The approximate numbers of new cases arising on day 14 after the arrival of the first infected person are estimated to be 322,000 in Tokyo, 25,000 in Kansai, 4,800 in Chukyo, 3,600 in Sapporo, 2,600 in Fukuoka, 600 in Sendai, 17 in Okinawa, and 300 in Miyazaki. The disease seems to spread more slowly in smaller cities such as Miyazaki and Okinawa than in big cities such as Tokyo and Kansai. Area quarantines may help to contain outbreaks in smaller cities, but probably not in larger cities. Because this study demonstrates that ribm is useful for simulating the spread of pandemic influenza in Japan, it is hoped that this modeling technique will be used in the creation of preparedness plans.

Plant trait-based analyses provide a useful approach for comparing and describing distinct plant communities and may offer a more general understanding of the influences and consequences of disturbance associated with land use on riparian vegetation. This research addressed two primary questions focusing on nine plant traits that may significantly influence ecological processes or function. Are riparian woody plant traits related to the surrounding watershed matrix? Are trends in plant traits that are related to the watershed matrix also evident in the riparian woody plant regeneration layer? Using a rapidly urbanizing region of the southeastern United States near Columbus, GA as an example, data on woody plant species composition were collected from 17 forested watersheds along headwater streams representing an urban-to-rural land use gradient. Land cover and hydrologic indices were used to characterize the watershed landscape matrix at each site. Plant species were described by morphological, physiological, and reproductive trait groups. A site x trait matrix was obtained and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordinations were used to identify trends in plant traits. Correlative analyses were used to relate watershed matrix indices to plant traits. Analyses indicated that riparian woody plant traits were related to the surrounding watershed matrix, most notably flood intolerance showed increased importance in urban areas possibly signifying a shift in hydrologic function. Changes in riparian woody plant traits are related to the watershed matrix and may have significant implications for ecological function and structure as urbanization continues.

AB  - Ireland experienced dramatic political, social and economic change in the twentieth century, of which the shift from a majority rural to a majority urban population was one of the most notable. These changes are reflected in the nature and form of the built environment. In this essay, the evolution of urban and suburban housing during Ireland's first urban century is considered. Existing patterns of unplanned middle-class suburban expansion were supplemented, from the 1920s, by a programme of planned working-class suburbanization. State intervention thus impacted on the location and form of new housing estates, while layouts owed much to the early British town-planning movement. High levels of owner-occupation in Ireland, the combined result of government policy and individual preference, were also reflected in a preference for particular housing forms. The predominance of the standardised three- or four-bedroom, semi-detached or detached house, was not challenged until the 1990s when there was a surge in apartment provision, largely driven by tax incentives. Changing norms in terms of housing size, facilities and design were shaped by the standards adopted by government and local authorities, as well as to the pressures of the speculative building process.

AB  - The article presents a theoretical framework, 'institutional phase theory', that charts the process by which higher education faculties in the USA were broadened by race, gender, and to a certain extent class over the past 40 years. Drawing upon institutional ethnographies of three very different universities - a top-ranked private university, a comprehensive urban university, and a top-ranked public university, the authors provide examples from the third, the University of Michigan. By taking a historical and institutional approach, the authors chart the movement from accepting 'exceptional' women and faculty of colour on male terms to measurable changes in overly rigid structures and institution-wide policies; expanded visions and boundaries in traditional disciplines; interdisciplinarity as a mark of the university; and transformed scholarly research in selected disciplines.

AB  - Background: TRAMIL network aims to understand, validate and expand health practices based on the use of medicinal plants in the Caribbean, a "biodiversity hotspot" due to high species endemism, intense development pressure and habitat loss.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to document both the medicinal plants that are frequently used to treat health conditions prevalent in the southeastern region of the archipelago of Puerto Rico and the trends in their use among the study population.
   Methods: An ethnopharmacological survey was conducted in the study region. The results were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.
   Results: Overall, 118 medicinal plants were recorded as being used to treat depression, nervousness, chronic sinusitis, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergic rhinitis, rhinofaryngitis, asthma, arthritis and migraine. The plant species with significant use were Citrus aurantium L., Citrus aurantifolia (Christm.) Swingle, Pluchea carolinensis (Jacq.) G. Don in Sweet, and Mentha piperita L. The use of medicinal plants is more frequent among single women with a high educational level, a trend similar to the use of CAM in the US.
   Conclusion: Ethnopharmacological knowledge and the use of medicinal plants is decreasing in the study region due to an increase in the use of conventional medical care and to self-medication with over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. Four botanical species with significant uses that were not previously recorded in the Caribbean Herbal Pharmacopoeia have been identified. This report will be followed by the scientific validation and toxicity studies of these plant species and the TRADIF activities in the study region.

AB  - Introduction Old-growth forests on Changbai Mountain are economically and ecologically important but have been fragmented outside Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve. The trend of forest landscape degradation on Changbai Mountain threatens forest sustainability and biodiversity conservation in the region. Previous studies have focused mainly on the structure and function of protected forests but have ignored managed forests outside the reserve border.
   Objectives In this paper, deforestation processes are studied for two forestry enterprises, namely Baihe and Lushuihe Forestry Bureaus, with different socioeconomic structure due to their differences in proximity to Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve, which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. Baihe's income comes from both forestry and tourism whereas Lushuihe's revenue is primarily from forest products. Land-use change was mapped using a time series of satellite images acquired in 1977, 1991, 1999 and 2007 for both forestry bureaus.
   Results It was found that Baihe experienced more severe deforestation, and more gains in cultivated and developed land than Lushuihe. The booming tourism in Baihe did not help lessen pressures on forest resources but led to increased fragmentation of forest landscapes on Changbai Mountain. While the tourism industry needs to be better regulated, it is important to create large-area, multi-use forest buffers and corridors around Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve.

AB  - Background: The reduced rainfall in southeast Australia has placed this region's urban and rural communities on escalating water restrictions, with anthropogenic climate change forecasts suggesting that this drying trend will continue. To mitigate the stress this may place on domestic water supply, governments have encouraged the installation of large domestic water tanks in towns and cities throughout this region. These prospective stable mosquito larval sites create the possibility of the reintroduction of Ae. aegypti from Queensland, where it remains endemic, back into New South Wales and other populated centres in Australia, along with the associated emerging and re-emerging dengue risk if the virus was to be introduced.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Having collated the known distribution of Ae. aegypti in Australia, we built distributional models using a genetic algorithm to project Ae. aegypti's distribution under today's climate and under climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2050 and compared the outputs to published theoretical temperature limits. Incongruence identified between the models and theoretical temperature limits highlighted the difficulty of using point occurrence data to study a species whose distribution is mediated more by human activity than by climate. Synthesis of this data with dengue transmission climate limits in Australia derived from historical dengue epidemics suggested that a proliferation of domestic water storage tanks in Australia could result in another range expansion of Ae. aegypti which would present a risk of dengue transmission in most major cities during their warm summer months.
   Conclusions/Significance: In the debate of the role climate change will play in the future range of dengue in Australia, we conclude that the increased risk of an Ae. aegypti range expansion in Australia would be due not directly to climate change but rather to human adaptation to the current and forecasted regional drying through the installation of large domestic water storing containers. The expansion of this efficient dengue vector presents both an emerging and re-emerging disease risk to Australia. Therefore, if the installation and maintenance of domestic water storage tanks is not tightly controlled, Ae. aegypti could expand its range again and cohabit with the majority of Australia's population, presenting a high potential dengue transmission risk during our warm summers.

AB  - Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 (+/- 0.197) with a detection probability of 0.2 (+/- 0.06) in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 (+/- 0.2) with detection probability of 0.212 (+/- 0.6) in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest (n = 10) than the wildlife sanctuary (n = 3) possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.

AB  - Conversion of relatively "wild" areas constitutes a rising threat to the ecological integrity of North American landscapes. As developers seek unprotected, amenity-rich lands, conservation planners require methods to recognize risk and prioritize actions. Most development models and processes are incremental, accumulating change over time and space. By contrast, large-scale amenity development can be rapid and extensive, necessitating "rapid assessment" techniques. For undeveloped lakeshores in the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion (330000kml), we developed a geospatial screening process based on four factors: (1) urban area proximity, (2) attractiveness of amenity (size), (3) regulatory gaps in protection, and (4) likelihood that owners will develop. To assess conversion risk, we added developable zones to the 10783 large lakes and ponds in the ecoregion and assessed risk to these lands based on four factors at two distances from 15 major urban areas in the region. Thirty-eight of 387 landowners were classified most likely to convert their lands through development, and 11 of these accounted for 97.5% of the total high-risk habitat area (625-1118 km(2)). Nearly all of the at-risk land (94.6%) lay outside of currently settled areas and most (69.1%) under the purview of a single regulatory agency, the Land Use Regulatory Commission of Maine (LURC). Without rigorous planning by such agencies large-scale, highly dispersed, and rapid conversion of lightly settled, amenity-rich forestland threatens habitat degradation at multiple spatial scales, i.e., local ecosystems themselves (e.g., lakes), surrounding landscapes, and regions.

AB  - The determination of seismic amplitude amplification is a fundamental contribution to seismic hazard assessment. While often only high-frequency amplitude variations (> 1 Hz) are taken into account, we analyse broadband waveforms from 0.14 to 8.6 Hz using a temporary network of 32 stations in and around the earthquake-prone city of Bucharest. Spectral amplitudes are calculated with an adaptive multiple-taper approach. Across our network (aperture 25 km x 25 km), we find a systematic northwest/southeast-oriented structural influence on teleseismic P-wave amplitudes from 0.14 to 0.86 Hz that can be explained by constructive interference in the dipping Cenozoic sedimentary layers. For higher frequencies (1.4-8.75 Hz), more local site effects prevail and can be correlated partly among neighbouring stations. The transition between systematic and localised amplitude variations occurs at about 1 Hz.

AB  - This article analyses how mobility between the first and second home, called second home mobility is conceptualised in Norwegian political discourse. We investigated two political fields in which second homes have entered this discourse: regional policy and policy for transport and infrastructure at the national level. Public and parliamentary policy documents and public newspaper records of debates constitute the empirical material. The article addresses the way in which second home mobility is reflected in Norwegian regional policy and political discourses. It pays particular attention to how this kind of mobility might represent connections or divisions between rural and urban groups. In brief, policy persists in insisting on a conceptual division between rural and the urban, even while bridging of the rural and urban is occurring and creating a movement for managing prototypical space.

TI  - The German Turners and the Taming of Radicalism in Chicago [1]
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT
LA  - English
AB  - The German Turner movement, a nationalistic gymnastic enterprise, migrated to the United States in the aftermath of the failed revolution of 1848. It quickly took hold in American cities with sizable German populations. Many German Turners espoused liberal philosophies, including Marxist, socialist and anarchist sympathies in their political views. They assumed leadership roles in politics, education and the labour movement; but those radical sympathies dissipated over time in the United States. This case study of Chicago, the centre of the American labour movement and a bastion of Turnerism in the United States, examines and analyzes the transition of Turner ideology and practice, from initial radicalism to incorporation within the mainstream political system, and from a focus on gymnastics to adoption of American sport forms. That transition occurred rather rapidly, largely over a period of two generations, by which time American Turners admitted that they had little in common with their European brethren. The article offers insights into the complex nature of sport, ideology and practice within the process of cultural flow.

AB  - The house crow (Corvus splendens) is an invasive bird in many parts of Asia. A radio-tracking study was conducted on 13 randomly selected birds caught throughout the port city of Singapore. We found that house crows returned faithfully to specific daytime areas and roost sites. Home range (95% fixed kernel utilization distribution [UD]) size ranged from 1.3 to 158.1 ha while core area (50% UD) size ranged from 0.2 to 22.3 ha. Crows that have formed pair bonds remained in their core areas for longer each day, and possessed smaller home ranges and core areas compared to other birds. In the middle part of the day, house crows remained in their core areas where the bulk of feeding occurred. In addition, they used supplementary feeding sites, which coincided with afternoon gathering points. House crows in Singapore travelled only short distances (maximum = 3.5 km) to their roost sites. unlike house crows studied elsewhere. Habitat selection analyses carried out at two spatial scales showed that house crows preferred commercial and public housing land uses, corroborating results from a count-based study. This was probably due to the higher amount of anthropogenic food found in these places. By understanding the crows' movement patterns and habitat preferences, management practices can be more focused and successful.

AB  - Both Occupiers and our opponents have used waste and discards-figuratively and literally-in strategies to create and cultivate a new social movement on one hand, and to maintain power and control over protesters on the other. This study will look at the roles trash, waste, filth and discards have played in tactical decisions by both sides of the movement from the point of view of a New York City Occupier. Overall, the examples examined of trash, filth, discards and their attendant transgressions make up an ongoing political debate about the ideal society by both Occupiers and its opposition. These are the terms over which contests about what counts as tolerable and intolerable conditions, right and wrong, citizenship and the Other, acceptable and unacceptable behavior and what constitutes 'out of placeness' have been waged.

More than 60 partners from research, health care, health industry and government in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg are promoting innovative measures to improve the treatment for mental disorders. The main objective is to implement integrated healthcare networks based on evidence for effective treatment methods, deriving from high-quality research throughout five indications such as psychosis, depression, somatoform and functional syndromes, anorexia and bulimia and addiction illnesses in adolescence. Those networks are accompanied by additional measures, for example, for improving information and education, addressing occupational health or strengthening the participation of patients and their families suffering from mental illness.

TI  - Support vs. Solidarity: White Involvement in the Aboriginal Movement
T2  - SOCIAL ALTERNATIVES
LA  - English
AB  - The Aboriginal movement has been one of the most outspoken Australian social movements for nearly a century despite the small Aboriginal population, due partially to the support of many non-Indigenous Australians. This relationship has not always been an easy one, and Aboriginal activists have alternated between welcoming diversity and preferring a more closed movement. This paper looks at the involvement of non-Indigenous people in one Aboriginal movement organisation, the Townsville Indigenous Human Rights Group. The non-Indigenous members of the group were carefully selected by Indigenous activists who have had previous negative experiences with white supporters. All group members were acutely aware of the potential for reproducing colonial power relations, and so the white women in the group made conscious efforts to remain in the background. This strategy allowed for Aboriginal leadership; however it came at the expense of real solidarity and engagement between white and Aboriginal group members.

AB  - Decentralized stormwater management is based on the dispersal of stormwater management practices (SWMP) throughout a watershed to manage stormwater runoff volume and potentially restore natural hydrologic processes. This approach to stormwater management is increasingly popular but faces constraints related to land access and citizen engagement. We tested a novel method of environmental management through citizen-based stormwater management on suburban private land. After a nominal induction of human capital through an education campaign, two successive (2007, 2008) reverse auctions engaged residents to voluntarily bid on installation of SWMPs on their property. Cumulatively, 81 rain gardens and 165 rain barrels were installed on approximately one-third of the 350 eligible residential properties in the watershed, resulting in an estimated 360 m(3) increase in stormwater detention capacity. One surprising result was the abundance of zero dollar bids, indicating even a limited-effort human capital campaign was sufficient to enroll many participants. In addition, we used statistical methods to illustrate the significant role of social capital in forming clusters of adjacent properties that participated in bidding. This indicated that as participants shared their experiences, neighbors may have become more willing to trust the program and enroll. Significant agglomerations of participating properties may indicate a shift in neighborhood culture regarding stormwater management with positive implications for watershed health through the sustained induction of alternate capitals.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME/ASCE/IEEE JOINT RAIL CONFERENCE
LA  - English
CP  - ASME/ASCE/IEEE Joint Rail Conference
AB  - As transportation corridors become an ever more important asset, existing rail freight corridors are under increasing pressure to be shared for transit purposes. In defining the expanded corridor use a comprehensive look at factors was undertaken on behalf of Transport Canada by AECOM. Understanding the issues is imperative in navigating this complex subject. In locations where the transit network and expected ridership-generation points are compatible with existing railway networks, the best use of a network of corridors for freight and transit should be one of the first steps in municipal and regional planning. Finding a best use of existing network typically does not happen for two reasons. First, the public entities typically do not observe the complete "freight network" and have a limited stake in its function and complexity. Unlike public roads or transit, public entities tend to look at single opportunities such as little used freight segments, or specific corridors that they can afford to pursue with a specific public purpose. As a result, freight railways often find themselves responding to a specific request for a segment in the context of their network and whether it serve a functional need. Second, the private freight railways similarly do not have opportunity or patience to investigate the public contribution to their networks. The point of view of what might be done if the potential transit services were understood and what it could mean to freight business with capital investment in an improved and/or rationalized freight delivery system may be hard to define, and the benefits may only occur in the distant future. They have a priority to pursue their immediate business model and therefore tend to wait until the public entity comes forward and asks about a specific corridor or opportunity. The issue of assets inventory, rationalization paired with transit planning, is the first step in evaluating efficient transportation systems through urban centres. Furthermore, the ability of some transit vehicles to be used on both on dedicated railway transit corridors, where it makes sense, as well as for street services, provide for greater flexibility in transit networks. What is missing is a review of freight networks from a regional perspective relative to all potential transit routes. The first question to be asked when looking at the freight network of an urban area is: where is it going, why is it going there, and could it be handled more effectively, and if so what are the overall benefits to all parties.

AB  - Urban parks can harbour small populations of saproxylic insects of high conservation concern, such as Osmoderma eremita and other rare beetles. These areas often host old trees which have become very uncommon in rural areas where they are threatened by commercial forestry management procedures based on frequent tree cutting. Nevertheless, old trees of urban parks may represent a hazard for public safety and are sometimes cut by management authorities. The aim of this work was to assess the loss of reproductive sites for saproxylic beetles of the Scarabaeidae, Lucanidae and Cerambycidae, when felling plans are adopted according to a Visual Tree Assessment Procedure (VTA), in a Mediterranean urban park. On July-August 2004, 1,247 holm oaks were surveyed within the border of an urban park of Rome (Villa Borghese). The occurrence of saproxylic beetles (i.e. the presence of frass, living insects or their remains) was verified in 66 old holm oaks, 41% of which were doomed to cutting by VTA. Eleven of these trees (41% of the trees doomed to be cut) held fragments of adults and sometimes living larvae of Osmoderma eremita, and four of them (36%) were included in the felling plan. The presence of Osmoderma eremita in tree holes was more frequent in deep cavities. The presence of frass in the cavities was positively associated with tree height and a high degree of damage at the root collar and negatively with the presence of hole-nesting birds.

AB  - The Global Historical Climate Network version 2 (GHCNv.2) surface temperature dataset is widely used for reconstructions such as the global average surface temperature (GAST) anomaly. Because land use and land cover (LULC) affect temperatures, it is important to examine the spatial distribution and the LULC representation of GHCNv.2 stations. Here, nightlight imagery, two LULC datasets, and a population and cropland historical reconstruction are used to estimate the present and historical worldwide occurrence of LULC types and the number of GHCNv.2 stations within each. Results show that the GHCNv.2 station locations are biased toward urban and cropland (>50% stations versus 18.4% of the world's land) and past century reclaimed cropland areas (35% stations versus 3.4% land). However, widely occurring LULC such as open shrubland, bare, snow/ice, and evergreen broadleaf forests are under-represented (14% stations versus 48.1% land), as well as nonurban areas that have remained uncultivated in the past century (14.2% stations versus 43.2% land). Results from the temperature trends over the different landscapes confirm that the temperature trends are different for different LULC and that the GHCNv.2 stations network might be missing on long-term larger positive trends. This opens the possibility that the temperature increases of Earth's land surface in the last century would be higher than what the GHCNv.2-based GAST analyses report.

TI  - Grid Connections, Batteries, and On-Board Generation: Sources for Electric Traction
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Well over 90 percent of all motorized transportation is fueled by products of petroleum, but the end of such widespread use of oil may be in sight. Among alternative fuels for land transportation, electricity appears to be the most promising, in part because it can be renewably produced and readily transmitted. The inadequacy and high cost of on-board storage of electrical energy present major challenges to widespread deployment of electric traction, and may do so for many years. On-board generation of electrical energy also presents challenges. The third means of powering electric traction is to provide for connection to the electricity grid while in motion. Grid-connected vehicles (GCVs) are an established feature of many cities and of much inter-city transportation, chiefly as electric streetcars, buses, and trains. They may be more highly regarded by users than their counterparts fueled by petroleum products, but they are nevertheless communal transportation, considered to lack the amenity of the private automobiles in which most land-based movement of people occurs. Private electric automobiles could, in principle, be grid-connected for some or all of their journeys, as electric buses are grid-connected. An alternative is to provide public transport that is more like private automobiles. This is generally known as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT), which could comprise relatively small, fully automated GCVs-often known as pods-that carry one to six persons along reserved guideways providing direct origin-to-destination service on demand. PRT could share infrastructure with private electric automobiles, although this may not be an optimal solution. Development of such GCV applications-for freight movement too-may be a more promising strategy than the current focus on improving traction batteries and fuel cells.

AB  - In the current neo-liberal economic and political climate, the labor movement faces immense challenges for survival and efficacy. As a massive redistribution of wealth upward has occurred, poverty is growing along with low-wage and insecure employment. The labor movement is developing new strategies that incorporate community organizing and local community issues into its issues as it organizes low-wage workers, often urban residents. Among these are living wage campaigns, community benefits agreements, and building regional progressive power. Many opportunities for collaboration with social work and involvement by social workers, particularly community practitioners, exist in these developments.

AB  - The northern region of Parana State, Brazil, was colonized by an English company during the second quarter of the twentieth century. British private investment was attracted to this little-explored region following the advance into the west of Brazil and the expansion of coffee-growing areas. As a fundamental part of this overseas land speculation enterprise, the whole territory was parcelled into small rural plots, a cluster of regularly spaced towns was founded and a railway line was built; only then immigrants were settled. Thus, systematic colonization, deliberate urbanization and town and country planning in advance of territory occupation can be seen. However, no formal evidence of this comprehensive colonization scheme has been found, apart from a few maps, some company documents, a large number of photographs and some scattered information. Hence, drawing upon the history of planning, cultural studies, imperialism/colonialism, British colonial towns and the Garden City Movement, this paper argues that certain British planning ideas and practices were applied in this area, more specifically those related to the garden city concepts, which have contributed to the construction of a particular landscape.

AB  - Mites can be found in all imaginable terrestrial habitats, in freshwater, and in salt water. Mites can be found in our houses and furnishings, on our clothes, and even in the pores of our skin-almost every single person carries mites. Most of the time, we are unaware of them because they are small and easily overlooked, and-most of the time-they do not cause trouble. In fact, they may even proof useful, for instance in forensics. The first arthropod scavengers colonising a dead body will be flies with phoretic mites. The flies will complete their life cycle in and around the corpse, while the mites may feed on the immature stages of the flies. The mites will reproduce much faster than their carriers, offering themselves as valuable timeline markers. There are environments where insects are absent or rare or the environmental conditions impede their access to the corpse. Here, mites that are already present and mites that arrive walking, through air currents or material transfer become important. At the end of the ninetieth century, the work of Jean Pierre M,gnin became the starting point of forensic acarology. M,gnin documented his observations in 'La Faune des Cadavres' [The Fauna of Carcasses]. He was the first to list eight distinct waves of arthropods colonising human carcasses. The first wave included flies and mites, the sixth wave was composed of mites exclusively. The scope of forensic acarology goes further than mites as indicators of time of death. Mites are micro-habitat specific and might provide evidential data on movement or relocation of bodies, or locating a suspect at the scene of a crime. Because of their high diversity, wide occurrence, and abundance, mites may be of great value in the analysis of trace evidence.

AB  - Human activities have degraded biogeographical barriers to dispersal resulting in the spread and naturalization of increasing numbers of nonnative invasive species. One correlate of invasiveness within a region is residence time or time since introduction. Plant species that were introduced into Europe prior to AD 1500 (European archaeophytes) that were subsequently introduced into North America provide a unique opportunity to examine the effect of extra-regional residence time (i.e., residence time that occurred in a nonnative region before a species was introduced into a new region). Here, we examine how nonnative species with extensive extra-regional residence times have affected beta diversity among states in the contiguous United States of America based on an analysis of occupancy and distance decay of similarity. State floras contained an average of 3106 +/- 922 species (mean +/- SD) with 2318 +/- 757 species classified as native, 180 +/- 43 species as European archaeophyte, and 608 +/- 236 species as other exotic with no European archaeophyte association. For European archaeophytes, 42% were identified as noxious weeds in the United States with 8% identified as agricultural and 14% as natural-area weeds (20%, 2%, and 13% for other exotics, respectively). In strong contrast to natives and other exotics, European archaeophytes were more widespread and presented weaker distance-decay patterns. Thus, European archaeophytes were more likely to become noxious weeds, particularly within agricultural areas, and were associated with significant losses in beta diversity. We suggest that this outcome is a consequence of extra-regional residence time, which allowed for the selection of species or the evolution of traits that favored the colonization of arable habitats associated with early agricultural activities in Europe, habitats that are widespread, resource rich, and uniformly distributed in the United States. Our findings suggest that a long-term trajectory can be established, with residence time in one region building biological and geographical potential, often in direct association with anthropogenic activities, for invasions in new regions. When predicting or managing for potential invaders within a region, identifying extra-regional residence time and its consequences is critical when assessing a species' long-term invasive potential.

TI  - Beliefs on Parenting and Childhood in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE FAMILY STUDIES

KW  - MOTHERS
AB  - In India, the family is a central unit of social existence and the socialization of children is a key function. Cultural scripts, parents own experiences, family situations and location guide parenting and familial practices. Parents' beliefs and ethnotheories contain explicit and implicit ideas about the manner in which children ought to be raised. With increasing global interaction and urban movement, the urban Indian family is continually faced with the challenge of keeping up with the fast pace of change. Such change exerts tremendous pressure on the ethos of the family as well as on parenting goals and motivations. This paper explores the nature of parental beliefs or ethnotheories among Indian families. The relatively unexplored territory of everyday conversations, interactions and routines within families has been used to access the nature and source of parents' ethnotheories. The paper specifically focuses on the manner in which mothers organize the daily routines of young children in the age group 3-6 years. The narratives provide a rich description of family life and have been organized within significant domains of childhood such as feeding and eating, regulation of behavior, development and learning, interpersonal relationships, agency for children and parental aspirations. Families living in Delhi, India formed a part of the study. The influence of cultural and familial diversity as well as situational factors was found to contribute largely to the multiplicity of beliefs. The rapidly changing urban situation indicates a need to renew ideas about parenting and childhood in India.

AB  - This article examines the occupation of Atlanta's Imperial Hotel by homeless people in the summer of 1990. This dramatic event represented the apogee of homeless empowerment in Atlanta during the last thirty years. It allows us to examine a "poor people's movement" that wielded the power of disruption to put the issue of affordable housing on the agenda of the city's governing regime. The Imperial takeover also provides an opportunity to consider the short-term factors that momentarily opened a space for such disruptive action and the long-term restructurings that ultimately disaggregated and disempowered homeless people.

AB  - The Black Rat (Rattus rattus) spread out of Asia to become one of the world's worst agricultural and urban pests, and a reservoir or vector of numerous zoonotic diseases, including the devastating plague. Despite the global scale and inestimable cost of their impacts on both human livelihoods and natural ecosystems, little is known of the global genetic diversity of Black Rats, the timing and directions of their historical dispersals, and the risks associated with contemporary movements. We surveyed mitochondrial DNA of Black Rats collected across their global range as a first step towards obtaining an historical genetic perspective on this socioeconomically important group of rodents. We found a strong phylogeographic pattern with well-differentiated lineages of Black Rats native to South Asia, the Himalayan region, southern Indochina, and northern Indochina to East Asia, and a diversification that probably commenced in the early Middle Pleistocene. We also identified two other currently recognised species of Rattus as potential derivatives of a paraphyletic R. rattus. Three of the four phylogenetic lineage units within R. rattus show clear genetic signatures of major population expansion in prehistoric times, and the distribution of particular haplogroups mirrors archaeologically and historically documented patterns of human dispersal and trade. Commensalism clearly arose multiple times in R. rattus and in widely separated geographic regions, and this may account for apparent regionalism in their associated pathogens. Our findings represent an important step towards deeper understanding the complex and influential relationship that has developed between Black Rats and humans, and invite a thorough re-examination of host-pathogen associations among Black Rats.

AB  - Crowds are a feature of large cities, occurring not only at mass gatherings but also at routine events such as the journey to work. To address extreme crowding, various computer models for crowd movement have been developed in the past decade, and we review these and show how they can be used to identify health and safety issues. State-of-the-art models that simulate the spread of epidemics operate on a population level, but the collection of fine-scale data might enable the development of models for epidemics that operate on a microscopic scale, similar to models for crowd movement. We provide an example of such simulations, showing how an individual-based crowd model can mirror aggregate susceptible-infected-recovered models that have been the main models for epidemics so far.

AB  - While sex allocation has been investigated productively at both population and family levels, as yet no general theory has been developed that is capable of linking processes at these two ecological scales, and very few empirical studies have examined cross-scale patterns. In Finnish northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), nestling sex ratio of local subpopulations is related to the spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of their principal avian prey, woodland grouse. Using data from an urban breeding population in Hamburg, Germany, I investigated: (1) whether brood sex ratio of goshawks varies with diet composition at the family level; (2) whether such variation could reflect adaptive adjustment; and (3) how family-level allocation can drive population-level patterns, such as those observed in Finland. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) were the most important prey species, with a pooled contribution to total diet of 36%. Brood sex ratio varied significantly with the proportion of pigeons in the breeding-season diet of pairs (increasing male bias). However, there was no evidence for sex-differential effects of diet composition, so it remains unclear whether the observed sex-ratio variation was an adaptive response. As all study pairs inhabited an (urban) environment where pigeons were unusually abundant, family-level sex-ratio adjustment caused a marked male bias in offspring sex ratio at the population level (male-biased nestling sex ratio in four of five years; pooled data: 60% males). This suggests that the large-scale variation observed in Finnish goshawk populations mirrors sex-ratio adjustment shown by individual families in response to small-scale environmental conditions. Apart from linking patterns empirically across ecological scales, this study is, to my knowledge, the first to demonstrate that family-level brood sex ratio varies with realized resource use (diet composition) in a raptor species. Previous studies either failed to find significant associations or, more commonly, violated theoretical assumptions by measuring environmental prey abundance (often integrated over large areas) rather than realized prey use of individual breeding pairs. I conducted a meta-analysis of offspring sex-ratio data from 17 goshawk populations across Europe to put my results into perspective.

AB  - A continuous high temperature event occurred in Beijing during 2-6, July 2010 is analyzed by utilizing the 1 degrees x1 degrees reanalysis data of NCEP/NCAR. The results show that, considering the relationship of the high temperature with strength and location of the subtropical jet stream (Si), the high temperature strengthens and expands when the SJ is anticyclonically curved, while the high temperature is weakened and disappears when the Si decays and moves southward, and comeback to the straightly westerly flow. This high temperature event is mainly affected by the ridge at the middle of the troposphere which controls the north of China and Mongolia, and the ridge in north of China and Mongolia and the Hetao High at the lower layer of the troposphere. The vertical movement of the air flow which extends from the right exit of the Si penetrates into the boundary layer and reaches to the surface. The adiabatic heating associated with the strong descending movement accelerates the development of the high temperature event. The impacts of the topography on this high temperature event are realized through the foehn effect. For this large-scale high temperature process, the effect of the atmospheric circulation is dominant, while the effect of the Urban Heat Island is only limited in the urban area.

AB  - From November 5 to 11 of 2007, the first official 'No Borders' camp took place along the Mexico-US border in the cities of Mexicali, Mexico, and Calexico, United States. The action, which had developed out of previous No Borders camps occurring since 1998 in regions such as the European Union and Australia, was a largely youth-led call for the abolition of borders and immigration controls, particularly in response to the growing death toll of undocumented migrants within this region. Through my direct involvement with this movement, I critically assess the methods by which this youth-led action attempted to create alternative spaces and discourses of solidarity surrounding the life and death issue of US immigration policy and border militarization practices. This work also addresses the notable void surrounding research on youth activism. Further it critiques the concept of participation by considering this youth-led movement, which does not seek to participate within pre-established frameworks and organizations, but rather seeks to create new futures surrounding citizenship, human rights, and mobility.

AB  - Although nested species subset patterns and mechanisms promoting them have constituted the focus of a considerable research effort, little attention has been paid to the role of seasonality in generating or moderating these patterns. I conducted monthly censuses of 130 urban parks in the city of Valencia throughout an annual cycle to assess whether seasonality influenced nested patterns of bird species assemblages. Specifically I tested the hypothesis that an increase in the movement of birds among parks outside of the breeding season, may reduce nestedness of resident birds. Results obtained in this study showed that assemblages of resident bird species were nested during the breeding season but not outside it, thus giving some support to the hypothesis. However, a reduction in nestedness outside the breeding season was not explained by an increase in the occupancy of parks but with an increase in the number of absences from parks that had been inhabited during the breeding season, most likely due to the use of habitats outside parks by some species (finches mainly). Results suggest the importance of both selective extinction and colonization processes in contributing to the degree of nestedness during the breeding season. However, environmental stress in the form of human disturbance apparently had little effect on the distributions of individual species. Habitat nestedness did not appear to be a factor as parks of all sizes were similar in number and type of habitats. An assessment of seasonality in other landscapes is needed to further understand its general effects on nestedness.

KW  - monopoly industries
KW  - decomposition of income differentials
KW  - Shapley value
AB  - Regression-based decomposition of inter-industry earnings differentials shows that in 1988, 1995 and 2002, inter-industry earnings differentials made an increasing contribution to urban earnings inequality in China. The primary reason for the widening gap lay in monopoly industries. At the same time, geographical location, educational level, type of enterprise ownership, type of occupation and whether the individual had a second job also contributed to rising earnings inequality, while age and being fully employed made a decreasing contribution. Therefore, if China is to reduce the earnings gap it is imperative that we remove barriers to labor market entry and break down some monopoly industries in the product market. Additionally, reducing obstacles to the free movement of labor and improving workers' educational level should also be important elements of the government's strategy for reducing the urban income gap in future.

AB  - The cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops has raised numerous concerns in the European Union and other parts of the world about their environmental and economic impact. Especially outcrossing of genetically modified organisms (GMO) was from the beginning a critical issue as airborne pollen has been considered an important way of GMO dispersal. Here, we investigate the use of airborne pollen sampling combined with microscopic analysis and molecular PCR analysis as an approach to monitor GM maize cultivations in a specific area. Field trial experiments in the European Union and South America demonstrated the applicability of the approach under different climate conditions, in rural and semi-urban environment, even at very low levels of airborne pollen. The study documents in detail the sampling of GM pollen, sample DNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis. Our results suggest that this GM pollen monitoring by bioaerosol sampling and PCR screening approach might represent an useful aid in the surveillance of GM-free areas, centres of origin and natural reserves.

AB  - The dynamics of Enochrus variegatus (Steinheil) and Enochrus vulgaris (Steinheil) in temporary pools and permanent ponds were studied in an urban park of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Samples were collected from both types of habitats weekly throughout one year, and variables like water surface and vegetation cover were recorded. In permanent ponds, adults of both species were found throughout the study period, while in temporary pools their presence depended on the availability of water. Differences in their reproductive seasons and breeding sites were observed. Enochrus vulgaris was characterized by an opportunistic strategy, and its larvae were detected in both types of habitats, associated mainly with spring and summer temperatures. Conversely, E. variegatus larvae were recorded almost exclusively in temporary pools, during the winter and spring seasons. In permanent ponds, both species were associated with vegetation cover, which could be related to the availability of refuges from fish predators. First instar larvae showed the highest abundance and were captured more frequently, in consecutive weeks and simultaneously with third instar larvae, suggesting that the two populations studied are not synchronized in oviposition time or development of immature stages. In several occasions, second instar larvae of both species were captured in a pool that had been dry during the previous sampling date, suggesting that they had not hatched from fresh laid eggs. Our findings show that adults of these species are capable of dispersal to and from temporary pools to avoid drought. In addition, their larval stages may also be able to resist drought in the pools by burrowing into the substrate.

AB  - The HIV-1 subtype C has spread efficiently in the southern states of Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana). Phylogeographic studies indicate that the subtype C epidemic in southern Brazil was initiated by the introduction of a single founder virus population at some time point between 1960 and 1980, but little is known about the spatial dynamics of viral spread. A total of 135 Brazilian HIV-1 subtype C pol sequences collected from 1992 to 2009 at the three southern state capitals (Porto Alegre, Florianopolis and Curitiba) were analyzed. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to explore the degree of phylogenetic mixing of subtype C sequences from different cities and to reconstruct the geographical pattern of viral spread in this country region. Phylogeographic analyses supported the monophyletic origin of the HIV-1 subtype C clade circulating in southern Brazil and placed the root of that clade in Curitiba (Parana state). This analysis further suggested that Florianopolis (Santa Catarina state) is an important staging post in the subtype C dissemination displaying high viral migration rates from and to the other cities, while viral flux between Curitiba and Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul state) is very low. We found a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.64) between routine travel and viral migration rates among localities. Despite the intense viral movement, phylogenetic intermixing of subtype C sequences from different Brazilian cities is lower than expected by chance. Notably, a high proportion (67%) of subtype C sequences from Porto Alegre branched within a single local monophyletic sub-cluster. These results suggest that the HIV-1 subtype C epidemic in southern Brazil has been shaped by both frequent viral migration among states and in situ dissemination of local clades.

AB  - The Caribbean tourism industry owes much of its success to beneficial geographical site and situation factors. Yet these geographical advantages have also contributed to the mass tourism-related pressures of economic dependency, social division and environmental degradation. We argue geographically marginal locales in the Caribbean have the potential to develop alternative tourism models that ameliorate these negative repercussions. With its conceptual roots originating from the slow food movement and theoretically rooted in Herman Daly's 'soft growth' development, we propose slow tourism as a viable soft growth model that is a more culturally sensitive and sustainable genre of alternative tourism. This new model and its locational appropriateness appears eminently suitable since it diversifies and revitalizes mature tourism offerings, redirects tourism away from 'hard growth' maxims, and thereby contributes to more sustainable tourism ensembles. In a maturing industry that requires innovation, revitalization and significant change in offerings if it is to survive and prosper, we argue the best places to promote slow tourism lies in the Caribbean's overlooked geographical margins where diversity and authenticity still persist.

AB  - The eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) in China has received much attention due to the construction of the Three Gorges Hydropower Station. Land use/land cover changes (LUCC) are a major cause of ecological environmental changes. In this paper, the spatial landscape dynamics from 1978 to 2005 in this area are monitored and recent changes are analyzed, using the Landsat TM (MSS) images of 1978, 1988, 1995, 2000 and 2005. Vegetation cover fractions for a vegetation cover analysis are retrieved from MODIS/Terra imagery from 2000 to 2006, being the period before and after the rising water level of the reservoir. Several analytical indices have been used to analyze spatial and temporal changes. Results indicate that cropland, woodland, and grassland areas reduced continuously over the past 30 years. while river and built-up area increased by 2.79% and 4.45% from 2000 to 2005, respectively. The built-up area increased at the cost of decreased cropland, woodland and grassland. The vegetation cover fraction increased slightly. We conclude that significant changes in land use/land cover have occurred in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The main cause is a continuous economic and urban/rural development, followed by environmental management policies after construction of the Three Gorges Dam. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the previous century, the wetland area in the lower Missouri River alluvial valley was reduced by 39% because of river channelization and bank stabilization projects. The Great Flood of 1993 reversed the trend of wetland loss by creating 466 new wetlands in the alluvial valley between Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri. We estimated amphibian occupancy, detection probability and number of species exhibiting evidence of reproduction in eight flood-created and 16 pre-flood existing wetlands from 1996 through 1998. We also evaluated whether hydroperiod (the number of days any water was present in a wetland from 20 February through 31 August) and distance to river predicted those values. Detection probabilities for adult amphibian species were relatively constant across years and ranged from 0.013 [Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus)] to 0.280 [Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii woodhousii)]. Occupancy of adult amphibians differed across years and was not correlated with habitat features. Estimated occupancy probabilities for amphibian species ranged from 0.126 [Plains spadefoot (Spea bombifrons)] to 0.896 [boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata)]. Almost double the number of amphibian species showed evidence of reproduction in existing wetlands (wetlands created before the Great Flood of 1993) when compared with that in flood-created wetlands. Similarly, temporary wetlands had nearly double the number of amphibian species showing evidence of reproduction when compared with permanent wetlands. Finally, the highest number of species showed evidence of reproduction in wetlands with springsummer hydroperiods between 135 and 140?days. All these relationships suggest that the invasion and persistence of predators in wetlands negatively influence amphibian reproduction. If the Missouri River is allowed to reconnect with the alluvial valley, more predators may be introduced into wetlands, leading to reduced amphibian occupancy and reproduction. However, this connection will not likely occur over the entire alluvial valley and, therefore, should not adversely impact amphibians that find refuge in higher-elevation, non-connected regions of the alluvial valley.

AB  - World heritage city surveillance system using smart closed circuit television (CCTV) is a system that detects the movement around the monitoring area and then counts the number of tourists who enter and exit the word heritage city. The system has been developed to assist the surveillance system in the world heritage city (WHC) or restricted area through the CCTV camera in detecting the trespassers, when the WHC is closed. This data can be used not only for the surveillance purpose but also for the commercial strategic planning and the security community as well. For example, the number of participants, audience, or visitors who attend the event can be used to plan the upcoming event. In developing the world heritage city surveillance system using smart CCTV, the developers adapted the knowledge about image processing to detect and count the number of people-in and people-out from video data and to security for the system. The system was tested on three set of video data and the results reveal 80-90% accuracy rate. Most of the errors occur when the background area is dark or when people walk in a group but the ability to control critical analysis of communication data to the agency administrator can control the order to increase security for tourists and maintain the condition of the remains a world heritage site.

AB  - This article examines racial politics in Brazil by analyzing the city of Salvador da Bahia's cultural policies over time and their relationship to national ideology and racial identity in Brazil more generally. It argues that the re-Africanization of Salvador's Carnival and its historical center, the Pelourinho, although initially products of the mobilization of Afro-Bahians themselves, have become institutionalized and ironically serve today as testaments to Brazil's diversity, tolerance, and integration. In light of increasing "ethnic'' tourism to Bahia, this article highlights the paradox behind and the fundamental contradictions in a culturalist approach to race-based political mobilization in the Bahian context, and perhaps Brazil more generally. Because African culture has been such a central part of constructing modern Brazilian national identity and racial democracy, a culturally based movement, even one challenging the deeply embedded racial hierarchy, can paradoxically reify the myth of racial democracy.

AB  - The factors responsible for the patterns of niche differentiation and narrow endemism have rarely been investigated in annual Mediterranean plants. This topic was addressed here by performing comparative studies on realized niches, regional occupancy, global biogeographical distribution and seed traits of a set of Arenaria (Caryophyllaceae) species inhabiting southern Provence (SE France), focusing in particular on Arenaria provincialis, a narrow endemic restricted to the hills and modest calcareous mountains around the city of Marseille. Field studies were carried out from 2008 to 2009 at 624 sites in the limestone mountains where Arenaria species are likely to occur. The Arenaria species occurring in southern Provence vary greatly in their patterns of regional occupancy and their biogeographical distribution. Multivariate analysis of the realized niche showed that they have some similar limiting environmental factors in common, but they do not all occupy the same habitats. Studies on the fruits and seeds showed that the endemic A. provincialis has a larger seed than its congeners and a capsule that remains closed and falls from the plant at maturity. This well-differentiated diaspore specific to A. provincialis may be responsible for the limited dispersal capacity of this species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that A. provincialis is not closely related to the other taxa inhabiting southern Provence, but rather to Arenaria occurring in highland areas in the south of France. The restricted pattern of distribution of A. provincialis is probably due to the past isolation event from which it originated and to its limited dispersal capacity, rather than resulting from its ecological niche range.

AB  - A state-of-the-art four-point tiedown system, a prototype automatic docking system, and a prototype rear-facing wheelchair passenger station (RF-WPS) were installed in a large accessible transit vehicle (LATV). A manual wheelchair, powered wheelchair, and a three-wheeled scooter were used to test the securement performance of each wheelchair securement system during LATV normal driving, hard braking, and rapid turning maneuvers. All test wheelchairs were loaded with an ISO 7176 Part 11 compliant loader gage representing the weight of an average male wheelchair occupant. A tri-axial accelerometer measured vehicle acceleration during driving maneuvers, and a low-tech movement tracking system measured wheelchair movement during driving maneuvers. Results show that each wheelchair securement system limited wheelchair displacement to less than the 51-mm Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) displacement limitation, and none of the securement systems showed visible signs of failure. Accelerations during LATV normal driving, hard braking, and rapid turning did not exceed 0.76g.

AB  - Various studies suggest that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, especially slow-wave sleep (SWS), is vital to the consolidation of declarative memories. However, sleep stage 2 (52), which is the other NREM sleep stage besides SWS, has gained only little attention. The current study investigated whether S2 during an afternoon nap contributes to the consolidation of declarative memories. Participants learned associations between faces and cities prior to a brief nap. A cued recall test was administered before and following the nap. Spindle, delta and slow oscillation activity was recorded during 52 in the nap following learning and in a control nap. Increases in spindle activity, delta activity, and slow oscillation activity in S2 in the nap following learning compared to the control nap were associated with enhanced retention of face-city associations. Furthermore, spindles tended to occur more frequently during up-states than down-states within slow oscillations during S2 following learning versus S2 of the control nap. These findings suggest that spindles, delta waves, and slow oscillations might promote memory consolidation not only during SWS, as shown earlier, but also during S2. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Globally, there is concern over the decline of bees, an ecologically important group of pollinating insects. Genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus F-ST was up to 0.53, and G'(ST) and D-est were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C. floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight the need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline of this and potentially other rare solitary bees.

AB  - Background: Biological invasions are one of the major causes of biodiversity loss, yet remain rather understudied in tropical environments. The Australian palm tree Archontophoenix cunninghamiana was introduced into Brazil for ornamental purposes, but has become an invasive species in urban and suburban forest patches. The substitution of A. cunninghamiana by the native palm Euterpe edulis has been proposed as a management action. Aims: We aimed to evaluate the regeneration potential of these two palm species in an Atlantic forest remnant in south-eastern Brazil where both species occur. Methods: We compared seedling establishment and seed longevity of both species through seed sowing, and also measured the contribution of A. cunninghamiana to the local seed rain and seed bank. Results: Nearly half of the non-anemochoric diaspores collected from the seed rain belonged to A. cunninghamiana, which represented a high propagule pressure in the community. The distribution of the alien palm seeds in the seed rain correlated with the distribution of nearby young and adult individuals inside the forest. Neither A. cunninghamiana nor E. edulis appeared to have a persistent seed bank in a burial experiment; seedling survival experiments suggested a much better performance for A. cunninghamiana, which had a survival rate of ca. 30% compared with a rate of only 3.5% for E. edulis. Conclusions: The results suggest a higher regeneration capacity for the alien palm over the native species when co-occurring in a forest fragment. Management actions are thus proposed to reduce a potential biological invasion process.

AB  - Marine aliens are non-native species that have been transported across major geographical barriers by human activities, involving vectors that move propagules along pathways. Species may also be newly observed in a geographical area due to range shifts, generally in association with climate change. Artificial structures are considered to be either man-made materials or natural materials shaped or displaced to serve a specific function for human activities. All types of artificial structures are currently increasing dramatically in coastal zones due to increasing human populations on coastlines. Most of the significant marine vectors and pathways involve mobile artificial structures and are reviewed here. These include shipping (ballast water and hull fouling) and aquaculture, including stock transfer and unintentional introductions, all of which can move species into new biogeographical provinces. Some types of structures frequently move long distances but have low fouling loads (e.g., commercial shipping), whereas others (e.g., barges and pontoons) can be hyperfouled due to long stationary periods such that when moved they transport mature fouling communities. We also examine the presence of alien marine species on static (immobile) artificial structures, which support different communities from those on natural hard substrata. We consider the role of these structures, such as coastal defences, artificial reefs, and offshore platforms, in the dispersal and abundance of alien species. Marinas include both mobile and immobile structures and are apparently particularly favourable habitats for many aliens. For example, in coastal North America approximately 90% of the alien species inhabiting hard substrata have been reported from docks and marinas. Detailed case studies of alien marine species (two seaweeds and four invertebrates) are provided, with an analysis of their origin, vectors of transport, habitat in the introduced range, and potential impact. Although there are exceptions, a large majority of marine alien species seem to be associated, at least for some of the time, with artificial structures. It is clear that artificial structures can pave the way and act as stepping stones or even corridors for some marine aliens, as do urban areas, roads and riparian environments in terrestrial ecosystems. The observed acceleration of spread rates for marine invasions over the course of the last two centuries may partly be a result of the increase of artificial structures in coastal environments coupled with greater activity of vectors.

AB  - We used 474 European plant species to analyse the impacts of climate and land-use change on the composition of habitat-specific species pools in Germany. We quantified changes in the probability of occurrence of species in a grid cell using an ensemble of three statistical modelling techniques, namely generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs) and random forests (RFs), under three scenarios (average change +2.2, +2.9, and +3.8 degrees C up to 2080). We evaluated the impact on single species occurrence and resulting species pools considering their affiliation to ten major terrestrial habitat types in both current (1961-90) and future projections (2051-80). Current habitat-specific species pools declined in size across all scenarios, e.g. by 24 +/- 13% (mean +/- s.d.) under the most severe scenario. We show that species responses may strongly vary among scenarios and different habitats with a minimum average projected range loss of 14% (+/- 18%; species typical to urban habitats under moderate climate change assumptions, average temperature increase +2.2 C) to a maximum average projected range loss of 56% (+/- 29%; species assemblages from mountain communities below the alpine zone at +3.8 degrees C). A separate analysis of species composition in habitat-specific species pools revealed a significant interaction between the scenario and the major habitat classes. We found a higher risk for habitat types with high conservation value characterised by a significant association between number of nationally endangered species and projected range loss in major habitats. Thus, habitat-specific management and application of measures favouring dispersal are required for mitigation of climate change impacts.

AB  - Longstanding policy debates over how prostitution/sex work should be thought about and responded to have been upended in the USA by a growing tendency to conflate the practice with sex trafficking. US law and social policy have converged most fully on this issue in a movement to eradicate what has come to be known as the commercial sexual exploitation of children. One outcome of this movement has been an expanded focus on prosecuting and imprisoning pimps and other legal adults who support or abet juridical minors involved in the sex trade. This paper will show that the simplistic, one-size-fits-all narrative of the child victim and the adult exploiter inherent in this policy does not reflect the realities of street-based sex work in the USA. After 2 years of ethnographic and social network research in two cities, we find that sex market-involved young people participate in a great diversity of market-facilitation relationships, many of which provide the only or the most crucial foundation for their support networks. A social policy based on a one-dimensional construction of the child victim and the adult exploiter not only endangers these crucial relationships but also disappears the real needs of young people involved in the exchange of sex for money.

AB  - Large conurbations are a significant source of the anthropogenic pollution and demographic differences between cities that result in a different pollution burden. The metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (MASP, population 20 million) accounts for one fifth of the Brazilian vehicular fleet. A feature of MASP is the amount of ethanol used by the vehicular fleet, known to exacerbate air quality. The study describes the diurnal behaviour of the submicron aerosol and relies on total particle number concentration, particle number size distribution, light scattering and light absorption measurements. Modelled planetary boundary layer (PBL) depth and air mass movement data were used to aid the interpretation. During morning rush-hour, stagnant air and a shallow PBL height favour the accumulation of aerosol pollution. During clear-sky conditions, there was a wind shift towards the edge of the city indicating a heat island effect with implications on particulate pollution levels at the site. The median total particle number concentration for the submicron aerosol typically varied in the range 1.6 x 10(4)-3.2 x 10(4) cm(-3) frequently exceeding 4 x 10(4) cm-3 during the day. During weekdays, nucleation-mode particles are responsible for most of the particles by numbers. The highest concentrations of total particle number concentrations and black carbon (BC) were observed on Fridays. Median diurnal values for light absorption and light scattering (at 637 nm wavelength) varied in the range 12-33 Mm(-1) and 21-64 Mm(-1), respectively. The former one is equal to 1.8-5.0 mu g m(-3) of BC. The growth of the PBL, from the morning rush-hour until noon, is consistent with the diurnal cycle of BC mass concentrations. Weekday hourly median single-scattering albedo (omega(0)) varied in the range 0.59-0.76. Overall, this suggests a top of atmosphere (TOA) warming effect. However, considering the low surface reflectance of urban areas, for the given range of omega(0), the TOA radiative forcing can be either positive or negative for the sources within the MASP. On the average, weekend omega(0) values were 0.074 higher than during weekdays. During 11% of the days, new particle formation (NPF) events occurred. The analysed events growth rates ranged between 9 and 25 nm h(-1). Sulphuric acid proxy concentrations calculated for the site were less than 5% of the concentration needed to explain the observed growth. Thus, other vapours are likely contributors to the observed growth.

TI  - Using Wind Data to Predict the Risk of Volcanic Eruption: An Example from Damavand Volcano, Iran
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - Damavand volcano is located 60 km to the East North-East of Tehran. It is a dormant stratovolcano outcrop in the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran and is the highest mountain (5670 m) in the Middle East and West Asia. Mazandaran Province, one of the most populous provinces by population density, Semnan and Gorgan provinces further east are neighbours of the Damavand. Volcanism in Damavand goes back to at least 1 Ma year ago and the latest eruption occurred 7000 years ago. Tephra dispersal in volcanoes strongly depends on atmospheric information in particular wind direction and velocity in stratospheric and tropospheric levels. We present an analysis of wind data to assess the hazards that would result from tephra fall in the cities and provinces neighbouring Damavand. Atmospheric data were provided from the Meteorological stations at Mehr-Abaad airport, Wyoming University and global data sets. We examine wind data from 17 standard pressure levels which cover from 5700 meter (Damavand peak) to 31 km above sea level. If Damavand moved into a state of unrest then a major explosive eruption is a plausible scenario that should be planned for. The results confirm that the area to the south and east of volcano will be affected by tephra. Communities around the southern and eastern flanks of the volcano also have high hazard. Wind data also shows the effects of season on dispersal of tephra from a 25 km high eruption column. Tephra dispersal is dominantly towards the east in all seasons for eruption columns up to 20 km above sea level. Mazandran, Semnan and Gorgan providence could be affected in this case. At 25 km-high eruption column and during the summer there are easterly winds; therefore, the tephra would disperse toward the east. In this case Tehran could experience a tephra fall deposit

AB  - Within the UK, local and regional government drives to reduce the quantity of waste being sent to landfill have led to an increase in small-scale composting schemes, instigated by local councils and not-for-profit organisations. The composting process relies upon the proliferation of microorganisms, leading to their emission into the ambient environment. In this investigative study, total bacteria and Aspergillus fumigatus emitted from a small-scale composting facility in central London were measured in different spatial and temporal dimensions. Bioaerosols did not disperse in concentrations significantly higher than those measured at 'background' locations, where maximum geometric mean was 55 x 10(2) Colony Forming Units (CFU) per m(-3). Concentrations on-site and at the nearest potential receptor were comparable to those found at commercial facilities, reaching 25 x 10(4) and 29 x 10(3) CFU m(-3) for total bacteria and A. fumigatus respectively. The room housing the facility was contaminated by moulds; likely to result from high relative humidity of the air (consistently above 80% during this study), building material, and the generation of organic dust. The complex diurnal meteorological variations of urban environments are likely to influence bioaerosol dispersal, and consequent exposure risk for sensitive receptors. Site planning tools including Geographical Information Systems (GIS) mapping with buffer zones around schools and hospitals, and use of computerised models for the design of rooms housing urban composting facilities are proposed as methods for reducing the risk of occupational and off-site receptor exposure.

AB  - With her book "Family and social network" Elisabeth Bott has inspired several follow-up Studies. In her study, Bott pointed out that social networks, as a social environment, are incorporated into family life, and therefore play an important role in the division of work within a family. While studies of egocentric network analysis have progressed since the publication of the book, Bott's thesis will nonetheless serve as the starting point of this study. If Elisabeth Bott's findings are reliable, we should find that families with similar behaviour have concurrent structures of characteristics within their networks. Results of a study conducted in Germany in 2003 indicate on the one hand that, in the meantime complementary applied gender roles have become more differentiated, and that relationships between married couples have become more egalitarian with regard to the division of work within the households. On the other hand, network relationships are organized functionally, and are independent of the division of work in the family. In contrast to the family structure of the 1960s, and as a result of the shift in social demands made on families, it appears that a functional separation of the external and internal affairs of families with children has occurred.

AB  - The author uses wheelchair mobility to examine the distinction (based on the historical opposition of two models of disability - an individual model and a social model) between the individual experience and the social experience of disability. In looking at the interaction between the person and the wheelchair, she demonstrates that there is continuity in people's experiences: their mobility (its form and extent) is the result of a process of reciprocal adaptation with their wheelchairs and their environment, which involves their bodies. In this process, the status of the wheelchair (as an incorporated or outside object) and of a person's space for movement (both social and physical) are correlatively and gradually defined. Analysis of these co-definition processes is important, because it allows us to identify the diversity of the resources - other people, objects, urban planning, services - upon which people rely in order to be able to move around and act in wheelchairs and in different public and private spaces.

AB  - Modernism and regionalism in Brazil: between innovation and tradition
   The interpretations of modernism in Brazil have tended to concentrate on the avantgardes that emerged in the first two decades of the 20th century in Brazil's two most important cities: Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. This article examines the spread of literary modernism from the 1930s onwards into three regions on the periphery of the country's innovative impulse, but which nonetheless possessed well-established cultures - the Northeast, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul - and which produced over the following years Brazil's most flourishing literature. From a literary viewpoint, therefore, the new ideas became radicalized precisely in the contexts most resistant to modern lifestyles. As well as investigating this movement towards states on the side-lines of modern culture, the text proposes to analyze the diversity of this literature vis-a-vis the impasses faced by these regions during the modernization process. Setting out from this underlying problem, it explores the connections between the Northeastern social novels, the Minas Gerais subjectivist literature and the gaucho (southern Brazilian) historical novel with the particularity and diversity of the social and political tensions experienced by these regional elites in clear decline. A special focus on the literature of mineiro author Lucio Cardoso helps shed light on the conflicts that permeated the field as a whole, since, though always particular, in Cardoso's work these tensions attain their most virulent expression.

AB  - Land movements are natural phenomena that affect the evolution of landforms and cause damage of social, physical and economical order. The main objective of the present study is to identify the different types of mass movements that occurred in San Pedro river basin-Nova Friburgo municipality-in January, 2012, and to correlate them with the types of vegetal covering and frequency and intensity of rainfalls. Points of mass movement were georeferenced using high precision PROMARK3 GPS and, later a digital elevation model (DEM) of the basin was prepared associated to a map of land use. Daily rainfall data was obtained through conventional rain gauges and those from the THIES TLX-MET Automated Weather Station. From the 33 scars mapped in the basin (23.71 km(2)), 17 are on forest area (12.8 km(2)), 06 in areas of conventional agriculture (3.6 km(2)), 08 in fallow areas (0.9 km(2)), 01 in pasture area (1.9 km(2)) and the rest represent urban area, rocky outcrop and clouds/shadows totaling (4.37 km(2)). The mass movements mapped are related to translational slides and mass flows. Data demonstrates that November and December, 2010 and January 2011 presented precipitation values above the mean. On 11/01/2011 there was a precipitation of 209 mm, representing 63% of the precipitation of that month. The most important rainfall that caused the landslides was between 21: 50 h (11/01) and 7: 10 h (12/01) reaching a total of 145.2 mm. The mass movements that occurred in the region are related to a high precipitation index and antecedent soil moisture.

AB  - The attempt to occupy the London Stock Exchange and the subsequent camps established at St Paul's Cathedral and other locations bordering the City of London have created new dynamics in social protest. Museums and other public collecting institutions face major challenges in preserving both the material culture and the social experience of this movement, which are often ephemeral in form or difficult to record in a rapidly changing environment. The danger of oversimplifying or misrepresenting meanings within this protest culture is ever-present. Yet, this danger has been mitigated by the self-chronicling and archiving tendencies of the Occupy movement itself, particularly its extensive use of social media and web-based resources.

AB  - We followed radio-collared striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) from January 2004 December 2005 in two urban areas of Flagstaff, Arizona, USA to determine seasonal patterns of movement and home-range size. We also used automated cameras to determine the potential for inter- and intraspecific interaction at skunks' diurnal resting sites and nocturnal focal locations. We found no difference between sexes in nightly rates of travel or in size of seasonal home range. Nightly rates of travel were greatest in the postbreeding months (May-July) and smallest from November to February, consistent with larger home ranges (95% kernel estimates) from March-August and smaller home ranges from September-February. Sixty-three percent of monitored males and 38% of monitored females crossed the urban-wildland interface, in at least one direction on at least one night, and some remained outside the urban area for days or weeks, indicating that skunks could act as vectors of disease across the urban-wildland interface. We recorded co-occurrence of skunks with domestic cats (Felis domesticus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and other skunks at focal locations and diurnal retreats used by skunks, suggesting these areas are potential sites for both inter- and intraspecific rabies transmission and could be targeted by wildlife managers during trapping or vaccination programs.

AB  - Tensions between activists and the homeless were common across different Occupy locations. This article focuses on the Occupy movement in downtown El Paso, Texas. It discusses the interactions between activists and homeless people. Initially, as the Occupiers camped in the square they excluded the homeless. A pivotal point was when some Occupiers spoke out against the mistreatment of the homeless arguing that these prejudiced actions were examples of classism. Furthermore, they argued that the homeless exemplified an important segment of the 99%. The contradictions that the homeless population brought to the movement allowed for the movement to grow. The tensions disappeared once the homeless took particular roles in the maintenance of the camp and the logistics needed to keep it running. This justified the presence of these individuals in the eyes of others. This also gave the homeless people a different identity, and normalized their sleeping arrangements since everyone in the camp was sleeping in urban public areas. By becoming Occupiers, homeless individuals gained a new political role that was different from that of being a recipient of charity and services. Some homeless people even credit the activities they carried with the Occupy El Paso movement for helping them recover from addiction and their eventual attainment of housing. The acceptance of homeless people as Occupiers gave coherence and strengthened the movement, while simultaneously providing dignity and solidarity for homeless people.

AB  - Population exposure to pollutants is important for studies on the exposure-response relationship. However, it is difficult to evaluate population exposure to non-conventional pollutants due to limited data on concentration levels and the movement patterns of inhabitants. In this study, an air dispersion model was used to simulate N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) concentrations, as a proxy to monitoring concentrations. A total of 1289 randomly selected household representatives were surveyed to obtain information on movement characteristics. Subsequently, population movement patterns were combined with DMF concentration levels on maps of 100 mx100 m resolution to calculate population exposure. During 2008, the estimated population exposure to DMF ranged from 0.002 to 0.64 mg/m(3). The highest level of population exposure to DMF was found in the north and northwest sub-districts of the study area, ranging from 0.42 to 0.64 mg/m(3). The population exposure to DMF for different occupational groups indicated that retired people and farmers were vulnerable subpopulations among people highly exposed to DMF. This was mainly because they spent most time at home where the DMF concentration was high. As pollutant concentrations were divided into small grids, we found that exposure levels were substantially impacted by population movement characteristics.

AB  - Context. Scat genotyping has not been routinely used to measure fox (Vulpes vulpes) abundance and our study sought to provide a benchmark for further technique development and assessment of field methods.
   Aims. This study sought to provide a comparative assessment of some common methods used to determine fox density and contrast their success with scat DNA genotyping.
   Methods. DNA recovered from fox scats was used to genotype individual red foxes and determine their abundance at four transects. Population indices were also developed from bait take, scat counts and sand plot tracks using index-manipulation-index (IMI) procedures on the same transects. Known samples of foxes were taken from two treatment transects using cyanide delivered in the M-44 ejector to manipulate the population and to recover foxes at the end of the trial.
   Key results. Replicated counts on a 41-km-spotlight transect at the field site before and after the population manipulation had low variance and good correlation (r(2) = 0.79, P < 0.01). Scat genotypes revealed 54 foxes in eight days and, when combined with biopsy DNA from recovered foxes, a minimum known to be alive (KTBA) density of between 1.6 and 5 foxes km(-1) was calculated for the transects. Overall, 15/30 (50%) of all recovered foxes had not been detected by scat genotyping, 23/53 (49%) of KTBA genotypes were detected only once and 5/54 (9.5%) of foxes were found to have moved between two transects.
   Conclusions. At transects where population manipulation occurred, surviving individuals contributed significantly more scats than at the control transects and some individuals were detected at bait stations at a much greater frequency. This strongly suggested that they had contributed disproportionately to some IMI density estimates that were probably influenced by a change in the activity of some individuals rather than changes in population density alone. At one transect, eight foxes were confirmed to be present by spotlight surveys and were detected by scat and KTBA genotypes, yet were undetected by scat, bait station and sand plot indices.
   Implications. Scat and other DNA-based survey techniques provide a great deal of information about the identification and movement of individuals and if DNA sampling methods can be made more efficient they have the potential to provide accurate abundance estimates that are independent of the control technique.

AB  - Two topics of great importance to conservation biologists and managers are the impact of habitat degradation on species' distributions and the effects of invasive species on the decline of other species. I evaluate the interaction of these threats by comparing the impact of a native invasive amphibian species on a formerly allotopic amphibian species in disturbed versus undisturbed habitat. Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus fowleri) historically thrived in a range of habitats Including urban and suburban areas in the mid-twentieth century, but has recently undergone a range contraction concurrent with the spread of the Coastal Plain Toad (Incilius nebulifer) into recently disturbed habitat. Contemporary surveys of historical collection sites obtained from museum records of vouchered specimens were used to document changes in the distribution of both species over the past half-century. Temporal changes in habitat disturbance at collection sites were detected by comparing historical aerial photographs with current remote sensing data. Analysis of species' distribution in different disturbance levels showed that A. fowleri is unaffected by disturbance in areas where I. nebulifer is absent, but at sites where the species are sympatric the distribution of A. fowleri in degraded habitat contracted while the expansion of I. nebulifer increased substantially. This study demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat alteration can facilitate dispersal and colonization by an invasive species, resulting in the significant decline of a native species that is otherwise tolerant of disturbance.

TI  - Second-Wave Cohousing: A Modern Utopia?
T2  - UTOPIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Cohousing is an increasingly popular form of tenure that combines elements of private and collective ownership and affords its occupants a. combination of the advantages of individual proprietorship with some of the benefits of living in a community that shares some of its space and activities. People join cohousing groups because they believe that there is something wrong with life in most villages, towns, and cities and they want to develop a better alternative. Sometimes this has been seen to articulate a utopian aspiration to secure a better way of living, of the kind more normally associated with self-consciously intentional communities. But many influential spokespeople in the contemporary cohousing movement, in North America particularly, deny this association and take an explicitly. anti-utopian stance, distancing cohousing from the communal movement and intentional communities. This article undertakes an examination of cohousing in North America today and asks the following questions: What is the real character of people's lived experience with modern cohousing? Why do people choose cohousing? Is it a form of intentional community? Is it utopian? Or is it just an attractive forth of housing tenure for people who want a nice place to live with good neighbors?

AB  - 'El Misti' volcano near the city of Arequipa in south Peru produced a Plinian eruption c.2030 yr BP that resulted in a tephra deposit consisting of three fallout layers, several pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits, a late stage, small debris-avalanche deposit, and lahar deposits. This VEI 4 Plinian eruption of El Misti has been selected as one of the reference eruptions for the hazard assessment and risk mitigation plan for the city of Arequipa.
   The Plinian column of this eruption rose up to 21-24 km and produced a tephra deposit over an area of at least 2580 km(2) within the 5 cm-isopach line. The dispersal axis is oriented SW, i.e. towards the area of the basin and city of Arequipa. Later pumice- and lithic-rich PDC deposits were emplaced into radial valleys extending from the volcano up to a distance of at least 13 km. The eruption produced a minimum total bulk volume of 1.2 km(3) (0.71 km(3) DRE volume) of tephra and PDC deposits. Components of the tephra deposit consist of beige, gray and banded pumices, lithic fragments, a minor amount of cogenetic dacite clasts, and free crystals. The minimum volume of the tephra deposit varies between 0.2 and 0.6 km3 (exponential, power-law integration and inversion of TEPHRA2 analytical model). The tephra deposit is characterized by a bulk density of 1500 kg/m(3) which results in a mass of 2.5-9.0 x 10(11) kg. The maximum mass discharge rate (MDR) is 1.1 x 10(8) kg/s based on a plume height of 24 km. The estimated duration of the Plinian eruption ranges between 0.6 and 2.3 h.
   Grain size distribution, componentry, and SEM analyses of both the tephra and PDC deposits, combined with the reconstructed stratigraphic sequence of the deposit, suggest that the eruption took place in five stages: (1) generation of a 21-24 km-high eruptive column that deposited the lower tephra layer; (2) collapse of the crater walls and partial obstruction of the vent during a period of decreased intensity, which led to the formation of a thin sand-sized, lithic-rich, middle tephra layer; (3) resurgence of a Plinian eruption column that formed the upper tephra layer; (4) subsequent collapse of the column that produced the PDC deposits; and (5) failure of the hydrothermally altered part of the crater rim towards the S and SE that resulted in a coarse, lithic-rich debris-avalanche deposit. Geochemical and mineralogical data obtained from the banded pumices suggest a mechanical mixing between two magma batches of dacite (similar to 70% SiO2) and andesite (61.7-64.1% SiO2) prior to eruption. The abundance of altered lithics in the uppermost tephra layer suggests that the hydrothermal system operating in the summit area of the volcano was partially disrupted and the vent enlarged just before the transition to the collapse of the column.

AB  - Tunisia is submitted to numerous small topographic displacements due to both the geodynamic of the Eurasian-African plates convergence, and to important anthropic actions such as oil production, underground water pumping, mine extraction and linked post-mining displacements. We propose herein to study the latter and locate, characterize, and quantify small topographic displacement fields due to the production of underground phosphate mines in central Tunisia. After having acquired and processed 17 radar images (ERS 1 and 2) of the central Tunisia (Gafsa area) through Differential Interferometry (DInSAR), we clearly observed local subsidence that we interprete as corresponding to mine exploitation of the underground Moulares Phosphates mines (southern Atlas of Tunisia). Field studies (circular normal faults located above the Phosphate extraction area) confirm the movement revealed by DinSAR. Also, DInSAR allows us to monitor temporal variations of the small vertical displacements on this specific area and since the collapse occurred near an urban area (Moulares city), this problem can be considered a potential anthropic risk.

AB  - Urban flooding is an increasingly alarming issue in terms of public safety and property damage. Climate change and its possible effects on the occurrence of more frequent extreme weather events have become an important topic in the area of global politics, science and engineering of today's world. The proper design of urban drainage systems and analysis of their hydraulic performance to secure flood protection in urban areas is a challenging task of urban water management. High resolution surface data describing hydrologic and hydraulic properties of complex urban areas is the prerequisite to more accurately describe and simulate the flood water movement and thereby to take adequate measures against urban flooding. LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) point cloud is an efficient way of generating high resolution digital surface model (DSM) of any study area. This paper presents an approach to segment LiDAR point cloud into ground and non-ground points based on slope change, height variation and standard deviation of neighbouring points. The non-ground points are later classified into buildings and trees by using an approach based on surface roughness and planar component calculation. Streets play an important role in terms of surface runoff generation. A semiautomatic approach has been developed to extract street point candidates from LiDAR data. A knowledge based expert system has been implemented to identify impervious surfaces (other than street) and grassland. Finally future ideas will be described to detect other surface drainage elements such as property boundary walls and slope information in the neighbourhood of the street as they are believed to guide the flood water flow and influence their possible intrusion into the private property (garage, basement).

AB  - An active migratory movement to Central Asia marked the second half of the 19th century. A considerable part of migrants settled in old Central Asian cities establishing a separated new or Russian part. The ethnic composition of the migrated population was very different. The most numerous group included Russian migrants (among them Ukrainians, Byelorussians). Also large diasporas were made up by Tatars, Poles, Jews, Germans, Armenians and Greeks, as well as by foreigners. The number of migrants increased year after year. So in the period from 1871 to 1897, the number of Tatars in new Tashkent increased by 26,5 times, of Jews. by 21 times, of Germans. by 20 times and of Poles. by 122.5 times. Among the residents of the Russian part in Central Asian cities were officials, military men, employees and workers, entrepreneurs and businessmen, people of science and art. Bulks of Tatars were busy in the sphere of trade and small-scale production; many of them were skilled workers. The Jews occupied the leading positions in the economy of Central Asia and were the main initiators in distribution of Russian goods in Central Asia. A lot of military and officials, representatives of intellectual labour were among the Germans. Initially, Russian power found skilled workers among Armenians, especially using them for the railway construction. But over time merchants, entrepreneurs, craftsmen appeared among the Armenians. Firstly, persons, who did military service and settled in the region, formed the Polish community. Then officials, teachers, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, engineers, skilled workers and craftsmen joined them. The Greeks achieved great success in the economic sector; office workers were also among them. The Russian administration did not put any obstacles to their resettlement at first, but later it accepted that the Tatars were competitors who exerted cultural impact on the local population; it also recognized the Jews to be its competitors in trade and financial issues. Migrants of different ethnic communities living within borders of the new city preferred to settle in quite compactly in separated quarters and streets. So they could recreate their usual way of life, linguistic and cultural environment. But in spite of the difference in faith and nationality, the situation specificity of migrants from Russia living in Muslim Central Asia forced them to recognize their unity. In general, they preferred to get together in contrast to local residents whom they treated quite carefully. However, there were no limits for local inhabitants and they could also settle in the Russian part.

AB  - Stroke is the main cause of motor and cognitive disabilities requiring therapy in the world. Therefor it is important to develop rehabilitation technology that allows individuals who had suffered a stroke to practice intensive movement training without the expense of an always-present therapist. We have developed a low-cost vision-based system that allows stroke survivors to practice arm movement exercises at home or at the clinic, with periodic interactions with a therapist. The system integrates a virtual environment for facilitating repetitive movement training, with computer vision algorithms that track the hand of a patient, using an inexpensive camera and a personal computer. This system, called Gesture Therapy, includes a gripper with a pressure sensor to include hand and finger rehabilitation; and it tracks the head of the patient to detect and avoid trunk compensation. It has been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial at the National Institute for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City, comparing it with conventional occupational therapy. In this paper we describe the latest version of the Gesture Therapy System and summarize the results of the clinical trail.

AB  - Conceptualisations of movement and mobility within geography are increasingly complicating reductive and sedentarist understandings that have tended to theorise mobility either as meaningless, or as the practical outcome of 'rational' decision makers. Until quite recently there has been a sedentarist bias in cultural geographic enquiry that has resulted in negative readings of mobility as insensate, polluting and harmful. Conversely, while transport geography has long explored people's daily mobility, it has used a primarily quantitative toolkit to explore the 'rational' reasons why movement occurs. The corollary of this has been an assumption that meaning is derived from points A and B, and an emphasis on explaining travel choice by eliciting linguistic accounts of movement. More recent research has begun to problematise such understandings and in doing so illuminate potential avenues of enquiry. Consequently, this review makes an argument for research into cycling to explore the content of the line between A and B in order to highlight the often fleeting and ephemeral meanings that can contribute significantly to what movement means. An essential part of this project is for research to focus on the 'immaterial' embodied and sensory aspects of mobility that have previously been neglected or marginalised. In order to realise these goals, this article also makes a case for broadening out the palette of methods used to study mobility and discusses the use of video as one possible way to provide more nuanced accounts of people's journeys.

AB  - We studied the effects of land use changes on flow regime and water chemistry of headwater streams in the highlands of Chiapas, a region in southern Mexico that has experienced high rates of deforestation in the last decades. Samples for water chemistry were collected and discharge was measured between September 2007 and August 2008 at eight streams that differed in the land uses of their riparian and catchment areas, including streams draining protected forested areas. Streams with high forest cover (> 70%) in their catchments maintained flow through the year. Streams draining more disturbed catchments exhibited reduced or no flow for 4-6 months during the dry season. Nitrate concentrations were lower at streams draining forested catchments while highest concentrations were measured where conventional agriculture covered a high proportion of the catchment and riparian zone. Highest phosphorus concentrations occurred at the catchment where poultry manure was applied as fertilizer. Differences between forest streams and those draining disturbed areas were correlated with the proportion of forest and agriculture in the riparian zone. Variation in stream variables among sampling dates was lower at the forest sites than at the more disturbed study streams. Conversion of forest into agriculture and urban areas is affecting flow regime and increasing nutrient concentrations, although the magnitude of the impacts are influenced by the type of agricultural practices and the alteration of the riparian zone.

AB  - Germany is one of the very few countries in the world with deserter monuments. Sparked by the Filbinger affair of 1978 and the protests of the German peace movement against NATO rearmament in the 1980s, a deserter monument movement emerged in numerous German cities, and by 2010 some 25 deserter monuments had been established across the country. These monuments fall into two main categories: those which specifically commemorate German soldiers who deserted from the Wehrmacht in the Second World War and those which are dedicated to honouring desertion as a matter of principle. Both types of monument qualify as a form of counter-monument, seeking to provoke reflection about traditional soldierly values and to challenge existing war memorials. The deserter monument movement and the monuments which it has spawned have played a significant role in shifting public perceptions about deserters from the Wehrmacht - leading to legal rehabilitation of the deserters in May 2002 - and have also contributed to the broader public debate about the role of the Wehrmacht in Hitler's 'war of annihilation'. The monuments occupy an important place in the evolving 'memory culture' (Erinnerungskultur) of contemporary Germany, representing one example of continuing German attempts to rewrite the public narrative of German war experience.

AB  - The present work exposes the results of a study conducted in the second semester of 2008 about the present trends of the process of religious pluralization in Bogota city. The report describes the process of religious change that occurs in the city, especially the expansion of the Pentecostal movement, which implies a simultaneous decrease in the percentage of the population which identifies with Catholicism. The paper proposes, in addition, some hypotheses that permit the explanation of this process of change, for example, the intensity of the pentecostal practice and the strategic use of the mass media by this religious group. Finally, the article explores some implications of religious change in the Colombian political field, and the relation of religious change to attitudes considered fundamental for the construction of citizenship in pluralistic societies, such as tolerance and respect for minorities.

AB  - This paper aims to explore the dynamic of agricultural land due to the urbanization pressure in Bangkok metropolis (Thailand), which is necessary for policy suggestion of land preservation. In this process, GIS technique and satellite image taken in year 2000 and 2006 were used together with field survey.
   The conversion between types of agricultural lands occurred in a ripple-like order moving further away from city centre. Orchard and rice field, which were once located in the inner city, were relocated to the outer area because of the replacement by vegetable farm and flower garden. This movement appeared because each agricultural activity had different level of urbanization resistance. This resistance depended on 1) investment, 2) period to get the first crop, 3) crop density per year, 4) rate of return from each crop, and 5) rick of flood. Policy and plan for agricultural land preservation was suggested base on this finding.

AB  - Living in the street using public spaces is not a problem involving adults alone. The possibility of finding children, young people and even whole families living in the so-called "situation of street" is increasing. While this is a growing problem and multidimensional, and while is considered as a more extreme and more visible social, the conceptualizations that occur around homeless people do not take into account the substantial aspects of the reality daily faced by its speakers. Thus, the movement of these subjects around the city is loaded of negative attributes and exterior qualities that point them as dangerous and guilty of their situation. This article proposes realizing how the homeless, through the development of various tactics, transform and load of significance their daily passing, the public space in which they carry out their daily life and subjectivity.

AB  - The authors aim to describe student attendance-mobility within a large urban district in ways that are meaningful and useful to schools and the community. First, the prevalence of mobility and nonattendance in Grades 1-12 across all students and by gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic subgroups is presented. Second, the impact on student mathematics achievement is examined. Results show that nonattendance-mobility negatively impact mathematics achievement as measured by the state's assessment, even after controlling for socioeconomic status and gender. Interestingly, there is not a differential impact across ethnicities. Black and White subgroups show similar patterns of achievement across attendance and mobility levels. Finally, the authors take a closer look at the 10 district high schools to determine where nonattendance-mobility is of particular concern. Implications for districts are discussed in terms of targeting the extent of the problem and where it is occurring, using that information to improve attendance and reduce mobility, and finally, instituting systematic approaches to deal with student movement in and out of schools.

AB  - In Urban Rail Transit (URT) stations, safety problems and delays occur, because of the complicated passenger organization processes, space and facility layouts, mass composition and movement. This paper analyzed the structure of the mass as well as the features and behaviors of passenger groups in stations. First, we explored the passenger organization processes, the hierarchical structure of the space, the passenger service network and the hierarchical of the mass. Second, we showed a hierarchical model of the mass, and studied both individuals and groups in their features, behaviors and impact on safety and efficiencies of the crowd. Third, we built a process model to demonstrate mass behaviors. Last, we developed a simulation framework of URT station, based on the models and taking into considerations of passenger organization, train operation and space layout.

AB  - Lateral soil movement due to surcharge loads and pit excavation often occurs in urban construction. The lateral soil movement may generate additional internal forces and deformation in pile foundation of adjacent buildings, and may lead to the damage of adjacent pile foundation and engineering accidents. Based on the Winkler's foundation model and deformation compatibility condition of pile and soil, the horizontal displacement control equation of a single pile is established. According to the differential relations between the internal forces and displacements, the two-stage method is adopted to solve the equations. With the typical engineering accident, the influence of lateral soil movements on adjacent pile foundation is investigated by parametric analysis of the pile bearing capacity. The analysis shows that the stability of retaining wall and the excavation depth have an important impact on the safety of adjacent pile foundation. One of possible causes resulting in the collapse accident of a high-rise building in Shanghai is obtained from the analysis.

AB  - Occupied the night after the worldwide mobilisation of 15 October 2011, the #hotelmadrid was an intensive, 50-day-long political experiment that turned an abandoned hotel in the heart of the Spanish capital into a radical political space and the perceived node of the indignados movement. The squatting of the hotel accomplishes key demands related to 'real democracy' and the re-appropriation of public space as a political space with claims for the right to housing, providing an excellent example for the discussion of the shifting dimensions of emancipatory struggles that emerged in the course of the Spanish 15-M Movement. In this regard, squatters engage actively against neoliberalism, promote the right to housing and convert such mobilisation into a forward-looking project that not only reclaims but also takes, socialising private properties through common repossession. Referring to strategic disobedience we discuss how protest camps, public political assemblies and squatting create spaces of citizenship and intend to crack naturalised facets of capitalism such as the powerful discourse about property rights.

KW  - OBESITY
AB  - Growing concern over childhood obesity has prompted a focus on underlying epidemics of physical inactivity and poor nutrition. Regarding the former, there is increasing understanding that behavior change promotion alone has not increased population physical activity levels and that an ecological approach is necessary. Therefore, the public health profession has moved beyond traditional behavior change campaigns toward a growing focus on altering policies and the built environment to create settings that support increases in routine, not just exercise or leisure time, physical activity among children. A survey of the literature suggests four broad factors that define settings where routine physical activity, especially active transportation, is more likely to occur:
   a compact variety of land uses, with a mix of destinations in close proximity;
   a comprehensive network of bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities;
   inviting and functional site designs for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users;
   safety and access for users of all ages, incomes, abilities and disabilities.
   Although these principles are increasingly accepted as beneficial, not just to health but to a community's economic, environmental, and social well-being, many contemporary ordinances and development practices undermine these outcomes. Therefore, five specific policy and intervention approaches are recommended to guide communities to these outcomes:
   1. zoning and development policies to protect open space, contain sprawl, and focus investment toward thriving, mixed down-towns and village centers;
   2. Complete Streets policies, which require roadways that are safe and functional for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users, as well as motor vehicles;
   3. a transportation-(not just recreation-) oriented trail network;
   4. creation of bicycle-and transit-friendly infrastructure and incentive policies;
   5. development of policy-based Safe Routes to School interventions.
   This proposed intervention framework requires evaluation both of effectiveness in increasing childhood physical activity and of the most promising means of getting policies implemented.

AB  - In the decades leading up to the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, student activism both within Iran as well as abroad played a significant role in developing widespread opposition to Shah Reza Pahlavi's dictatorial government. Youth mobilisation among the Iranian student diaspora reached a pinnacle during the years immediately preceding the revolution and drew direct connections with other anti-imperialist, pro-democratic campaigns simultaneously occurring around the world. In the US/Mexico border city, El Paso, Texas, this global phenomenon manifested in the cross-cultural collaboration of Chicano and Iranian student activists. This paper presents a micro-history of the interethnic collaborative activism of these two groups; and how it provided a community of solidarity for the Iranian youth who comprised a social base that helped bring about the Iranian Revolution.

AB  - Radiation dispersal devices (RDDs), or dirty bombs, are terrorist weapons designed to scatter radioactive materials in large urban areas. Although the main intent of a RDD is to produce general panic and chaos, other impacts such as health, environmental, property and economical damage may also occur. Although one certain method of reducing health risks from a RDD event is to remove the radioactive contaminants from the environment immediately, rapid cleanup after a RDD event may be impossible in many cases. However, preventing the migration of the radioactive contaminant is crucial. Although it may be necessary to allow the contaminant to remain in place, preventing its migration is still essential. Fixatives can reduce or eliminating migration potential of a contaminant introduced by a RDD. This paper reviews the significance of fixatives in response to a RDD event and some of the products which have been identified for such a purpose. Many of the products are promising for application. However, many reports lack quantitative information to allow for effective comparative evaluation. Further, key parameters, such as shelf life and product toxicity, are not typically evaluated. We recommend that standardized performance parameters be established to allow for better comparative evaluation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificially constructed wetlands offer a low-cost treatment alternative to remove a number of pollutants found in effluent water from industry, mining, agriculture, and urban areas. The determination of treatment efficiency cannot be determined without understanding the flow dynamics of individual parcels of water through the wetland. A method for tracking parcels of water is proposed, using Rhodamine-WT as a tracer. A series of tracer tests were conducted on a 1.2 ha treatment wetland. Bromide and Rhodamine-WT were simultaneously dosed into the inlet and monitored at 60 sampling locations for 5 weeks. Rhodamine-WT concentrations were found to be coincident with bromide. For all three events the relationship between Rhodamine-WT concentration and bromide concentration was linear at each sampling point with a slope of 0.82. The peak concentration of Rhodamine-WT and bromide was also found to coincide throughout the wetland. Rhodamine-WT can be used to determine the movement of individual parcels of water through a treatment wetland and used to determine treatment efficiencies at individual locations within a wetland.

AB  - This paper describes the application of a wireless sensor network to a 31 meter-tall medieval tower located in the city of Trento, Italy. The effort is motivated by preservation of the integrity of a set of frescoes decorating the room on the second floor, representing one of most important International Gothic artworks in Europe. The specific application demanded development of customized hardware and software. The wireless module selected as the core platform allows reliable wireless communication at low cost with a long service life. Sensors include accelerometers, deformation gauges, and thermometers. A multi-hop data collection protocol was applied in the software to improve the system's flexibility and scalability. The system has been operating since September 2008, and in recent months the data loss ratio was estimated as less than 0.01%. The data acquired so far are in agreement with the prediction resulting a priori from the 3-dimensional FEM. Based on these data a Bayesian updating procedure is employed to real-time estimate the probability of abnormal condition states. This first period of operation demonstrated the stability and reliability of the system, and its ability to recognize any possible occurrence of abnormal conditions that could jeopardize the integrity of the frescos.

AB  - The northern area of Crdoba province (southern Spain) is characterised by a high spatial distribution of Quercus species. In Crdoba city, high airborne Quercus pollen counts are detected during spring despite the low presence of Quercus populations in the Guadalquivir Valley, where this city is located. This study sought to clarify and identify the potential origin of the different Quercus peaks detected in this city and chart the possible relationship between Quercus pollen curves and air-mass movements. For this purpose, an integrated study of daily and intra-diurnal Quercus pollen counts and back-trajectory analysis was performed over the March-June period of the years 2006-2008. The application of cluster techniques to back trajectory enabled the identification of six different types of air-mass movement. As a function of frequency, two different air-mass groups were identified: the main group comprised Local, Slower Northwest and Mediterranean movements, characterised by higher frequencies; a second group consisting of North, Faster Northwest and Southwest trajectories occurred less frequently over the study period. Although a significant correlation was observed between Quercus airborne pollen counts recorded in Crdoba city and the influence of the Mediterranean air-mass movements, the strongest positive correlation was found between North and Northwest air-mass movements and daily Quercus pollen counts. These results would confirm both that the major Quercus pollen sources are located at different distances north of the city and a new pollen source is also located south of the province, beyond the Guadalquivir valley, related to the arrival of Mediterranean air masses. The northern source appears to be linked to regional transport and the southern source to long-range transport.

AB  - In recent decades, local governments in the United States have repeatedly turned to activism to protest higher government policies, or to generate policy movement in an expanding array of domestic and foreign policy areas. There has been little scholarly effort, however, to categorize the behaviors of local activism or to understand why it occurs. This conceptual article introduces local activism as a political strategy comprised of several progressively aggressive behaviors. A typology for these activist behaviors is suggested and the potential goals and motivations of local activists explored, along with recent changes to the intergovernmental environment that may have provided both cause and political incentive for local activism.

AB  - Riparian landscapes are natural habitats of unique ecological, environmental and scenic values. which are highly sensitive to human intervention and impact. Yet, due to their qualities, and especially the presence of water, they are also usually attractive for recreation purposes. This is more so in and and semi-arid zones like Israel. Nevertheless, in the past, the importance of riparian landscapes in Israel did not receive adequate attention in policy and planning. As a result, over the years they were exposed to various negative impacts, including pollution by industrial and agricultural effluents, diversion of water for agricultural and other purposes, and land use conflicts. Although in recent years, with the growing awareness of their ecological and recreational potential, considerable efforts are being invested in the rehabilitation of deteriorated riparian landscapes, their protection is still deficient.
   This article reviews and examines policy tools used for the protection of riparian landscapes in Israel, focusing on legislation, institutional structure and physical planning as they emerge from relevant laws, reports and literature. It reveals, among others, gaps and deficiencies in legislation, institutional dualities along with split authorities both expressing a particularistic approach, and, until recently, lack of relevant designated planning. The article concludes by offering some suggestions for improving the protection of riparian landscapes in Israel, including: integration of existing laws based on a whole watershed approach: reorganization of institutional structure to facilitate a national vision of riparian landscapes rather than the existing particularistic approach; formulation of structured planning procedures to ensure the realization of designated national plans: and promotion of awareness to riparian values at various levels.

AB  - Recently, in several areas of the Middle East, a sharp increase of cutaneous leishmaniasis was observed in suburbs of larger towns including Jerusalem. In some of these areas, poor housing conditions and unsuitable waste management was suspected to provide ideal conditions for sand fly breeding, but hard data on diurnal resting sites and breeding habitats of most sand fly species are scant. In this study, we chose 16 sites on both slopes and the bottom of a natural valley in the Judean Desert to conduct a survey of sand fly distribution with emergence traps. Altogether, 1,261 sand flies, 52% Phlebotomus syriacus, 22% P. sergenti, 14% P. papatasi and 12% P. tobbi were caught. About two thirds of the flies caught were resting, while the other third emerged from breeding sites. All four species showed clear preferences for resting and breeding sites, but generally, most sand flies were breeding in the more humid habitats, namely the bottom of the valley, the adjacent north facing slope, terraces on the north facing slope, and caves. The vegetation cover also appeared to be important for resting habitats; on the bottom of the valley more than six times as many sand flies were collected in areas covered by dense vegetation than in areas with low vegetation cover. P. sergenti seemed also to better tolerate the drier habitats, which might explain the abundance of this species in the arid Judean Desert.

AB  - In this study, we compared the composition and abundance of carabid species according to their habitat affinity, wing form and mean body size between continuous and isolated forest areas. Investigated plots were located in temperate forests of Mt. Medvednica that represent an island of forest embedded in a lowland matrix of urban ecosystems, agricultural fields and meadows and in similar forest types in large, continuous montane forests in the Gorski kotar area. Data for the proportions of species traits and habitat affinities of 10 plots were compared using principal component analysis (PCA) and nested ANOVA followed by post Hoc tests. We found significant differences between the proportions of forest specialist and generalist carabids and in the morphological characteristics of carabid communities between isolated and continuous forest areas. Isolated area had less forest specialists and more generalist species than large, continuous forest. More macropterous species were present in isolated habitat and more brachypterous in continuous forest area, especially medium-sized brachypterous beetles. Higher proportions of small-sized carabids were present in isolated area and large species were more common in continuous forest areas. Our results suggest that the power of dispersal is an important factor that can be used in analyses of isolation effects on carabid assemblages, not only at small scales, but at larger scales as well, showing the uniqueness of large, continuous forest areas.

AB  - Dissolved aluminium concentrations ([Al]) in the < 0.45 mu m filtered fraction are described for 54 UK river sites covering rural, acidic/acid sensitive, agricultural and urban typologies, and wide pH range (4 to 11). High [Al] occurred under acidic conditions and for acid runoff neutralised by bicarbonate rich groundwater. Thermodynamic analysis indicates Al hydroxide/hydroxy-silicate oversaturation at circumneutral pH across the rivers, but undersaturation at lower/higher pH. The oversaturation reflects in part the presence of Al bearing colloids as indicated by (1) [Al] being correlated with components associated with both lithogenic (Fe, Ti and lanthanides) colloids and organic carbon, (2) baseflow studies using cross-flow ultrafiltration and (3) comparison of our data with Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN) information on labile and non-labile Al. Tree harvesting and emission reductions of SO(x) in acidic and acid sensitive catchments in mid-Wales led to acidification reversal, lower [Al] and changing [H(+)] - [Al] relationships. The [Al] decline was confined to acidic conditions while [Al] increased during the later part of the monitoring period with a peak around 2002 for moorland and forested systems. Colloidal production across the flow range was indicated late in the record by comparison of our data with information collected by the AWMN for a site in mid-Wales. This production seems interlinked with organic carbon and with dissolved CO(2) changes. In order for further understanding of Al hydrogeochemistry in river systems there is a need to integrate research that moves from equilibrium to kinetic and colloidal consideration including the critical issues of organic and inorganic controls within the context of bioavailability and aquatic stress. The colloidal Al may well be of low environmental concern to fish and other factors such as habitat may well be critical.

AB  - This paper presents the Spanish contra culture movement known like La Movida, which occurred in Madrid, and in the principals Spanish cities, on late 70 and early 80, and the showing up of the filmmaker that represents the post-franquism new beginning: Pedro Almodovar. With "Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del monton" and "Laberinto de pasiones", he shows all the underground specimens of the moment. Spain lived at that time a creative reborn, after 40 of dictatorship, and the fine arts, the music and the cinema testified the feeling of the group, that haven't had lived the Civil War (1936-39), neither the Second World War, but suffered the daily consequences of living in an isolated country, that still kills the oppositions of the regime, where almost nothing new was allowed, till the explosion of colors of La Movida. The reception to the movement at that time, and the following revision, is here under review using the cultural studies contributions.

AB  - In Santa Catarina State (Brazil), Rio dos Cedros is one of the cities that suffered from natural disasters triggered by very intense rainfall in November 2008. According to the Municipal Civil Defense, this event caused economic losses of US$2.1 million and 96 homeless, directly affecting 90% of the municipal population. The principal phenomenon responsible for these disasters was the debris flow. In this context, field surveys were conducted throughout the city in order to investigate the possibility for houses to be affected by landslides and debris flows. After the preliminary evaluation, two cases of debris flow whose extensions were over 1 km were chosen for a more detailed survey. The objective of the present study was to analyze the meteorological and geomorphic aspects of these cases. The total rainfall in Rio dos Cedros in November 2008 and the entire year of 2008 were 644 mm and 2509 mm, respectively. An analysis of the daily rainfall during October and November 2008 and the debris flow occurrence time indicates that the factor triggering debris flows in Rio dos Cedros in 2008 was the accumulated rainfall, not its intensity. Two debris flows analyzed in the present study had different geomorphic conditions, one being confined in the channel and showing ordinal debris flow (Debris A), and the other unconfined, presenting the debris avalanche feature (Debris B). The larger density of elastic blocks was observed at the depositional area of Debris B. Both the localities are characterized with migmatite. Topographic analysis showed that the volume of the mass movement is related with topographic parameters (elevation difference and travel distance). This relationship implies that the two cases of Rio dos Cedros had similar behavior to other cases reported in temperate and cold regions. It is, therefore, concluded that there is geomorphic control on the debris flow behavior. The similarity of Debris A and B implies the high potential effects of woody vegetation on the debris flow feature.

AB  - A mark-release-recapture study of the dispersal ability of blow flies, Calliphora nigribarbis, was conducted in Ikumo-Naka, Ato Town, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan in December 2004. A location where a fatal avian influenza outbreak had occurred I year previously was selected for the present study. A total of 3,884 C. nigribarbis were collected, 1,915 of which were marked and released from 4 different collection sites during 2 successive days. The recapture rate of the released C. nigribarbis ranged from 0.014 to 0.029 among the collection sites, and the overall recapture rate was calculated as 0.022. Based on the distance between the released site and the recaptured site, the dispersal rate of C. nigribarbis was estimated as 256 m/h on the 1st day and 179 m/ h on the 2nd day of the experiment, and the maximum dispersal rate observed in this study was estimated as 500 m/h. Taking into account the active period of C. nigribarbis on a fine day (7 h/day), the distance traveled by C. nigribarbis within a day was estimated as 1,789 and 1,250 m/day on average for the 1st and 2nd days, respectively, and the maximum distance was 3,500 m/day. These results suggest that C. nigribarbis could play a role in the mechanical dissemination of avian influenza virus and spread of the outbreak in Japan.

AB  - The invasion of exotic earthworms in the Northern Forest of the United States alters carbon and nitrogen cycles and reduces forest litter and native plant cover. Humans are the principal agents of dispersal, spreading earthworms both inadvertently via horticulture, land disturbance, and in the tires and underbodies of vehicles, and voluntarily through composting and the improper disposal of fish bait. A study in Webb, NY-a town located within the Adirondack State Park, one of the most celebrated cultural and ecological regions in the US-exposes the human dimensions of earthworm invasion. Environmental history research, interviews with residents and bait sellers, and a mail survey of town residents show that positive attitudes towards earthworms and their ecological effects lead to casual disposal or use of them. Earthworm use is a strong cultural practice and the risk of their continued introduction in the Adirondacks is high.

AB  - Turkey, which is situated on the transit route to Europe for many refugees/asylum seekers from Asia and Africa, has recently been facing a gradually increasing refugee problem. In this study, a sociological analysis of refugees will be introduced through the example of the city of Isparta in Turkey which serves as a transit country for many international refugees. The study will attempt to discuss the demographic characteristics of refugees, such as their age, gender, education levels, occupations, marital status, number of children, job/occupation and employment status, social and economic status, survival ways, reasons why they became refugees, traumas they experienced, adaptation problems, expectations, and finally their points of view towards both themselves and the world. The source of data used in the study includes the refugees residing in Kafeler (Bugday) Street in the city centre, as well as the refugees residing in Yedis, ehitler district of Isparta. The study was carried out between October 2007 and January 2008 using in-depth interview technique.

AB  - Scale is fundamental to ecological studies as patterns exist at multiple levels of organisation. Scale is critically important when assessing a species' distribution, and it can influence the results of complex landscape analyses. If ignored, conservation and management decisions may be inappropriate. In this study, we assessed an often overlooked element in landscape analyses, spatial configuration, to uncover patterns of species distribution. Specifically, we evaluated cover by native vegetation within an urban landscape using a non-nested approach based on discrete consecutive rings (e.g., 0-50 m, 50-100 m, etc.) and a traditional nested approach based on concentric circles (e.g., 0-50 m, 0-100 m, etc.) to determine whether these approaches differ in their effectiveness in uncovering relationships between land cover and animal occurrence in a disturbed, urban landscape. We performed spatial configuration analyses using two anuran amphibian species (wood frog, Lithobates sylvaticus; and boreal chorus frog, Pseudacris maculate) sampled via call surveys at 75 wetlands (of constructed stormwater sites [n=58] and natural wetlands [n=17]) located within the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between proportion of native vegetation and species occurrence at three grain sizes (10 m, 50 m, and 100 m) based on analyses of non-nested concentric zones. The nested and non-nested approaches differed in their predictions regarding the occurrence of the frog species. The nested approach explained a higher percentage of deviance when predicting wood frog occurrence than did the non-nested analyses whereas the non-nested approach explained a higher percentage of deviance when predicting boreal chorus frog occurrence. We identified locations surrounding wetlands that predicted occurrence using the non-nested approach that were not detected by the nested approach, suggesting that non-nested analyses may represent an overlooked tool for habitat assessment. Top models for predicting occurrence varied among the three grain sizes, suggesting that our ability to detect environmental heterogeneity is scale-dependent. Incorporating spatial configuration (non-nested and nested designs) and multiple grain sizes in analyses may provide better resolution of landscape patterns and help uncover causes behind species' distributions.

AB  - Background: Prospective memory (PM) denotes the ability to remember to perform actions in the future. It has been argued that standard laboratory paradigms fail to capture core aspects of PM.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We combined functional MRI, virtual reality, eye-tracking and verbal reports to explore the dynamic allocation of neurocognitive processes during a naturalistic PM task where individuals performed errands in a realistic model of their residential town. Based on eye movement data and verbal reports, we modeled PM as an iterative loop of five sustained and transient phases: intention maintenance before target detection (TD), TD, intention maintenance after TD, action, and switching, the latter representing the activation of a new intention in mind. The fMRI analyses revealed continuous engagement of a top-down fronto-parietal network throughout the entire task, likely subserving goal maintenance in mind. In addition, a shift was observed from a perceptual (occipital) system while searching for places to go, to a mnemonic (temporo-parietal, fronto-hippocampal) system for remembering what actions to perform after TD. Updating of the top-down fronto-parietal network occurred at both TD and switching, the latter likely also being characterized by frontopolar activity.
   Conclusion/Significance: Taken together, these findings show how brain systems complementary interact during real-world PM, and support a more complete model of PM that can be applied to naturalistic PM tasks and that we named PROspective MEmory DYnamic (PROMEDY) model because of its dynamics on both multi-phase iteration and the interactions of distinct neurocognitive networks.

AB  - This paper focuses on one of the 'child-trafficking scandals' that occurred in Brazil in the 1990s. Ethnographic research was carried out between 2000 and 2001 within a movement of poor families formed in Sao Paulo to put pressure on the authorities to review the legal procedures that had led to their children being placed for national and international adoption. Fieldwork was supplemented by other data, including reports by legislative bodies, articles in the press, and case files involving the termination of parental rights. This paper explores views on international adoption among members of the Brazilian elites such as judges, agents in the field of child protection and journalists, in the context of old but persistent neoMalthusian ideas. Although the Brazilian birth rate is now below the replacement level, it is still common to blame 'irresponsible' reproduction among the urban poor for violence in large cities. Drawing a parallel with the routine sterilization of women that prevailed for decades and was encouraged by Brazilian physicians, the paper examines how, in a 'struggle against poverty', judicial agents took it upon themselves to enforce 'birth control' through adoption, bypassing family consent and the law in the process. The paper concludes by arguing that discrimination against poor families who are viewed as disorganized, immoral and irresponsible characteristics frequently associated with criminality by a sector of the elites - has contributed to the view that lower-class families do not have the right to bear children, or to keep them.

AB  - In the last decades, geographers' attention has been drawn to the vertical dimension of space and indoor environments due to population growth and concomitant city expansion. While traditional geography has long studied merely horizontal relationships of spatial processes and phenomena, recent years have also witnessed a growing number of studies that have sought to extend traditional spatial analysis tools to three-dimensional and indoor environments. In line with these developments, this paper proposes a new indoor accessibility measure which quantifies the quality of access to exits, called exitability. In this, the movement of people with respect to its three-dimensional environment, the user characteristics and the surrounding occupant interactions is considered key. Since the accessibility of exits is most important during evacuations, the calculation of exitability uses existing evacuation flow models. In a case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of exitability measurements through an application on existing building data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticides such as pyrethroids have been frequently found in runoff water from urban areas and the offsite movement is a significant cause for aquatic toxicities in urban streams and estuaries. To better understand the origination of pesticide residues in urban runoff, we investigated the association of pyrethroid residues with loose particles in runoff water from concrete surfaces after treatment with commercial products of bifenthrin and permethrin. In runoff water generated from simulated precipitations after 1 to 89 d exposure under dry outdoor conditions, over 80% of the pesticides was found on particles >0.7 pm for most treatments. The solid-water partitioning coefficient (K-d) on day 1 was estimated to be 2.4 x 10(3) to 1.1 x 10(5) L/kg for permethrin and bifenthrin on these solids. Except for solid formulations, the pesticide-laden particles likely originated from dust particles preexisting on the concrete before treatment and the disintegration of the surficial concrete matter through weathering. We consequently tested a simple sponge-wipe method to collect and analyze the loose particles on concrete. Concurrent analyses (n = 30) showed an excellent linear correlation between the amount of pesticides transferrable to runoff water and that on the wipe (R-2 = 0.78, slope = 1.13 +/- 0.11, P < 0.0001). The fact that the linear relationship has a slope close to 1.0 suggests that this method may be used to predict pesticide residues available for contaminating runoff water before runoff actually occurs. The importance of loose particles should be considered when developing practices to mitigate pesticide runoff contamination from urban residential areas.

AB  - Faced with an economic crisis, people took to the streets and camped in urban plazas throughout Spain in May 2011. Many people were successfully mobilized by a generalized sense of frustration, indignation and impotency in the face of coming elections where many citizens felt there were no real alternative economic and social policies offered, nor the possibility to vote for government programmes that would deal with the crisis in a way that prioritized the concerns of the population. In online discussions, concerned proactive participants called for 'A Real Democracy Now' that represented the concerns and priorities of regular Spanish citizens. In order to make their discontent visible, they called for people to camp and 'occupy' public spaces together in order to force politicians and elites to face the generalized discontent with the dire economic prospects. This paper builds on non-participant observation of the Indignados movement in Barcelona, Spain, conducted in the summer of 2011. It looks at the consolidation of the 'occupy' contentious performance to protest income inequality and economic policy. It argues that this movement is a direct precedent to the Occupy Wall Street movement in the USA. The 15 May movement showed that not only people in North Africa had reasons to take the streets and engage in collective action, but many citizens in the developed world also had reasons to take public squares and show their dissatisfaction with the economic and political status quo.

AB  - Water management paradigms and practices have evolved markedly from the post-World War II years to the twenty-first century. Changes have been particularly urgent and visible in water-limited arid lands. Notable trends include movement from an emphasis on technological, Supply-side solutions toward sociological, demand-side management from rigid top-down state control toward decentralized management; and from local or regional management arenas toward integrated, multilateral formation of water policy from a global perspective. Efforts continue to augment water supplies, but practice has shifted from tactics such as weather modification to energy-efficient desalination. wastewater reuse and, significantly, conservation, which was hardly considered in previous periods of perceived abundance. Overtaking even these efforts in importance is a growing intellectual elaboration of an integrated water management paradigm, which recognizes that each element on both the supply and demand sides of the equation contributes to the total water availability arid requires consideration of linkages between urban and rural water use as well as between the domestic, industrial, and agricultural sectors. This awareness has spurred the establishment of "global water initiatives," marking a shift toward globalization of water management to achieve higher levels of integration.

AB  - Human activities have profoundly influenced natural ecosystems, especially wetlands. This study attempted to differentiate the impact of human activities on reductions in wetland vegetation in the Lixiahe wetlands, China, at multiple spatial scales. The reduction in wetland vegetation from 1988 to 2006 was quantified using Landsat data, and moving window analysis was used to detect hot spots of vegetation reduction in the wetlands at window sizes of 150, 1,000 and 2,500 m. Logistic regression was used to examine the influence on occurrence of the hot spots of landscape variables representing accessibility to human settlements and roads. Over the study period, wetland vegetation declined by 69%, which was largely attributable to aquaculture development. The hot spots of wetland vegetation reduction exhibited increasing patch size, but decreasing patch number with increasing window size. The occurrence probability of the hot spots rose significantly with increasing proximity to rural settlements and secondary roads, with only a minor response to the presence of towns. With increasing window size, however, the density of secondary roads and rural settlements were less influential, whereas the presence of major roads had more influence on hot spot occurrence. These trends are reasonable in that wetland use activities in the study area are directly associated with the settlements and roads in the rural areas at local scales, but are also indirectly associated with the major transportation network from a regional perspective. Overall, these results suggested that different human activities, as distinguished by their sources on the landscape, could have different environmental consequences at different scales for scale-dependent features.

In the early 1880s there was a slight recovery as the city entered into the period of early demographic transition. Based on available parish registers from the stated period as well as the official population censuses we are given an insight into changes in movement and structure of population in Brod, whose role and significance were particularly increasing after 1878 when the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina.

AB  - Ouchida Keiya's Chikatetsu Hiroba (Underground Plaza, 1970), a film from the Japanese underground cinema movement, documents the gathering of 'folk guerrillas' (activists and student protestors) at the underground plaza linking the west and east exits of the vast Shinjuku railway station in February 1969. This essay analyses their protests by highlighting their apparent search for a new performative praxis, amidst evidence of complicated broken threads, misplaced emotions and disconnections between politics and action. Through occupying and restoring other uses of the space, I argue that the protestors desired to remake the city as a forum for ideological confrontation and revolutionary aesthetics.

AB  - With the growth in urbanization process and activities in Hong Kong and many large cities in China, a great number of super high-rise buildings have been constructed in these years. The occurrences of many large fire tragedies, especially the US 9/11 terrorist attack, made people aware that super high-rise buildings may cause serious fatalities, and extremely they could collapse in a huge uncontrolled fire. Compared with people's evacuation behavior, little interests have been drawn to pre-movement behavior. In Hong Kong and some major cities in China, over 90% of people are living in multi-storey multi-compartment buildings. Their awareness and responses to fire incidents happening in the other parts of the same building have substantial influence on the whole evacuation process. Studies on pre-evacuation human behavior have been performed for many years. but the vast majority of the studies were qualitative-oriented. Accordingly, an attempt was made in this article to quantitatively investigate people's pre-evacuation behavior by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, which was trained by Hong Kong's post-fire field survey data.

AB  - Population size, reproductive timing and habitats, seasonal behaviors, and juvenile activity were assessed in a British Columbia population of the endangered Oregon forestsnail, Allogona townsendiana, over a period of 4 years. Adult snail population size ranged from seven to 47 snails in four x 24-m<SU2</SU sampling sites. The mating period peaked in March and April; adults aggregated in clusters of eight to 14 snails before mating. Pairs of snails were observed to mate for 225 min or more in close proximity to coarse woody debris and stinging nettle, Urtica dioica. Nesting peaked in April-May and resulted in a mean clutch size of 34 eggs (SD=9). Hatching for two nests occurred at 63 and 64 d after oviposition. Within hours of hatching, juveniles began dispersing from the nest site; by 1 month most had disappeared. Snails tracked with harmonic radar became less active or aestivated from late July to early September and hibernated from early November to mid-March within leaf litter and soil. Preliminary measurements of growth rate indicate this species takes a minimum of 2 years to reach adulthood and has a typical life span of at least 5 years.

AB  - A significant segment of internal migration in India at large, and in the states of Rajasthan and Orissa in particular, continues to be distress-led. Colossal collapse of rural employment generation, the economic setbacks at cultivation, and, the largely deficient employment opportunities in urban centres among others, are believed to be the driving force behind the rise of a more insecure type of movement now. paradoxically however, this movement occurs in a world supplemented by a renewed belief in sanctioning equality of opportunity as a way of life, propagating fuller economic growth, and endorsing greater social cohesion (Aldridge 2001), across the socio-political spectrum. As a result, migratory processes and their subsequent impacts thereof, attains critical significance in the present times. It is in the above context that the proposed paper contextualizes migration debates within historiography, policy and economy of the states of Orissa and Rajasthan in India, and seeks to elucidate the formidable challenges it represents for the Indian social fabric.

AB  - With urbanisation, there is an increasing trend for artificial structures, such as seawalls, to replace natural habitats. The predatory mulberry whelk, Morula marginalba Blainville, is seldom observed on seawalls in Sydney Harbour, yet it is abundant on the rocky shores of south-eastern Australia. The Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata Gould, is common on seawalls in Sydney Harbour, forming two types of crust, providing 'elaborate' or 'simple' habitats that differ in structure. Whelks were numerous on some seawalls with elaborate oyster crusts, but were sparse on walls with simple crusts. Thus, different types of crust, with different structure, may explain the differences in the numbers of whelks among seawalls. These different crusts may cause differences in dispersal and/or mortality. The structure of the habitat created by the oysters was manipulated on seawalls and the responses of M. marginalba were observed. Whelks emigrated more rapidly from simple than from elaborate crusts and more individuals moved into elaborate than into simple crusts. Decreases in the numbers of M. marginalba at larger scales, via mortality or emigration, did not differ between the crust types. The range of habitats that can be used by M. marginalba is extended because it can exploit the biogenic structure provided by oysters on artificial urban structures, which otherwise form unsuitable habitat.

AB  - The major immediate-early (MIE) gene locus of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the master switch that determines the outcomes of both lytic and latent infections. Here, we provide evidence that alteration in the splicing of HCMV (Towne strain) MIE genes affects infectious-virus replication, movement through the cell cycle, and cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Mutation of a conserved 24-nucleotide region in MIE exon 4 increased the abundance of IE1-p38 mRNA and decreased the abundance of IE1-p72 and IE2-p86 mRNAs. An increase in IE1-p38 protein was accompanied by a slight decrease in IE1-p72 protein and a significant decrease in IE2-p86 protein. The mutant virus had growth defects, which could not be complemented by wild-type IE1-p72 protein in trans. The phenotype of the mutant virus could not be explained by an increase in IE1-p38 protein, but prevention of the alternate splice returned the recombinant virus to the wild-type phenotype. The lower levels of IE1-p72 and IE2-p86 proteins correlated with a delay in early and late viral gene expression and movement into the S phase of the cell cycle. Mutant virus-infected cells had significantly higher levels of cdk-1 expression and enzymatic activity than cells infected with wild-type virus. The mutant virus induced a round-cell phenotype that accumulated in the G(2)/M compartment of the cell cycle with condensation and fragmentation of the chromatin. An inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis increased the round-cell phenotype. The round cells were characteristic of an abortive viral infection.

AB  - This article, based on previously unused documents of the Russian secret police, deals with the history of the Kiev pogrom of 1905 which occurred after the announcement of the Manifesto of October 17. It focuses on the relationship between the political and the nationalistic as motivation for conflict participants. It is concluded that the Kiev pogrom during its first stage was an armed clash between two civil parties the revolutionaries and the Black Hundreds with effortlessly demoralized the authorities. During the second stage as the result of the features of an anti-government movement in the Western part of the Russian empire, the collision assumed the character of an anti-Jewish pogrom.

AB  - 'Carabidologists do it all' (Niemela 1996a) is a phrase with which most European carabidologists are familiar. Indeed, during the last half a century, professional and amateur entomologists have contributed enormously to our understanding of the basic biology of carabid beetles. The success of the field is in no small part due to regular European Carabidologists' Meetings, which started in 1969 in Wijster, the Netherlands, with the 14(th) meeting again held in the Netherlands in 2009, celebrating the 40(th) anniversary of the first meeting and 50 years of long-term research in the Dwingelderveld. This paper offers a subjective summary of some of the major developments in carabidology since the 1960s. Taxonomy of the family Carabidae is now reasonably established, and the application of modern taxonomic tools has brought up several surprises like elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Progress has been made on the ultimate and proximate factors of seasonality and timing of reproduction, which only exceptionally show non-seasonality. Triggers can be linked to evolutionary events and plausibly explained by the "taxon cycle" theory. Fairly little is still known about certain feeding preferences, including granivory and ants, as well as unique life history strategies, such as ectoparasitism and predation on higher taxa. The study of carabids has been instrumental in developing metapopulation theory (even if it was termed differently). Dispersal is one of the areas intensively studied, and results show an intricate interaction between walking and flying as the major mechanisms. The ecological study of carabids is still hampered by some unresolved questions about sampling and data evaluation. It is recognised that knowledge is uneven, especially concerning larvae and species in tropical areas. By their abundance and wide distribution, carabid beetles can be useful in population studies, bioindication, conservation biology and landscape ecology. Indeed, 40 years of carabidological research have provided so much data and insights, that among insects - and arguably most other terrestrial organisms - carabid beetles are one of the most worthwhile model groups for biological studies.

AB  - This article deals with the lives of young egress of drug traffic in the slums of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Its main objective is to examine the circumstances and the specific conditions that drive young people to abandon this illegal work activity. The method used to collect data was the topical life story in order to find out how 30 youths, from seven slums, had got involved until their departure from the "movement". Data shows that youths, entering trafficking, had an expectation of empowerment. With time, this attitude will wane, as they realize they are living with situations of betrayal, punishment and fear. The process for getting out occurs when the youth begins to question this type of work and sees other ways of life, more consistent with their aspirations. The facts conclude that when getting an early involvement in organized crime it leaves them physically and emotionally exhausted, as selling drugs is an ongoing confrontation through constant episodes of armed conflicts and arms dealing.

AB  - Objectives
   This study sought to evaluate the use of a continuous-flow rotary left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation.
   Background
   LVAD therapy is an established treatment modality for patients with advanced heart failure. Pulsatile LVADs have limitations in design precluding their use for extended support. Continuous-flow rotary LVADs represent an innovative design with potential for small size and greater reliability by simplification of the pumping mechanism.
   Methods
   In a prospective, multicenter study, 281 patients urgently listed (United Network of Organ Sharing status 1A or 1B) for heart transplantation underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD. Survival and transplantation rates were assessed at 18 months. Patients were assessed for adverse events throughout the study and for quality of life, functional status, and organ function for 6 months.
   Results
   Of 281 patients, 222 (79%) underwent transplantation, LVAD removal for cardiac recovery, or had ongoing LVAD support at 18-month follow-up. Actuarial survival on support was 72% (95% confidence interval: 65% to 79%) at 18 months. At 6 months, there were significant improvements in functional status and 6-min walk test (from 0% to 83% of patients in New York Heart Association functional class I or II and from 13% to 89% of patients completing a 6-min walk test) and in quality of life (mean values improved 41% with Minnesota Living With Heart Failure and 75% with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires). Major adverse events included bleeding, stroke, right heart failure, and percutaneous lead infection. Pump thrombosis occurred in 4 patients.
   Conclusions
   A continuous-flow LVAD provides effective hemodynamic support for at least 18 months in patients awaiting transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life.

AB  - Urbanization occupies an ambiguous position in the development of the Middle Euphrates region of Turkey and Syria, in part because the area frequently formed a contested region between other stronger Early Bronze Age polities. This paper aims to review evidence from a series of archaeological surveys to illustrate trends in settlement during the 4th and 3rd millennium BC. Re-analysis of survey data from three exemplar regions in the Middle Euphrates demonstrates that by including settlement away from the main Euphrates Valley we get a picture of two main zones of settlement corresponding to agro-ecological zones. In the northern zone, settlements underwent phases of nucleation and dispersal through time, but long-term configurations were relatively stable. In contrast, a southern zone, south of the Sajur Valley, was characterized by rapid colonization and some degree of boom and bust growth of towns, perhaps encouraged by the opportunities afforded by the high risk but high rewards of the 'zone of uncertainty'. Although ecological conditions and climate change played a role in settlement growth and failure, in part by setting the parameters for agro-pastoral production, it is evident that socio-political circumstances, chronic conflict and sheer opportunism were probably key to both the growth and decline of the southern settlements.

AB  - In this article, we address the question of how diffusion mechanisms predict the level of violence among soccer fans. We embed possible causes of violent fan behavior in a theoretical framework of diffusion, as social movement scholars deploy it to study other instances of collective violence. Four possible diffusion explanations are examined: social status of transmitters (both other fan-sides as well as soccer players), status similarity of adopter and transmitter, direct ties as captured by geographical distance, and indirect ties as measured by media coverage. These explanations are tested for the occurrence of violence around soccer matches in the Netherlands during the period 2001-2005. We employ a pooled complementary log-log analysis of fourteen teams over two hundred match weeks and control for repression, city size, and several match characteristics. We find considerable evidence for three of the four proposed explanations and demonstrate that aggressive play on the pitch, hooliganism by fan-sides with similar status, and media coverage are significant explanatory factors for the evolution of fan violence.

TI  - Geothermal drillings in Staufen/Breisgau (Germany): damage causes and perspectives

AB  - In 2007 seven geothermal borehole heat exchangers with a planned depth of 140 m were installed of a small square next to the historic town hall of the City of Staufen for its heating and cooling. Some weeks after completion of the borehole heat exchanger drillings an uplift movement started, causing heavy damages to the surrounding buildings. Officially 269 buildings are currently affected, some are deemed structurally unstable. One office building had to be evacuated. An artesian aquifer was connected hydraulically to the anhydrite bearing Gipskeuper Formation. Anhydrite reacts to gypsum which causes volume extension. The swelling process, once initiated, cannot be stopped easily because the process itself opens and closes water paths. Furthermore Staufen is located on the eastern graben flank of the Upper Rhine Valley on a strongly tectonized massif. Due to these fissured and faulted formations, the prediction of water movement and the swelling process is very difficult. With a newly developed grouting some major cavities near the wellbores were sealed off. This has been partly successful because the maximum uplift rate of about 10 mm/month decreased to less than 4 mm/month (data of May 2012). Additional problems could arise from the good solubility of gypsums in water, which may cause sinkholes. In the last months some small subsidence phenomenon already occurred locally within the uplift area.

AB  - Little is known about the phenomenon of pain in German nursing homes. In particular, it is unknown to what extent and severity pain occurs among residents and how their pain can be described.
   A total of 13 nursing homes located in the city of Munster, Germany, were included as part of the health services research project "Action Alliance Pain-free City Munster." Data were collected from 436 residents over 65 years old via self-report or the observational pain tool pain assessment in advanced dementia, german version (PAINAD-G), according to the cognitive status of the residents.
   At the time of the interview, the majority of the residents questioned reported suffering from pain at rest and/or during movement. Approximately one quarter of residents complained about moderate to intolerable pain at rest and nearly 45% during movement. Residents encountered pain most often when standing up, sitting, resting in bed and walking and three quarters of residents had suffered from pain for more than 1 year. Many residents experienced pain in several body regions. Among residents assessed solely by the observational pain scale PAINAD-G, signs indicating pain existed in 21% (a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 6) or 69% (a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 2), respectively, depending on the cut-off value chosen on the PAINAD-G scale.
   Pain in nursing homes is a challenge that needs more attention as it has considerable negative consequences for the persons concerned. The extent of pain in the studied facilities indicates an urgent need for action on the part of all professionals caring for residents in nursing homes.

AB  - Aim
   To use herbarium records to characterize important correlates of spatial spread, areal occupancy and clustering of 100 alien plant species of conservation concern in the North and South Islands of New Zealand.
   Location
   New Zealand.
   Methods
   Using herbarium data of 6294 records representing 100 alien plant species, we assessed spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of alien species by examining the role of major urban areas as sources of sampling bias. A novel method to account for spatial biases in sampling effort was developed and applied to two simple distance metrics: nearest- and furthest-neighbour spread rate. The relative importance of these two distance metrics in determining the range, areal extent and dispersion of alien species across both the North and South Islands of New Zealand was also assessed.
   Results
   The spatial distribution of herbarium records was highly clustered with a significant bias towards the more populated regions. Once sampling bias was taken into account, there was no indication that species were found closer to these urban centres than might be expected based on sampling effort. The nearest-neighbour spread rates were usually 1-5 km yr-1 and correlated positively with the furthest-neighbour spread rates that were an order of magnitude higher. Range and area increased and clustering decreased with higher spread rates and longer recording time span. The spread rates divided species into five groups that were clearly distinguishable in terms of the extent of their distribution and the degree of clustering. Species occurring on both islands did not exhibit similar spread rates or spatial patterns.
   Main conclusions
   The nearest- and furthest-neighbour spread rates from herbarium records can explain the area and pattern of alien plant distributions and improve the understanding of the dynamics of their spread. Five groups emerge from the spread rates in relation to a null model. Fast-spreading plants had the widest, least clustered distribution, which suggests widespread chronic problems; slow-spreading plants had localized, but dense, clustered distributions, indicating acutely problematic weeds. These patterns appear robust and may be useful in predicting the future patterns of spread and in planning long-term management strategies in New Zealand.

AB  - There exists a high probability of a great earthquake rupture along the subduction megathrust under the Mentawai Islands of West Sumatra in the near future. Six rupture models were used to assess the tsunami inundation and the accompanying sediment movement in Painan, West Sumatra, Indonesia. According to a worst scenario, the potential tsunami might hit the coast of Painan about 26 minutes after the rupture and the entire city could be inundated with a maximum inundation depth of about 7 m. Severe erosion may also occur in the near-shore region. Two scenarios, one scenario with a positive leading wave and the other with a negative leading wave, were selected to simulate the tsunami-induced morphological changes. A positive leading wave would cause severe erosion in the shoreline area and a large sandbar in the offshore area adjacent to the shoreline; a small amount of sediment could be deposited in the city area; a negative leading wave could cause moderate erosion in the further offshore area due to the strong retreating wave front, an offshore sandbar could form in the bay area, while no noticeable large area of sand deposit could be found in the city area. The difference in the erosion and deposition patterns between these two scenarios provides very helpful information in the investigation of historical tsunamis through tsunami deposits.

AB  - Technical plan for the construction of Wind power Station on Housetop of buildings in a City(WSHC in short) put forward in this paper. The wind force turbine with two wind wheels was adopted in WSHC to capture wind energy and produce electricity as much as possible in the limited area on the housetop. No vanes can go down out of WSHC even if an accident of a vane breaking occurs because two technology protection measures are used here: first, the vanes of a wind wheel are linked up by a thin wire rope at middle of them; second, the webs made of stainless steel wires are fixed at inlet and outlet of the accelerate and orientate device. WSHC belong to environmental friendly and animal harmoniously ones because of the consideration of the webs mentioned above, so that the birds are stopped out of the wind power generator. The grid connection mode of commutating, inversing and connecting to the distribution network of the building was adopted in WSHC. Equipped by a connecting device in-house, each wind power generator can be controlled in max electric production mode during the term when voltage output of the generator higher than 12volts. The diameter of accelerate and orientate device of 3.6m was selected on the consideration about structural-load-carrying capacity of the present building. WSHC can be put into commercial operation in most area of China. Some has evident investment effectiveness because the investment payback time is only 2.4years as wind energy density is 300 W/m(2), annual generation hours are 6000 hours and electricity price is 0.84yuan/(kW.h).

AB  - Hard rock aquifers for the purpose of this Paper mean the non-carbonate, fractured rock aquifers in the terrain covered by crystalline basement complex, metamorphic rocks and also by extensive effusive volcanic rocks like the basalts of western India (Deccan traps. Ground water development in hard rock aquifer areas has always played a secondary role compared to that in the areas having high-yielding unconsolidated or semi-consolidated sediments and carbonate rocks. This has been due to the relatively poor ground water resources in hard rocks, low specific capacity of wells, erratic variations and discontinuities in the aquifer properties, and difficulties in exploration and assessment of the resource. It should, however, be remembered that for the millions of farmers in developing countries, having their small farms in the barren landscape of fractured hard rock terrain, whatever small supply available from these poor aquifers is the only hope for upgrading their standard of living by growing irrigated crops or by protecting their rain-fed crops from the vagaries of rainfall. It is also their only source for drinking water for the family and cattle. In many developing countries, hard rock hydrogeologists have therefore, an important role to play. In the developed countries, the interest in hard rock hydrogeology, apart from drinking water supplies to small communities, is recently promoted by the prospects of using these low permeability rocks for the storage of hazardous nuclear and chemical wastes. The study of ground water flow through faults, fissures and fractures is also of interest to scientists studying the migration of contaminants. Hard rock hydrogeologists, the world over, are therefore divided into two main groups: Those interested in obtaining ground water for domestic, irrigational or industrial use by exploring fractured and permeable zones in a relatively less permeable matrix of hard rock and those interested in locating impermeable or the least permeable zones for storage of hazardous nuclear waste. Ironically, for the first group even the most permeable zones are often not good enough to yield adequate water supply, while for the second group even the least permeable zones are often not good enough for safe storage of hazardous nuclear waste over a prolonged period of a few hundred years.
   This Paper discusses the occurrence of ground water and the precautions for sustainable development of ground water in arid and semi-arid regions, in view of the forthcoming climatic changes. It emphasizes the need for recharge augmentation hand-in-hand with development of new wells, so that the new development does not harm the traditional practices. In India, the neglect of recharge augmentation has caused lowering of water table and drying-up of old dug-wells of 12m to 15 m depth, which used to provide irrigational and drinking water supply for last several centuries. In Iran, many Qanats have dried up because of lowering of water table due to heavy pumping of ground water from newly developed deep tube-wells in their vicinity. The goal in many countries has, therefore, shifted from ground water development to ground water management which includes management of the quantity on Supply side and Demand side and also the management of ground water quality, especially with respect to pollution and salt water intrusion. Pollution of ground water in urban environment is becoming a cause of worry because in many developing countries there is a heavy migration of population from rural areas to urban centers and providing safe quality of drinking water to this population and managing the waste water generated in the cities and towns, is a major problem. The role of UNESCO-IUGS-IGCP Project GROWNET (Ground Water Network for Best Practices in Ground Water Development in Low Income Countries) is also described towards the end of this Paper. The Author is the Project Leader for GROWNET.

AB  - This article's proposition is to discuss the social function of community health agents (CHA) in the production of urban public health service, within the situated action perspective. The service, which is co-produced with its users, is analyzed as a result of the triangular relation between the State, its agents and the amount of users, which the latter is part of (living in the same "micro-area" is a criteria to the selection). On the one hand, this category of "subaltern" social workers, in charge of the development of the Family Health Program (PSF), descends from the popular movements of the 1980s (National Health Movement). On the other hand, its daily activity is guided by the neoliberal politics and the internal reform of the State of the 1990s, and the appearence of other local actors and levels of local regulation that have occupied the space left by the State. In this ambiguous context, this article proposes an initial systemization of these contradictory injunctions, and discusses the "mediator" role assumed by the health agents.

AB  - As with other areas of the public sector in Mongolia, the healthcare system has undergone significant structural and policy reforms since the early 1990s. The previous infection control system, characterised as a sanitary-epidemiological network, was dismantled with no replacement. A new infection control management system was established in 1997 with the adoption of infection control policies and guidelines, establishment of hospital infection control programmes in all major hospitals, training of health professionals and the commencement of passive surveillance of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Recent health statistics claim that HAIs occur in 0.01-0.02% of all hospital admissions with the highest percentage (0.05%) in tertiary hospitals in the capital city Ulaanbaatar, but this is very likely to be an underestimate. In 2002 the Government approved a national programme to establish a sentinel surveillance system for HAIs with improved laboratory-based monitoring. However, implementation has been delayed due to insufficient support from stakeholders and a shortage of resources and trained infection control professionals. Non-governmental infection control initiatives are limited by time and coverage. (C) 2010 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parsimony and SplitsTree analyses of ITS and 5' trnK/matK sequence data were used to assess the extent of hybridisation and its evolutionary significance in the New Zealand endemic genus Hoheria A. Cunn. The seven species of Hoheria form a monophyletic group along with the New Zealand endemic genus Plagianthus J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. and the Australian endemics Asterotrichion Klotzsch. and Gynatrix Alef. This strongly supported clade is sister to a clade of Australian species of Lawrencia Hook. The inferred evolutionary history of Hoheria suggests that the extant species are derived from a common ancestor that arrived in New Zealand by long-distance dispersal. There was little divergence among the species of Hoheria in either their ITS or trnK/matK sequences. Two known Hoheria hybrids exhibited overlapping heteromorphic nucleotides at virtually all of the variable positions. Approximately 40% of the other Hoheria accessions in our study retain similar heteromorphic sites. These polymorphisms were shared among the deepest branches in the ITS phylogeny, which potentially suggests that hybridisation has occurred throughout the evolutionary history of Hoheria. The phylogenetic structure of the ITS phylogeny completely collapsed in the strict consensus tree, and there was significant conflict between the biparentally inherited ITS phylogeny and the maternally inherited trnK/matK phylogeny. However, the removal of known and suspected hybrids resulted in parsimony trees that were more resolved. SplitsTree analyses revealed incompatible signals in the data, but recovered well supported groups that diverged from a central boxy network. Although the species of Hoheria are isolated by their ecological preferences or geographical distributions, interspecific hybrids are common in urban areas where the species are often planted.

In these communities, notoriously labelled 'garrisons ', dons have 'manufactured consent ' for their illicit rule, using coercive tactics and by positioning themselves as legitimate civic leaders. In the process, these rogue actors have not only gained acceptance among signifi cant numbers of the subaltern class but also (tacit) political recognition in the wider society. Genuine civil society has been eclipsed in Jamaica's urban garrisons due to the persistence of this rogue leadership. Still, a more hopeful outlook for Jamaica may be possible. Drawing upon previous research outlining the widespread struggle against the Mafi a led by members of Italian civil society, and the ensuing decline in its omnipotence in that country, the paper considers the implications of the positive developments in Italy for the noticeable movement towards degarrisonisation in Jamaica, and contemplates what role a resurrected Jamaican civil society might play in this process.

AB  - The themes of mobility and transformation occupy centre stage in many sociological accounts, where 'movement' references people and places in 'new' times, often without situating how movements may actually be embedding or reconstituting inequalities, spatially, culturally and materially. Attention to how gender and class may be reconfigured queries straightforward notions of change, even 'crisis', pointing towards the reshaping of exclusions and their intersecting dimensions. Based on interviews in the North-East of England, this article aims to explore younger women's spatial negotiations in the context of change and continuation, where regional efforts on regeneration can be conceptualized against the backdrop of de-industrialization and (urban) rebranding; the 'past', 'present' and 'future' sit uneasily in these (re)imaginings. These reconstitutions force consideration of the different forms and consequences of social transformation, negotiated in the dis-identifications made by women where, for some, their presence was marked as distinctly out of place, as opposed to others who could more easily claim a movement and placement compatible with the sense of regional change and mobility.

TI  - Capacity and Solidarity: Foundational Elements in the Unionization Strategy for Immigrant Day Labourers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA  - English
KW  - REVITALIZATION
KW  - CONSTRUCTION
KW  - MOVEMENT
AB  - Recent scholarship has been reasonably optimistic about unionization as a mechanism of labour justice for immigrant workers in casual and contingent work. This optimism rests on two assumptions: (1) that unions have the capacity to absorb immigrant workers in nonstandard work and (2) that casual, immigrant labourers enjoy the kind of solidarity that underpins collective action. This paper examines these assumptions critically through a case study of construction unions and Latino immigrant day labourers in Denver, Colorado and Baltimore, Maryland. I use participant observation and in-depth interviews with nine labour unions, 19 Latino immigrant day labourers, and two (non-union) day labour organizing projects in the cities to examine questions of capacity and solidarity. I find that the existing foundations for unionizing day labourers may be weak in certain cities and communities. Union capacity is undermined by structural fragmentation and specialization in market segments that are inaccessible to day labourers. Strategically, in an age of de-unionization, unions also face pressures to add value for employers by sorting the workforce into high quality and low quality categories. Locals indicate day labourers would likely fall into the latter category, thus precluding membership. The foundations for solidarity are similarly weakened in the cases studied. Culturally, day labourers in Denver and Baltimore emphasize self-reliance and material well-being over collective action and the pursuit of justice. To work toward unionization, organizers should be prepared to confront deficits of capacity and solidarity in other cities as well, especially those where homelessness is prevalent among day labourers, where immigrant populations are newly arrived, or where local union cultures are unreformed. I suggest that union collaboration, a cooperative type of occupational unionism, and commitments to training day labourers may help boost union capacity to absorb day labourers, while the creative use of material incentives should figure prominently in organizing strategies.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - Stroke is the main cause of disabilities in the world and is typically treated with intensive, hands-on physical and occupational therapy for several weeks after the initial injury. However, due to economic pressures, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home sooner, so the potential benefit of the therapy is not completely realized. Thus, it is important to develop rehabilitation technology that allows individuals who had suffered a stroke to practice intensive movement training without the expense of an always-present therapist. Although several robotic devices have been developed for stroke rehabilitation, these are too expensive for use at home or in small clinics. We have developed a low-cost alternative that allows stroke survivors to practice arm movement exercises at home or at the clinic, with periodic interactions with a therapist. The system integrates a virtual environment for facilitating repetitive movement training, with computer vision algorithms that track the hand of a patient, using an inexpensive camera and a conventional personal computer. This system, called Gesture Therapy, has been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial at a hospital in Mexico City, comparing it with conventional occupational therapy. The results show that both treatments improve the functionality of the affected upper extremity, with not significant difference between them. However, the patients that used the virtual environment have a greater motivation and attachment to the treatment, which in the long term are decisive for maximal recovery.

AB  - Factors that contribute to strong teacher-student relationships are vital to understand because of the influence these relationships have on achievement and motivation, particularly for minority group students. This article draws from a substantial quantity of empirical data, grounded in a wide theoretical and cultural base, regarding aspects of caring teacher practice to discuss mathematics teacher behaviours in relation to an existing model of health and well-being that encompasses cognitive, social, spiritual, and physical dimensions. Drawing from 100 Year 10 mathematics lesson observations involving six teachers and their classes across three urban schools, evidence emerged that for many indigenous (Maori), New Zealand Pacific, and New Zealand European students, caring teacher behaviours important for student engagement and achievement both include, and range beyond, traditional teaching practices. Examples include capitalising on student reactions and shared endeavours within the context of mathematics learning, expecting mathematical progress, showing respect for students and for their mathematics learning, being explicit about practice and expectations, incorporating one-to-one interactions, making opportunities within mathematics learning for sharing personal identities, and incorporating movement. This research illustrates how mathematics educators can attend to the specific and holistic mathematical learning needs of their students, including those often marginalised.

AB  - Atmospheric PAHs in the Kuroshio Sphere of southern Taiwan were measured and characterized using samples collected simultaneously at four sites from February to October in 2007. Higher PAH concentrations occurred in winter (range 2.41 +/- 1.85 to 40.8 +/- 6.97 ng m(-3)) and autumn (range 1.21 +/- 0.32 to 65.1 +/- 57.4 ng m(-3)) than in summer (range 0.87 +/- 0.36 to 17.7 +/- 2.88 ng m(-3)). Comparison of the total PAH concentrations from the four sampling sites showed that the total PAH concentrations from the Kaohsiung urban site (KHU) were 1.7-4.4 times higher than those from the Kaohsiung coastal site (KHC), 3.6-26 times those from a rural coastal site (Kenting, KT), and 16.9-53.8 times those from an offshore island site (Lanyu, LY). The PAH compositional pattern, diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis indicated that the major sources of PAHs in the study area can be classified into three categories. The first is vehicular sources from local traffic, the second is natural soils, and the third is industrial activities including coke ovens and incinerator emissions. The results from back trajectories also demonstrated that atmospheric PAHs were produced by local sources but were also influenced by transboundary movement of terrestrial pollutants. The characteristics and sources of atmospheric PAHs identified in this study provide useful information for estimating the effects and transportation of PAHs in the Kuroshio Sphere.

AB  - Safeguarded by some guardian hills as Fusacatan and Quinini, the city of Fusagasuga flourishes under the influence of a society that knows since colonial times, its proximity to the Colombian capital. This vicinity has influenced trade in agricultural products, in the floating population's movement to the municipality and in the use which has been given to the land of this part of the country. The soil here is analyzed not only as a scenario where the geological, climatic and evolutionary dynamics converge, but appears as a physical structure dependent on the actions taken by the society during the process of occupation of their territory. The society through the productivity space's valuation has caused living space's destruction and the virtual disappearance of the rural population.

AB  - Hybrid zones are natural experiments that expose the forces maintaining species differences. But for cases where a trait of one of the hybridizing pair appears shifted into the range of the other, the underlying mechanism can be difficult to infer. For example, hybridization between hermit warbler (Dendroica occidentalis) and Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi) is restricted to narrow hybrid zones in Washington and Oregon, yet hermit mtDNA can be found in phenotypically pure Townsend's populations up to 2000 km north along the Pacific coast. This could reflect introgression of selectively favoured hermit mitochondria north across the hybrid zones, or a neutral genetic wake left behind following southern zone movement. Hermit mitochondrial haplotypes in populations of coastal Townsend's exhibit relatively high genetic diversity and significant divergence from those found in populations of hermit warblers. This contradicts the predictions of selective introgression, but is consistent with a northern population of hermits diverging in a glacial refugium before being replaced by Townsend's via aggressive hybridization. Previous field studies showing Townsend's males to be competitively superior to hermit males support this scenario, and suggest that the extreme hybrid zone movement evidenced by the hermit mitochondrial wake represents an extinction in progress.

AB  - This paper contributes to the ethnography of guided tours in politically contested spaces by interrogating their use for political advocacy by Palestinian guides in the Old City of Jerusalem. It advances the guided tour genre as a potentially transformative encounter for tourists, while offering reflection on its possibilities and limitations for solidarity. Analyzing the narrative framework of the tour vis-a-vis the cityscape shows that guides strategically employ both discourse and movement to convince tourists of the injustice of the Israeli occupation through a practice called political detouring. It reveals how guides manipulate the tour genre's dynamic nature by spontaneously altering its trajectories to expose the corresponding instability of Palestinian lives in Jerusalem.

AB  - A well-maintained marine mammal stranding database can be an invaluable tool in understanding not only strandings but also changes in the marine environment. This study aimed to examine the following aspects of marine mammal strandings in the Philippines: species composition, temporal (i.e., frequency of stranding per year and seasonality) and spatial (i.e., frequency of stranding per region and province) variation, proportions of alive or dead specimens, and stranding hotspots. In 2008, a systematic collection of data on strandings, including out-of-habitat incidents, resulted in an initial 12-year database-from 1998 to 2009. A total of 178 stranding events were recorded: 163 single, 10 mass, and 5 out-of-habitat strandings, with an average of 15 observed stranding events annually. Twenty-three of the 28 confirmed species of marine mammals in the Philippines were recorded to strand, including first-recorded specimens for the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps), and Longman's beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus). The top five most frequent species to strand included spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) (n = 26), short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) (n = 14), melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra) (n = 13), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) (n = 11), and common bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) (n = 10). Dugongs (Dugong dugon) stranded seven times since 2001. Strandings occurred throughout the year with frequency significantly peaking during the northeast (NE) monsoon (November to March) season. Overall, Regions III (Central Luzon) and VII (Central Visayas) had the highest number of strandings (both n = 27) followed by Regions I (Ilocos) (n = 22) and V (Bicol) (n = 18). The following provinces or local government units were considered hotspots based on high number of strandings observed at each area: Zambales, Cagayan, Zamboanga City, Negros Oriental, Bohol, Pangasinan, and Bataan. Sixty-five percent of all documented stranding events involved live (n = 116) animals. This high percentage might be linked to dynamite fishing (causing acoustic trauma), fisheries interactions, or biotoxins from harmful algal blooms coupled to their foodweb. These strandings in general validate the diverse marine mammal assemblage in the Philippines and reveal the various environmental threats with which they deal.

AB  - The Ventnor Undercliff, located on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, is an ancient landslide complex of marginal stability that is prone to ground movement and occasional landslide events. The impact of ground movement on property and services in the town has been significant in the past. Since 1995, the local authority has made a significant investment in continuous monitoring and analysis of weather and ground movement data at key sites amongst other landslide management initiatives. These data reveal strong relationships between antecedent rainfall, groundwater and ground movement rates, confirming that prolonged periods of heavy winter rainfall and excess groundwater levels are a fundamental control on landslide behaviour. Climate change projections over the next 100 years point to significant increases in sea level and winter rainfall, which are expected to result in accelerated ground movement rates and more frequent landslide events in the Undercliff. There are concerns that hitherto marginally stable areas of the Undercliff may become unstable as a result of reactivation of ground movement and the occurrence of new landslides. In areas previously affected by ground movement or landslides, the frequency and rate of ground movement and landsliding is expected to increase. The paper presents historical and new data to demonstrate the relationships between rainfall and ground movement, and uses these to predict the likely impacts of climate change on future landslide behaviour. The paper concludes that climate change poses a very real threat and significant challenge to the future management and mitigation of the ground instability risks in the Ventnor Undercliff, which may be echoed for other similarly marginally stable ancient landslides in the UK.

AB  - Daily temperature could determine mosquito activity and competence for transmitting arboviruses. This work aims to determine the seasonal occurrence of mosquito species and to characterize their flight activity in relation to the mean daily temperature in Buenos Aires, Argentina (March 1998 to April 2001). The proportion of capture events for each culicid species throughout all seasons and thermal ranges, obtained by classifying daily mean temperatures corresponding to every capture event, was compared using a test for multiple independent proportions. Twenty-three species from six genera were captured and two groups could be identified: group 1, species captured in all thermal ranges and group 2, species not captured below 11 degrees C. Flight activity of the different species would be affected by daily and seasonal mean temperature. Species of group 1, which are present throughout the year, seem to be triggered above a certain threshold of temperature, regardless of the season. Group 2 species would display a seasonal activity pattern.

AB  - Ottoman State withdrawing from Europe since 1683 also started emigration movement. Ottoman Lands reducing caused; Muslim Turkish population emigration to the lands under State dominance. Furthermore, significant amount of Muslim population sheltered to Ottoman State during Russian deportation enforced in Caucasia. Thousands of Muslim Emigrant emigrating from Rumelia, Caucasia and Crete were populated in Anatolia that was the centre of Ottoman lands. One of the cities they have been populated in Anatolia was Antalya. Emigrants sent to Antalya by seaway. As a result of emigrations settling, new neighborhoods and villages occured in Antalya. Emigrants feeding was provided by the state settling in Antalya and also residence to live and sum land was given. Nevertheless during feeding and and sheltering of emigrants some problems occured. But these problems were solved by central and local government cooperation. Besides some emigrant groups settled in Antalya provoked various public crimes during and after populating years.

AB  - Background: Ultrasound measurement of dynamic changes in inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter can be used to assess intravascular volume status in critically ill patients, but published studies vary in accuracy as well as recommended diagnostic cutoffs. Part of this variability may be related to movements of the vessel relative to the transducer during the respiratory cycle which results in unintended comparison of different points of the IVC at end expiration and inspiration, possibly introducing error related to variations in normal anatomy. The objective of this study was to quantify both craniocaudal and mediolateral movements of the IVC as well as the vessel's axis of collapse during respirophasic ultrasound imaging.
   Methods: Patients were enrolled from a single urban academic emergency department with ultrasound examinations performed by sonographers experienced in IVC ultrasound. The IVC was imaged from the level of the diaphragm along its entire course to its bifurcation with diameter measurements and respiratory collapse measured at a single point inferior to the confluence of the hepatic veins. While imaging the vessel in its long axis, movement in a craniocaudal direction during respiration was measured by tracking the movement of a fixed point across the field of view. Likewise, imaging the short axis of the IVC allowed for measurement of mediolateral displacement as well as the vessel's angle of collapse relative to vertical.
   Results: Seventy patients were enrolled over a 6-month period. The average diameter of the IVC was 13.8 mm (95% CI 8.41 to 19.2 mm), with a mean respiratory collapse of 34.8% (95% CI 19.5% to 50.2%). Movement of the vessel relative to the transducer occurred in both mediolateral and craniocaudal directions. Movement was greater in the craniocaudal direction at 21.7 mm compared to the mediolateral movement at 3.9 mm (p < 0.001). Angle of collapse assessed in the transverse plane averaged 115 degrees (95% CI 112 degrees to 118 degrees).
   Conclusions: Movement of the IVC occurs in both mediolateral and craniocaudal directions during respirophasic ultrasound imaging. Further, collapse of the vessel occurs not at true vertical (90 degrees) but 25 degrees off this axis. Technical approach to IVC assessment needs to be tailored to account for these factors.

AB  - Landless farmworkers in Brazil typically occupy land that is legally eligible for expropriation, but the state normally does not expropriate until a land occupation forces the hand of authorities. Landowners and local authorities in the Brazilian countryside frequently respond to occupations with violent repression. Their action reflects the hybrid character of the Brazilian state, modern and rational in cities and at the federal level but, in many rural areas, still clientelistic and marked by nonlegitimate violence. Land occupiers, landowners, and authorities jointly enact a repertoire of collective action that corresponds to the backward character of the state in those areas. The action of the land occupiers, however, is legitimated by the claim of civil disobedience while the efforts to repress them cannot lay claim to legitimacy on that basis.

Between December 2009 and March 2010, the internship aimed to understand the regional context, identity and tourism in Burgundy. This region is the ancient wine and local products increases the practice and tourism dissemination. The Burgundian regionalist formation occurred within the regionalist formation of France, in the late nineteenth century and was strengthened in the period between the two World Wars. The analysis of the historical process of local formation showed that the regionalist movement was strategically articulated, in order to maintain farmers' field, avoiding their mass migration to the cities, and encouraging local production of products that would become typical, elitist and later worldwide recognized.

AB  - Water main pipes buried in expansive soils are often subjected to severe distress subsequent to installation. Excessive stresses may be induced due to either differential movement of the soils or swelling pressures from the soils along the pipes, impairing their performance or even breaking them. Field monitoring is an important means for understanding soil behaviour and its interaction with water mains. For this purpose, field instrumentation was successfully installed to monitor the performance of a section of water main placed in a well-developed area of a city neighbourhood where more frequent pipe breakage had occurred in recent years. The instrumentation included sensors to measure pipe wall strains, pipe displacement, in situ soil water content, soil pressure, and temperature. The instruments were installed in both the soil backfill and native soil around the backfill. This paper presents the analyses of monitoring data collected during the first 3 years after instrument installation. It was observed that the soil and pipe behaviour was affected significantly by soil properties and seasonal changes and correlated closely with the change pattern of the local meteorological conditions.

AB  - The collective of agents is considered, each of which possesses states - "healthy", "sick", "virus carrier", "in hospital", "possesses immunity". Average values of duration of a current of disease, the incubatory period, and duration of immunity are set. Controlling parameters of system are the probability of disease, probability of realization of medical help, number of places in hospital, coverage of the population by inoculations. It is necessary to research time change of states of the multiagent system based on pair interactions.
   We offer to imitate the behavior of agents collective representing each of them as elastic sphere. Agents move in the conditional city landscape, such as streets of various widths and intensity of movement, square, hospitals, educational institutions, etc. For movement of agents we propose the technique of "preferable directions". Each event occurs in a digital moment of time; the moments of future events are allocated on increasing order. Local time is entered for each agent that allows moving only two of them in collision case.
   One of simulation results is that the time duration between disease peaks exceeds the average period of immunity in 1.1 - 1.2 times.

AB  - Introduction Biometeorological Circumstances have great influ-, ence on all traffic participant's, especially on reflexes, movement' coordination and perception ability, increasing the number of accidents. Motocyclists and bicyclists are specific participants in traffic, so their traumatism has its own special characteristics:
   Objective The aim of this study was to establish biorneteorological influence on motorcyclists and bicyclists accidents.
   Methods Comparative analysis of everyday biometeorological phases for the city of Kragujevac determinated by the Republic Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia and motorcyclists and bicyclists accident evidence received from Kragujevac traffic police for the period 2004-2008.
   Results There were 5,180 traffic accidents in this period, with 180 accidents in which 77 motorcyclists and 116 bicyclists were knocked down. Most of the accidents were in 2008 (53) arid the least in 2005 (28). Most accidents occurred during August (28) and between 19.00 and 20.00 hours (18). There were no acci. dents during January, between 04.00 and 06.00 hours. There were 85% accidents in the urban area Most of 169 males were aged 16-20 and 21-25 years (20 and 21). Most of 24 females (6).1 were aged-11-15 years. Those Who caused the accident mostly sustained injuries due to improper speed limit (31), while the victims due to the disrespect of street crossing priorities (32). Forty-one motorcyclists and 85 bicyclists suffered mild body injuries. Thirty-one motorcyclists and 27 bicyclist suffered severe injuries. Five motorcyclists and four bicyclists ended lethally. Most accidents happened in biometeorological phases 9 (63), 4 (32) and 1 (31).
   Conclusion Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between accidents-and biometeorological phases, with most accidents occurring during stabile warm weather and rapid penetrations of cold fronts, and with a sudden switch of, weather conditions.

AB  - Riparian cottonwood/willow forest assemblages are highly valued in the southwestern United States for their wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and watershed protection. Yet these forests are under considerable threat from climate change impacts on water resources and land-use activities to support human enterprise. Stream diversions, groundwater pumping, and extended drought have resulted in the decline of cottonwood/willow forests along many riparian corridors in the Southwest and, in many cases, the replacement of these forests with less desirable invasive shrubs and trees. Nevertheless, ecophysiological responses of cottonwood and willow, along with associated ecohydrological feedbacks of soil water depletion, arc not well understood. Ecophysiological processes of mature Fremont cottonwood and coyote willow stands were examined over four consecutive growing seasons (2004-2007) near Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The tree stands occurred near the inlet of a reservoir that was drained in the spring of 2005 and remained empty until mid-summer of 2006, effectively removing the primary water source for most of two growing seasons. Stem sap flux density (J(s)) in cottonwood was highly correlated with volumetric soil moisture (theta) in the upper 60 cm and decreased sevenfold as soil moisture dropped from 12% to 7% after the reservoir was drained. Conversely. J(s) in willow was marginally correlated with theta and decreased by only 25% during the same period. Opposite patterns emerged during the following growing season: willow had a lower whole-plant conductance (k(t)) in June and higher leaf carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) than cottonwood in August, whereas k(t) and delta(13)C were otherwise similar between species. Water relations in both species recovered quickly from soil water depletion, with the exception that sapwood area to stem area (A(s):A(st)) was significantly lower in both species after the 2007 growing season compared to 2004. Results suggest that cottonwood has a greater sensitivity to interannual reductions in water availability, while willow is more sensitive to longer periods of soil water depletion. These data shed light on the linkage between soil water deficits and ecophysiological processes of threatened riparian forests given potential land-use and long-term drought impacts on freshwater resources.

AB  - During 2006, thirty-one oral histories were collected in Pich, Campeche, to research patterns of mobility among agricultural families living in hamlets (rancherias) located near permanent water sources. Two patterns were found: (1) movement from one hamlet to another on average every fourteen years with reoccupation in a generational cycle; and (2) repeated movements throughout the year between the hamlet home and a permanent house in town (dual-residence). Thus, over a domestic cycle of approximately thirty-five years, the typical agricultural family occupied at least three houses. These data suggest a need to revise existing Pre-Columbian population estimates for the agricultural population providing food to the city-states of the Northern Maya Lowlands. In general, estimates based on house mounds have not included rates of reduction due to mobility or dual residency for lack of detailed ethnographic information such as we here provide for the agricultural families of Pich.

AB  - Aims To describe the public use of respiratory hygiene behaviours during the 2009 influenza pandemic and to test the feasibility of an observational method.
   Methods Respiratory behaviour was systematically observed at three public settings during August 2009 in the capital city of New Zealand (Wellington). Data on each coughing or sneezing event were collected.
   Results A total of 384 respiratory events were observed, at a rate of 0.8 cough/sneeze per observed-person-hour. Around a quarter of respiratory events (27.3%) were uncovered, and there was infrequent use of the responses recommended by health authorities (i.e., covering with a tissue or handkerchief at 3.4% and covering with elbow or arm at 1.3%). Respiratory event rates were higher in all settings that were 'high flow' (for people movement) compared to 'low flow' settings. Uncovered events were more common among people at the hospital entrance versus the hospital cafe [risk ratio (RR) = 7.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-52.6] and when a person was located within 1 m of others (RR = 1 5, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9). Observing respiratory hygiene was found to be feasible in all of the selected public locations. There was good agreement between observing pairs about whether or not respiratory events occurred (inter-observer correlation = 0.81) and for uncovered versus covered events (total Cohen's kappa score = 0.70).
   Conclusions It was feasible to document respiratory hygiene behaviour in public urban settings during a influenza pandemic. Respiratory hygiene advice was not being adequately followed by this population towards the end of the first wave of the pandemic.

AB  - There are numerous studies describing nest-boxes as breeding places for birds, and sometimes for mammals. However, our results show that in urban conditions nest-boxes are also important nesting places for Hornets (Vespa crabro). The proportion of nest-boxes occupied by V crabro in this study was between 8 and 20% and varied significantly from year to year. We did not find any relationship between birds' presence in nest-boxes in winter, as well as in spring, and nest-box occupancy by Hornets. We found high nest-site tenacity, defined as a preference to re-use the same nest-box during the study period. However, this tenacity did not persist in the last season when new boxes were added. The high occupancy level of nest-boxes we have observed might increase human-hornet conflicts. Therefore, when placing bird nest-boxes in urbanized areas it must be borne in mind that a substantial proportion may become occupied by this particular insect.

AB  - This study examines the impact of the revitalization of low-income, public housing properties on homicide patterns. It tracks the movement of homicide clusters from the initial properties to those neighborhoods where public housing residents were displaced over a 19-year period in Louisville, Kentucky. The median-income level of residents and vacant housing emerged as important predictors of homicide clusters. This article concludes that low-income public housing and Section 8 housing properties provide an environment where homicides are likely to occur. This pattern remained in effect even when the nature of public housing changed.

AB  - It is widely recognized that refugee integration occurs most effectively within communities that are rich in inter-cultural social capital. This paper explores the dangers associated with intensely bonded and disconnected communities and the relationship between refugee marginalization and the presence of youth gangs. Drawing upon a small-scale qualitative study with young refugees in Glasgow, it seeks to explore the extent to and ways in which these young people experience social bonding and bridging and participate in gang culture. The findings suggest that excessive bonding social capital often limits opportunities for inter-cultural integration in Glasgow. Gang membership, although driven primarily by territorial issues, provides one site for ethnic solidarity and racial prejudice. The paper considers the potential for community initiatives to build inter-cultural cohesion, and ends by calling for changes to dispersal policy and for further research to explore the most effective vehicles for building social capital in multi-ethnic urban communities.

AB  - The importance of effective and efficient traffic congestion monitoring grows with the enlarging of urban scale and increasing number of vehicles. We develop a traffic congestion monitoring system which is based on adaptive background subtraction. The system reads real time monitoring video from communications department and converts it into images. After that, we change them into corresponding gray images and carry out image binarization with dynamic multiple thresholds method which selects thresholds depending on pixel, grayscale and pixel position. Afterwards we perform noise reduction with an adaptive median filtering which, taking environmental and other factors into account, dynamically changes median filtering window scale in accordance with the noise density. To fit actual environmental changing, the system updates the background periodically by dynamic background refreshing method. We also put forward an adaptive background subtraction method, which can remove burst noise, to identify the moving objects and get total movement in a given time. Finally, the system determines whether the congestion occurs by comparison result of the total movement and predefined threshold. With the system, traffic management department can facilitate rapid access to the road traffic conditions and real-time traffic congestion monitoring.

AB  - This paper develops means of apprehending the rhythms of everyday practices and performances. Emerging from the context of recent calls for more explicit engagements with issues surrounding research methods and methodologies in the doing of cultural geography, and in particular in the examination of the geographies of practices, the paper responds to critiques of recent discussions of urban and social rhythms that highlight limitations in the articulation of methods for actually apprehending everyday rhythms. As such, in conversation with Lefebvre's portrait of the rhythmanalyst and other works interested in the significance of rhythm to social practices, the paper proposes time-lapse photography as a useful component of such a rhythm-analytical, and more generally practice-orientated, methodology. In doing so, the paper draws attention to this method's ability to document and facilitate the reflection upon the complex durational unfolding of events and the situation of key occurrences within this polyrhythmia. This is illustrated in relation to the everyday rhythms of a specific urban space in Bath, UK and a street magician's variously successful attempt to intervene into the everyday life of Bath.

From this place connections, interconnections and social, economical, cultural and emotional exchanges occur. It's about resuming a certain emotion in movement (emotion in motion), more appropriately described as e-motion in motion, where technological network mechanisms play a key role. We want to reapproach distinct historical times: yesterday's Potosi, which still reverberates in today's Evo Morale's Bolivia, interrogating as to the future of a mixed society and Shanghai Biennial-2008, China, under the symbol of translocalmotion, talking about the past-future of Hutong's apples and the birds in ordinary bamboo cages.

This article examines key chapters of those stories by tracing the dynamics of collective memory as related to the movement to remember the air raids and build a Tokyo Peace Museum. It concludes with an analysis of the existing memorial as a space of literal memory.

AB  - Fasciolosis is a parasitic disease which is caused by digenetic trematodes, such as Fasciola hepatica, and which occurs worldwide. The disease causes significant economic losses in cattle because of the reduction in milk and meat production and because the parasitized livers have no economic value. Also, abortion and mortality rates increase. To determine the Occurrence and dispersal of F. hepatica in the state of Minas Gerais, fecal samples were collected from bovines aged 12 months and older between April 2005 and April 2006. The bovines came from 1,251 rural farms of 120 municipalities/cities in Minas Gerais. Water was collected to ascertain the presence of the intermediate host in the properties where infected bovines were found. A total of 16 Municipalities had infected bovines and 13 had the presence of Lymnaea columella. We detected infected bovines in 70% of the rural farms visited in the municipality of Itajuba. Itajuba was also found to have infected snails with the larval stage of E hepatica. The results revealed that infection by E hepatica in bovines of Minas Gerais was associated with the presence of the intermediate host and favorable epidemiological factors, drawing attention to the necessity of adopting proper control measures in the area.

AB  - The maned wolf has been studied in nature reserves, but few researches have been carried out outside protected areas. Since only about 2 % of the Brazilian Cerrado, the maned wolf's main habitat, has been set aside as parks and reserves, determining what is happening with the species in private and disturbed areas is important for an accurate assessment of its vulnerability to extinction. Here we investigated the trophic ecology of a maned wolf population inhabiting a 1610 ha section of the Calcada Ridge, an unprotected area located in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, capital of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The study site is in the buffer zone (<10 km) of two protected areas, where anthropogenic (urban areas and roads) and disturbed areas (burned fields) total a third of the study landscape. The main disturbances are mining activities, unregulated ecotourism and road proximity. Fecal samples (n=95) collected between 2006 and 2008 revealed that the maned wolf frequently used both natural and disturbed fields. The diet was composed mostly of small mammals (9 species, 16.2 % of items and 92.6% of scats) and the plant Solanum lycocarpum (12.2% of items and 89.5% of scats), similar to what has been found in less disturbed areas. Overall diet diversity was, however, lower than has been found elsewhere, probably reflecting the poorer resource base of the study area. These results, together with recent findings from other sources, highlight the importance of buffer zones. They also suggest that the maned wolf is an ecologically flexible species that might be prone to hunt, and perhaps even survive, in disturbed areas outside protected areas.

AB  - The green building or green architecture has come to light as a strong architectural movement at the end of 1990's and as a main trend in architectural practice. The architectural green is a modern architectural philosophy which deals with the competent relationship between the functional constructive systems and its vital environmental, by controlling the inputs and outputs of this system with the least negative effects on the environment and occupant's health, and the least energy consumption during the various stages of the building ( construction, operation, maintenance and destruction) to achieve the functional activities and the inventive and efficient architectural structures.
   The importance of this movement lies in trying to achieve the sustainable development in its environmental, social and economic aspects because of the problems that developed and developing countries (e.g. Iraq) face such as energy consumption and pollution. Several international standards of different classifications, depending on local context of each country, has been appeared. Some of these tools are (BREEAM, LEED, CO-CHPS Colorado, GBTool, CASBEE) which aim to assess the performance of the building from green Architecture's perspective. Although there is a similarity in the classification levels including the sustainable location, how to use (water, energy and atmosphere, materials, resources) effectively, indoor environment quality and the design's innovation, they differ in other aspects that its importance relies on the environmental and local context.
   The problem of our research was the absence of the practical evaluation tool of the green building (school buildings) for the Iraq's local context in general and Mosul in particular, compatibly with the city climate.
   The research aims at making theoretical construction to identify the assessment indicators of the school buildings from green architecture's perspective, in order to create suitable and general assessment tool for schools building in Mosul city which can help improving the performance of these schools, decreasing the effect on the health, sparing energy coasts, and other benefits in the stages of the project (pre-construction, construction, post-construction). The research supposes that the multi-dimensional designing strategy is an active tool used in establishing the tool classification of assessment.
   For reaching goals, the research adopts the theoretical method and questionnaire. Finally, the research provides an assessment tool for school building in Mosul from the green architecture's perspective (AGBS) Green Building Assessment Tool for school) in conformity with the local context of the city for enabling the designer to follow it in order to achieve the investment within his school architectural products. Results indicate six categories for assessment tool.

AB  - Releasing aquarium-held sharks when no longer needed by the holding institution may help mitigate the impacts that aquaria have on declining wild populations. To investigate the viability of releasing display specimens, four raggedtooth sharks (Carcharias taurus) that had been held at Two Oceans Aquarium, Cape Town were released back to the wild between 2004 and 2008. To test the hypothesis that they survived and that their movement patterns were similar to wild conspecifics, wild-caught sharks were also tagged and released at the same time and locality. Aquarium-and wild-caught sharks were equipped with pop-up archival (PAT) tags, VEMCO ultrasonic tags, and numbered spaghetti dart tags. With the exception of one individual, all the aquarium-released sharks survived. Both aquarium-released and wild-captured sharks displayed eastward movements and travelled hundreds of kilometres after release. Data from the PAT tags indicated that individuals from both groups swam mainly in shallow waters, but dived as deep as 80 m to mid-shelf waters. A wide temperature tolerance was exhibited as they travelled though temperatures ranging from 10 to 22 degrees C. Movement tracks of the sharks revealed 'station keeping' and an autumn migration between April and May. Rates of movement between individuals were variable. The depth range recorded in this study supports published information on habitat and prey choice. This study illustrates that this species can survive aquarium release after years of captivity and that they appear to behave similarly to wild-caught conspecifics.

AB  - To analyse the spatial distribution of TB in Antananarivo and investigate risk factors.
   Pulmonary TB data were collected through passive case detection in 16 Tuberculosis Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (DTC). New cases listed in the DTC registers from 2004 to 2006 and resident in Antananarivo were included in the study. Field workers of the national control program conducted household surveys of all cases to collect complementary information on socio-economic status. TB spatial organization and risk factors were analysed over two successive periods (August 2004-July 2005, August 2005-July 2006); analysis was done at the neighbourhood level, by searching for spatial clusters with the spatial scan test.
   3075 pulmonary tuberculosis new cases were reported in Antananarivo from 2004 to 2006. The average incidence during the study period was 74/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 64.9-84.5). Spatial clusters occurred in three of the six arrondissements (districts) of the city (192 neighbourhoods). A decrease in clustering was observed with movement towards the southern neighbourhood.
   The change in risk of a TB cluster was linked to socio-economic (e.g. household amount of ownership of tap water) and patient care factors (e.g. patients lost to follow-up).

AB  - Introduction: Pre-hospital ambulance calls are not random events, but occur in patterns and trends that are related to movement patterns of people, as well as the geographical epidemiology of the population. This study describes the geographic-time epidemiology of ambulance calls in a large urban city and conducts a time demand analysis. This will facilitate a Systems Status Plan for the deployment of ambulances based on the most cost effective deployment strategy. Materials and Methods: An observational prospective study looking at the geographic-time epidemiology of all ambulance calls in Singapore. Locations of ambulance calls were spot mapped using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Ambulance response times were mapped and a demand analysis conducted by postal districts. Results: Between 1 January 2006 and 31 May 2006, 31,896 patients were enrolled into the study. Mean age of patients was 51.6 years (S.D. 23.0) with 60.0% male. Race distribution was 62.5% Chinese, 19.4'% Malay, 12.9'% Indian and 5.2% others. Trauma consisted 31.2% of calls and medical 68.8%. 9.7% of cases were priority 1 (most severe) and 70.11/6 priority 2 (moderate severity). Mean call receipt to arrival at scene was 8.0 min (S.D. 4.8). Call volumes in the day were almost twice those at night, with the most calls on Mondays. We found a definite geographical distribution pattern with heavier call volumes in the suburban town centres in the Eastern and Southern part of the country. We characterised the top 35 districts with the highest call volumes by time periods, which will form the basis for ambulance deployment plans. Conclusion: We found a definite geographical distribution pattern of ambulance calls. This study demonstrates the utility of GIS with despatch demand analysis and has implications for maximising the effectiveness of ambulance deployment. Ann Acad Med Singapore 2009;38:184-91

AB  - The term 'amenity migration' describes a broad diversity of patterns of human movement to rural places in search of particular lifestyle attributes. This review of international literature, drawn from the authors' own prior research and searches on relevant databases, synthesises findings on the implications of amenity migration for the creation and distribution of environmental harms and benefits. Further, we critique common framings of amenity migration-related environmental transformations and offer suggestions for future research. Analysis is positioned within a review of five common themes reflected in the cases we consider: land subdivision and residential development; changes in private land use; cross-boundary effects; effects on local governance institutions; and displacement of impacts. Within each of these themes, we discuss the uneven geographies of environmental transformation formed by diverse conceptions of 'nature', patterns of local management of amenity-driven transformations, and ecological contexts. We conclude that through both intended and unintended environmental consequences of dominant activities and land uses, amenity migration results in a redistribution of environmental harms and benefits at multiple scales, as rural landscapes are (partially and incompletely) re-created in line with the ideals and expectations of amenity migrant populations.

AB  - Entomological surveys on Aedes aegypti (L) often focus on residential premises, while ignoring nonresidential premises. It has been proposed that the latter should be subject to specific monitoring strategies, since they have the potential to contribute a large proportion of the overall mosquito population. In this study, we used traps for ovipositing females to compare the levels of Ae. aegypti infestation in residential and non-residential premises and assess whether there was any evidence for a spatial association of infestation between non-residential premises and the surrounding homes. This information is important for designing specific surveillance programmes for these special sites and their surroundings. This study was conducted in three neighbourhoods of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with distinct population densities, water services, dengue histories and vegetation coverage. Ae. aegypti abundance was measured using two types of traps (standard and sticky ovitraps) installed in five non-residential premises and 80 residential premises per neighbourhood. Mosquitoes were collected in the summer (January to March) and winter (June to September) of 2007. The distribution of captures per household per week did not differ significantly between the seasons, although larger numbers of eggs and adults were obtained during the summer. Most non-residential premises were not significantly more infested than homes, despite the larger quantities of containers. There were a few exceptions, including a transportation company, two recycling centres and a boat yard. These highly infested non-residential premises were also spatially associated with highly infested homes in the vicinity. Continuous monitoring with traps may be an effective way of evaluating non-residential premises as sources of dengue vectors for nearby communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Brazil faces an expansion and urbanization of American visceral leishmaniasis with human and canine cases in several metropolises. This report describes two cases of autochthonous canine visceral leishmaniasis in the city of Florianopolis, state of Santa Catarina, classified as an area previously without disease transmission.
   Case: Five dogs from Canto dos Aracas, Lagoa da Conceicao, Florianopolis municipality, which had no history of displacement to other municipalities, were studied by collecting clinical specimens in an attempt to isolate the parasite and to confirm the infection by Leishmania. For sampling the animals were sedated and after local shaving, asepsis and anesthesia with lidocaine HCl 2%, two fragments of apparently healthy skin of the scapular region with the aid of a 3 mm punch were obtained. The two fragments were placed in sterile saline plus antibiotics and antifungal agents solution to attempt the isolation of the parasite in NNN culture medium plus Schneider's medium. In addition to the collection of skin fragment, animals underwent bone marrow (BM) needle aspiration, obtained from the manubrium of the sternum, using a 20 mL syringe with 40x12 mm needle and aspiration biopsy of popliteal lymph nodes using Valeri citoaspirador 10 mL syringe and 25x8 mm needle, both performed after local shaving, asepsis and anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. The material collected from punctures biopsies was also seeded in an attempt of isolating the parasites. Among the five examined animals, in three cases promastigotes were isolated, two of which through the cultivation of skin fragments and one through a punctured sample of the lymph node. In two cases isoenzymatic characterization and identifying parasites such as Leishmania chagasi could be performed.
   Discussion: The LVC findings in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina generates great concern due to lack of knowledge of the actual spread of the disease, transmission dynamics in this area, knowledge of the vector, wild reservoirs and even in relation to the canine population exposed, for the first time, to Leishmania chagasi. These peculiar conditions may contribute to the onset of an abrupt expansion of the disease, differently from endemic regions. This fact can also be observed in many other cities in Brazil, mainly due to the development and expansion of road networks and the popularity of air travel, which increases the transit of people and their pets thereby increasing the risk of dispersion, not only of LVC, as of other infectious diseases to non-endemic areas. Another important point which causes dispersion of the LVC is related to some owners' attempt to get around the main control method, which is euthanasia for positive dogs, and end up moving their animals to areas where there is no endemic canine serological survey, endangering the population of these areas. The use of some tools could avoid this type of dispersal, as the tighter control of the movement of dogs from endemic areas, implementation of mandatory serological diagnosis and mandatory reporting of positive canine cases. Moreover, educational measures to educate dog owners and veterinarians from the public and private sectors would also help in trying to minimize this problem. In this sense, it is extremely important that the entomological and epidemiological surveillance aimed at LVC are deployed and implemented in free areas, aiming at detecting the presence of vector and/or canine enzootic diseases before installing the anthropozoonotic cycle, allowing unprecedented action aimed at preventing the occurrence of disease in humans, or even prepare the health services and the population to fight the problem.

AB  - An invasive sawfly (Aproceros leucopoda; Hymenoptera, Argidae) has been attacking elms (Ulmus sp.) in Europe. It orginates from Japan and has been first recorded in Europe in 2003. In the paper the occurrence of A. leucopoda in Croatia is reported for the first time and prognosis of future dispersal and damages is given. Potential host plants of A. leucopoda are all native and introduced elm species in Europe. The sawfly has up to 4 generations per year and parthenogenetic reproduction, After six larval instars, eonymphs make loosely spun cocoons on the leaves (Figure 3). Adults (Figure 4) lay eggs along leaf margins. Young larvae (Figure 5) make distinctive zigzag feeding tracks on leaves (Figure 1), older larval instars devour the whole leaf and only midveins are left (Figure 2). The larve can completely defoliate elm trees which was the case in Japan, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Romania.
   A. leucopoda was first recorded in Croatia in 2011 on several locations (Table 1, Figure 6). On the leaves a tipical zigzag feeding tracks were recorded, larvae and cocoons were found and adults were raised from the colected cocoons. The species was identified with the help od the key in Blank et al. (2010). The number of generations per year was not determined. The damage on the elm trees in Croatia was not severe, no defoliation was observed and only single leaves were completely consumed.
   A. leucopoda can be considered as invasive species in Europe and Croatia, it can be expected that the sawfly will disperse to other parts of Croatia (to forests and urban trees) in the coming years. The sawfly will disperse actively (females are strong flyers) and passively (with traded material and vehicles). Complete defoliation of elm trees in Croatia can not be excluded in the coming years.

AB  - Bat surveys were conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Willoughby Local Government Area (LGA) in the northern suburbs of Sydney to determine the occurrence and movement of microbats. Based on the frequency of bat detections and the direction of bat movements, two major and five minor bat flyways were identified in the study area. The two major flyways were north south movement corridors that occurred on the eastern and western margins of the LGA; each major flyway had minor flyways branching from them. The two major flyways were separated from each other by the Pacific Highway rise that runs north south through the centre of the study area. The rise acts as an effective flyway barrier as tree corridors are completely disrupted by an exposed, noisy, night-illuminated residential and commercial strip. Minor bat flyways approach the Pacific Highway rise from the east and west and are only separated by a relatively short distance. Extending these flyways to create an east west passage across the study area would greatly extend the foraging range of bats on either side of it. In order to link the major flyways, the eastern and western minor flyways need to be extended by the creation of a continuous tree canopy through residential areas to the Pacific Highway rise. Controlled street planting and supported private plantings of trees along strategic routes, together with modified street lighting could achieve this result. The crossing of the Pacific Highway would require the construction of a lightweight "flyover bridge" that commenced and ended in the extended tree canopies. This would provide a wind and light shielded crossing point for bats attempting to fly east west across the Willoughby LGA. The components of the "flyover bridge" are discussed along with other considerations in achieving an effective extended flyway through a densely populated residential area.

AB  - In the United States alone, over 7400 bird-aircraft collisions (birdstrikes) were reported in 2007. Most of these strikes occurred during takeoff or landing of the flight, and it is during these flight phases that aircraft experience their highest risk of substantial damage after colliding with birds. Birdstrikes carry enormous potential costs in terms of lives and money. Using feather remains and other tissue samples collected from the engines of US Airways Flight 1549, which crash landed in the Hudson River in New York City on 15 January 2009 after a birdstrike, we apply molecular tools and stable hydrogen isotopes to demonstrate that migratory Canada geese were responsible for the crash. Determining whether the geese involved in this birdstrike event were resident or migratory is essential to the development of management techniques that could reduce the risk of future collisions. Currently, the US civil aviation industry is not required to report birdstrikes, yet information on frequency, timing, and species involved, as well as the geographic origin of the birds, is critical to reducing the number of birdstrikes. Integrating this information with bird migration patterns, bird-detecting radar, and bird dispersal programs at airports can minimize the risk of such collisions in the future.

AB  - A mobile platform was outfitted with real-time instruments to spatially characterize pollution concentrations in communities adjacent to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, communities heavily impacted by emissions related to dieselized goods movement, with the highest localized air pollution impacts due to heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDT). Measurements were conducted in the winter and summer of 2007 on fixed routes driven both morning and afternoon. Diesel-related pollutant concentrations such as black carbon, nitric oxide, ultrafine particles, and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were frequently elevated two to five times within 150 m downwind of freeways (compared to more than 150 m) and up to two times within 150 m downwind of arterial roads with significant amounts of diesel traffic. While wind direction was the dominant factor associated with downwind impacts, steady and consistent wind direction was not required to produce: high impacts were observed when a given area was downwind of a major roadway for any significant fraction of time. This suggests elevated pollution impacts downwind of freeways and of busy arterials are continuously occurring on one side of the road or the other, depending on wind direction. The diesel truck traffic in the area studied was high, with more than 2000 trucks per peak hour on the freeway and two- to six-hundred trucks per hour on the arterial roads studied. These results suggest that similarly-frequent impacts occur throughout urban areas in rough proportion to diesel truck traffic fractions. Thus, persons living or working near and downwind of busy roadways can have several-fold higher exposures to diesel vehicle-related pollution than would be predicted by ambient measurements in non-impacted locations.

AB  - This paper describes a method of using Craigslist personal ads to better understand the movement behavior of anonymous, casual sex-seeking individuals within the men-whohave-sex-with-men community. Given recent dramatic increases in HIV and sexually transmitted disease within this community, gaining insight into how sexual networks connect neighborhoods and cities is important for formulating public health interventions. Due to the high degree of similarity exhibited by subsets of Craigslist ads, and the presumption that a set of near-identical ads, when not spam, originate from the same author, we can apply techniques for efficient near-duplicate detection to identify clusters of near-identical ads. By examining each of these clusters and identifying differences in user-supplied location tags, we can then reconstruct an approximation of an anonymous individual's movement footprint over time, as well as estimate the rate at which ad authors seek sexual encounters. For the state of California, we find that 86% of all encounter requests for a given set occur within a 50 mile area, with only less that 4% of messages reflecting long-distance travel over 250 miles. 60% of all detected clusters reposted ads within 2 weeks of the first detected post. We show that even in the relatively noisy, unstructured data environment of anonymous personal ads, it is still possible to extract meaningful signal and identify useful social network properties for analysis.

AB  - With the development of modern cities, numerous buildings over 40-storey have been constructed in recent decades. Fire safety issues, especially evacuation, are of the major concerns for building designers, occupants, as well as governments. To ensure the safety of ultra high-rise building evacuation, different performance-based designs have been proposed. In this study, we propose a quantitative and viable elevator aided ultra-high rise building evacuation model which simulates both pedestrian movement and elevator transportation. After validation and calibration, the proposed Ultra high-rise building Evacuation with Elevators (UEE) model is adopted to explore two main evacuation strategies, i.e., phased evacuation and total evacuation with the aid of elevators. In these two strategies, refuge floor plays an important part because it not only provides a place for temporarily stop, but also for the transition from stair evacuation into elevator evacuation. Thus, the effect of refuge floor interval on the high-rise building evacuation process is further investigated. It is found that the interval design of refuge floors has a direct relation with the characteristics of the elevators and building occupants. In the case that a proper ratio of the building occupants is transported to the ground level by fast elevators while others are evacuated by stairs, the evacuation process can reach an optimized state.

AB  - The wool carder bee, Anthidium manicatum, is the most widely distributed unmanaged bee in the world. It was unintentionally introduced to North America in the late 1960s from Europe, and subsequently, into South America, New Zealand and the Canary Islands. We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A. manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, USA. Anthidium manicatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and MaxEnt background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution models to examine the potential distribution of A. manicatum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manicatum model based on locality and background data from the species' native range predicted 50% of the invasive records associated with high habitat suitability (HS >= 0.90). The invasive North American model predicted a much broader distribution of A. manicatum (214% increase); whereas, the South American model predicted a narrower distribution (88% decrease). The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D = 0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D = 0.69). We discuss the naturalization of A. manicatum in North America, possibly through punctuated dispersal, the probability of suitable habitats across the globe and the synanthropy exhibited by this invasive species.

AB  - Managing flying-fox camps is an increasing challenge for agencies responsible for managing wildlife and residential communities along the east coast of Australia. Conflict has arisen between humans and flying-foxes when camp sites were established in urban areas or when people have settled close to existing camps. People and government agencies have often attempted to disperse the flying-foxes away from these camps in the hope that they will move to different locations, but the success of these attempts has been poorly documented. This paper examines the consequences of a coordinated, government-sponsored attempt to relocate a flying-fox camp in the township of Maclean, northern NSW. This camp was a maternity site that had been occupied regularly for over 100 years. Between 1999 and 2007, the flying-foxes were repeatedly induced to move by subjecting the camp to continuous loud noise. Here we compile records to show that the total cost of this relocation attempt was at least $400,000 including 640 person-hours of effort. Flying-foxes made 23 attempts in those years to return to the original camp, although the frequency of attempts declined over time. Twelve other sites were used during this time as temporary camps, including seven sites not previously occupied. In 2004, flying-foxes established a new continuously-occupied camp in the Iluka township, 16 km north east of Maclean, which was still in use in 2010 (the time of finalising this paper). Residents near to the Iluka camp were by then intensively lobbying governments to disperse the animals from this new location. The outcome after nearly a decade of dispersal attempts at Maclean was that flying-foxes continued to return periodically to the original site, and there were more camp sites established in the region, over a wider area than previously known from historical records, and the number of affected residents experiencing conflict had increased. This experience raises questions of how, and at what spatial and temporal scales, the success of relocation attempts should be determined.

AB  - In Puerto Rico, respiratory diseases affect a significant percentage of the population, and it is possible that the environmental factors unique to the island, such as easterly winds, dense vegetation, and high humidity, may increase the concentration of airborne biological particulates that could distress susceptible individuals. As most studies characterized fungal spores and pollen in temperate zones, we wanted to describe their concentrations in a tropical zone. The Allergenco(A (R)) (MK3) spore trap was used to monitor airborne spores and pollen concentrations for 12 months starting on May 2005. During the length of the study, silicone grease-coated microscope slides captured 12 impacts daily, which were then stained with calcofluor and observed under the microscope with bright field and ultraviolet light. Atmospheric conditions were recorded with the Precision Weather Station(A (R)). Precipitation, dew point, and relative humidity promote the presence of fungal spores in San Juan throughout the year, with basidiospores being the most frequent. Spore concentrations were higher during the early morning hours all the year around. Wind and gusts were dispersal factors, and humidity and the dew point favored the release of spores into the atmosphere. In contrast to spores, pollens were not found to be affected by any of the meteorological factors and no distinctive patterns were found. Describing how airborne spores and pollens, many of which have allergenic potential, behave in the tropics, such as in San Juan, Puerto Rico, could be used to design preventive measures for the benefit of the sensitized population. Information about the presence and abundance of aeroallergens will assist in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and asthma on the island.

AB  - Report some of the changes in production and consumption occurring in the state of Sao Paulo. through the restructuring in motion systems, logistics and standards and taxation, as well as the impacts on urban spaces through new economic dynamics, imposed by the demands of corporate, is the purpose of this article. The decentralization of production and consumption towards the interior was made possible by the combination of hierarchical and ordered some basic elements such as technological innovations (ways and means of transport) and organizational (logistics, standards and taxation) which optimized the flow territorial state Sao Paulo. It is noteworthy, therefore: 1) the improvement of logistics as a strategy, planning and management of transport, storage and communications (including the granting of public services to private), 2) the technological improvement and expansion of motion systems (infrastructure, means of transport) and 3) the systems of rules and regulations through taxation and deregulation affect the circulatory system of a given space. Thus, both systems aims to disentangle the economic flows (goods, services, information, capital and people) and provide a more fluid territorial. The impacts on the State of Sao Paulo, mainly through its economic dynamics, revert positively and negatively, by changing the way one thinks and performs planning.

AB  - Background: Evidence from more than 30 years of research suggests a profound relationship between social participation and human health and well-being. People who hold meaningful roles in Supportive social Contexts live longer, get sick less often, suffer less disability, and recover faster from life-threatening events. However, despite ample evidence of benefit, the complex phenomenon of social participation has proved difficult to untangle in creating policies or programs for optimizing health in diverse communities. For vulnerable populations, the answer to the question of what contexts invite meaningful participation and improve well-being remains unclear.
   Purpose: This study explores how diverse participants engage in a supportive network and proposes a theoretic model of community-building for health promotion.
   Methods: Principles of community-based participatory research were used for qualitative study using in-depth interviews, with a purposeful sample of 28 members of a service exchange program in an urban community.
   Results: Four primary themes that were related to participation in the service exchange program were identified: (1) motivation for participation; (2) service exchange, or reciprocity, as vital to the program, with distinct benefits in a heterogeneous group; (3) Occurrence of personal and community growth; and (4) health promotion and improved well-being. A model of how participation in the service exchange leads to community-building is presented.
   Conclusions: The model Suggests that opportunities for reciprocity are fundamental to healthy community development in heterogeneous groups. Further study of how reciprocity encourages diverse populations to work together to create a landscape of healing may provide a valuable framework for health promotion.

AB  - Karst hydrology is characterized by multiple springs, sinkholes, and losing streams resulting from acidic water percolating through limestone. These features provide direct connections between surface water and groundwater and increase the risk of groundwater, spring, and stream contamination. Anthropogenic activities (agriculture, tourism, urban and residential areas) accentuate the contamination potentials. The objectives of this article arc, to present a modification of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (version 2005) that allows faster percolation through the soil substrate and recharge of the aquifer. This addition was necessary to simulate quick movement of water through vertical conduits that characterize karst topography. The model was calibrated for the James River basin, a large watershed (3,600 km(2)) in southwest Missouri. Losing streams were simulated by specifying high soil conductivities in the channels, and sinkholes were simulated as ponds with a high hydraulic conductivity at the bottom. Results indicated that the changes improved the partition of stream flow between surface and return flow. Water quality results indicated that the SWAT model can be used to simulate the frequency of occurrence of pollutant concentrations and daily loads. This case study highlights the possibilities and limitations in modeling flow and water pollutant movement in a karst watershed.

AB  - The study demonstrates the importance, in general, of adopting a geographical (integral) approach and local analysis to determine flood risk in small Mediterranean basins, where normally there is no surface runoff. At the same time, it highlights the possibilities afforded by a post-flood study. More specifically, the study seeks to identify the factors that aggravated the impact of the extreme flood event in the tourist town of Calpe (Alicante, Spain) on 12 October 2007.
   Our results stress the high volume of discharge that can be generated by small basins in the Mediterranean following intense rainfall events that may exceed 200 mm/day. For the 4.6 km(2) drainage network studied here, we calculate a maximum discharge of 143 m(3)/s, for a return period of 500 years. This natural risk (high potential discharge in what are usually dry basins) is exacerbated by the socioeconomic transformations that have taken place along the Mediterranean coast. The expansion of urban land use has increased vulnerability to flooding in highly attractive tourist zones that are now at high risk of flooding. The municipal area recognised as presenting a class "2" qualitative vulnerability (on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 is the most vulnerable) rose from 1% to 34% between 1956 and 2002. Changes to the basins and the traditional drainage systems in endorheic zones have also increased vulnerability to flood events. For example, the area occupied by the mouth of the main basin analysed here has fallen from 2.4 ha in 1956 to just 0.7 ha in 2002.
   The study's main conclusions point to the need to introduce hydrological monitoring networks in small drainage systems in ephemeral river basins. It also stresses the importance of implementing structural actions to facilitate surface runoff discharge. In the mid-to-long term we conclude that there should be a declassification of urban land use zones at high risk of flooding. Moreover, detailed (local) studies which adopt an integral approach in their post-flood analyses should be undertaken to identify levels of flood risk and the appropriate land use regulations required.

AB  - We measured the reproductive rate of Red-shouldered Hawks (Buteo lineatus) nesting in suburban southwestern Ohio and in a rural forested region in Hocking Hills, southeastern Ohio, from 1997 to 2005. In the suburban region, the reproductive rate varied greatly from nest to nest, less so from year to year, indicating that some nest areas consistently produced more young than others. The most productive 25% of nest areas produced 44% of all the nestlings in the study, whereas the least productive 25% of nest areas produced only 7% of all nestlings. In the rural area, the reproductive rate varied significantly from year to year, less so from nest area to nest area. Overall reproductive rates in the two study areas differed only in 2000. We suggest that differences among the nest areas in reproductive rate likely indicate differences in habitat quality of individual nest areas, whereas differences among years likely reflect regional factors that influence nesting birds, such as weather.

AB  - The scope of this study was to evaluate an intervention program with group physical exercises to prevent falls in the elderly in long-term care institutions. This is a non-randomized clinical trial conducted with 20 institutionalized elderly people in the city of Goiania in Brazil. The interventions occurred over the period of five months, though the proposed exercise program was based on earlier studies. Standardized measures were used to assess falls, balance and gait, muscle strength, flexibility and fear of falling. After the period of 12 months from the start of intervention there was a significant reduction in the number of falls (p = 0.046). Based on the program, significant differences were observed for point allocation of the maneuvers of balance (p = 0.001), total scores of the maneuvers of balance and gait (p = 0.007), muscle strength of hand grip (p = 0.001) and of lower limbs (p < 0.001), flexibility of movement of shoulder flexion (p = 0.001). The intervention using an exercise program proved to be adequate, albeit insufficient to improve the gait, multiple joint flexibility of the spine and hip and fear of falling, or to reduce the number of elderly people who suffered falls from the beginning of the study.

AB  - After near extirpation in the early 20th century, Ring-billed Gulls (Lures delawarensis) are currently (2009) the most abundant colonial waterbird nesting on the Great Lakes. Nest count data are reported from four decadal censuses (1976-2009) conducted by the Canadian Wildlife Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Numbers increased from 305,790 nests (1976-80) to a peak of 718,887 nests (1989-90), then decreased to 652,664 (1997-2000) and to 585,984 nests (2007-09). Changes varied spatially after the second census with greatest losses (-38.6%) at North Channel, Georgian Bay and northern Lake Huron colonies, and greatest gains (+324.2%) at Lake Michigan colonies. A total of 472 sites had nests in at least one census (Canada N = 319; U.S. N = 153). Eighteen (3.8%) colonies had >2,000 nests in all four censuses, and had 37.5-41.9% of all nests in each census. Site occupancy was fluid. A high proportion (56.8%, N = 268) of sites contained nests in only one of the four censuses, and few (N = 40,8.5%) had nests in all censuses. Thirty-nine sites had >2,000 nests gains/losses between census periods; 14 (35.9%) were on urban/industrial lands with artificial substrates. Human management and predator activities at some colonies contributed to declines in nest numbers at these locations. Movement of breeding birds among colonies and changes in local food supply may have influenced changes in nest numbers elsewhere. Reasons for the overall nest losses across the Great Lakes after the second census are unknown. Received 15 June 2010, accepted 30 August 2010.

AB  - Contemporary geopolitical narratives have shifted from a Cold War focus on security attained through effective spatial containment to an emphasis on security won through effective spatial administration. Weak, disorderly, and ungoverned spaces are often scripted as insecure and dangerous, requiring sovereign intervention and harsh discipline as a corrective action. These narratives and practices increasingly borrow from the domestic arena, and serve to blur former binaries such as internal/external and policing and war. This paper investigates the domestic "broken windows policing" language of ungoverned, disorderly space in New York City, and traces its movement and subsequent usage in the occupation of Iraq. The use of language such as broken windows and zero tolerance serves to legitimate state practices, but is also effective as a shaping force for newly articulated positions and subjects. It is argued that broken windows policing, as an imaginative geopolitical scripting of the perils of chaotic and ungoverned space, helps to produce new forms of governance through security. Further, this disciplining process facilitates the formation and entrenchment of neoliberal practices and subjectivities by rendering spaces and populations 'insecure' and in need of repositioning hence opening them up to powerful market forces and technologies of the self such as privatization, entrepreneurialism, and responsibilization.

AB  - Few studies at a broad geographical scale have characterized intraspecific variation in morphology of woodland hawks in the genus Accipiter. From 1999 to 2007 we investigated morphological variation in large samples of live Cooper's Hawks (A. cooperii) nesting in four study areas: coniferous woodland around Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, isolated deciduous woodlands in short-grass prairies of northwestern North Dakota, towns and rural deciduous woodlands along the border of North Dakota and Minnesota, and urban and rural mixed deciduous and coniferous landscapes of Wisconsin. These sites span 2660 km across the northern part of the species' breeding range. We measured body mass (i.e., size), wing chord, tail length, tarsus diameter, hallux length, and culmen length of breeding adults, finding significant and clinal variation in body mass (or size). The smallest and most similar-sized birds occurred in British Columbia and western North Dakota, larger birds along the border between North Dakota and Minnesota, and the largest birds in Wisconsin. Several other characters varied significantly when mass was used as a covariate. Variation by study site in mean indices of sexual size dimorphism was negligible and not significant. We speculate that the morphological differences we found, in part, are the result of geographic isolation, where diets, migratory behavior, and structural characteristics of nesting habitats vary across landscape types.

AB  - Similar to humans and primates, artificial creatures like robots are limited in terms of allocation of their resources to huge sensory and perceptual information. Serial processing mechanisms used in the design of such creatures demands engineering attentional control mechanisms. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for learning top-down sequential visual attention control for agents acting in interactive environments. Our method is based on the key idea, that attention can be learned best in concert with visual representations through automatic construction and discretization of the visual state space. The tree representing the top-down attention is incrementally refined whenever aliasing occurs by selecting the most appropriate saccadic direction. The proposed approach is evaluated on action-based object recognition and urban navigation tasks, where obtained results support applicability and usefulness of developed saccade movement method for robotics.

AB  - This paper intends to analyze the events occurred in Bogota city during the students' strike in May1938, which was programmed to oppose to certain modernization and educational secularization measures imposed by the President Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo's liberal government. The students raised against the review exam applied at the end of high school and the preparatory course, which were requirements to enter higher education. This essay approaches the problematic caused by the educational reform, the student protest's unleashing, the actions taken by the students in the capital of the republic, the movement's impact in other places of the country and the ideological trends that supported the students' strike. Regarding this last issue; although the support of the conservative opposition was evident, many university and high school students fought with conviction for what they then considered an arbitrary action of the liberal government.

T2  - FAMILY & COMMUNITY HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Victorian urbanisation created suburban communities out of fields and orchards. In one suburb, east of Oxford City, where piecemeal development occurred in a rural area from the 1840s, a network of religious orders linked to the Oxford Movement provided health and welfare services. The local priest, Father Benson, was a major benefactor and instigator of these services. As the suburb grew and the state became more involved in health and welfare service provision, the church responded accordingly. Using a local graveyard to identify some key individuals and organisations involved in the developing community, combined with an analysis of the census, provides a framework for an outline of the history of the community and the development of its service infrastructure. This gives us an insight into both east Oxford and the wider debates on church and state provision of services.

AB  - Background: Studies on heteronormativity in PE either appear to have explored the experiences of and conditions for non-heterosexual students,or adopt a retrospective point of view. Further, the relation between heteronormativity and movement and how movement activities embody social norms and values related to gender and sexuality has not been explored in depth.
   Purpose: To explore the relation between movement and heteronormativity in PE as experienced by the students.
   Participants, setting and research design: The study is based on interviews with 24 students, aged 15 and 16 years and living in a big city area in Sweden. Each student was interviewed on three occasions, immediately following PE lessons visited by the researchers.
   Data collection: The interviews revolved around: (1) the students' social situation; (2) their sporting habits and interests; (3) their views about PE (aims, content, teaching methods, learning, assessment and grading); (4) their views of girls' and boys' conditions in PE; and (5) their views about body and movement.
   Data analysis: A discourse analysis was conducted, based on the interview as a whole, namely the interviewer's questions and comments and the interviewees' responses and possible counter-questions. Particular interest was directed towards linguistic regularities relating to norms and ideas about gender and sexuality.
   Findings: Heteronormativity conditions the way in which girls and boys (feel they can appropriately) engage in a certain movement activity and still be viewed as 'normal'. In the PE classes we visited, being recognised as a 'normal' or straight girl presupposed a feminine appearance, a good coordinative and rhythmic ability, self-confidence in relation to partner dancing, and conversely, a lack of self-confidence and are reluctance to appear aggressive and competitive in connection with ball games. Boys who adopt that position might be apprehended as 'effeminate' or 'poofs' - unless they have some kind of status marker that can serve as a heterosexual alibi, like being popular and athletic. Being recognised as a 'normal' or straight boy presupposed a masculine appearance and confidence, i.e. aggressive and competitive behaviour, in team ball games. Girls who occupy that position might be perceived as 'butch' or 'manly' (perhaps as lesbians?) if they do not, correspondingly, have some kind of marker that can serve as a heterosexual alibi. This might include having a feminine appearance.
   Conclusions: Since heteronorms are embodied in and through movement, any attempt to challenge the heteronormative culture of PE teaching would have to carefully consider which kinds of activities to include in the PE curriculum, and to make it possible for the students to move in new ways. Such a strategy would include a critically reflexive approach among PE teachers towards the conventional endeavour to make the teaching 'work' without too much emphasis on exploring how students experience different physical activities.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of fire ignitions and fire sizes is essential for understanding fire regimes. Although previous studies have documented associations of human-caused fire ignitions with road corridors, less consideration has been given to understanding the multiple influences of roads on the fire regime at a broader landscape-scale. Therefore, we examined the difference between lightning- and human-caused fire ignitions in relation to forest road corridors and other anthropogenic and biophysical factors in the eastern Cascade Mountains of Washington State. We used geographical information systems and case-control logistic regression models to assess the relative importance of these explanatory variables that influence the locations of lightning versus human-caused ignitions.
   We found that human-caused ignitions were concentrated close to roads, in high road density areas, and near the wildland urban interface (WUI). In contrast, lightning-caused ignitions were concentrated in low road density areas, away from WUI, and in low population density areas. Lightning-caused ignitions were also associated with fuels and climatic and topographic factors. A weak but significant relationship between lightning-caused fire and proximity to gravel roads may be related to fuels near roads or to bias in detection and reporting of lightning-caused fires near roads. Although most small fires occurred in roaded areas, they accounted for only a small proportion of the total burned area. In contrast, the large fires in roadless and wilderness areas accounted for most of the burned area. Thus, from the standpoint of the total area burned, the effect of forest roads on restricting fire size is likely greater than the impact of roads on increasing fire ignitions. The results of our study suggest that roads and their edge effect area should be more widely acknowledged as a unique type of landscape effect in fire research and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emergent phenomena occur due to the pattern of non-linear and distributed local interactions between the elements of a system over time. Surprisingly, agent based crowd models, in which the movement of each individual follows a limited set of simple rules, often re-produce quite closely the emergent behaviour of crowds that can be observed in reality. An example of such phenomena is the spontaneous self-organisation of drinking parties in the squares of cities in Spain, also known as "El Botellon" [20]. We revisit this case study providing an elegant stochastic process algebraic model in Bio-PEPA amenable to several forms of analyses, among which simulation and fluid flow analysis. We show that a fluid flow approximation, i.e. a deterministic reading of the average behaviour of the system, can provide an alternative and efficient way to study the same emergent behaviour as that explored in [20] where simulation was used instead. Besides empirical evidence, also an analytical justification is provided for the good correspondence found between simulation results and the fluid flow approximation.

AB  - In the past 50 years, a marked reduction has occurred in European and North American children's freedom of movement and outdoor play. Using a structural equation model, the present study investigates the interaction between personal, environmental, and psychosocial factors that affect children's independent mobility. The study involved 313 mothers of 8-10-year-old Italian children. The results supported the hypothesized model: the age of the child, the maternal perception of social danger, and positive potentiality of outdoor autonomy were the most influential variables on children's independent mobility, measured as an index. Further, the maternal perceptions mediated the influence of the other demographic, psychosocial, and environmental variables on independent mobility.

AB  - Production of manufactured nanoparticles (mNPs) is likely to increase significantly in the near future. To investigate mNP mobility in sandstone groundwaters, column experiments have been completed on intact continental redbed sandstone. SiO2 mNP breakthrough concentrations decrease as ionic strength increases, with reversibility indicating secondary minimum attachment: a maximum retention capacity is observed. In contrast, initial metal oxide mNP breakthrough concentrations in deionized water gradually fall as clogging occurs, mobility being in the order (Si >) Ti, Sb > Ce, Ag: no detectable breakthrough occurs for artificial groundwater solutions, even after many 100s of pore volumes. These results suggest that most particles have limited mobility, consistent with measured zeta potentials, but that remobilization can occur if conditions change. A small proportion of particles appear to be more mobile, and this is confirmed by the presence of small amounts of mNPs in wellwaters.

AB  - Sakzewski L, Ziviani J, Boyd RN. Best responders after intensive upper-limb training for children with unilateral cerebral palsy. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2011;92: 578-84.
   Objective: To delineate characteristics of best responders in a randomized trial comparing constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) to bimanual training for children with unilateral cerebral palsy.
   Design: Secondary analysis of a single-blind matched-pairs randomized comparison trial.
   Setting: Community sporting facilities in 2 Australian capital cities.
   Participants: Children (n=64; mean age, 10.2 +/- 2.7y; 52% boys), matched for age, sex, side of hemiplegia, and upper-limb function, were randomized within pairs to CIMT or bimanual training. Sixty-one children who completed CIMT (n=31) or bimanual training (n=30) were included in this study.
   Interventions: Each intervention was delivered in day camps (total 60h over 10d) using a novel circus theme with goal-directed training.
   Main Outcome Measures: Change between baseline. 3, and 26 weeks on the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL>7.4%), Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA>4 raw score points), and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM>2 points) defined best responders.
   Results: Poorer baseline hand function predicted a best response for unimanual capacity of the impaired upper limb (MUUL) immediately postintervention; however, at 26 weeks the odds of achieving a favorable outcome were 21 times greater for CIMT than bimanual training. A favorable response for bimanual performance (AHA) was predicted by immediate change in Jebsen-Taylor hand function test scores. Age (older), left-sided hemiplegia, and lower-baseline COPM performance scores significantly predicted favorable individualized outcomes.
   Conclusions: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial directly comparing 2 upper-limb training models, found children with poorer hand function benefited most. Favorable outcomes for bimanual performance were associated with gains in movement efficiency and older children with left-sided hemiplegia achieved more favorable gains in perceived occupational performance.

AB  - 1. Early detection of biological invasions can reduce the costs of control and increase its efficacy. Although much research focuses on the appearance or establishment of new invaders, few studies target the detection of spread from established populations. Managers of natural areas have limited resources; therefore, there is need for efficient methods of quantifying the spread of likely invaders in local and regional areas.
   2. We employed homeowner surveys, seedling outplanting, directed seedling searches and randomly located plots to determine whether two introduced species of Oleaceae, Ligustrum lucidum and Olea europaea, demonstrate invasive levels of recruitment in California's Sacramento Valley. These methods are examples of low-cost approaches to examining the regional spread of non-native woody species with differing habitat requirements.
   3. Homeowner surveys indicated abundant recruitment of L. lucidum in irrigated areas, with no evident decline by distance from horticultural source trees. Ligustrum lucidum seedlings established readily when planted immediately adjacent to streams, but were unable to survive summer drought when located further from the water.
   4. Recruitment of O. europaea at distances > 100 m from source trees was uncommon. Spread of O. europaea is rare relative to the number of reproductive individuals that have been planted in the study area; where it occurs, seedling recruitment appears largely a function of propagule pressure.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Low-cost and rapid methods are essential for successful long-term monitoring of spread from populations of introduced, woody plant species. We employed high-efficiency methods of spread detection for two species of Oleaceae with invasive potential and existing populations in the study region. We detected no barriers to spread by L. lucidum in areas with elevated soil moisture and consider the species a likely riparian invader. By comparison, O. europaea shows little tendency to spread. We suggest that managers combine low-input methods and direct surveys towards habitats of conservation concern and routes of likely seed dispersal.

AB  - Since 1912, Arrow Rock, Missouri, has transformed itself from a small river town into a major heritage-tourism center through a grassroots historic preservation movement. The result has been that in 1963 Arrow Rock was recorded as a National Historic Landmark site, in 2006 the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed it as one of its "Dozen Distinctive Destination" sites, and in 2008 it was recognized as a "Preserve America Community." Like many historic towns, Arrow Rock's preservation and interpretation focused initially on its "white, male, and rich" heritage, ignoring the majority of its past citizens. Beginning in 1996, Arrow Rock has utilized public history and archaeology to develop new interpretive programs that address its African American heritage and that attempt to engage this previously marginalized descendant community.

AB  - The Palestine issue is a heart breaking politico-legal issue that has remained unresolved for so long. The issue started immediately after the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and following the occupation of Palestine by Great Britain. Britain disregarded the will of the majority of population, facilitated, directly or indirectly, Jewish settlements and supported foreign- led Zionist movement by making an unjust and illegal promise to them to create a state for Jews in Palestine which it eventually did and in doing so it further complicated the Palestine issue - an issue which the League of Nations was unable to solve due to its lack of commitment and its weak organizational structure. The issue has continued till today and is termed as "the most serious and prolonged unresolved political and human rights issue on the agenda of the United Nations (UN) since its inception." The inability of the UN to resolve the Palestine issue is not due to the fault of international law hut clue to the lack of commitment of some of the powerful members of its executive organ, that is the Security Council. These powers disgracefiilly have shown passivity and apparent indifference about the long and cruel Israeli occupation of Palestine. As this paper explains, the indifference on the part of the UN Security Council has enabled the Zionist state of Israel to pursue with impunity its aggressive wars, its ethnic cleaning strategy, its settlements policy its blockades of the Palestinian cities and towns and its denial of the Palestinians" inalienable right of selfdetermination. If the powerful nations of the world failed Palestine and its people, we the Muslims must not follow suit. We must stop our infighting and unite our strength and do everything that is peacefully possible to help Palestinians to find a just solution to their problem and if possible to restore Palestine to its historical status.

AB  - Linepithema micans (Forel) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is reported to occur from eastern Brazil to central Argentina in pasture or grassland, forest and second growth riparian forest, nesting under stones, rotting wood, and sandy soil. However, information on this species is poor and its ecological interactions and role as pests are unknown. Linepithema humile (Mayr), a closely related species to L. micans, known as the Argentine ant, is native to South America, and was accidentally introduced to several regions of the world. Recent studies have shown that other related species, such as L. micans, could become as pestiferous as L. humile because of its phylogenetic proximity. Samples of L. micans from different habitats in Southern Brazil were characterized by sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA. Sequences were compared to previously obtained sequences from samples of L. humile and the genetic distance and differences in the tRNALeu structure were investigated. Our data identified three haplotypes of L. micans, two of which were observed in ant populations closely associated with the Brazilian ground pearl Eurhizococcus brasiliensis (Hempel) (Hemiptera: Margarodidae), a soil scale that is a serious pest of vineyards. The third haplotype was identified in ants from populations invading residences in urban habitats.

AB  - Variation in the shell colour and banding polymorphism in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis was studied in 260 populations in the region of Gdansk, northern Poland. Unlike in other regions of Poland, many populations contain brown shells. Populations from shaded habitats have higher frequencies of brown than those from open and intermediate habitats, largely at the expense of yellow shells. Nearly all brown shells are also unbanded. Apart from this disequilibrium, banding morphs among yellow and pink shells show no relationship to habitat. There are no broad geographical trends in morph-frequencies, but there are very strong correlations among populations very close together, revealed both by pairwise analysis and Moran's I. Principal Component Analyses show that these correlations relate to overall genetic similarity at the loci involved. The populations are at the north-eastern limits of the species' range; habitats are mostly anthropogenic, and comparisons with studies in two urban areas (Wroclaw, SW Poland, and Sheffield, central England) suggest that the patterns of variation seen are a product of human transport of propagules followed by local dispersal. The effect of habitat here is much less marked than in regions much further west, but it indicates that natural selection has occurred.

AB  - Objective To Understand the prevalence, consequences and risk factors of falls among Urban community-dwelling elderly in Beijing. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Longtan Community, Beijing. A total of 1512 individuals aged 60 years or over were selected by stratified cluster sampling. Data regarding the frequency of falls in the previous year, as well as circumstances, consequence and related factors of falls were collected from the elderly through face-to-face interviews with questionnaires in their home. Results The prevalence of falls was 18.0% on the average among 1512 participants, higher in women (20.1%) than in men (14.9%) (P=0.006), and increased with age (chi(2)(for trend)=10.37, P=0.001). The total rate of falls-induced injuries among the fallers was 37.7%. Falls usually resulted in soft-tissues bruises (58.7%), fear of repeated episodes of falls (58.8%). loss of independence and confidence in movement (35.7%) and even in hip fracture. In addition to the burden of medical care, falls also generated a big economic burden. Occurrence of falls was significantly associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The related factors of falls in the elderly included age >= 60-70 years, femininity, less physical activities, fear of furture falls, living alone, severely impaired vision, health problem-impacted activities of daily living, chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, postural hypotension, stroke sequela, cataract, arthritis, dementia and depression), medications (psychoactive, anti-diabetic), gait imbalance, high bed and faintly-lighted stairway. Conclusion The prevalence of falls among Urban community-dwelling elderly in Beijing is closely associated with significant associated with intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Efforts to prevent falls in the elderly should be made at community level.

AB  - The Silurian dolostone bedrock in Ontario, Canada, is a broad 400 km long swath northward from Niagara Falls through the Bruce Peninsula that represents an important water source for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. Where the Quaternary overburden is thin or absent, karst is common. This study concerns an urban area where the dolostone aquifer is 100 m thick beneath up to 50 m thick Quaternary deposits and where karst features identified by borehole information are common. Hydraulic tests show moderate to large bulk rock hydraulic conductivity and rock core tests indicate much smaller matrix hydraulic conductivity than the bulk rock values. Therefore, the aquifer is essentially a dual permeability, fully saturated system in which conduits occur within a network of ubiquitous extensive, horizontally- and vertically-interconnected fractures. Karst features are concentrated in a thin zone at the top-of-rock, likely representing former epikarst, and also in a thicker zone in the middle of the aquifer. Some pumping test results and large yields of some municipal wells are consistent with conduit occurrences. However, atmospheric tritium, distributed-source contamination (Cl-, NO3-), and a point-source pesticide plume (metolachlor) show detailed concentration distributions lacking influence of flow in conduits. Detailed hydraulic head profiles also show no influence of conduit flow. This study shows that when designing monitoring networks for groundwater quality and source water protection in similar contexts, locating conduits is not necessary because contaminant distributions are governed by the combined influences of the rock matrix, fractures and conduits, the hydraulic boundary conditions, and the interconnected fracture network with only minimal conduit effects. Prior to glaciations, an integrated karstic aquifer could develop with flow controlled by conduits; however, this original, converging flow system became non-functional when the Quaternary sediments drastically modified the boundary hydrologic conditions and the head distribution.

AB  - The paper deals with the analysis of tsunami risks for Western Canada and the numerical modelling of a potential tsunami which could affect the region and generate significant damage to the western Canadian coastline. Following a review of the seismic risk and historical tsunamis which occurred along the western Canadian coastline, the authors concluded that this region is highly vulnerable should a major tsunami occur. Consequently, the authors conducted a study on the numerical modelling of a possible tsunami generated by movement along the Cascadia fault, which is located offshore British Columbia. The results of the model outline the significance and extent of the coastal flooding risk associated with such a rare, but destructive phenomenon. The potential for inundation of the low-lying areas around the coastline of Vancouver Island and in and around the City of Vancouver was found to be high. A number of recommendations and conclusions focusing on the results of the numerical simulation are included.

AB  - Although a critical value of the anti-apartheid movement and within the democratic Constitution, there is a lack of national consensus on the meaning of non-racialism in South Africa and how best it can be achieved, particularly given the continued use of historically defined race categories for redress. In response, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Gauteng City-Region Observatory conducted a series of qualitative focus groups exploring the understanding of non-racialism among South Africans, and found widespread ambiguity about its meaning among research participants. Results suggest that while many continue to associate strongly with identity groups based on apartheid race categories, integration and engagement has increased within public life. Less change has occurred within private spaces, where stereotypes and racism remain firmly intact. Participants view non-racialism as more likely to be achieved by future generations than present ones. However, the research findings cast doubt on whether children will be able to reject stereotypes within families and at home.

AB  - The green building movement is an attempt to address IEQ and occupant health concerns by providing healthier building environments. As improved IEQ is the stated goal of green design, we question how green offices are in fact performing in comparison to non-green buildings, from the occupants' perspectives. The findings of this research showed there was no significant difference in the overall satisfaction with IEQ between the two LEED offices and conventional offices in the same city. The most influential IEQ aspect of overall satisfaction was lighting satisfaction. One LEED office had good satisfaction with the noise environment but poor satisfaction with the lighting environment; the other LEED office had good satisfaction with the lighting environment. The IEQ characteristics in the two LEED offices are discussed to generate design implications in green interior projects and IEQ improvements.

AB  - This article investigates how written and spoken discourse has influenced dance pedagogy, performance and choreography in Palestine (and subsequently the Occupied Palestinian Territories) during the last 150 years. This includes an analysis of imperial, nationalist and Islamist cultural commentaries through published literature and public oral forums on Palestine. Whilst these verbal expressions are varied (and include travel accounts, anthropological studies, critical reviews, artists' reflections and political debates), they share an interest in critically appraising the value of local dance activities. The historical review leads into a consideration of how foreign hegemony and subsequent shifts in domestic politics can influence dance writing and present obstacles to dance artists working within such politically marginalised and collectively traumatised population groups. It concludes with a review of strategies for how critical discourse may be made more inclusive and sustainable. The article draws upon ethnographic, historical and action research undertaken within the West Bank city of Ramallah between 2000 and 2007.

TI  - Pounding Damage to Buildings and Bridges in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch Earthquake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROTECTIVE STRUCTURES
LA  - English
AB  - This paper addresses the damage to buildings and bridges resulting from relative movements between adjacent structures observed by the authors from building inspections and in-the-field investigations in Christchurch and surroundings carried out two weeks after the devastating earthquake of 22 February 2011. Relative structural response is often initiated by the different dynamic characteristic of the participating structures. Pounding induced damage might occur when the closing relative response is larger than the gap between adjacent structures. In the Central Business District (CBD) of Christchurch City many adjacent buildings have inadequate gaps between them or in many cases even no gap. Consequently, a large number of buildings, already weakened by the previous main shock of 4 September 2010 and its several thousand aftershocks, suffered further damage due to the strong February aftershock. The reoccurrence of excessive soil liquefaction caused particularly heavy damage to bridge sites along Avon River as the spatially varying ground movements induced large relative movement of the ground surface.

AB  - The distributional ranges of many species are contracting with habitat conversion and climate change. For vertebrates, informed strategies for translocations are an essential option for decisions about their conservation management. The pygmy bluetongue lizard, Tiliqua adelaidensis, is an endangered reptile with a highly restricted distribution, known from only a small number of natural grassland fragments in South Australia. Land-use changes over the last century have converted perennial native grasslands into croplands, pastures and urban areas, causing substantial contraction of the species' range due to loss of essential habitat. Indeed, the species was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1992. We develop coupled-models that link habitat suitability with stochastic demographic processes to estimate extinction risk and to explore the efficacy of potential climate adaptation options. These coupled-models offer improvements over simple bioclimatic envelope models for estimating the impacts of climate change on persistence probability. Applying this coupled-model approach to T. adelaidensis, we show that: (i) climate-driven changes will adversely impact the expected minimum abundance of populations and could cause extinction without management intervention, (ii) adding artificial burrows might enhance local population density, however, without targeted translocations this measure has a limited effect on extinction risk, (iii) managed relocations are critical for safeguarding lizard population persistence, as a sole or joint action and (iv) where to source and where to relocate animals in a program of translocations depends on the velocity, extent and nonlinearities in rates of climate-induced habitat change. These results underscore the need to consider managed relocations as part of any multifaceted plan to compensate the effects of habitat loss or shifting environmental conditions on species with low dispersal capacity. More broadly, we provide the first step towards a more comprehensive framework for integrating extinction risk, managed relocations and climate change information into range-wide conservation management.

AB  - Kastamonu, the city in the Western Black Sea part of Turkey is an example of the provinces with higher emigration rates. Kastamonu, most of its area is covered with forests (65%), does not possess any significant business fields other than forestry activities. One of the reasons behind the migration movement in Kastamonu is that the forestry activities in the local community do not provide a satisfactory economic return.
   Due to the emigration from Kastamonu province, the population of villages decreases, which causes several changes in land use. These changes are mostly evident in forest and agricultural areas. GIS applications can be used effectively in the determination of changes that occur in these areas.
   In this study, the change of population in time in villages within the area of Kure Forestry Operation Office in Kure district of Kastamonu (1990-2010) and land use (1997-2010) were examined using GIS techniques.

AB  - Aquifer recharge, which uses urban stormwater, is an effective technique to control the negative effects of groundwater overexploitation, while clogging problems in infiltration systems remain the key restricting factor in broadening its practice. Quantitative understanding of the clogging process is still very poor. A laboratory study was conducted to understand surface physical clogging processes, with the primary aim of developing a model for predicting suspended solid clogging processes before aquifer recharge projects start. The experiments investigated the clogging characteristics of different suspended solid sizes in recharge water by using a series of one-dimensional fine quartz sand columns. The results showed that the smaller the suspended particles in recharge water, the farther the distance of movement and the larger the scope of clogging in porous media. Clogging extents in fine sand were 1 cm, for suspended particle size ranging from 0.075 to 0.0385 mm, and 2 cm, for particles less than 0.0385 mm. In addition, clogging development occurred more rapidly for smaller suspended solid particles. It took 48, 42, and 36 hr respectively, for large-, medium-, and small-sized particles to reach pre-determined clogging standards. An empirical formula and iteration model for the surface clogging evolution process were derived. The verification results obtained from stormwater recharge into fine sand demonstrated that the model could reflect the real laws of the surface clogging process.

AB  - Multiple regression analysis of PM10 concentration concerning to meteorological elements for Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, in 2005 and 2006. Air is an efficient means of atmospheric pollutants dispersal and its r behavior depends on the atmospheric movements that occur in the troposphere. In Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, there is a large daily traffic and a concentration of industries that may be responsible for atmospheric emission. In the present work we studied the behavior of daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM10), in this city, considering the influence of meteorological variables. Data analysis was performed from descriptive statistics, linear correlation and multiple regressions. Data were provided by the State Foundation of Environmental Protection Henrique Luiz Roessler-RS and the National Institute of Meteorology. Based on the analysis it was possible to verify that: the concentration of PM10, measured every day at 4:00 p.m., did not exceed national standards for air quality; meteorological elements that influenced on the concentrations of PM10 were the daily average wind speed and average daily radiation with negative relations; the daily average temperature of the air and the directions, north and northwest of wind, with positive relations. Wind directions which contribute significantly to lower concentrations on the measured places are east and southeast.

AB  - Vector control is a key means of combating mosquito-borne diseases and the only tool available for tackling the transmission of dengue, a disease for which no vaccine, prophylaxis, or therapeutant currently exists. The most effective mosquito control methods include a variety of insecticidal tools that target adults or juveniles. Their successful implementation depends on impacting the largest proportion of the vector population possible. We demonstrate a control strategy that dramatically improves the efficiency with which high coverage of aquatic mosquito habitats can be achieved. The method exploits adult mosquitoes as vehicles of insecticide transfer by harnessing their fundamental behaviors to disseminate a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) between resting and oviposition sites. A series of field trials undertaken in an Amazon city (Iquitos, Peru) showed that the placement of JHA dissemination stations in just 3-5% of the available resting area resulted in almost complete coverage of sentinel aquatic habitats. More than control mortality occurred in 95-100% of the larval cohorts of Aedes aegypti developing at those sites. Overall reductions in adult emergence of 42-98% were achieved during the trials. A deterministic simulation model predicts amplifications in coverage consistent with our observations and highlights the importance of the residual activity of the insecticide for this technique.

AB  - Damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant caused by the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami off the northeast coast of Japan resulted in the release into the environment of radioactive material. Airborne radioactive material was detected in metropolitan areas near Tokyo, and increases in radiation dose rate were observed at many locations. In this study, repeated measurements with the in situ Ge system were performed in Chiba City, which is about 220 km south of Fukushima. Increases in radiation dose rate were recorded on 15, 16, and 21 March, with a maximum of 0.5 mu Gy h(-1). This level is clearly higher than natural background in Japan. Airborne Mo-99, (99)mTc, (129)mTe, Te-129, Te-132, I-131, I-132, I-133, Xe-133, (133)mXe, Xe-135, Cs-134, Cs-136, Cs-137, and La-140 were detected. Environmental radioactive contamination in the metropolitan area occurred mainly on 21 March by rainfall. The initial rates of decrease in radiation dose rate generally reflected radiological decay according to their physical (radiological) half-lives. However, the in situ half-lives of the long-lived radionuclides such as Cs-134 and Cs-137 reflected environmental dispersal rather than radiological decay. Health Phys. 102(4):437-442; 2012

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the behaviour of economic sentiment indicators at rent-growth turning points and indicators' ability to forecast such turning points. More specifically, the paper looks at whether early signals are generated for forthcoming periods of negative and positive office rent growth. The analysis aims to complement structural model forecasting in the real estate market with short-term forecasting techniques designed to predict turning points.
   Design/methodology/approach - The objective of this study is achieved by deploying a probit model to examine the ability of economic sentiment indicator series to signal the direction of office rents and the strength of movement in this direction. The main advantage of this approach is that it is geared towards predicting turning points. Probit models are non-linear in nature, and as such they can capture more effectively the likely asymmetric adjustments when turning points occur than linear methodologies would. The analysis is applied to three major office centres - La De 'fense, London City, and Frankfurt - to examine whether the results will differ by geography.
   Findings - The findings reveal that the probit methodology utilising information from economic sentiment indicators generates advance signals for periods of contraction and expansion in office rents across all three markets: La De 'fense, London City, and Frankfurt. The lead times for La De 'fense and Frankfurt are longer than those for London City and range between three and nine months. The evidence in this paper clearly supports the appeal of sentiment indicators and probit analysis to inform forecasting and risk assessment processes.
   Originality/value - Acknowledging the limitations of structural models and related methodologies and the lack of adequate research on turning-point prediction in the real estate market, this study forecasts episodes of negative and positive office rent growth applying appropriate techniques and data that lead economic activity, are of monthly frequency, and are not revised historically. The paper raises awareness of a forecasting approach that should complement structural models and judgmental forecasting, given its suitability for short-term forecasting and for signalling turning points in advance.

AB  - Damage to buildings occurs if a construction component fails. The result is a partial or total collapse which can be dangerous for people for example if it's a bridge or a large hall. The collapse of the terminal building at the Airport Charles de Gaulle in Paris and the damage at the historic City Archives of Cologne are typical examples of such accidents. Another problem is the contradiction of the increasing volume of traffic (particularly heavy traffic) and the great age of bridges. The probability increases that the load-bearing capacity of a bridge decreases. For example the collapses of the Mississippi Bridge and of the Inntal Motorway Bridge can be seen as results. Therefore it is necessary to control endangered structures during their life span.
   In order to prevent these kinds of accidents, the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing developed a radio-based, self-configuring measuring system in cooperation with the ScatterWeb Company, Berlin (Germany). This measuring system consists of identically designed sensor modules which are self-sustaining, wireless, act as transmitters and receivers and are equipped with a special sensor technology for long-term monitoring of buildings or engineering facilities. The sensor unit uses strain gauges for stress analysis and contains interfaces for additional sensors. The system in particular applies to buildings and structures for transport and traffic and large-scale industrial facilities, where a subsequent wiring installation is difficult or impossible.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the extent and severity of metal contamination of soils in the east of the Dead Sea, southwestern Jordan. This area was affected by a potash plant and intensive agricultural production. The samples were obtained at two depths, 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, and were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, and Cr. Physicochemical parameters that are expected to affect the mobility of metals in the soil such as pH, TOM, CaCO3, CEC, and conductivity were determined. The relatively high concentrations of metals in soils of the studied area were related to anthropogenic sources such as the potash industry, agricultural activities, and traffic emissions. The mean concentrations of the metals were of the order: C-Fe > C-Pb > C-Zn > C-Cr > C-Mn > C-Cu and C-Cd where C is the concentration of these metals in solution. Heavy metals such as Zn, Cd, and Pb showed higher concentrations in the area that is closer to the potash plant, while Cr concentration was low. These metals were concentrated in the soil surface and decreased in the lower part of soil due to their mobility, movement and physicochemical properties, and alkaline pH. Metals of anthropogenic origin, including Cd, Pb, and Zn, were highly enriched with respect to crustal composition. The non-clay minerals of the sand-sized fraction are composed mainly of quartz and calcite as major minerals, with dolomite and feldspar as minor minerals. Factor analysis revealed three groups of elements that differ in their distribution. The first of these components is unpolluted soil, which was distributed in the study area. The second is the polluted soil, which occurs mostly around the potash plant and Ghore El-Safi area. The third factor represents the physicochemical sources, and is not significant.

AB  - While the social movements literature has increasingly incorporated sociospatial categories into its conceptual toad!, this article argues that tracing the concrete ways in which a particular category "scale" is mobilized as a stake of political debate helps us refine its workings in practice. Integrating research on the co-constitutive nature of law and political action, this article traces how efforts to pass antipredatory home lending legislation in the United States during the 1990s and 2000s resulted in a rescaled home-lending legal regime. Using judicial and regulatory documents, media accounts, and publications by advocates, government actors, buyers and the financial industry, I analyze the mechanisms through which this occurred. Debates about federalism, home rule, and preemption illustrate that involved parties attempted to "fix" a legal regime scaled according to their organizational strengths. Finally, this case illustrates how discourses around globalization and economic rationality inform the trajectory of legal debates.

AB  - This article discusses an experience with youngsters from a public school, developed as Activities Workshops. The experience included actions resulting from university extension activities, characterized by interventions that seek to exercise participative methodologies, based on the defense of the rights which compose citizenship. With the support of the theoretical and methodological presuppositions of social occupational therapy and education for freedom advocated by Paulo Freire, the Activities Workshops have been constituted as a social technology for approaching students, (re)building projects and enlarging support networks conducted with youngsters who come from urban popular groups and are in situations of social vulnerability. The sum of these experiences has provided us with subsides related to the discussion about the implementation of these devices into the schools' curriculum, in order to establish educational proposals founded on democratic bases that support a tensioning movement of the current situation, contributing to face contemporary social issues.

AB  - In 2007, an incursion of equine influenza (EI) occurred in Australia. Accurate maps of property boundaries were used to examine the pattern and mechanism of local spread of EI. This study focussed on a cluster of infected premises (IPs) at Park Ridge, a peri-urban suburb 26 km south of Brisbane, Queensland. The cluster recorded 437 IPs and 81% of these were not contiguous to a previously IP. The mean distance from each new IP to the closest previous IP was 0.85 +/- 1.50 km with a range of 0.01-12.94 km. Eighty-two percent of new IPs were within 1 km of a previous IP. The spatial mean for each week's new IPs showed a consistent trend of movement from east to west throughout the epizootic consistent with the predominant wind patterns. The findings were consistent with the conclusion that EI will routinely spread over 1-2 km via wind-borne aerosol.

AB  - Francisco SANCHEZ PEREZ Labour protests in the spring of 1936
   This article seeks to throw some light on the relationship between the triumph of the left coalition in February 1936, swiftly dubbed the Popular Front, and the virulent outbreak of labour and urban protests and conflicts that followed this triumph. After February 1936 the workers expected to see political change and a restoration of labour relations as they were before October 1934. In this context the paper examines this new wave of strikes: in the countryside the decline of agrarian strikes and the multiplication of land invasions and occupations; in industry, inter-union collaboration and the persistence of frictions among them; the impact of the crisis and unemployment on some of the most radicalised sectors (construction); the uneven distribution of strife and the preponderant role of Madrid; the role of sectors with no union tradition; and the role of political and sit-down strikes.

AB  - The characterization in real-time of the drivable space in front of the vehicle is a key issue for safe autonomous navigation or driving assistance. This paper presents a method that uses a lidar (a multilayer laser scanner) integrated in the front bumper of an automotive vehicle. A grid processing is first applied to detect and localize objects in the immediate environment after having compensated the movement of the vehicle. Accurate map information is then introduced in the perception scheme to refine the characterization of the drivable space. The paper details the different processing stages necessary to implement this method and presents the design of the system that has been prototyped on board an experimental vehicle. We report real experiments carried out in challenging urban environments to illustrate the performance of this approach which has been evaluated thanks to a precise retro-projection of the estimated drivable space in a wide-angle scene camera.

AB  - The Greater Toronto Area is the largest urban concentration in Canada and one of the most significant built regions in North America. Toronto's growth legacy has created a legacy of sprawl development. Growth has not occurred without controversy. On the Oak Ridges Moraine, an environmentally sensitive landform located along Toronto's northern suburban edge, development has been the catalyst for activism and policy changes that led to a fundamental rethinking of Ontario's planning regime. Changes to Ontario's planning approach have resulted in land-use conservation legislation to manage development activity on the Moraine. This paper considers the role of incremental policies in creating a conflict setting which ultimately led to ecologically based planning legislation. We conclude that several factors helped advance conservation planning - media attention, a history of incremental planning, the emergence of a well-organised conservation movement and the serendipitous convergence of key leadership personalities.

AB  - In May 2010, anti-government demonstrators made a flaming inferno of the CentralWorld Plaza - Thailand's biggest, and Asia's second largest, shopping mall. It was the climax of the latest major chapter of the Thai political conflict, during which thousands of protestors swarmed Ratchaprasong, the commercial centre of Bangkok, in an ultimately failed attempt to oust Abhisit Vejjajiva's regime from power. In this article, I examine how downtown Bangkok and exclusive malls like CentralWorld represent physical and cultural spaces from which the marginalized working classes have been strikingly excluded. It is a configuration of space that maps the contours of a heavily uneven distribution of power and articulates a vernacular of prestige wherein class relations are inscribed in urban space. The significance of the Red-Shirted movement's occupation of Ratchaprasong lies in the subversion of this spatialisation of power and draws attention to the symbolic deployment of space in the struggle for political supremacy.

AB  - As increasing urbanization is taking place worldwide, earthquake hazards pose serious threats to lives and properties for urban areas. A practical earthquake prediction method appears to be far from realization. Generally, the traditional instruments for earthquake detection have the disadvantages of high cost and size. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method which can detect earthquake intensity using video capture device. The main method is based on a new proposed motion vector algorithm with simple but effective methods to immediately calculate acceleration of a predefined target object. By estimating the motion vector variation, the movement distance of predefined target object can be computed, and therefore the earthquake amplitude can be defined. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in a series of experimental simulations. It is shown that the scheme successfully detects the earthquake occurrence and identifies the earthquake amplitude from video streams.

AB  - Psammobates geometricus has a limited distribution in the southwestern Cape, South Africa, where it occurs in small habitat fragments separated by agricultural and urban developments. Space use and its determining factors thus represent critical information for the effective conservation of this species. We used radiotelemetry and thread-trailing to study the movement patterns and space use of geometric tortoises over an annual cycle, and estimated home ranges with minimum convex polygons and fixed-kernel methods. Home range size of geometric tortoises showed large inter-individual variation, and for females, a positive relationship to body size. Females, the larger sex, had larger home ranges and mean daily displacements than males had. Female space use was high through most of the year, except in the wet season, when food was abundant, temperatures relatively low, and soft soils allowed easy nesting. Males used more space and displaced further in the non-nesting than nesting season, perhaps to optimise mating opportunities in the non-nesting season before females ovulate. Home ranges were more elongate and overlapped more in fallow fields than in natural vegetation, suggesting that habitat degradation alters home range structure. The space geometric tortoises used for their annual activities ranged from 1.02 to 44.85 ha. The large home ranges and effects of habitat degradation should influence the size of reserves, and the destiny of geometric tortoises in small habitat fragments.

AB  - Objective: No well-designed longitudinal study on Parkinson disease (PD) has been conducted in India. Therefore, we planned to determine the prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates of PD in the city of Kolkata, India, on a stratified random sample through a door-to-door survey.
   Method: This study was undertaken between 2003 to 2007 with a validated questionnaire by a team consisting of 4 trained field workers in 3 stages. Field workers screened the cases, later confirmed by a specialist doctor. In the third stage, a movement disorders specialist undertook home visits and reviewed all surviving cases after 1 year from last screening. Information on death was collected through verbal autopsy. A nested case-control study (1:3) was also undertaken to determine putative risk factors. The rates were age adjusted to the World Standard Population.
   Result: A total population of 100,802 was screened. The age-adjusted prevalence rate (PR) and average annual incidence rate were 52.85/100,000 and 5.71/100,000 per year, respectively. The slum population showed significantly decreased PR with age compared with the nonslum population. The adjusted average annual mortality rate was 2.89/100,000 per year. The relative risk of death was 8.98. The case-control study showed that tobacco chewing protected and hypertension increased PD occurrence.
   Conclusion: This study documented lower prevalence and incidence of PD as compared with Caucasian and a few Oriental populations. The mortality rates were comparable. The decreased age-specific PR among slum populations and higher relative risk of death need further probing. Neurology (R) 2010;75:1362-1369

AB  - The 1847 M 7.4 Zenkoji, Japan, earthquake was caused by movement of the west-dipping, western margin reverse-fault zone of the Nagano basin (WFZNB) and produced surface ruptures reported in Japanese historical documents. Despite previous studies to assess fault activity of the WFZNB, our trench excavation at Dannohara, Nagano City, exposed near-surface fault structures associated with the Zenkoji earthquake for the first time and provided geologic evidence for three earlier paleoseismic events. Three core samples 10-15 m long defined a hanging-wall anticline beneath the trench. Although the primary fault was not observed, the revealed subsidiary features enabled us to discuss surface rupture morphology and its repetition patterns. We suggest that: (1) the east-dipping reverse faults exposed on the trench walls and the hanging-wall anticline are developed above a west-dipping blind reverse fault; (2) the east-dipping normal faults represent bending-moment faults at the crest of the hanging-wall anticline; (3) the exposed east-dipping faults slipped during the Zenkoji earthquake to produce elongated linear rise scarps described in historical documents; (4) the hanging-wall anticline grew during the earthquake to generate uplifted lands as reported in historical documents; and (5) faulting similar to that during the Zenkoji earthquake also occurred during the penultimate earthquake. We propose preliminary but better constraints on timing of the third and fourth latest faulting events, and a tentative and maximum recurrence interval of 800-1000 years for the WFZNB. To better understand reverse-fault rupture patterns for appropriate evaluation of seismic hazard, historical surface ruptures should be studied in more detail.

AB  - The focus of this study is investigation of land subsidence in Semarang city Indonesia with the use of Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) of ALOS-PALSAR satellite. We processed 22 ascending SAR images during January 2007 to January 2009 plus two descending SAR images acquired on 6 June 2006 and 17 June 2007. The time series analysis of interferometry was performed by using 12 pairs of interferogram relative to 21 January 2007 and 8 pairs of interferogram relative 24 January 2008. The topographic phase contribution was removed using the 3-arcsec (90 m) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We performed precision baseline estimation to vanish the fringes from baseline effect between master and slave data. In order to investigate the contribution of horizontal movement in our analysis, we constructed two interferograms of ascending orbit and descending orbit. The time series results exhibited that the area is subsiding continuously without a significant seasonal effect during January 2007 to January 2009. The land subsidence observed from InSAR data is approximately up to 8 cm/year. Three cross sections on image displacement show the extreme land subsidence occurred especially along the coastal area and lowland area where this area is considered as industrial with high-density settlements, consuming a lot of groundwater, and land is changed from agriculture and cultivation purposes to industrial estates and house. Our result also shows a consistency with historical pattern of subsidence measured by leveling data. The results highlight the potential use of InSAR measurements to provide better constraints for land subsidence in Semarang city Indonesia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Processionary (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Schiff), is an endemic insect of pine and cedar trees, existing both in rural and urban areas. Ocular toxicity, once rare due to the efficacy of eradication methods, is caused by the insects' hair and is expected to be more frequent with its recrudescence. We report two clinical cases and review the epidemiology of Processionary and its eye injuries. Case 1: a 64 year-old patient complained of red eye and foreign body sensation after being gardening. She had a BCVA of 0.5 and biomicroscopy revealed an epithelial erosion, flare (++), Tyndall (+++) and the presence of a setae in the deep corneal stroma. Case 2: a 28 year-old patient complained of severe pain in the right eye and hyperemia after having had contact with a caterpillar. He presented with a BCVA of 0.6, Tyndall (+++) and multiple filaments (over 20) at different depths in the cornea. Case 3: a 23 year-old patient refers to the ER with foreign body sensation and constant lacrimation in the right eye after having been completing military exercises in an urban park. He presented a BCVA of 0.3, multiple epithelial erosions in the nasal half of the cornea that covered multiple orange strands and an anterior chamber reaction (Tyndall +). Therapy was initiated with topical steroids and symptomatic surveillance. Ocular toxicity due to Processionary hairs, whose movement occurs preferentially towards the posterior pole, includes early signs (conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis) and late signs (cataract, pars planitis, vitritis, and retinitis). The 3 cases presented had early lesions, having fully recovered from the inflammatory condition after 6 months. However, inactive setae were still visible in the corneal stroma. Intraocular migration, which can occur years after the initial episode, is possible and might be severe, thus requiring a life-long surveillance.
   Conclusion: Processionary recrudescence has been observed, both in rural and urban areas. It is therefore imperative to be familiar with eye injuries caused by the insect and its treatment.

AB  - The success of invasive ants is frequently attributed to genetic and behavioural shifts in colony structure during or after introduction. The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a global invader, differs in colony genetic structure and behaviour between native populations in South America and introduced populations in Europe, Japan, New Zealand and North America. However, little is known about its colony structure in Australia. We investigated the genetic structure and behaviour of L. humile across Melbourne, Victoria by quantifying variation at four microsatellite loci and assaying intraspecific aggression at neighbourhood (30-200 m), fine (1-3.3 km) and regional (5-82 km) spatial scales. Hierarchical analyses across these scales revealed that most genetic variation occurred among workers within nests (similar to 98%). However, although low genetic differentiation occurred among workers between nests at the fine and regional scales (similar to 2%), negligible differentiation was detected among workers from neighbouring nests. Spatial genetic autocorrelation analysis confirmed that neighbouring nests were genetically more similar to each other. Lack of aggression within and across these scales supported the view that L. humile is unicolonial and forms a large supercolony across Melbourne. Comparisons of genetic structure of L. humile among single nests sampled from Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Perth with Melbourne showed no greater levels of genetic differentiation or dissimilar spatial structure, suggesting an Australia-wide supercolony.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the rate of gene flow between GM (RR) and conventional soybeans, in the city of Alfenas, in the south region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The work was carried out in the Horticultural Section and Experimentation of the University Jose do Rosario Vellano - UNIFENAS, in the period of October of 2004 trougth November of 2005. It were been used two cultivars of soybeans (Glicine max): one traditional cultivar [MG/BR 46 (Conquista)], not tolerant to the glyphosate, and other cultivar (BRS Valiosa) resistant to the molecule from glyphosate. The experimental area was delineated by sowing in concentric circles with rays of 1, 2, 3, 4 m for the plant of the cultivar not genetically modified (Conquista) and 5 m for the plants of the cultivar genetically modified. Plants removed of both the populations had received an application from glyphosate, by the the applications of the commercial product Roundup, in the dosis of 1.0 L.ha(-1) when they had reached the V3 stadium, with the objective of certification of the resistance to the herbicide. The RR gene flow in soybeans occurs at low taxes (maximum of 0.25%) in the conditions of Alfenas - MG, Brazil. However, these fact indicates a potential of contamination in soybeans plants not genetically modified growing near the RR plants.

AB  - Seventy years of foot traffic flow research in Russia provided unique empirical data base of travel speed values at different flow density, ranging from 0 up to 13-14 persons/m(2) obtained in approximately 35.000 counts in 100 series of observations and experiments in the different buildings, city territories, route types and experimental settings.
   The laws for crossing of boundaries of adjacent sectors of paths, crowding of people, merging, reforming and diffusion of flows were developed. The flow traffic through door openings, cross and contra-flows, movement on a router with "unlimited" width and other special cases were also investigated.
   Accumulated empirical database was used to establish valid psychophysiological law describes relation between flow travel speed and flow density considering emotional state of people. This law was expressed as random function.
   Established relations were validated against actual observations, experiments and unannounced evacuations which involved able-body and disabled people. Due to high reliability of established laws they were used in all related Russian building codes and also used for flow/evacuation modeling aimed to provide safety of building occupants. Obtained results are presented in the given paper.

AB  - Both the World Health Organization and the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommend using the partogram to follow labor. The objective of this study was to analyze the use of obstetrical interventions, the types of delivery, and perinatal outcomes according to zones I, II and III of the partogram. This cross-sectional study was performed with 233 low-risk pregnant women between December 2004 and March 2005 at a public maternity hospital located in the city of Itapecerica da Serra, in the state of Sao Paulo. Comparative analysis was performed using Chi-square and Fischer exact tests. The practices used in the different partogram zones with statistical significance of (p = 0.05) were: bath, movement and walking (zone-III); artificial rupture of the membranes (zone-II) and oxytocin (zone-I). Caesarean sections were performed on 24% of women in zone-III. The interventions occurred at a timely moment, indicating that the partogram is an instrument that can be used as a guide when adopting interventions during labor.

AB  - Security systems have gained importance during the last decade. There has been a substantial increase in the use of technology for designing different types of security systems. We have seen an introduction to biometric systems like fingerprint scanner, iris scanning. Most of the systems which have developed are manufactured for large scale uses. Many corporate buildings, shopping complexes are seen with security systems. Fire security systems are very important as they help in controlling huge property losses and lives. I would like to propose an electromagnetic theory based free fall emergency evacuation system which is much quicker in evacuating a given place. Emergency evacuation is the movement of people from a dangerous place due to the threat or occurrence of a disastrous event. Examples are the evacuation of a building due to a bomb threat or fire and the evacuation of a district because of a flood or bombardment or an evacuation from a city due to a hurricane. All the principles of a emergency evacuation system remain same, only the way of clearing the place will be an innovative process.

AB  - Aim
   Range expansion across a heterogeneous landscape may depend on the habitat selected and used by the expanding species. If habitat selection influences range expansion then localities colonized by a species should contain a greater proportion of favoured habitat (and less non-habitat) than other nearby localities not colonized. White-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) and Eurasian collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) are two bird species that provide an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis, because the geographic ranges of both species have been expanding in North America for more than two decades.
   Location
   Continental USA.
   Methods
   We used distribution data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to test whether the landscapes occupied by each species contained a greater proportion of favoured habitat (urban land, grassland/pasture, shrub land and cropland) and a lower proportion of non-habitat (forest land) than landscapes where doves were not found. We tested each species separately in each of three broad expansion areas, namely East, Central and West. We also compared rates of spatial spread between expansion areas and between the two species.
   Results
   As predicted, both species tended to occupy landscapes with greater proportions of urban land, shrub land and cropland but with less forest land compared with landscapes without doves, in all three expansion areas. Contrary to prediction, occupied landscapes tended to have slightly less grassland/pasture than unoccupied landscapes. Rates of spread differed between the two species and among expansion areas.
   Main conclusions
   Range expansion and the extent to which a species fills or saturates its range are influenced by the habitat ecology of the expanding species. Species colonize localities based on the availability of suitable habitat. However, the role of habitat in a species' range expansion does depend somewhat on the greater geographical setting. Over large regional and geographical scales, range expansion (rate of spread and saturation) may proceed unevenly, suggesting that range expansion is a very dynamic and context-specific process.

AB  - With the development of modern cities, more and more ultra high-rise buildings have been built. Emergency evacuation of such buildings becomes one of the major concerns for building designers, building occupants and governments, especially after the disaster of 9/11. In this study we designed three experiments to investigate the process of ultra high-rise building evacuation. The experiments were performed in Shanghai World Financial Center, which is about 470 m tall. In the first experiment, the evacuation of a single pedestrian from the top floor to the first floor was performed. Movement characteristics such as mean speed and the time needed for evacuation were analyzed. In the second experiment, the mass evacuation process was captured by video cameras and the data were extracted out manually. The evacuees were distributed initially on floors 12-17, and were asked to evacuate through a staircase onto the refuge floor. On the refuge floor, i.e. the 6th floor, the evacuees were required to transit into another staircase to keep moving down to the ground floor. The characteristic space time curves for each evacuee were extracted and analyzed. Parameters such as the mean speed and the evacuation time, as well as the characteristic of the transit process from one staircase to another were investigated. We at last mimicked and discussed the process of lift evacuation for an ultra high-rise building in the 3rd experiment. Evacuees located on the 41st and 65th floor were asked to move downward by stairs until they came to the refuge floors, where they would evacuate to the ground floor by lifts. The time characteristic of the mixed evacuation strategy was discussed. The basic data obtained from the experiments are useful for building designers and can be used to validate and refine ultra high-rise building evacuation models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - On November 4th 2007, along the Grijalva River in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, has occurred one of the largest landslides ever known. This landslide, known as Juan del Grijalva, destroyed the town of the same name, killing 20 people, and moved 55 million cubic meters of rock and debris down slope to completely block the Grijalva River. In order to understand the characteristics and factors that triggered the Juan del Grijalva landslide, geologic studies were conducted at the site. The results indicate that the landslide was composed of a lithologic sequence of thin-bedded shales and thin to medium-thick-bedded sandstones. This was faulted into several blocks dipping in the same sense as the mass movement. The main triggering factor was the increment of the pore pressure into the lithologic unit due to water saturation after 5 days of heavy rain before the incident. According to records from the last century, the Juan del Grijalva mass movement represents one of the largest mass movements recorded all over the world. The risk conditions of the area after the landslide lead to the rapid construction of an artificial channel to drain the accumulating mass of water upstream and therefore prevent a future catastrophic inundation down stream.

T2  - DEAKIN LAW REVIEW
LA  - English

KW  - REENTRY
KW  - CRIME
KW  - MODEL
AB  - The status of offender rehabilitation has been influenced by the prevailing social climate, the promotion of ways to improve rehabilitation's efficacy, and the well documented cycling of correctional imperatives. A renewed interest in offender transitions and reintegration has been apparent in recent years and most western correctional systems now feature policies and/or programs that address issues relating to the housing, employment, education and the broader 'resettlement' of offenders. However, this movement of correctional imperatives into the 'social' realm brings considerable challenges. Perhaps most significantly, the achievement of reintegration is dependent on juridical and community support in ways that other sentencing goals are not. Given the array of understandings of what 'reintegration' actually is, the abundance of programs claiming such a focus, and the reliance that reintegrative ideas have on community support, measuring the extent and nature of such support is seen as a useful exercise. With the above in mind, the goal of this paper is to identify legislative and community obstacles to the success of reintegrative ideals and policies. The paper first examines relevant legislation for references to reintegrative notions, finding a legislative ambivalence about such ideas. It then presents findings from a Victoria-wide survey of community views about the reintegration of ex-offenders. Participants in the community survey (n = 2635) were asked for their views about sentencing objectives, and the nature of their support for employment and housing initiatives. The results showed low levels of overall support for reintegration, with numerous more subtle distinctions being evident. The data also identify numerous areas where reintegrative programs are likely to be more readily accepted. The findings also indicate a need for targeted research into the correlates of community readiness for specific aspects of offender reintegration, and underlines the need for community education about the social implications of effective reintegration policies for urban, regional and rural communities.

DPM is essentially the carbonaceous aerosol emitted by diesel engines, with a primary particle size of 10-30 nm, though which rapidly agglomerates to form 100-300 nm aerosols. Most guidelines limit occupational exposure to DPM (measured as elemental carbon) to 100 mu g/m(3), on an 8-hr averaged basis. However directly assessing worker exposure is both time consuming and expensive. Apart from sampling the exposure of each individual worker, or conducting continuous (and expensive) monitoring, it is difficult to determine if the DPM levels in a workplace will be sufficient to cause DPM exposures above guideline levels. This work has developed a combined particle dynamics and Bayesian regression model, which allows the DPM levels in an underground mine to be predicted both spatially and temporally. The model incorporates known physical effects, (airflow conditions, dispersion, agglomeration), vehicle movement and vehicle emission rates. This enables the model to account for changing (increased) levels of productivity in the mine, a change in the vehicle fleet, or other such factors. The model has been validated against a monitoring study performed in the mine.

AB  - Many long corridors are built in underground public transport interchanges in downtown of big cities. Smoke control systems have to be installed in these long corridors. A density jump might occur when the smoke flowing under the ceiling hits a smoke barrier. High mass flow rates are then resulted due to additional air entrainment. In this paper, characteristic of density jump at smoke barrier in long corridors, which are induced by horizontal smoke movement underneath the ceiling, will be studied by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Three fire scenarios LF1, LF2 and LF3 with 3 MW, 5 MW and 10 MW fires are selected in a long corridor with two smoke barriers to study the characteristic of density jump. Predicted results by CFD are discussed and compared with the analytical expressions about density jump. As the Froude number under normal fire condition is relatively low, other scenarios HF1-HF3 with higher Froude number were carried out. All CFD results further confirm that density jump occurs when smoke flowing in a long corridor strikes the smoke barrier. Air entrainment would be increased and this phenomenon should be included in fire hazard assessment of long corridor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the persuasive communications (public relations and branding through social media) of a micro Occupy event, namely a nine-day appearance of the global protest movement at Bournemouth University (BU), on the south coast of the UK. It reflects on how student and town protesters used digital and social media in comparison to the wider and more successful UK movement. It interviews the student leader, and asks questions about the role social networks like Occupii. org played in formulating communication strategies as well as how they integrated with more popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The conclusions coming from our micro case study suggest that without a supportive geographic and civic location; clear and focused messages, and robust strategic communication planning and execution, Occupy events will remain very small.

AB  - A biosecurity response was triggered by the detection of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) at the Port of Auckland, New Zealand. Ae. albopictus does not occur in New Zealand and is the most significant mosquito threat to this country. The possibility that a founding population had established, resulted in a large-scale biosecurity surveillance and control program. The response was initiated in early March 2007 and completed by mid-May 2007. No further exotic mosquitoes were detected. The response surveillance program consisted of larval habitat surveys and high density ovi- and light trapping. It was coordinated with a habitat modification and S-methoprene treatment control program. The response policies were guided by analysis of surveillance and quality assurance data, population modeling, and trace-back activities. Mosquito habitat and activity close to port were both more abundant than expected, particularly in storm water drain sumps. Sumps are difficult to treat, and during the response some modification was required to the surveillance program and the control regime. We were assured of the absence or eradication of any Ae. albopictus population, as a result of nil detection from surveillance, backed up by four overlapping rounds of insecticide treatment of habitat. This work highlights the importance of port surveillance and may serve as a guide for responses for future urban mosquito incursions.

AB  - Assisted colonization could help prevent the extinction of threatened and endangered species by intentionally moving a species to a region where it has not occurred in the recent past, but should survive under future climate scenarios. Where species are naturally localized and confined to patchy habitats, assisted colonization might be the only means for population dispersal across human landscape barriers such as urban and agriculture areas. The major risk associated with assisted colonization is introducing ecologically harmful species. Previous policy papers have described management options for deciding when to move a species to mitigate for climate change. We build on this previous work by examining management options and policy solutions for assisted colonization under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). On its surface, the ESA statutory language appears to provide the legal framework for allowing assisted colonization, as the U.S. Congress gave the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) broad discretion to manage populations of endangered species. However, current USFWS regulations are an impediment to assisted colonization for many endangered animal species, whereas regulations do not necessarily restrict assisted colonization of endangered plants. Because of this discrepancy, we recommend a review of the regulatory language governing movements of endangered species.

AB  - Using forests to mitigate climate change has gained much interest in science and policy discussions. We examine the evidence for carbon benefits, environmental and monetary costs, risks and trade-offs for a variety of activities in three general strategies: (1) land use change to increase forest area (afforestation) and avoid deforestation; (2) carbon management in existing forests; and (3) the use of wood as biomass energy, in place of other building materials, or in wood products for carbon storage.
   We found that many strategies can increase forest sector carbon mitigation above the current 162-256 Tg C/yr, and that many strategies have co-benefits such as biodiversity, water, and economic opportunities. Each strategy also has trade-offs, risks, and uncertainties including possible leakage, permanence, disturbances, and climate change effects. Because; similar to 60% of the carbon lost through deforestation and harvesting from 1700 to 1935 has not yet been recovered and because some strategies store carbon in forest products or use biomass energy, the biological potential for forest sector carbon mitigation is large. Several studies suggest that using these strategies could offset as much as 10-20% of current U. S. fossil fuel emissions. To obtain such large offsets in the United States would require a combination of afforesting up to one-third of cropland or pastureland, using the equivalent of about one-half of the gross annual forest growth for biomass energy, or implementing more intensive management to increase forest growth on one-third of forestland. Such large offsets would require substantial trade-offs, such as lower agricultural production and non-carbon ecosystem services from forests. The effectiveness of activities could be diluted by negative leakage effects and increasing disturbance regimes.
   Because forest carbon loss contributes to increasing climate risk and because climate change may impede regeneration following disturbance, avoiding deforestation and promoting regeneration after disturbance should receive high priority as policy considerations. Policies to encourage programs or projects that influence forest carbon sequestration and offset fossil fuel emissions should also consider major items such as leakage, the cyclical nature of forest growth and regrowth, and the extensive demand for and movement of forest products globally, and other greenhouse gas effects, such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions, and recognize other environmental benefits of forests, such as biodiversity, nutrient management, and watershed protection. Activities that contribute to helping forests adapt to the effects of climate change, and which also complement forest carbon storage strategies, would be prudent.

AB  - Purpose - This paper studies the Chinese hospitality sector in terms of its online users' word of mouth (WOM) on hotel staying experiences in five-star hotels of Beijing and Shanghai. Comparisons and analyses on the eWOM are made from three perspectives: online booking site vs. online meta-search site; Chinese hotels vs. foreign and Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan/Singapore (HMTS) hotels; and hotels in Beijing vs. hotels in Shanghai. These three perspectives respectively draw on the issues of incentive, cultural and operational, and geopolitical differences in the hospitality industry of China. Results and implications of this study are expected to make some contributions to the knowledge asset management of the hospitality industry by providing the most updated insights from the most vivid case of the emerging economies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two Chinese travel websites are chosen for this study: ctrip.com, the country's most important travel-booking site with over 40 million members and a network of over 32,000 hotels worldwide, and daodao.com, one of the most popular meta-search sites among the Chinese, with more than 20 million members and over 40 million online ratings by real travellers. In total, data from 202 five-star hotels in Beijing and Shanghai (of which 109 in Beijing and 93 in Shanghai) are used, and hotels used on both websites are exactly the same ones. All ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings were manually collected during August and September of 2010. Means difference and t-tests were conducted to test the hypotheses of the study.
   Originality/value - Current studies in hospitality management are mostly focused on developed countries, with few exceptions concerning developing countries, which are gaining growing importance. This study fills the void by examining the hotel industry of the biggest developing country-China. Moreover, despite the increasing importance of Internet to the hospitality industry, the existing literature is scarce on issues that examine the eWOM differences from traditional booking sites and meta-search sites. This study makes a contribution by studying the most important hotels in most important cities in China. Moreover, cultural factors in this study are drawn from the opposite direction from the majority of the literature, where cultural diversity lies in service receivers, while in this study the cultural diversity arises from the service providers.
   Practical implications - Managerial implications of luxury hotels in China are provided, which are useful for strategic and operational improvements for both Chinese and non-Chinese players in this sector. It is concluded that the online booking site tend to report better customer reviews compared with the meta-search site, which proves our hypothesis that the former is more incentive-driven and less independent as information provider. It has also been found that overall Chinese luxury hotels underperform their foreign counterparts in China, giving space for further development and improvement. In terms of the location difference, no significant eWOM difference was found between Beijing and Shanghai luxury hotels, which implies that difference in political and functional orientations does not necessarily lead to difference in service providing.

AB  - Composite borehole profiling combined with trenching is an effective way to acquire evidence of past ruptures of buried active faults. In this study, three composite borehole profiles and a large-scale trench excavation were carried out across the surface rupture zone of the 1976 M (s)7.8 Tangshan earthquake. The following three major conclusions have been reached. (1) The surface rupture zone of the 1976 earthquake extends more than 47 km long to the south of Tangshan city, passing to the west of Sunjialou, to Daodi town in Fengnan County, to Xihe in Fengnan County. (2) The surface rupture zone is divided into south and north branches. The north branch has mainly right-lateral strike-slip motion, and the vertical displacement of the surface is up on the west and down on the east. On the other hand, the vertical displacement of the south branch is up on the east and down on the west, accompanied by some right-lateral slip. Such a faulting style cannot be explained by the movement of a single normal or reverse fault, but is consistent with the vertical displacement field induced by the right-lateral strike-slip of the fault belt. The drilling and trenching data from this study verify that such activity continued through the Late Quaternary on the Tangshan Fault. (3) The fault planes exhumed by trenching and the dislocations of strata revealed by the boreholes indicate that multiple faulting events occurred on the Tangshan Fault in the Late Quaternary. The timing of three ruptures prior to the 1976 earthquake was 7.61-8.13, > 14.57, and 24.21-26.57 ka BP. Counting the earthquake of 1976, the recurrence interval of the four strong events is about 6.7 to 10.8 ka. On one of the three borehole profiles, the Niumaku profile, nine faulting events were detected since 75.18 ka BP with an average interval of 8.4 ka. In addition, this paper also discusses the difference between the Late Quaternary sedimentary environments to the north and south of Tangshan city based on stratum dating.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to characterize the external morphology and the orientation of burrows constructed by the mangrove crab Ucides cordatus. Data were obtained from two mangrove forests of similar vegetation dominance (Laguncularia racemosa) but differing in flooding heights. These mangroves were located near Barra de Icapara, Iguape City (SP), Brazil, (24 degrees 50'36 '' S-47 degrees 59'53'W). A total of 221 burrows were examined (120 on the high mangrove and 101 on the low mangrove). External morphology of the burrows was recorded by photographs for categorization and description. The directions of the burrow openings were recorded using a geological compass and the declivities of the ducts were measured with a clinometer. Females constructed 70.8% at Site A and 69.4% at Site B of the occupied burrows with the opening facing the margin of the river (P < 0.001), whilst males showed no significant difference in the burrow orientation (P > 0.05) at either site. In females, the tendency for burrow orientation possibly has a reproductive connotation as larval dispersal may be favoured and enhanced by the tides. Four groups of distinct tracks related to the morphotypes and developmental stages of U. cordatus were observed, No sediment constructions associated with the burrows were recorded for this species. Declivity of the burrows from juveniles was lower than from adults (P < 0.05), probably caused by the differential growth of the chelipeds in this species.

TI  - A Middle-Class Diversion from Working-Class Struggle? The New Zealand New Left from the Mid-1950s to the Mid-1970s
T2  - LABOUR HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Internationally, the New Left is frequently regarded as an archetypal middle-class movement that had little concern with the working class. Yet in New Zealand, the New Left's most prominent organisations were working-class youth groups or joint worker-student groups. Furthermore, when a major upturn in workplace antagonism occurred during the late 1960s and the 1970s, many New Leftists attempted to form links with these recalcitrant workers. New Leftists not only supported workplace disputes, but also organised in working-class inner-city suburbs. Significantly, some New Leftists attempted to come to grips with the changing class composition of the time. They usefully broadened class analysis to include many white-collar workers, although much of their analysis was inconclusive. However, other New Leftists dismissed the working class, narrowly defined as manual workers, as backward and reactionary. Moreover, the New Left tended to perceive workers' struggles as peripheral in importance, as it primarily focussed on protesting against the Vietnam War, the nuclear threat, US military installations and apartheid. Overall, the New Left had an ambiguous and complex relationship with class-struggle.

AB  - Organic aerosol (OA) in the atmosphere consists of a multitude of organic species which are either directly emitted or the products of a variety of chemical reactions. This complexity challenges our ability to explicitly characterize the chemical composition of these particles. We find that the bulk composition of OA from a variety of environments (laboratory and field) occupies a narrow range in the space of a Van Krevelen diagram (H: C versus O:C), characterized by a slope of similar to-1. The data show that atmospheric aging, involving processes such as volatilization, oxidation, mixing of air masses or condensation of further products, is consistent with movement along this line, producing a more oxidized aerosol. This finding has implications for our understanding of the evolution of atmospheric OA and representation of these processes in models. Citation: Heald, C. L., J. H. Kroll, J. L. Jimenez, K. S.

AB  - This article examines gender and ethnicity as part of the same social experience It argues that the annual contest to crown Miss Colombo in Trail, British Columbia, during the first half of the 1970s, together with the campaign to preserve the beauty pageant after 1973, offers a unique gendered context to understand the making of ethnicity in a small city Broadly speaking, the pageant reflected specific social, economic, spatial, and cultural changes within the local Italian experience a strong sense of place, occupational success, movement to ethnically mixed neighbourhoods, and positive relations with non Italians These processes played out in a paradoxical forum of the Colombo pageant-a paternal institution that celebrated and evaluated young Italian women s bodies Never contesting the institution itself, which carried a gendered power imbalance, Italian women-both as volunteers and contestants-worked through the pageant to promote their own interpretation of Italian belonging and to endorse a range of new possibilities for themselves The women dramatically recast, but did not overturn, the gendered structures through which these changes took place-a pattern that points to the resiliency of paternalism in discourses of ethnic belonging

AB  - As a result of social change over the past 20 years, there has been an economyinduced population movement in Turkey from eastern locales and rural areas to western regions and city centres. The effects of this domestic migration exemplify the problems of "integration faced by a migrating population". In Turkey the role of Public Education Centres is primarily to provide pre-vocational training to adult learners. The aim of this research is focused upon the following five research questions: a) What are the motivating factors for adults attending courses? b) Are the syllabi consistent with contemporary adult education theories? c) Which media are being used in the courses? d) Are adult learners being taken on excursions outside of the classroom to workshops and factories? e) What methods exist for measuring learning outcomes? The researchers developed a questionnaire to collect data. The questionnaire was composed within a framework of questions to provide insight to the following: i) Characteristics of adult learners, ii) The constructivism principles used in adult education, iii) Teaching techniques suitable for adults, and iv) Motivations behind course enrollment of adult learners. The content validity of the questionnaire was provided by expert opinions. Students attending Turkey-Mersin Public Education Centres between 2007-2008 were chosen as the subject population, with the questionnaires being distributed to 60 adult learners in this research. The findings can be summarized by the following: In the study it was found that students within the same course possessed educational backgrounds ranging from university graduates to those who had never attended a day of school in their lives. The motives behind course attendendance exhibits a diversity of viewpoints among the adult learners. Most of the learners stated that they were learning the subject material for the first time.

AB  - A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a highly mobile wireless ad hoc network that is targeted to support vehicular safety, traffic monitoring, and other applications. Mobility models used in traditional mobile ad hoc networks cannot directly be applied to VANETs since real-world factors such as road layouts and traffic regulations are not considered. In this paper, we propose a vehicular mobility model that reflects real-world vehicle movement and study the performance of packet-routing protocols. First, we study the routing in small-scale VANETs and propose two routing schemes: 1) connection-based restricted forwarding (CBRF) and 2) connectionless geographic forwarding (CLGF). With the insights obtained, we consider routing in large-scale VANETs. Since road complexity and traffic variety may cause many potential problems that existing routing protocols cannot address, we introduce a two-phase routing protocol (TOPO) that incorporates road map information. The proposed protocol defines an overlay graph with roads of high vehicular density and access graphs that are connected to the overlay. While in the overlay, packets are forwarded along a precalculated path. As far as access routing is concerned, we employ the aforementioned CBRF and CLGF schemes and send packets to the overlay or handle packets delivered from the overlay. We argue that the TOPO can serve as a framework that integrates existing VANET routing protocols. We also consider data diversity in VANETs and design the TOPO as an intelligent transportation system (ITS)-friendly protocol. To validate our design philosophy and the routing protocol, we use different areas in the city of Orlando, FL, and generate vehicular mobility traces, following our mobility models. We feed the traces to network simulators and study the routing behavior. Simulation results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed routing protocols for large-scale VANET scenarios.

AB  - One of the biggest earthquakes recorded m human history has recently devastated a large part of the Chilean territory and, followed by a Tsunami, destroyed cities, seaports, fishermen's coves, bridges, and countryside houses. This cataclysm affected a large proportion of our population, leaving homeless families, no working tools nor work places, hospitals, schools, public buildings, museums. However, the loss of human lives was small compared to similar disasters. It destroyed part of the national heritage as well as damaged people's living conditions. A national movement started immediately to help and recover, and international resources, both human and technological, were also set in motion. As after previous earthquakes in Chile, young M.D's and medical students were organized in voluntary groups backed by institutions or by their men organizations and Went from large cares as Santiago and others to provide medical and psychological care to those in most need Young members and students of other health professions (nurses, physical therapists, etc.) were included in these groups or worked in their own ones. National and international experience indicates that the forthcoming months require special care of psychological reactions and sequelae (post traumatic stress symptoms) and health consequences after water pollution, restrictions in housing and deteriorated sanitary conditions. Nevertheless, our country will stand up once more (Rev Med Chile 2010, 138: 267-269)

AB  - The environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina, already compromised before the war by the development of heavy industry, has worsened since the conflict. According to WHO data, in Bosnia and Herzegovina almost 97% of the population have access to water, but its quality is often unsuitable for human consumption because of low protection of water sources, inappropriate water treatment and obsolete condition of the distribution systems. The results of the present study show that such an issue occurs also in the Municipality of Zavidovici (Central Bosnia, 46 000 inhabitants approximately). Water leakages along the municipal network lead to the loss of about 70% of volume drawn from water sources. Distributed water that is microbiologically safe very often contains excessive turbidity and a high permanganate index, due to an incomplete and, therefore, inappropriate water treatment. Moreover, in the large territory of the municipality there are numerous small waterworks whose characteristics are very often unknown. The current situation should therefore be improved not only through structural interventions, such as repairing the pipe network or the construction of specific treatments for removal of turbidity and organic matter from the raw water, but also by means of surveys aimed at identifying the characteristics of rural waterworks and the quality of distributed water.

AB  - Background. National Health Program requires administrative authorities to implement local prevention programs and to support medical activities in their area. On behalf of the Department of Health, City Council of Poznan, in order to gather information about the state of oral health 12-year-old residents, conducted an epidemiological study including a number of aspects: the presence of caries and periodontal disease, malocclusion, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
   Objectives. The aim of study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint and medical needs associated with malocclusion in 12-year-old children.
   Material and Methods. The study protocol included a simplified way of assessing malocclusion based on the leading symptom, which is an easy to notice deviation from the norm. The examination of TMJ was performed by observation of the jaw to jaw relationship during opening and closing movement and the presence of clicking/popping. I n an interview the presence of pain in the TMJ was also taken into account. Total study involved 2,522 people from the general population of 12-year-old children living in Poznan.
   Results. 97% of respondents did not show any signs of pathology of the TMJ. The most frequently observed was an abnormal movement path of the mandible during abduction (at 1.19% of the respondents, 2% of boys and 0.37% girls). Both clicking and the deviation on the mandible occurred in 0.24% of the children. Only 0.2% of the respondents complained in an interview of the TMJ associated pain. Normal occlusion was reported in 35.4% of respondents (37.8% girls, 32.7% boys). 13.3% of 12-year-old children had an urgent orthodontic consultation need.
   Conclusions. Results have indicated the presence of orthodontic treatment needs of the youth, both in aspect of the observed malocclusion and prevention of temporomandibular joint dysfunction

AB  - Recent observations of a bicyclist riding through town and on a treadmill show that the rider uses the upper body very little when performing normal maneuvers and that the bicyclist may, in fact, primarily use steering input for control. The observations also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system.
   We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with no-hands. These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization.
   Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling. These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization-related control actions.

AB  - Set in the framework of self-help- and institutional housing, this paper focuses on main changes in low- and middle-income housing markets in Mexico since the 1960s. Since then, self-help housing occurred at a massive scale, as a consequence of population growth and simultaneous urban growth. In the 1960s and 1970s the combined self-help housing and self-urbanization emerged as a demand making movement. Although self-help housing is no longer dominant in the metropolitan housing markets, it still is an important characteristic, especially for the poorest. Today, many households in the low- and (lower-) middle income-brackets are also offered mass-produced dwelling options, in different shapes and sizes and at different cost-levels. This paper focuses on the two pillars of Mexico's social housing provision and the need to attend the lowest-income groups better, through a revaluation of (assisted) self-help housing and giving more clearness on modest housing products, its costs and affordability.

AB  - Traffic congestion monitoring is being more and important with the enlarging of urban scale and increasing number of vehicles. Video-based traffic congestion monitoring systems are widely used now but it relies on the high performance of hardware. We analyze the procedure of video-based traffic congestion system and divide it into graying, binarization, denosing and moving target detection. The system first reads real time monitoring video and converts them into grayscale images. Through experiment, we find simple global threshold is the most cost efficient for monitoring system. Then we perform noise reduction with different algorithms and find the fittest one for the system. We also put forward a background subtraction method with noise reduction for post-treatment to identify the moving objects, improving identification rate. The system determines whether the congestion occurs by comparison result of the total movement and predefined threshold. We propose an integrated optimized solution for traffic congestion monitoring by making a tradeoff between cost and effect, which uses simple global threshold for binarization, does denoising with IGF (sigma=0.05) and conducts background subtraction with median filter (3x1). The solution achieves real-time response and improves performance without adding more computation.

AB  - An understanding of flood impact in terms of sustainability is vital for long-term disaster risk reduction. This paper utilizes two important concepts: conventional insurance related flood risk for short-term damage by specific flood events, and long-term flood impact on sustainability. The Insurance Related Flood Risk index, IRFR, is defined as the product of the Flood Hazard Index (FHI) and Vulnerability. The Long-term Flood Impact on Sustainability index. LFIS, is the ratio of the flood hazard index to the Sustainable Development Index (SDI). Using a rapid assessment approach, quantitative assessments of IRFR and LFIS are carried out for 2339 counties and cities in mainland China. Each index is graded from 'very low' to 'very high' according to the eigenvalue magnitude of cluster centroids. By combining grades of FHI and SDI, mainland China is then classified into four zones in order to identify regional variations in the potential linkage between flood hazard and sustainability. Zone I regions, where FHI is graded 'very low' or low' and SDI is 'medium' to 'very high', are mainly located in western China. Zone II regions, where FHI and SDI are 'medium' or 'high', occur in the rapidly developing areas of central and eastern China. Zone III regions, where FHI and SDI are 'very low' or 'low', correspond to the resource-based areas of western and north-central China. Zone IV regions, where FHI is 'medium' to 'very high' and SDI is 'very low' to 'low', occur in ecologically fragile areas of south-western China. The paper also examines the distributions of IRFR and LFIS throughout mainland China. Although 57% of the counties and cities have low IRFR values, 64% have high LFIS values. The modal values of LFIS are ordered as Zone I < Zone II approximate to Zone III < Zone IV; whereas the modal values of IRFR are ordered as Zone I < Zone III < Zone IV < Zone II. It is recommended that present flood risk policies be altered towards a more sustainable flood risk management strategy in areas where LFIS and IRFR vary significantly, with particular attention focused on Zone IV regions, which presently experience poverty and a deteriorating eco-system.

AB  - The Olympic Games promise great things; world peace and the transformation of the host city are but two ambitions of the Olympic Movement. The benefits and changes that the 2012 Olympics are supposed to bring to the London Borough of Newham-which will host some 80 per cent of the Olympic events-have been much lauded by the Olympic apparatchiks who typically proselytise about the transformation of communities, countries and individuals via the staging of the Games. The local Organising Committee and others-typically within the real estate sector-are the people who shape these sentiments into particular land deals that will serve to justify the plethora of deals, contracts and developments. Whilst the Olympics are about transformations, ostensibly in the lives of athletes, ordinary people and communities, transformations of an even more lasting sort occur in the Olympic neighbourhood through massive construction and servicing contracts. The Olympics are also about discipline which plays out not only in terms of the preparation of athletes to perform at their utmost, but is imperative to all the arrangements required to host such a huge event. For the good of the Games, people living in the shadow of the 2012 Olympic stadium face having their movements and their neighbourhoods subjected to all manner of prohibitions and limitations.

TI  - Temporospatial Analysis of Hurricane Katrina Regional Evacuation Traffic Patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS

AB  - Between the fall of 2004 and spring of 2005, a plan was developed to facilitate the evacuation of southeast Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans, when under the threat of a hurricane. The plan was created by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development and the Louisiana State Police with the goal of eliminating or mitigating the traffic problems that were a part of the Hurricane Ivan evacuation that occurred in Sept. 2004. The cornerstone of the plan was to maximize the available roadway infrastructure within the region to move nearly the entire population in the most rapid and efficient manner. It incorporated the reversal of about 100 miles of interstate freeway across two states, restricted access to nearly 100 additional miles of freeway, while coordinating the transportation assets on a region-wide basis. This paper summarizes an effort to describe and quantify the effect of this regional evacuation plan on the movement of traffic across roadway infrastructure covering an area of nearly 75,000 square miles and a period of 3 days. The analyses illustrate the extent to which the evacuation impacted the roads in Louisiana, where these impacts were the most significant, how long they lasted, and how they compared to a prior evacuation plan in which a much lower level of management was used.

AB  - Focal mechanism solution of the 27th August 2009 earthquake (mb = 4.0) that occurred in the Badr area, northwest of Saudi Arabia, approximately 50 km from the Red Sea has been determined from the P-wave first motion polarities. Results show normal faulting mechanism with a negligible component of strike-slip motion with NE T-axis direction. This type of mechanism is common with other earthquakes of the northwestern Saudi Arabia and is considered to present the tectonic movement of the region. The dominantly extensional tectonic regime in this province demonstrates the influence of NE extension in the Red Sea. The strikes of the solution are consistent with those of the main faults near the epicenter. Hypocentral location of this earthquake was carried out using the data from the King Abdulaziz City of Science and Technology Seismic Network, Saudi Arabia, and the Egyptian National Seismological Network, Egypt. The horizontal and vertical confidence estimates are 0.5 km for both. The local magnitude, M (L), following the Richter's original definition was also derived from ten digital three-component broadband seismograms. The average local magnitude determined in this study is 3.8 +/- 0.17. The estimated seismic moment of this event is .

KW  - shear strength
AB  - The major rivers within the City of Winnipeg are founded in glacial Lake Agassiz clay and silt sediments that have low shear strength. As such, riverbank instabilities are a common issue along many stretches of the rivers. The use of rockfill columns has become an increasingly utilized approach for stabilizing failing banks. Recent cases in Winnipeg have shown that movements can occur following installation of rockfill columns. Uncertainty regarding the magnitude of these movements that is required to mobilize shearing resistance in the rockfill columns has resulted in situations where the stability of riverbanks following remediation has been questioned. This has provided a need to improve our understanding about how much movement a stabilized slope must undergo before sufficient shear resistance of the rockfill column will be mobilized. The results of experimental testing conducted to assess the shear mobilization of rockfill column materials using a large-scale direct shear test apparatus are presented in this paper. The testing methodology is described along with the test results. The results show that the development of material specifications, construction, and placement methods and appropriate methods of analysis requires understanding of the stress-strain properties of the in situ soil and the rockfill material.

AB  - The BG-Sentinel (BGS) trap uses visual and olfactory cues as well as convection currents to attract Aedes aegypti (L.). The impact of the visual environment on trapping efficacy of the BGS trap for Ae. aegypti was investigated. Four- to 5-d nulliparous female and male Ae. aegypti were released into a semicontrolled room to evaluate the effect of the presence, reflectance, and distribution of surrounding harborage sites on BGS trapping efficacy. Low-reflective (dark) harborage sites near the BGS had a negative effect on both male and nulliparous female recapture rates; however, a more pronounced effect was observed in males. The distribution (clustered versus scattered) of dark harborage sites did not significantly affect recapture rates in either sex. In a subsequent experiment, the impact of oviposition sites on the recapture rate of gravid females was investigated. Although gravid females went to the oviposition sites and deposited eggs, the efficacy of the BGS in recapturing gravid females was not compromised. Ae. aegypti sampling in the field will mostly occur in the urban environment, whereby the BGS will be among oviposition sites and dark harborage areas in the form of household items and outdoor clutter. In addition to understanding sampling biases of the BGS, estimations of the adult population size and structure can be further adjusted based on an understanding of the impact of dark harborage sites on trap captures. Outcomes from this suite of experiments provide us with important considerations for trap deployment and interpretation of Ae. aegypti samples from the BGS trap.

AB  - The intensification of work generated by the introduction of new technologies and management changes, modifies the pattern of illness among workers. This can be seen through the increase in cases of work-related illnesses such as RSI, which represent the main group of occupational diseases in our country. Its occurrence is associated with work activities that require excessive force, improper posture and repetitiveness of the same movement pattern. The loss in business will reduce the productivity and/or quality, absenteeism, increased costs to the sickness, loss or functional impairment of the worker with a consequent reduction in self-esteem and all socio-professional and family involved. Although they are most often associated with urban life and industry, occupational disorders also affect the economic activities related to rural. Among the various agricultural activities, fruits is developing and contributing to the increased participation of the agricultural sector in GDP, and the northeast, especially the Sao Francisco Valley, the great emphasis on the export of grapes, using a large quantity of manpower. The activity of thinning the berries became indispensable to the production of fine grapes. There is a preference of hand labor of women to practice this activity because it is a mild, fragile and perishable, in the case of the grape. According to Santos (2002), women are more affected by occupational diseases due to double shifts that have (domestic and professional work outside the home). In this regard, we sought to identify what types of RSI possible to tackle the workers in the activity of thinning and what are the risks of developing this disease in women who practice the activity of thinning of berries of table grapes in the Lower Basin San Francisco Valley. For this there was a case study in a company producing grapes in the city of Petrolina, where they were applied in data gathering: questionnaires, survey of anthropometric data (height and weight), check list and photos, plus the WinOWAS use of the software, where it was possible to analyze the positions taken in carrying out the task and the work environment, and to assess the anthropometric and biomechanical data from the study. The analysis of these data indicated that these workers are predisposed to develop lesions in the shoulders, hands, along the spine due to repetitive movements and postures that the task requires.

AB  - Background: The global pattern of distribution of 1033 B. anthracis isolates has previously been defined by a set of 12 conserved canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms (canSNP). These studies reinforced the presence of three major lineages and 12 sub-lineages and sub-groups of this anthrax-causing pathogen. Isolates that form the A lineage (unlike the B and C lineages) have become widely dispersed throughout the world and form the basis for the geographical disposition of "modern" anthrax. An archival collection of 191 different B. anthracis isolates from China provides a glimpse into the possible role of Chinese trade and commerce in the spread of certain sub-lineages of this pathogen. Canonical single nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) and multiple locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) typing has been used to examine this archival collection of isolates.
   Results: The canSNP study indicates that there are 5 different sub-lineages/sub-groups in China out of 12 previously described world-wide canSNP genotypes. Three of these canSNP genotypes were only found in the western-most province of China, Xinjiang. These genotypes were A. Br.008/009, a sub-group that is spread across most of Europe and Asia; A. Br. Aust 94, a sub-lineage that is present in Europe and India, and A. Br. Vollum, a lineage that is also present in Europe. The remaining two canSNP genotypes are spread across the whole of China and belong to sub-group A. Br. 001/002 and the A. Br. Ames sub-lineage, two closely related genotypes. MLVA typing adds resolution to the isolates in each canSNP genotype and diversity indices for the A. Br. 008/009 and A. Br. 001/002 sub-groups suggest that these represent older and established clades in China.
   Conclusion: B. anthracis isolates were recovered from three canSNP sub-groups ( A. Br.008/009, A.Br.Aust94, and A.Br.Vollum) in the western most portion of the large Chinese province of Xinjiang. The city of Kashi in this province appears to have served as a crossroads for not only trade but the movement of diseases such as anthrax along the ancient "silk road". Phylogenetic inference also suggests that the A.Br.Ames sub-lineage, first identified in the original Ames strain isolated from Jim Hogg County, TX, is descended from the A.Br.001/002 sub-group that has a major presence in most of China. These results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the younger Ames sub-lineage in Texas and the large Western North American sub-lineage spread across central Canada and the Dakotas.

AB  - P>1. Overlapping river and road networks provide a framework for studying the complex interactions between natural and human systems, with river-road intersections as focal areas of study. Roads can alter the morphology of stream channels, pose barriers to freshwater fauna, provide easy access to streams for humans and non-native species and accelerate the expansion of urban development.

We determined what variables control the structure of diadromous fish and shrimp communities and assessed whether particular road crossings altered community structure in north-eastern Puerto Rico. We identified 24 sites that represented a range of river and road sizes across two catchments that drain El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico.
   3. The location of natural barriers and the size of stream pools were the most important variables for predicting six of fifteen fish and shrimp distributions. Predatory fishes were predicted to be limited to areas in the river network below large, steep waterfalls, whereas adult shrimp Atya lanipes (Atyidae) were predicted to be present above these waterfalls. The fish Awaous banana was predicted to be present in pools > 11.6 m wide, whereas the shrimp Xiphocaris elongata was predicted to be present in pools < 10.4 m wide. The distributions of nine species were predicted poorly, but three of these species were common and three were rare.
   4. Although urban and agricultural land covers were among the top three predictors of five species distributions, they were probably good predictors because they were correlated with the natural gradient. Further study is necessary to disentangle natural and anthropogenic gradients.
   5. Road crossings, 10 of which were culverts, were not dispersal barriers for fishes or shrimps. On average, species were present both upstream and downstream from road crossings at 68% of sites where they occurred. Absences upstream or downstream from road crossings occurred at 16% of sites each and likely resulted from a failure to detect species.
   6. Several existing features of these catchments and taxa may aid in fish and shrimp conservation. The headwaters are protected by management practices of El Yunque National Forest, connectivity within the river network has been maintained, and the diadromous life history of these organisms makes them resilient to pulsed disturbances.

AB  - Valerie Lee and Douglas Ready explore the influences of the high school curriculum on student learning and the equitable distribution of that learning by race and socioeconomic status. They begin by tracing the historical development of the U. S. comprehensive high school and then examine the curricular reforms of the past three decades.
   During the first half of the twentieth century, the authors say, public high schools typically organized students into rigid curricular "tracks" based largely on students' past academic performance and future occupational and educational plans. During the middle of the century, however, high schools began to provide students with a choice among courses that varied in both content and academic rigor. Although the standards movement of the 1980s limited these curricular options somewhat, comprehensive curricula remained, with minority and low-income students less often completing college-prep courses.
   During the 1990s, say the authors, researchers who examined the associations between course-taking and student learning reported that students completing more advanced coursework learned more, regardless of their social or academic backgrounds. Based largely on this emerging research consensus favoring college-prep curriculum, in 1997 public high schools in Chicago began offering exclusively college-prep courses. To address the needs of the city's many low-performing ninth graders, schools added extra coursework in subjects in which their performance was deficient. A recent study of this reform, however, found that these approaches made little difference in student achievement.
   Lee and Ready hypothesize that "selection bias" may explain the divergent conclusions reached by the Chicago study and previous research. Earlier studies rarely considered the unmeasured characteristics of students who completed college-prep courses-characteristics such as motivation, access to academic supports, and better teachers-that are also positively related to student learning. Although the Chicago evaluation is only one study of one city, its findings raise the worrisome possibility that the recent push for "college-prep for all" may not generate the improvements for which researchers and policy makers had hoped.

AB  - In a hot-humid climate, comfort ventilation involving air movement over the skin of the human body is a prime consideration for thermal comfort. In developing countries with such a climate, the use of an air conditioner is not economically feasible by a majority of the population. Therefore, ceiling fan assisted cooling strategies hold significance. Fans increase the air movement inside rooms, thereby causing the layer of sweat over the occupant's body to evaporate. This paper aims to assess the evaporative cooling effect of a ceiling fan in a naturally ventilated house. The study was carried out in the hot-humid climate of Chennai City in India during the hottest part of the year. The criterion for evaluating the indoor thermal performance of this study is the difference in the standard effective temperature SET under conditions of still air and under conditions of using a ceiling fan at 2 m/s speed. Indoor air temperature changes under still air (0.1 m/s) were collected in four rooms of varying orientations (NW, NE, SW and SE) and with varying opening sizes for a 24 hour period. Using the software 'ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Standard Tool' developed by Environmental Analytics (Berkeley, CA) for ASHRAE, the difference in SET was calculated for these rooms and for eight conditions of opening sizes. Also, indoor comfort conditions, based on the five-point thermal discomfort scale, were recorded. It was found that the ceiling fans are most effective in enhancing comfort during the early morning hours. In addition, ceiling fans are consistent in providing thermal comfort when opening sizes are very small (5% - 25% of the floor area). They are most effective when opening sizes are of the order of 10% to 60% of the floor area. It was found that the NW orientated room had the least number of comfortable hours even in the presence of a ceiling fan.

AB  - Jiangyin County is in the infamous Su-Xi-Chang land subsidence area caused by excessive groundwater withdrawal in Jiangsu province, China. The maximum accumulated land subsidence reached 1,310 mm near the centre of the subsiding trough in 2006 in southern Jiangyin, and earth fissures of significant vertical offsets have been observed at Changjing, Hetang and Wenlin which form an arc towards the subsidence trough. An ancient Yangtze River course is found underlying and passing through the depression in southern Jiangyin, forming a local basin surrounded by outcropped bedrock ridges in the north and south. The Quaternary stratigraphy demonstrates significant heterogeneities in the basin; the second confined aquifer is much thicker and deeper and encapsulated inside the basin and absent above the ridges. The development of earth fissures along the Changjing-Hetang-Wenlin arc might be a combination of an inward rotation of sediments due to a large differential subsidence, an inward movement driven by seepage force and a steeper slope along the south-eastern shoulder of the basin that facilitates the development of horizontal tensile strain and/or shear strain necessary for fissuring. The land subsidence has slowed down and no new earth fissure zone has occurred in the area after the banning of deep groundwater extraction was enacted in 2001.

AB  - The historical eruptive activity at Colima Volcano has been characterized by Strombolian and Merapi type eruptions and Vulcanian explosions associated with dome growth, which have ended in a Plinian eruption about every 100 years. The situation now prevailing at Colima Volcano is similar to that which preceded these explosive eruptions, when a dome fills the crater. This study proposes seven scenarios for the ash-fall from a Plinian eruption, based on historical eruptive activity, isopach thickness from the 1913 Plinian eruption, land use, socioeconomic data, and a 15-year statistical wind study realized with daily radiosonde data grouped according to four altitudinal levels: 4,000-9,000 (I); 9,000-14,000 (II); 14,000-17,000 (III) and 17,000-28,000 (IV) ma.s.l., based on common wind speeds and directions. We have integrated the wind distribution at level IV and estimated the ash dispersion for a Plinian eruption. From January to March, the main impact would be towards the northeast, in April and in October, towards the east, in May, towards the north-northeast or north-northwest, from June to August, towards the northwest, in September, towards the west, and in November and December, towards the west-southwest. The fallout would damage the coniferous forests of the Colima National Park, two lagoons and three lakes. More than 30 million people living in Guadalajara, Mexico City, Leon and Colima would suffer eye, respiratory and skin problems. The proximal areas, such as Ciudad Guzman, would be subject to roof collapsing and communication problems. The agricultural and livestock sectors would suffer severe financial losses. The Queseria sugar mill, the Atenquique paper mill, and the cement plants in Zapotiltic would halt work due to chimney obstruction and machinery abrasion. Four thermoelectric plants, twenty airports and four commercial ports would be affected if the eruption occurs in summer.

AB  - School-based health education is a promising approach for improving organ donation rates, but little is known about its efficacy among ethnically diverse youth. The impact of a classroom intervention was examined in a multicultural high school population where students' ethnicities were 45% African American, 30% Asian American, and 33% Caucasian (allowing for multiracial choices). A baseline survey was administered to all health classes within two wk prior to intervention. On the intervention day, classes randomly assigned to the intervention group received an educational session, followed by a second survey; in control classes, the second survey was taken before the educational session. At baseline, non-Caucasian ethnicity and male gender were each associated with lower levels of willingness to donate. Following the intervention, students in the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge scores (p < 0.001), as well as positive movement of opinion regarding willingness to donate (p < 0.0001). Most importantly, the positive changes in opinion occurred independently of ethnicity and gender, in spite of these both being negative predictors of opinion at baseline. These results demonstrate that even a single classroom exposure can impact knowledge levels, correct misinformation, and effect opinion change on organ donation among an ethnically diverse adolescent population.

AB  - Photochemical ozone pollution of the lower troposphere (LT) is a very complex process involving meteorological, topographic emissions and chemical parameters. Ozone is considered the most important air pollutant in rural, suburban and industrial areas of many sites in the world since it strongly affects human health, vegetation and forest ecosystems, and its increase during the last decades has been significant. In addition, ozone is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. For these reasons, it is necessary to carry out investigations that determine the behaviour of ozone at different locations. The aim of this work is to understand the levels and temporal variations of surface ozone in an industrial-urban region of the Southwest Iberian Peninsula.
   The study is based on ozone hourly data recorded during a 6-year period, 2000 to 2005 at four stations and meteorological data from a coastal station. The stations used were El Arenosillo and Cartaya-both coastal stations, Huelva-an urban site and Valverde-an inland station 50 km away from the coastline. The general characteristics of the ozone series, seasonal and daily ozone cycles as well as number of exceedances of the threshold established in the European Ozone Directive have been calculated and analysed.
   Analysis of the meteorological data shows that winter-autumn seasons are governed by the movement of synoptic weather systems; however, in the spring-summer seasons, both synoptic and mesoescale conditions exist. Average hourly ozone concentrations range from 78.5 +/- 0.1 mu g m(-3) at Valverde to 57.8 +/- 0.2 mu g m(-3) at Huelva. Ozone concentrations present a seasonal variability with higher values in summer months, while in wintertime, lower values are recorded. A seasonal daily evolution has also been found with minimum levels around 08:00 UTC, which occurs approximately 1-1.5 h after sunrise, whereas the maximum is reached at about 16:00 UTC. Furthermore, during summer, the maximum value at El Arenosillo and Valverde stations remains very uniformed until 20:00 UTC. These levels could be due to the photochemical production in situ and also to the horizontal and vertical ozone transport at El Arenosillo from the reservoir layers in the sea and in the case of Valverde, the horizontal transport, thanks to the marine breeze. Finally, the data have been evaluated relative to the thresholds defined in the European Ozone Directive. The threshold to protect human health has been exceeded during the spring and summer months mainly at El Arenosillo and Valverde. The vegetation threshold has also been frequently exceeded, ranging from 131 days at Cartaya up to 266 days at Valverde.
   The results in the seasonal and daily variations demonstrate that El Arenosillo and Valverde stations show higher ozone concentrations than Cartaya and Huelva during the spring and summer months. Under meteorological conditions characterized by land-sea breeze circulation, the daytime sea breeze transports the emissions from urban and industrial sources in the SW further inland. Under this condition, the area located downwind to the NE is affected very easily by high ozone concentrations, which is the case for the Valverde station. Nevertheless, according to this circulation model, the El Arenosillo station located at the coast SE from these sources is not directly affected by their emissions. The ozone concentrations observed at El Arenosillo can be explained by the ozone residual layer over the sea, similar to other coastal sites in the Mediterranean basin.
   The temporal variations of the ozone concentrations have been studied at four measurement sites in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The results obtained point out that industrial and urban emissions combined with specific meteorological conditions in spring and summer cause high ozone levels which exceed the recommended threshold limits and could affect the vegetation and human health in this area.
   This work is the first investigation related to surface ozone in this region; therefore, the results obtained may be a useful tool to air quality managers and policy-makers to apply possible air control strategies towards a reduction of ozone exceedances and the impact on human health and vegetation. Due to the levels, variability and underlying boundary layer dynamics, it is necessary to extend this research in this geographical area with the purpose of improving the understanding of photochemical air pollution in the Western Mediterranean Basin and in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - Recently, some experiments demonstrated that reliable DInSAR measurements can be achieved at any band and that further time-series analyses can be applied for airborne data. However, most of the airborne DInSAR results, including the time-series, published so far have focused on short-term analyses (baselines within hours or few days). This paper presents the first worldwide airborne DInSAR survey at P-and X-band for measuring the land movements occurred within 1 year and 3 months. The survey was performed by the OrbiSAR system of OrbiSat under contract with Petrobras (CENPES), as part of a experiment with the objective to identify possible threats to the pipeline due to land movements in Sao Sebastiao-SP, Brazil. The measurements at P-band show reliable and coherent movements in 80% of the imaged vegetated areas with accuracy in the order of centimeters. At X-band we were able to reliably measure coherent movements in urban areas with accuracy in the order of millimeters. Through field work evidences, the paper analyses the causes of these small scale land movements, and how they are related to geodynamic processes. A comparison between the DInSAR and in-loco inclinometer measurements is presented. The paper suggests some possible operational scenarios and discusses on the potential of the airborne DInSAR for land movement monitoring.

AB  - Several epidemiological changes have occurred in the pattern of nosocomial and community acquired infectious diseases during the past 25 years. Social and demographic changes possibly related to this phenomenon include a rapid population growth, the increase in urban migration and movement across international borders by tourists and immigrants, alterations in the habitats of animals and arthropods that transmit disease, as well as the raise of patients with impaired host defense abilities. Continuous surveillance programs of emergent pathogens and antimicrobial resistance are warranted for detecting in real time new pathogens, as well as to characterize molecular mechanisms of resistance. In order to become more effective, surveillance programs of emergent pathogens should be organized as a multicenter laboratory network connected to the main public and private infection control centers. Microbiological data should be integrated to guide therapy, adapting therapy to local ecology and resistance patterns. This paper presents an overview of data generated by the Division of Infectious Diseases, Federal University of Sao Paulo, along with its participation in different surveillance programs of nosocomial and community acquired infectious diseases.

AB  - Didelphis albiventris is a well-known and common marsupial. Due to its high adaptability, this very widespread generalist species occurs under various environmental conditions, this even including protected regions and disturbed urban areas. We studied a 653 bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase c (COI) from 93 biological samples from seven Brazilian localities, with linear distances ranging between 58 and about 1800 km to analyze the effects of geographic distances on variability and genetic differentiation. The haplotype network presented nine haplotypes and two genetic clusters compatible with the two most distant geographic areas of the states of Minas Gerais, in the southeast, and Rio Grande do Sul, in the extreme south. As each cluster was characterized by low nucleotide and high haplotype diversities, their populations were obviously composed of closely related haplotypes. Surprisingly, moderate to high F-ST differentiation values and a very weak phylogeographic signal characterizes interpopulation comparisons within Minas Gerais interdemes, these being correlated with the presence of privative haplotypes. On a larger geographic scale, a comparison between demes from Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul presented high F-ST values and a robust phylogeographic pattern. This unexpected scenario implies that mtDNA gene flow was insufficient to maintain population cohesion, reflected by the observed high differentiation.

AB  - December 2011 protests in Russia, the largest after the collapse of the Soviet Union, shattered the status quo that had taken shape over the last decade and signaled that Russia is entering turbulent waters. Russia found itself caught in a trap: the 2011-2012 elections perpetuate a personalized power system that became the source of decay. The top-down rule and its "personificator" - Vladimir Putin - are already rejected by the most dynamic and educated urban population. However, no clear political alternative with a broad social support has yet emerged to replace the old Russian matrix.
   In terms of strategic significance, Putin's regime will most certainly unravel in the foreseeable perspective. But it is hard to predict what consequences this will have: the system's disintegration and even collapse of the state, growing rot and atrophy, or the last grasp in the life of personalized power and transformation that will set Russia on a new foundation. One thing is apparent: transformation will not happen in the form of reform from above and within, and if it does occur, it will be the result of the deepening crisis and society's pressure.

AB  - This paper reports the study of the osseous remains of an adult male (30-35 years) from a Spanish urban necropolis dating from the pre-industrial age (17th-18th centuries). We have diagnosed the presence of a severe unreduced forearm fracture, which has been classified as a Type I Monteggia fracture in the left arm. Injury occurred by a complete and poorly resolved ulnar fracture in its upper third. As result of this ulna fracture a radial head dislocation also occurred, creating a new articular surface on the humerus. The ulna also underwent two different types of angulation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anatomical changes of the elbow joint bones after a Monteggia fracture, assessing the completeness of functionality on the arm of this man. After the fracture, this individual lived the rest of his life with a permanent dislocation of his radius; therefore, loss of the forearm rotation, cubitus valgus, elbow instability and pain were all present. Movement was limited to an intermediate position or semipronative. A detailed description of the pathology is also accompanied by a discussion of the historical-cultural context in which this man lived and the common diseases of the population to which he belonged.

AB  - This case study deals with a rock face monitoring in urban areas using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. The pilot study area is an almost vertical, fifty meter high cliff, on top of which the village of Castellfollit de la Roca is located. Rockfall activity is currently causing a retreat of the rock face, which may endanger the houses located at its edge. TLS datasets consist of high density 3-D point clouds acquired from five stations, nine times in a time span of 22 months (from March 2006 to January 2008). The change detection, i.e. rockfalls, was performed through a sequential comparison of datasets. Two types of mass movement were detected in the monitoring period: (a) detachment of single basaltic columns, with magnitudes below 1.5m(3) and (b) detachment of groups of columns, with magnitudes of 1.5 to 150m(3). Furthermore, the historical record revealed (c) the occurrence of slab failures with magnitudes higher than 150m(3). Displacements of a likely slab failure were measured, suggesting an apparent stationary stage. Even failures are clearly episodic, our results, together with the study of the historical record, enabled us to estimate a mean detachment of material from 46 to 91.5m(3) year(-1). The application of TLS considerably improved our understanding of rockfall phenomena in the study area.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to improve the accuracy of the COMFA outdoor thermal comfort model for application to subjects performing physical activity. A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify conditions where the COMFA model produced erroneous estimates of the heat and moisture exchanges between the human body and the ambient environment, based on data from subjects performing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Errors occurred at high metabolic rates (> 400 W m(-2)), high wind speeds (> 4 m s(-1)) and warm air temperatures (> 28A degrees C). Revisions to the clothing resistance (r (c)), clothing vapour resistance (r (c upsilon)), skin tissue resistance (r (t)), and skin temperature (T (sk)) equations were proposed. The revised assessment revealed that subjects had a wide range of thermal acceptability (B = -20 W m(-2) to +150 W m(-2)), which was offset to the warm-end of the comfort scale. The revised model (COMFA*) performed well, predicting the actual thermal sensation of subjects in approximately 70% of cases. This study effectively integrated current empirical research related the effect of wind and activity on the clothing microclimate to improve the application of an outdoor thermal comfort model for subjects performing physical activity.

AB  - Catfish have provided sustenance for Missouri inhabitants since prehistoric times, and their abundance and large size capabilities contribute to a popular sport fishery. Catfish were first propagated in state fish hatcheries and stocked in public and private waters in 1911. The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) began intensive rearing of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus in 1938. Since 1942, fingerling channel catfish have been used in MDC's private impoundment stocking program. In the early 1960s, MDC initiated production of advanced fingerling channel catfish (>20.3 cm) for stocking in small public lakes. Catchable-size channel catfish (>30.5 cm) are provided for kids' fishing clinics and the urban fishing program where angler effort is as high as 30,000 h/ha. Blue catfish I. furcatus and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris were first reared for stocking in public impoundments in 1978 and 1983, respectively. Commercial markets currently exist for channel catfish, flathead catfish, and blue catfish harvested from the Mississippi and St. Francis rivers. Catfish have comprised 21% of the commercial fish harvest since commercial fishing reports became a requirement in 1945. Channel catfish aquaculture has been a viable commercial industry in Missouri since the 1950s. The first official state sportfishing regulation established for catfish was a seasonal restriction in 1928 followed by a 30.5-cm minimum length limit for channel catfish in 1933. Separate daily sport fish bag limits are in effect for flathead catfish, blue catfish, and channel catfish. Currently, catfish are the most preferred sport fish group in Missouri. Most (75%) catfish anglers prefer to fish for channel catfish, most are harvest-oriented, and more than 80% prefer to fish with rod and reel. Competitive fishing for catfish began in the early 1980s, with most tournaments held on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and associated lower tributary streams. Major management achievements include banning commercial catfishing on the Missouri River and developing an effective sampling technique for monitoring channel catfish populations in small public lakes. Current fisheries management efforts are directed by a statewide plan and primarily focused on measuring exploitation, growth, movement, and fecundity of blue catfish and flathead catfish in the Missouri River, upper Mississippi River, and associated tributaries, and growth and exploitation of blue catfish and flathead catfish in two large reservoirs.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have adapted to, and are thriving in, residentialsuburban landscapes. Special hunts, sharpshooting programs, and fertility control efforts have been implemented in residential communities to reduce local deer populations. For these management strategies to be effective, it is important to understand deer movement and behavior patterns in suburban landscapes. Our objectives were to quantify annual and hunt-season home-range size, and evaluate the relationships between landscape characteristics, land-ownership patterns, and deermovements during the autumn hunting season. Much variation in home range size was observed for annual (15.5-173 ha) and hunt-season home range (16.8-120.7 ha) over the 2-yr study. Deer core areas were not characteristically different from home ranges with regards to forest lands or building density, but were different with regards to road density and property density. Deer use of core areas during the day was similar to, or higher than, deer use at night. Most individual properties in deer core areas were <2.8 ha. Under the current set-back distance for firearms hunting (152 m), 31% and 38% of deer had no portion of their home range potentially open to firearms hunting, and 69% and 81% had no portion of their core areas potentially open to firearms hunting in years 1 and 2. Percentage of forest in home range buffers decreased from 66% in year 1 (abundant acorns) to 46% in year 2 (moderate acorns) as deer shifted into residential development. Findings from our study emphasize the value of conducting multiyear studies and incorporating other variables such as mast abundance to improve interpretation of landscape models. The close association of deer core areas with roads suggests that sharpshooting programs that bait and shoot deer from roads may be an effective management option. In suburban landscapes, deer core areas are comprised of many different landowners, limiting hunter access and mobility to deer core areas. No-hunt buffers around buildings should be reduced to levels that increase hunter access to deer core areas, yet maintain reasonable safety zones. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Objective: Problems facing authorities and researchers of road traffic accidents in most developing countries include lack of data and clarity and accessibility problems with existing data. This resulted in a severe scarcity in information on pedestrian crashes, which, in turn, served as an obstacle facing all efforts to reduce these crashes. This study aims at studying pedestrian crashes with regard to their causes and characteristics in Riyadh, analyzing the bodily distribution of injuries in victims and determining the characteristics of pedestrians and drivers involved in these collisions. Methods: Data on randomly selected road traffic accidents involving pedestrians between July 2005 and June 2008 were collected from five different sources. Data collected included date and location, casualty details, accident sketch, weather conditions, site characteristics, road surface conditions, vehicle characteristics, type of collision, vehicle(s) direction and movement, damage description, and causes as well as details of parties involved such as nationality, age, education level, severity of injury, and others. Results: The number of pedestrian crashes investigated was 460, involving 551 victims over a 3-year period (out of an estimated 1500 crashes). Results showed that the average rate of pedestrian fatalities per accident was as high as 0.32 and that almost two thirds of drivers and slightly less than half of the victims were less than 30 years of age. In contrast to other road traffic accidents (RTAs) in this city, two thirds of pedestrian crashes occurred between 4:00 pm and midnight. Results also revealed that non-Saudis and men were at a significantly greater risk than Saudis and women to be involved in pedestrian crashes. It was also found that two thirds of pedestrians involved in RTAs were struck while crossing the road. Moreover, although 8.7 percent of Riyadh's population lives in the southern and northern regions of the city, pedestrian crashes in these two regions constituted 32.2 percent of all pedestrian crashes. As related to injury type, head, thorax, and spinal injuries formed most of the serious injuries. It was also found that the most often injured body regions were the upper and lower extremities and the head. Conclusions: Practical recommendations are given that researchers, traffic police, medical authorities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), educational institutions, and municipalities can adopt to lower the risk of pedestrian crashes.

AB  - The medical response to radiation-whether file result of radiological warfare, terrorist deployment of improvised radiation dispersal weapons, political assassination. occupational or industrial accidents or the medically radiated patient remains one of the least taught among all disciplines within medical education. In the aftermath of 9/11 among medical vulnerabilities to toxicant threats, of all the categories of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)-whether using the CBRNE (chemical, biological. radiological, nuclear, explosive) or NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) acronym-radiation is the least taught in professional schools, responder Cultures Or Civil preparedness organizations. To date. few health care professionals (HCP) possess the fundamental knowledge or skills to identify and diagnose, let alone treat a radiation victim; this vulnerability made even more Obvious in the aftermath of the high profile assassination of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko. He was poisoned with Polonium(210). Radioactive Substances are ubiquitous with radiation Sources being ill or transported through virtually every region nationwide. It is essential to increase preparedness among community and rural health care facilities as well as urban and University hospitals. Managing radiation injuries effectively requires access to specialized equipment and expertise. Radiation sickness is progressive and may require acute, critical and long term care throughout the Course of illness. Regardless of the source, preparedness rests upon acknowledging a threat exists and dedicating the resources to address the risks including, the enhancement of training Mid equipment. Mass or individual exposures to radiation present Unique challenges to the entire response continuum from law enforcement, first responders and emergency medical care. Increased education about and practice in responding to radiological threats is essential to enhance preparedness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.

AB  - During most of the past century, spirit leveling was the only technique for providing high-precision data for the assessment of land subsidence in the northern Adriatic coastland. Only at the end of the 1990s did global positioning system methods, both continuous (CGPS) and differential (DGPS), begin to be used for ground movement measurements with a sufficient accuracy. Since the beginning of the new millennium, space-borne observation techniques based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry also have been used to detect ground displacements, i.e., subsidence and uplift, in the Venice coastland. Differential InSAR (DInSAR), first, and interferometric point target analysis (IPTA), at a later stage, have been applied to measure and map displacements occurring since 1992 when SAR data first became available. The capability of SAR interferometry to measure ground vertical movements in large areas at millimetric accuracy has significantly improved the knowledge of the phenomenon. In particular, comprehensive maps of the vertical displacements have revealed the high spatial variability characterizing the ground movements in the Venice region. A general land stability has been detected in the central part of the study area, including the major cities of Venice, Padova and Treviso, with scattered local bowls of subsidence of up to 2-3 mm/year. Conversely, land settlement has appeared as a widespread phenomenon in the northern and southern coast with rates of up to 5 and 15 mm/year, respectively. Uplift rates ranging up to 2 mm/year have been measured in two different large areas located north of Treviso and south of Padova, respectively, whereas higher values are restricted to the eastern sector of the Euganean Hills.

AB  - Our cities worldwide are plagued with the hazards of global wan-ning, ozone layer destruction and acid rain, caused by the over-consumption of energy. Such dilemmas can be offset by using less energy in innovative ways. We, as architects, have to make important decisions about the types of our buildings. To reach this purpose, ecological design focuses on the human-nature interface and uses nature. Although the green building movement is a relatively recent phenomenon, it has its roots in several previous generations of architecture. In the Iranian context, several figures laid the foundation for today's ecological design. In such traditional buildings many forms, elements, materials, and techniques were used to achieve comfort and respond to the local climate. Courtyards, wind catchers, and shading devices are some of the most successful aspects. However, many probably haven't heard about "Shavadun". It refers to a place situated about seven meters under the ground. In the hot and dry climate of some parts of Iran, "Shavadun" is the best solution, providing comfort for the occupants. In this paper, first we introduce this architectural space according to some case studies in that context. Then we consider some other characteristics of "Shavadun", such as dimensions, temperature, ventilation, and daylight. We focus on the benefits of "Shavadun" as a place for escaping from the hot summer days. Finally we propose ecological solutions based on the principals employed in designing "Shavadun", which can be integrated into today's buildings. The aim of this challenge is to use the wisdom of the past to meet the requirements of the current building, while retaining the positive cultural and environmental aspects of vernacular design.

AB  - This paper presents a detailed study on the seismic pattern of the state of Karnataka and also quantifies the seismic hazard for the entire state. In the present work, historical and instrumental seismicity data for Karnataka (within 300 km from Karnataka political boundary) were compiled and hazard analysis was done based on this data. Geographically, Karnataka forms a part of peninsular India which is tectonically identified as an intraplate region of Indian plate. Due to the convergent movement of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate, movements are occurring along major intraplate faults resulting in seismic activity of the region and hence the hazard assessment of this region is very important. Apart from referring to seismotectonic atlas for identifying faults and fractures, major lineaments in the study area were also mapped using satellite data. The earthquake events reported by various national and international agencies were collected until 2009. Declustering of earthquake events was done to remove foreshocks and aftershocks. Seismic hazard analysis was done for the state of Karnataka using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches incorporating logic tree methodology. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) at rock level was evaluated for the entire state considering a grid size of 0.05A degrees x 0.05A degrees. The attenuation relations proposed for stable continental shield region were used in evaluating the seismic hazard with appropriate weightage factors. Response spectra at rock level for important Tier II cities and Bangalore were evaluated. The contour maps showing the spatial variation of PGA values at bedrock are presented in this work.

AB  - Paddlefish Polyodon spathula historically occurred in the Ohio and Allegheny River systems, extending into the headwater sections of the Allegheny River in New York and Pennsylvania. At the turn of the 19th century, paddlefish were reported in the Allegheny River near the cities of Salamanca and Olean, New York. The last published historical account of paddlefish in Pennsylvania occurred in 1919 at the mouth of the Kiskiminetas River, a major Allegheny River tributary. The demise of paddlefish in Pennsylvania and New York has been attributed to channelization, dams, gravel dredging, and water quality degradation. The construction of Kinzua Dam in 1968 prohibited paddlefish to the upper Allegheny River system. As late as 1986, paddlefish in Pennsylvania were listed as extirpated, and they continue to be classified as such in New York. In order to re-establish self-sustaining populations, Pennsylvania initiated a stocking program in 1991 in the upper Ohio and lower Allegheny rivers. In 1998, New York initiated a complimentary stocking program approximately 160 km upstream in the Allegheny Reservoir (above Kinzua Darn). A second stocking location, Conewango Creek, was added in 2006 in a relatively unaltered section of the historic range. Free ranging adult paddlefish were captured by gill nets and "reliable source" reports were documented in Pennsylvania and New York. No evidence of natural reproduction or year-class structure has been documented in either state. Pennsylvania plans to increase the size of stocked fish and New York plans to increase stocking densities as hatchery space permits. Both states will continue to monitor and assess the reintroduction of paddlefish to the upper Ohio River basin.

AB  - Artificial groundwater recharge has several applications, including preventing the subsidence that takes place due to pumping. The investigations show that whenever the average of recharge in a year is more than pumping, we do not have any lowering of the groundwater level. But if recharge is less than the pumping and if the characteristics of the soil are suitable, land subsidence can occur. Investigations in the central regions of Kerman, a city in southern Iran, show that although we observe the groundwater level is rising, we unexpectedly have settlement. Ordinarily, the rise of groundwater level will increase the pore water pressure and decrease the effective stress, so subsidence will not occur. A possible explanation for the subsidence that occurs when groundwater levels are rising is the seepage forces generated by downward flowing water in the unsaturated zone. As we demonstrate, the vertical movement of water and the infiltration of water through unsaturated soil imparts forces to the soil, and when the flow direction is downward, the forces should add to effective stresses. Inclusion of unsaturated zone processes makes the problem more complicated, and taking them into account involves a coupled problem that is not amenable to analytical solutions. In this paper, with some simplifications, we show that the coupled problem should be considered in evaluating the effect of recharge on subsidence and that for artificial recharge, the rate of recharge should be considered. The resulting effective stresses can sometimes be greater than expected.

AB  - Metropolitan Water District (Metropolitan) is a public agency charged with providing its service area with adequate and sufficient supplies of high quality water. Metropolitan was incorporated in 1928 by an Act of the California Legislature to serve its 13 original founding Member Agencies. Today, Metropolitan provides water to 26 cities and water agencies serving more than 19 million people in six counties in Southern California. On average Metropolitan delivers 1.7 billion gallons of water per day. California, the third-largest state in the U.S. by land area, has a diverse geography including foggy coastal areas, alpine mountain ranges, hot and arid deserts, and a fertile central valley. California is also the mast populous state, exceeding 37 million people in 2010. California's large population drives the interlinked demands for water and energy in the state. The water-energy nexus in California is highlighted by the fact that two-thirds of the population resides in Southern California while two-thirds of the state's precipitation occurs in Northern California. Separating Southern California from the rest of the state is a series of east-west trending mountain ranges. Water conveyance projects have been constructed to address this north-south water imbalance and to also import supplies from the Colorado River, hundreds of miles east of Southern California population centers. The movement of water on this scale requires significant energy resources. The California Energy Commission (CEC) estimates that water-related energy use consumes 19% of the state's electricity and 30% of its natural gas usage every year, and demand is growing. Energy management is a critical concern to Metropolitan and other California water agencies. These issues drive water and energy leaders to jointly manage energy and water use to ensure long-term mutual benefits.

AB  - The hydrologically and the environmentally degraded situation of the Dead Sea is reflected by the hydrogeological situation in the Upper and Lower Jordan Valley and the surrounding basin of the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea, with a drainage area of around 42,200 km(2), is mainly fed by the Jordan River from the north and from side wadis in the east and west. With a surface runoff from 1,000 mio m(3)/year ( before 1950) to less than 200 mio m(3)/year nowadays, it is clear why the water level in the Dead Sea is lowering and its surface is declining. Due to the continuous decrease of water runoff into the Jordan Valley and the side wadis, the surface water level of the Dead Sea is declined by around 1 m a year, and this caused more than 25 m decline of the Dead Sea level in the last 30 years. Geoelectric sounding measurements by Jordanian research teams showed that areas underlying the coastal aquifers formerly occupied by the Dead Sea water are gradually becoming flushed and occupied by fresh water. The latter is becoming salinized due to the residuals of Dead Sea salted water in the aquifer matrix, showing a lower salinity than that of the Dead Sea water. The salt dissolution from the Lisan Marl formation through the surface and groundwater movement is causing collapses along the shorelines in form of sinkholes. These sinkholes are tens of meters in diameter and depth and cause damages to roads, parks and agriculture areas. The sinkholes are threatening the increased urban and touristic activities in the Dead Sea area. The activities of the mineral extraction industry and the increasing of needed fresh water supply for the tourism and agriculture and urban development exploit the resources of the Dead Sea without consideration of the natural needs of the Dead Sea. Without any dramatic change of the present unsustainable development policies of the Dead Sea area, a tragedy ending by drying of the Dead Sea will be the consequence in less than a century. The Planned Red - Dead Sea project can be a solution to ease the deteriorating situation of the Dead Sea.

AB  - Understanding the ontogenetic habitat linkages of sharks is important for conservation and managing human interactions. We used acoustic telemetry, catch data, elemental and stable isotope signatures and dietary analyses to investigate ontogenetic habitat use in south-east Queensland, Australia, by the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, a IUCN 'near-threatened' species that is implicated in many shark attacks on humans in urban estuaries. Sequential analyses for delta N-15 and delta C-13 of vertebrae from five adult C. leucas and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) for elemental composition from 23 C. leucas, including a pregnant female, were also used to trace ontogenetic habitat dependence. Acoustic telemetry indicated large juvenile and subadult C. leucas remained in estuarine habitats. delta N-15 values across shark vertebrae showed an ontogenetic shift in diet with total length (TL), confirmed by stomach contents. LA-ICPMS data reflected the ontogenetic movements of C. leucas from natal habitats. Differences among adults were gender related. Shifts in habitat use by subadults were correlated with a sigmoidal delta C-13 relationship with TL. C. leucas have a multipartite, stage-specific dependency in their transition between habitats along the freshwater-estuarine-marine continuum, making them particularly susceptible to the habitat alteration that is occurring globally.

AB  - Recent research has provided a high-resolution map that depicts the effect of land subsidence on the Venice coastal plain of Italy. The map, which covers the decade of 1992 to 2002, was obtained by an innovative "Subsidence Integrated Monitoring System" (SIMS), which efficiently merges the different displacement measurements obtained by high precision-leveling, differential and continuous Global Positing System data (GPS), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based interferometry. The displacement rates exhibit significant spatial variability, ranging from a slight 1 to 2 mm/yr uplift, to a serious subsidence of more than 10 mm/yr. This paper aims to describe the many natural and anthropogenic mechanisms that drive the pattern of the ground displacement. The movement sources are presented based on their depth of occurrence. Deep causes act at depths generally greater than 400 m below m.s.l. (mean sea level), and are recognizable in the movement of the pre-Quaternary basement. Medium causes act at depths between 400 and 50 m below m.s.l., and include geological features, such as a major presence of compressible clay layers in the southern and northern portions of the study area and groundwater withdrawals, mainly in the north-eastern coastland and western mainland. Shallow causes, i.e. those occurring from a depth of 50 m up to the ground surface, are related to the architecture and geomechanical properties of the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, which are more thick and compressible approaching the littoral belt; geochemical compaction, due to the increasing salt concentration in the clayey sediments: and oxidation of the outcropping organic soils drained by land reclamation. These two latter factors primarily involve the southern portion of the Venice coast. The building loads in newly developed areas also cause local compaction of shallow deposits. We conclude that the consolidation of Holocene deposits and anthropogenic activities (groundwater withdrawal, land reclamation. and urban land use) are the major factors that contribute to the present land subsidence in the Venice coastland.

AB  - The fire and rescue service is undoubtedly one of the best organised functional units of the state. Its importance still increases in case of incident occurrence. The preparation for the occurrence and control of an incident is always desirable. In the majority of cases, the preparation is carried out in the framework of civil emergency preparedness of various subjects that may influence the security of territorial units and their infrastructures. It is potable and firefighting water distribution systems in towns and municipalities that belong to the most significant systems in relation to the fire and rescue service. Their optimum function can very often decide about the health and life of citizens and simultaneously the amount of material damage caused by fires. In the case of simultaneous occurrences of two or more incidents in the public and the technical infrastructure, a critical situation endangering the standard expected activity of intervening brigades may arise. The text of the contribution shows how to determine and eliminate the given natural and anthropogenic risks to an acceptable level.

AB  - There are thousands of laws and regulations in the United States, ranging from the local to the state to the federal level. The sheer number of laws increases the probability that some of these laws may contradict each other. In recent years in the City of Portland, many controversial instances of police officers using force have occurred. In this project we used formal verification and robot programming techniques to validate and find contradictions in laws that govern police use of force. We constructed a model of police officers and bystanders in a robot "game" using the NuSMV software and development language. Temporal logic, which uses a subset of modal logic, along with predicate calculus is used to produce a computational logic tree, which simulates all possibilities in the model. Robot movement is used to model state evolution. We inserted statutes and case law into our model to dictate the behaviors of the actors, in the process developing a formal method of translating laws into operational predicate modal logic clauses. Finally, we run a process to check through the computation tree to find contradictions. Our final results found several contradictions, some of them obvious enough to be used as argument in real court cases, and suggest the legal code should be seriously cleaned up so as to prevent confusion and uncertainty. Our work also suggests that formal verification techniques can be applied to drug laws, tax laws, and other legal venues.

Soil Sci. 89: 611-622. The characteristics and landscape distribution of Histic Dystric Turbic Cryosols were examined oil a steep (>30%) northerly slope in the unglaciated Klondike Plateau, near Dawson City, Yukon Territory. Based oil texture, major element geochemistry, and clay mineralogy, the mineral parent materials were crudely stratified, with a silty material of likely aeolian origin overlying sandy gravelly colluvium. Discontinuous organic matter-enriched horizons occurred 50 cm or more below the active layer, and contained abundant partially decomposed plant detritus. Eight accelerator radiocarbon dates, ranging from 350 +/- 40 to 3680 +/- 40 C-14 years BP, Suggested that incorporation of organic materials within and below the active layer was geologically recent, and had likely occurred by a combination of cryoturbation and slope processes. The widespread and rapid initiation of mass movements on slopes containing pemafrost that followed forest fires in 2004 on the Klondike Plateau may be an analogue for the processes that contributed to organic matter burial in these Cryosols. These soils may represent a significant reservoir of C, as similar sites Occupy at least 15% of a representative portion of the Plateau. This reservoir may be vulnerable to mobilization if future climatic warming increases the frequency of forest fires and resulting slope instability.

AB  - Temperature and smoke spread in the early stage of a fire were modeled, using computational fluid dynamic techniques, and compared with data obtained from field tests conducted in an operating roadway tunnel in the City of Montreal, Canada. Fire characteristics, including temperatures and smoke spread over the tunnel were measured during these tests. Two types of fire scenarios were simulated: gasoline pool fires under vehicles and gasoline pool fires behind vehicles. The estimated fire size used in the simulations was 650 kW. The initial and boundary conditions of each simulation were set to mimic the conditions of the corresponding test. Comparisons were made to temperature and smoke optical density measurements. In general, favourable comparisons between the numerical predictions and the experimental data were observed. The ceiling temperature downstream of the fire decreased with an increase in the distance from the fire source, which is also the case for smoke optical density. The ceiling temperatures produced by the fire behind the vehicle were higher than those produced by the fire under the vehicle. The temperature variation along the central cross section of the tunnel shows that the highest ceiling temperature occurs 3 similar to 5 m downstream of the fire because the plume was tilted by the airflow inside the tunnel. Fire location had a significant impact on ceiling temperature development in the tunnel. The airflow conditions at the fire location significantly affect smoke and temperature distributions in the tunnel which will also affect the performance of detection systems.

AB  - This study was designed to describe the status of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Ethiopia, through analysis of FMD outbreak reports and the detection of antibodies, to address the possibility of establishing a disease-free zone. Serum samples collected from cattle between 2003 and 2006 for the serosurveillance of rinderpest were used for this study. The records of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development from 2002 to 2006 indicate that FMD outbreaks occurred each year in Ethiopia during this period, with the highest number in 2004, when 134 outbreaks took place. The highest rates were from the North Shoa zones of both the Oromia and Amhara regions.
   The serum samples were tested using the 3ABC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, to identify antibodies against FMD. From a total of 4,465 sera, 10.5% (n = 467) tested positive. The highest seroprevalence was detected in samples from the Eastern zone of Tigray with 41.5%; followed by the Guji zone of Oronnia and Yeka district of the city of Addis Ababa, with 32.7% and 30%, respectively. Antibodies specific to FMD virus were not detected in Gambella or Benishangul. The effects of cattle, sheep and goat density, both separately and together, were analysed with a spatial regression model, but did not have a significant effect on seroprevalence. This indicates that other factors, such as farming systems and livestock movement, play a significant role in the occurrence of FMD. Based on these study findings, it might be appropriate to establish disease-free zones in Gambella and Benishangul.

AB  - Objectives: To study bowel patterns (function/habits) and its associated variables in an adult Saudi population.
   Methods: In a cross sectional study, a 21-item questionnaire on bowel function (habits and frequency) was distributed to 10,000 high school students from all 5 regions of Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, between February and April 2011. The randomly selected students, and 2 of their household or family members completed the questionnaire. Socio-demographic characteristics, eating habits, chronic diseases, and medications used were studied.
   Result: Sixty-one percent (N=4918) were above the age of 16 years, of which 51.5% were males, and 88.1% were Saudis. It was observed that 18.1% of respondents perceived their bowel movements as being irregular and abnormal. There was no association between gender and abnormal/irregular bowel movement (OR: 0.89;p=0.13). Individuals over 60 years suffered from bowel pattern abnormalities (OR=1.8; p=0.01). Educational status (secondary), occupation (teacher and unemployed), diet habits, and chronic diseases of study subjects were also statistically significantly associated with their bowel movements. Respondents consuming more vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy products, and rice had significantly more normal bowel movements. Females tended to defecate less frequently as compared with males (p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of both genders have bowel movements at least once a day.
   Conclusion: Our results may serve as a baseline for appropriate intervention strategies, and also for future studies to substantiate, negate, or add more observations/ conclusions.

KW  - 1939.-1941.
AB  - The paper presents the state of affairs in this area in the period between 1939 and September 1941. Several important issues are discussed here: the state of affairs within the local units of the Croatian Peasant Party on the eve of World War Two; the early days of the development of the Ustasha movement; poor economy; the state of affairs during the April War; Italian occupation; the state of affairs after the Roman Treaties; the establishment of the Ustasha government; the Ustasha terrorism and its widespread impact; the acceptance of the Independent State of Croatia amongst the people (presented through a survey of the press), etc.
   The said issues are analysed thoroughly. The analysis shows that the Croatian Peasant Party, which had formerly been the strongest political power in the District, was cut to less than a half after the establishment of the Ustasha government; this was the result of a significant number of its distinguished members having joined the Ustasha movement and taken active part at high functions in the newly-established Ustasha government bodies. A minor part of senior members remained loyal to the party leadership and Dr. Vladko Macek. There were almost no so-called left party members, save for some exceptions in Zupa dubrovacka and particularly on the Peljesac Peninsula. The Ustasha movement started developing in 1939, and by 10 April 1941, it had gradually and continually become stronger, thanks to receiving a considerable amount of support from the organisation called Krizarsko bratstvo (the Brotherhood of the Crusaders).
   Italian occupation, which took place on 17 April 1941, interrupted many plans the Ustasha members had regarding the reinforcement of their power. The Italians intended to stay in this area and annex it; this particularly terrified the Ustasha members. However, pursuant to the Roman Treaties, the Dubrovnik area was included in the Independent State of Croatia. The Italians left the so-called Second occupational zone, while the eastern part of Herzegovina (Capljina, Ravno, Ljubinje, Stolac, Gacko and Trebinje), together with the Peljesac Peninsula, entered Velika zupa Dubrava (the Great County of Dubrava), with the seat in Dubrovnik. The Italian Army and its command remained in the area, but the civil and military powers were handed over to the Independent State of Croatia.
   The Ustasha government managed neither to become consolidated nor to function normally in the area of Velika zupa Dubrava. The reasons for it were the following: the uprising of Serbs in the eastern part of Herzegovina; the discordance between the civil authorities, concentrated in Velika zupa Dubrava, and the Ustasha movement, which operated via the Ustasha headquarters and camps. Government officials interfered against the law into the civil affairs, weakening thereby its efficiency in implementing the laws. This happened mainly due to the fact that the Ustasha members arrested, imprisoned, sent to camps and killed Serbs, Jews, Yugoslav nationalists, communists and Croats who had been disloyal and who had refused to collaborate. By the end of August 1941, the relations had due to the inflamed uprising in Herzegovina escalated to such an extent that they had threatened the security of both the occupational regime and the Ustasha government. Hence, Italy decided to reoccupy the Second zone, where it repeteadly introduced the civil and military powers.
   The paper rests on original materials, so far mainly unpublished, as well as on the published memoirist writings and the press of that time. The memoirist literature (thoroughly analysed and verified) was used in the absence of original materials. The described events are presented in chronological order, divided by the issues tackled; the internal integration method was applied in their presentation.
   The results arising from this paper show particular features that did not occur in the wider area of Dalmatia and were specifically linked with the state of affairs within the Croatian Peasant Party and the Ustasha movement. The main conclusion is that during three months of its existence, the Ustasha government, established in the Dubrovnik District, managed to become neither consolidated nor reinforced; while disposing of as much power as the command of the Italian Army allowed it. It enjoyed a considerable amount of support from the former authorities of the Banovina of Croatia. It however enjoyed markedly less power outside of Dubrovnik than in the city of Dubrovnik itself; there, the majority of the intellectual elite joined it, and in particular many attorneys-at-law.

TI  - Structural control for the emplacement of veins and felsic domes in the Zacatecas mining district, Mexico
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
LA  - Spanish
AB  - The Zacatecas mining district was considered one of the most important silver deposits from colonial times until the end of the XIX century; mining operations are currently attractive, as they have found new sites with profitable economic mineralization. The study area is located north of the city of Zacatecas, where marine Triassic sequences, volcano-sedimentary deposits of the Early Cretaceous, clastic and volcanic rocks of the Eocene crop out. The Mesozoic rocks were affected by at least two stages of compressive deformation associated with folding and reverse faulting, which caused imbrication of most of the sequence. These deformation events occurred mainly during the Cretaceous and early Tertiary and are more conspicuous in the volcano-sedimentary deposits. After the last compressive event of the Laramide orogeny, a transtensive deformation phase dissected the mountain into five blocks separated by La Cantera, Mala Noche; Veta Grande, Panuco and Casa de Cerros faults. In this paper we propose a model for the emplacement of the veins and felsic domes of the Zacatecas mining district based on structural control by transtensional and extensional movement. The fault and vein systems have an echelon arrangement with development of reidel fractures and horsetail patterns at fault terminations. Movement along the faults is supported by kinematic indicators on the fault planes, where there are two overlapping sets of grooves: one horizontal (dextral) and one oblique. This suggests that a second event of normal faulting took place along the rupture planes generated during the first event (lateral). First stage faults and fractures provided conduits for mineralization in the principal veins and the ascent of felsic dikes and domes. The second fault reactivation event was normal-left oblique, which is evident in La Cantera fault and corresponds to the second stage of mineralization. The Bufa dome was emplaced in the dilation zone of this fault during the first stage of activity, and was later affected by hydrothermal events during extension, causing alteration (argilization and silicification) in the fault zone. The ore bodies are found mainly in dilation zones of the four main fault steps formed by transtension.
   The study area is located within Basin and Range Province, and is characterized by the presence of basins, half grabens, and horsts developed mainly during the Oligocene. Faults that dissected the Zacatecas range have an average orientation of N60 degrees W, coinciding with the system known as San Luis-Tepehuanes.

AB  - The coastal population of the black-headed dwarf chameleon Bradypodion melanocephalum in KwaZulu-Natal appears to be centred on the eThekwini Municipal Area, which is experiencing rapid urban development. This population occurs in few statutory protected areas, all of which are small. In order to conserve successfully the coastal population in KwaZulu-Natal, knowledge of its geographic range and location of potentially suitable habitat is required. Bradypodion melanocephalum was until recently known mainly from Durban, with isolated records from areas to the north and south. A cartographic model was used to estimate the distribution of the coastal population in KwaZulu-Natal. The model predictions were ground-truthed, and the model was found to have a positive predictive power of 0.57 and a negative predictive power of 0.84. The relatively low positive predictive power of the model appeared related to habitat management that is not appropriate for the conservation of B. melanocephalum. The geographic range was then estimated using a Maxent model to predict climate suitability while at the same time taking cognizance of a dispersal barrier, the output of which was further refined in a geographic information system to exclude areas of unsuitable landcover. The variables included in the final model were mean daily minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean daily maximum relative humidity of the coldest month. Both these variables relate to dew formation in the dry winter period, and dew appears to be a critical water source for B. melanocephalum during winter. The Maxent model estimates greater probabilities Of Occurrence towards the coast, where rapid urbanisation is occurring. This urbanisation is one of the threats to the survival of the coastal population of Bradypodion melanocephalum. The utility of translocation of B. melanocephalum to areas that will not be developed within a development site in comparison to translocation off-site as mitigation to ensure the conservation of the coastal population in rapidly urbanizing areas needs to be investigated further.

AB  - Objective To assess the nature and prevalence of genetic discrimination experienced by people at risk for Huntington's disease who had undergone genetic testing or remained untested.
   Design Cross sectional, self reported survey.
   Setting Seven genetics and movement disorders clinics servicing rural and urban communities in Canada.
   Participants 233 genetically tested and untested asymptomatic people at risk for Huntington's disease (response rate 80%): 167 underwent testing (83 had the Huntington's disease mutation, 84 did not) and 66 chose not to be tested.
   Main outcome measures Self reported experiences of genetic discrimination and related psychological distress based on family history or genetic test results.
   Results Discrimination was reported by 93 respondents (39.9%). Reported experiences occurred most often in insurance (29.2%), family (15.5%), and social (12.4%) settings. There were few reports of discrimination in employment (6.9%), health care (8.6%), or public sector settings (3.9%). Although respondents who were aware that they carried the Huntington's disease mutation reported the highest levels of discrimination, participation in genetic testing was not associated with increased levels of genetic discrimination. Family history of Huntington's disease, rather than the result of genetic testing, was the main reason given for experiences of genetic discrimination. Psychological distress was associated with genetic discrimination (P<0.001).
   Conclusions Genetic discrimination was commonly reported by people at risk for Huntington's disease and was a source of psychological distress. Family history, and not genetic testing, was the major reason for genetic discrimination.

AB  - The structure and stratigraphy of the Chapais-Chibougamau mining camp in the Archean Abitibi greenstone belt of the Superior Craton, Quebec, Canada, is reevaluated from new aeromagnetic data, geochronology, and field studies to provide a framework for syngenetic and epigenetic mineralization. Mineralization in the Chapais-Chibougamau area is synvolcanic (volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS)), synmagmatic (Fe-Ti-V, Ni-Cu, Au-Ag-Cu-Zn-Pb veins, Chibougamau-type Cu-An veins), and shear zone hosted (including Opemiska Cu-Au veins subtype). VMS deposits occur within felsic volcanic rocks of tholeiitic affinity and mafic to felsic volcanic rocks of transitional to calc-alkaline affinity at the top of three volcanic cycles of the Roy Group. VMS deposits and early polymetallic veins (Au-Ag-Cu-Zn-Pb) are associated with NNW- to NNE-striking synvolcanic faults. Fe-Ti-V deposits occur within the Layered zone of the Lac Dore Complex, especially where it thickens in areas of interpreted synmagmatic faults, Subeconomic magmatic Ni-Cu deposits occur at the contacts of mafic-ultramafic or tonalitic intrusions. "Chibougamau-type" Cu-Au veins formed through magmatic-hydrothermal processes. They are cut by dikes that predate regional D-2 deformation but are located within, and are deformed by, NW- and NE-trending D-2 shear zones. Shear zone-hosted Au deposits are developed preferentially within regicmal E-W-trending deformation corridors and along NNE-striking sinistral shear zones while "Opemiska-type" Cu-Au veins occur within regional overturned anticlines in mafic sills of the Cummings Complex.
   U-Pb dating of detrital zircons provides maximum depositional ages for metasedimentary rocks of the Blondeau Formation of the Roy Group and the Stella Formation of the Opemisca Group (which unconformably overlies the Roy Group). The Blondeau Formation is <2721 +/- 3 Ma, which is coeval to the age of the Windfall Member in the Urban-Barry Belt. Both show similar exploration potential as they host early polymetallic (Au-Ag-Cu-Zn-Pb) veins. The Stella Formation is <2704 +/- 2 Ma and is unaffected by first generation folds, thus providing a time constraint for the earliest folding event (D-1). This new age also indicates that sedimentation in the Chapais-Chibougamau area occurred earlier than for the Timiskarning-type assemblages in the southern Abitibi greenstone belt, but the structural setting and presence of alkaline intrusions suggests similar potential for syenite-associated An deposits in the Stella Formation.

AB  - Alien species are intentionaly or unintetionaly introduced species into new area. When an alien species succefully invades and impacts a new ecosystem it becomes an invasive species. Until today, 109 invasive insects on woody plants (57 from North America, 52 form Asia) have been introduced and established in forest ecosystems in Europe (MATTSON et al. 2007). Introduction and dispersal of new species is increasing from year to year due to globalization of trade and ever increasing tourist traffic between continents. The aim of this research was to identify most important alien and invasive insect species in Croatian forests and give an estimate od their damage and prognosis of their future spread.
   The research has lasted for 5 years (2006 to 2010) and potential host plants in continental, submediterranean and mediterranean parts of Croatia were researched. For each invasive species found a prognosis for their future spread and damages is given according to their biology, ecology, researches on natural enemies and data from the literature.
   Seven (7) insects species from the orders Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera were found and they can be cosidered as alien or invasive species in Croatian forest ecosystems (Table 1). For each insect species a host plant, locality where the insect was found and prognosis of damage on the scale from 1 to 4 (1-no influence on host plant, 4-serious forest pest) is given.
   Parectopa robiniella, Phyllonorycter robiniella, Phyllonorycter issiki, Obolodiplosis robiniae, Leptoglossus occidentalis, Metcalfa pruinosa, Dryocosmus kuriphilus are alien or invasive insects established in Croatian forests. Introduction and spread of these species and their intensity of occurence has been very similar to the same pattern of spread and occurence in other Europaean countries. Several other invasive species on woody ornamental plants in urban areas have also been recorded in Croatia: Phyllonorycter leucographella, Dasineura gleditchiae, Argyresthia thuiella, Cameraria ohridella, Anoplophora chinensis.
   Knowledge on insect origin, biology, ecology pathways of introduction and spreading are very important for providing pest risk analysis and making relevant prognosis of dangers that a new pest is posing for forest ecosystems.

AB  - Mine tailings are an environmental problem in Southern Spain because wind and water erosion of bare surfaces results in the dispersal of toxic metals over nearby urban or agricultural areas. Revegetation with tolerant native species may reduce this risk. We grew two grasses, Lygeum spartum and Piptatherum miliaceum, and the crop species Cicer arietinum (chickpea) under controlled conditions in pots containing a mine tailings mixed into non-polluted soil to give treatments of 0%, 25%,50%,75% and 100% mine tailings. We tested a neutral (pH 7.4) mine tailings which contained high concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. Water extractable metal concentrations increased in proportion to the amount of tailings added. The biomass of the two grasses decreased in proportion to the rate of neutral mine-tailing addition, while the biomass of C. arietinum only decreased in relation to the control treatment. Neutron radiography revealed that root development of C. arietinum was perturbed in soil amended with the neutral tailings compared to those of the control treatment, despite a lack of toxicity symptoms in the shoots. In all treatments and for all metals, the plants accumulated higher concentrations in the roots than in shoots. The highest concentrations occurred in the roots of P. miliaceum (2500 mg kg(-1) Pb, 146 mg kg(-1) Cd. 185 mg kg(-1) Cu, 2700 mg kg(-1) Zn). C. arietinum seeds had normal concentrations of Zn (70-90 mg kg(-1)) and Cu (6-9 mg kg(-1)). However, the Cd concentration in this species was similar to 1 mg kg(-1) in the seeds and 14.5 mg kg(-1) in shoots. Consumption of these plant species by cattle and wild fauna may present a risk of toxic metals entering the food chain. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This text deals with the poetics of Bohumil Hrabal, using it as a starting point for an exploration of the changes that occurred in his writing after the Second World War, with particular attention given to the techniques of collage and montage. The aim is to seize the gradual modifications of these forms, originating from the historical avant-garde movement, in the period after 1945, as well as to analyze the ways in which these techniques disrupt traditional narrative forms. A new definition of narration may be found in the fragmentary urban language explored in the experimental texts of Claude Simon and Bohumil Hrabal as well as in the cut-ups of William Burroughs and Brion Gysin. We could call the form used in the analyzed collages and montages conceptual mimesis. It corresponds indeed to the need for expressing the crisis of civilisation caused by the traumas of the War and at the same time shows the ethically problematic relationship between art and reality during this period. This potential danger is dealt with in different ways by each artist. The cut -ups of Burroughs and Gysin choose a wild arbitrariness, reflecting, in their opinion, the nature of the experience of contemporary reality. Simon finds the answer in refined formal play, gradually tainted more and more with historical reflection. The emphasis on historical memory is the strongest in Hrabal's collages which are able to connect ethics and aesthetics. Moreover, the historical dimension of his experimental texts excludes too great a lingering on purely aesthetic questions.

AB  - Considerable literature supports the desirability of studying individuals in the context of their immediate social unit, the household. Focused studies of household composition reveal that households in economically disadvantaged populations with low homeownership rates are particularly likely to experience additions, subtractions, and substitutions among members. This article examines the methodological challenges associated with defining, tracking, and explaining mobility at the household level. We describe a retro-active approach for linking individual household members across waves that was employed for the Making Connections survey, a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of 10 low-income urban communities. Our method involved comparing individuals at three different points in time using a combination of probabilistic matching software, data queries, and human review. The process produced personal identifiers that could be integrated with the household-level data to identify changes beyond numerical shifts in household size. We use the combined data to examine mobility across a gradient of stability in household composition. Our work advances past studies in two ways. First, our definition of adding or losing individuals is calculated based on the presence or absence of a specific person, rather than numerical change in the number of adults and children in the household. Second, we demonstrate a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of household mobility by examining various types of change in household composition-gaining, losing, or replacing individuals, or being repopulated entirely with new occupants-in combination with physical relocation during a 6-year period. A series of maps compares the patterns of residential movement and household composition change within a specific territory.

AB  - The genearation, occurrence and development of Wenchuan M(s)8. 0 great earthquake was the product of decomposition, adjustment and movement of the deep material. Therefore, two profiles of crustal thickness M are obtained by using the data of Bouguer gravity anomalies. The deep crustal structures around Longmen Shan mountain fault system and its adjacent area are obtained. Meanwhile, the theoretic isostatic crustal thickness D are obtained according to Airy's isostatic theory, to research the crustal isostatic state in Sichuan Basin, Longmen Shan, Qionglai Shan and western Sichuan mountains area. After that, the distributions of D and M in this area are compared mutually. The results indicated that Longmen Shan orogenic zone is in a very non-isostatic state, i. e., the crust is in a unstable state. There obvious differences between the orogenic zone and its north-west or south-east parts are existed. The precise deep structure, effect of gravity field and isostatic compensation must be researched, for the study of the relationship of gravity field effect and strong earthquakes. This research result may provide deep factors for the selection of location, re-construction of buildings, layout of towns and villages after earthquake.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the incidence, impact, and consequences of accountant and lawyer bankruptcies in Victorian Scotland. The paper examines these bankruptcies in the context of an emerging profession separating from an established legal profession as part of the rise of professionalism in the Victorian Age.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports data describing 135 accountant and 361 lawyer bankruptcies declared between 1855 and 1904. It uses theories of the rise of professionalism, signals of movement to occupational ascendancy, and social attitudes to money to provide explanations of the incidence, impact, and consequences of these bankruptcies. The paper also examines bankruptcy and the early disciplinary codes of professional accountancy associations.
   Findings - Despite a trend of general decline in total, accountant, and lawyer bankruptcies in Scotland through the Victorian Age, there is no consistency over time between accountant and lawyer bankruptcies and economic conditions. Bankrupt accountants were typically unregulated as professionals in contrast with bankrupt lawyers who were usually regulated. Accountant and lawyer bankruptcies predominantly involved experienced practitioners, location in major cities, and administration by professional accountants. Bankruptcy was associated with criminal activity in a minority of cases in each profession. There was inconsistency in the post-bankruptcy disciplining of bankrupt accountants and lawyers, and post-bankruptcy loss of economic status in both professions.
   Practical implications - The paper contributes to the Victorian history of institutionalised professions such as accounting and law. It demonstrates the presence of marginal practitioners in emerging and established professions, the need to study professionalisation in social context, and the impact of bankruptcy on discipline in an emerging profession.
   Originality/value - The paper represents the first contextualised study of bankruptcy among professionals generally and accountants and lawyers, particularly in the Victorian Age.

AB  - In the last two decades hazard maps (HM) have established as one of the major tools for risk assessment and urban planning in alpine regions. During this time, various efforts and methodical adjustments could be recognized that significantly supported reliability and applicability of HM. All those adjustments are based upon the fundamental Swiss system of geological hazard assessment and mitigation, the so called BUWAL, which is by now considered to be the main fundament for the elaboration of HM in alpine areas. One of the last problems that can be regarded as almost unsolved in terms of a local hazard zoning and elaboration of HM is the integration of large deep-seated and creeping mass movements (i.e. "Talzuschub", "Sackung") in these maps. The classification of hazard zones that are to be depicted by the HM according to BUWAL requires the assessment of "intensity" and "probability of occurrence" as basic information. But since intensity appears to be irrelevant for the classification of those phenomena ( intensity is only determined by velocity [ rate] as moving rock mass [volumina] and depth of surface of rupture always correspond to a "high"-grade intensity) and thus probability of occurrence is the main parameter for classification respective the BUWAL matrix, it becomes obvious, that existing methods have to be completed by different approaches. Sound research, published in various papers during the last decades, showed that almost every slope movement takes place in correspondence to the theories of "accelerating creep", no matter if one regards falls, topples, slides or a spreads in bedrock or soils. Thus, the application of mathematically based concepts of creep theory in combination with suitable codes of numerical modelling and targeted monitoring systems as fundament for data collection in addition to intensive geological field works seems to be such a different and promising approach for integrating large deep-seated and creeping mass movements in a regional HM. This article introduces the research project "Talzuschub Algund" that makes use of this multi-based concept, also discussing requirements, chances and constraints of the accelerating-creep-theories for elaboration of HM and time related forecasts / predictions in the sense of the BUWAL-matrix. The project was established in 2007 by the Office for Geology and Building Material Testing of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano in close cooperation with the Chair for Engineering Geology of the Technische Universitat Munchen.

AB  - The effectiveness of emissions control programs designed to reduce concentrations of airborne particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in California's San Joaquin Valley was studied in the year 2030 under three growth scenarios: low, medium, and high population density. Base-case inventories for each choice of population density were created using a coupled emissions modeling system that simultaneously considered interactions between land use and transportation, area source, and point source emissions. The ambient PM2.5 response to each combination of population density and emissions control was evaluated using a regional chemical transport model over a 3-week winter stagnation episode. Comparisons between scenarios were based on regional average and population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations. In the absence of any emissions control program, population-weighted concentrations of PM2.5 in the future San Joaquin Valley are lowest under growth scenarios that emphasize low population density. A complete ban on wood burning and a 90% reduction in emissions from food cooking operations and diesel engines must occur before medium-to high-density growth scenarios result in lower population-weighted concentrations of PM2.5. These trends partly reflect the fact that existing downtown urban cores that naturally act as anchor points for new high-density growth in the San Joaquin Valley are located close to major transportation corridors for goods movement. Adding growth buffers around transportation corridors had little impact in the current analysis, since the 8-km resolution of the chemical transport model already provided an artificial buffer around major emissions sources.
   Assuming that future emissions controls will greatly reduce or eliminate emissions from residential wood burning, food cooking, and diesel engines, the 2030 growth scenario using "as-planned" (medium) population density achieves the lowest population-weighted average PM2.5 concentration in the future San Joaquin Valley during a severe winter stagnation event.
   Implications: The San Joaquin Valley is one of the most heavily polluted air basins in the United States that are projected to experience strong population growth in the coming decades. The best plan to improve air quality in the region combines medium-or high-density population growth with rigorous emissions controls. In the absences of controls, high-density growth leads to increased population exposure to PM2.5 compared with low-density growth scenarios (urban sprawl).

AB  - IBERL, Katerina. A few remarques upon the Russian Orthodox parish of Bratislava in the years 1924-1945, in the context of the Russian exile conditions. His. toricky casopis, 2012, 60, I, pp. 49-75, Bratislava.
   The spiritual life of the Russian Orthodox community in Bratislava 1924-1945 represents - in contrast to the monastery of St. Hiob in Ladomirova in North-Eastern Slovakia - a hardly known chapter at the cross-point of Slovakian and Russian history. About 25,000 emigres from Russia found shelter in Czechoslovakia as a consequence of the Bolshevist revolution and the debacle of the White movement. Most of the emigres came after 1921, after the Russian Relief Action of the Czechoslovak government had been launched. About 2000 persons settled scattered all over Slovakia. In Bratislava, however, the biggest Slovakian emigre centre came into being (in the 30s about 500 persons). In 1924 the Russian Orthodox parish was founded. Three Russian priests were in service there until 1945, acting not just in Bratislava but also in other Slovakian communities where Russian emigres lived. Metropolitan Evlogy (Georgievsky) appreciated their selfless work among the exiles very much. Beyond the religious function sensu stricto the Russian orthodox community of Bratislava organized charity aid for needy fellow-countrymen in the city. During World War II, the work of Bratislavian parishioners extended significantly, including Russian citizens from the occupied territories of the USSR as well. Bishop Sergy's possibilities, however, to visit orthodox communities of Metropolitan Evlogy's jurisdiction in Slovakia became complicated.

KW  - work-induced LBP
AB  - Background: Low Back Pain (LBP) is the most frequently reported musculoskeletal disorder in workers. This study was aimed to develop risk prediction model of low back pain that can be used to prevent the recurring low back pain attack.
   Methods: The study was case-control design based on the industrial community by using ergonomical approach. Total samples were 91 workers for cases and 91 workers for controls. Workers suffering for low back pain in the last 6 months served as cases, and those from the same age group and receiving the same amount of exposure without any symptoms of low back pain served as controls. Risk factors include socio-demographic factors, socio-ocupational factors, physical working environmental factors, non-physical environmental factors, and biomechanics factors. Receiver Operating Characreistics (ROC) was used to describe relationship between true positive value (in vertical axis) and false positive value (in horizontal axis) in order to discover a risk predictive value of LBP.
   Results: The determinant risk factors for low back pain (LBP) were bending work postures, waist rotation movement, manual lifting, unnatural work postures, those who had worked for more than 18 years, and irregular sport activities. By using ROC with 91.20% senstivity and 87.90% spesifi city, the calculated prediction value was 0.35. This is the cut-off point to discriminate workers with and without LBP. The risk predictors value of work-induced LBP calculated by linear equation of logistic regression varied between 0-11.25.
   Conclusion: The prediction model of work-induced LBP can be used for early detection of LBP to reduce the risk and prevent the recurrence of LBP.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to present an exploration of the contributions of the military organization to knowledge-based development within and beyond the boundaries of its home country
   Design/methodology/approach - After first defining knowledge, several frames of reference for considering knowledge are presented. Then the nature of contributions to societal knowledge from military organizations is explored, with a focus on leadership and values as knowledge contributions. A large part of this paper is a case study which introduces the core values of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and looks at SAF's knowledge contributions to the city-state of Singapore and Singapore's allies and regional neighbors.
   Findings - The knowledge and learning that occur in military organizations are entangled with the knowledge and learning of the country they serve, in terms of both individuals moving through the military setting and back into society and the military organization's larger knowledge contributions made in service to its citizens. Using SAF, specific examples are cited that support the movement of knowledge from the military to the public and private sectors and enhance the growth of knowledge-based development. The strong values needed for effective military defense clearly carry over to the nation's civilian needs in terms of leadership.
   Originality/value - The paper takes a unique approach to exploring the role of military organizations and personnel in knowledge-based development of the country they serve, intertwining descriptions of military values and knowledge with individual examples of leaders who move from the SAF to the public and private sectors, and stories provided by current and past SAF leaders. A new conceptual model of the relationship between moral values and knowledge is introduced.

AB  - An important component of quantifying seismic hazard and risk in regions such as Wellington is to characterise both the long-term rate of occurrence of the region's major earthquake-generating active faults, as well as potential interactions between faults (e.g., the potential for earthquake triggering). This paper describes paleoseismic data from two trenches (Ohariu Valley) and a natural streambank exposure (Horokiri valley) c. 24 km apart, which constrain the timing and size of recent surface rupture events on the northeast striking Ohariu Fault c. 6 km northwest of Wellington City. One event is recorded at all three sites and radiocarbon age constraints indicate it correlates with the 1050-1000 cal. years BP event previously identified elsewhere along the fault. A younger, smaller (decimetre-scale) event is recorded in one of the Ohariu Valley trenches, and the timing is constrained by two radiocarbon ages to post-310 cal. years BP. This event may either be a small, primary Ohariu Fault rupture, or a triggered event associated with a large earthquake on a nearby fault. If it is a triggered rupture, then a possible mechanism is dynamic triggering associated with one of the recent large-great earthquakes on the Wellington (post-300 yr), Wairarapa (AD1855), or Awatere (AD1848) Faults. Small rupture events do not necessarily contribute to the recurrence interval classification of the Ministry for the Environment Active Fault Guidelines, but they could be important for sensitive structures crossing the fault and for lifelines crossing multiple active faults.

AB  - This paper presents the field descriptions and microscopic observations of a tectonic breccia in the basement gneiss of the Cabo Frio and Arraial do Cabo areas, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and its intrusive contact with the Early Cretaceous mafic dyke. At the sea cliff close to the Ilha do Japones, there is an excellent contact outcrop between them. The tectonic breccia zone is 10 to 20m wide and has N30 degrees E direction. The breccia clasts are angular and characterized by auto-brecciation texture, and composed of breccia with similar aspect of the host tectonic breccia. The matrix is firmly consolidated by hydrothermalism and following silicification. The mafic dyke is 7 to 10m wide and of N45 degrees E direction. Along the contact, the dyke chilled margin featured by fine-grained basalt and prismatic joints can be observed. At the Conchas Beach and Arraial do Cabo city, there are four outcrops demonstrating the mafic dyke intrusion into the consolidated tectonic breccias. These outcrops prove that the tectonic breccias are older than the Early Cretaceous tholeiitic dykes. The fault breccias could have been formed during the brittle-phase tectonism of the last stage of the Pan-African Orogeny by hydrothermalism without magmatic activities, namely tectonic hydrothermalism. The existence of the clasts constituent of the breccia that are composed of breccia suggests that the fault movement and following hydrothermalism occurred repeatedly.

It took place along an N-S trending right-lateral strike-slip fault, almost near the southern end of Nyband-Gowk fault. In this study, we mapped the frequency-magnitude distribution of aftershock events spatially across the Bam aftershock zone. The b-value varies between 0.6 and 1.1 across the Bam rupture zone. The overall depth distribution of b-value in Bam aftershock zone reveals two distinct increases in b-value: (1) at depths of 8-10 km and (2) shallower than 4 km beneath the Bam city. There is no correlation between high b- value anomalies found in this study and the region of largest slip, whereas the spatial correlation between high b-value anomalies and the zone of low V (s) and high sigma (in earlier tomography study) is obvious. This correlation reveals that material properties and increasing heterogeneity are more important in controlling b-value distribution in Bam earthquake rupture zone. The high b-value anomaly near the surface of northern part of rupture zone may be related to unconsolidated and water-rich quaternary alluvial sediments and probable low-strength rocks beneath them. The high b-value anomaly at depth range 8-10 km can be correlated with fractured and fluid-filled mass, which may result from the movement of magma during Eocene volcanism in the Bam area. In this study, the induced changes in pore fluid pressure due to main shock are suggested as a mechanism for aftershock generation.

TI  - Zionist Resettlement in Palestine before the British Mandate: Socio-economic Aspect (1881-1920)
T2  - JUDAICA UKRAINICA
LA  - Ukrainian
AB  - The Zionist resettelment in Palestine in 1881-1920 is a unique experience of developing a peripheral region, which laid the foundation for its transformation into one of the centers of the modern world economy. It began and was realized, first of all, in the socio-economic sphere, and only after that - in the sphere of political relations, if we speak not about global, but about regional or local perspectives, not about a theory (Zionist), but about the concrete practice which is particular for the region. It would be quite incorrect to study this problem exceptionally in terms of colonialism, because "the Jews have never abandoned The Promised Land forever since they were banished from there by the Emperor Adrian's legionaries in the II century A. D. But before 1881 they settled in Holy land to study Torah, to pray for all people of Israel in holy cities, to live here on offerings collected for them by co-religionists all over the world, and post mortem - to be buried in this land".
   The connection of the Jews and Jewry with Palestine had never been interrupted, but from the beginning of the 1880s the resettlement in Palestine began at an absolutely different level. However, speaking about socioeconomic processes in 1881-1920, it is reasonable to speak precisely about resettlement, but not about colonization in its pure form, though the element of colonization cannot be denied. The term "resettlement" is acceptable both from the economic point of view (as the Jewish migrants were able to turn an Ottoman remote place into a busy economic region of the modern world) and from socio-political point of view, because the first settlements and economic activity are a prologue to creation of the State of Israel.
   The element of colonization was also present. Its presence can be traced both in connection of Zionist movement with the history of Europe and with the fact that Palestine was a region, colonized by Europeans since a long-ago. In the process of colonization, the European countries, undoubtedly, helped the Jews persecuted by these countries. The European world needed the "return" (the term is more socio-cultural than historical) of Palestine in the centre of the European history and policy. And it is possible to speak about symbiosis of the European policy and Zionist movement in its socio-economic sphere.
   As resettlement was occuring, the predominance of religious and economic reasons changed into political ones. The Jews no longer wanted to build a house on a foreign land and, moreover, did not want to be foreigners on the land of Biblical Israel.
   The Zionist resettlement in Palestine can be studied as a natural process of expansion of the Europocentric world. The resettlement at this stage had peaceful and legal character, laying the foundation for creation of "national home" in the years of the British Mandate.

AB  - Campi Flegrei (CF) is a large volcanic complex located west of the city of Naples, Italy. Repeated episodes of bradyseism (slow vertical ground movement) near the town of Pozzuoli have been documented since Roman times. Bradyseismic events are interpreted as the consequence of aqueous fluid exsolution during magma solidification on a slow timescale (10(3)-10(4) yr) superimposed upon a shorter (1-10 yr) timescale for the episodic expulsion of fluid from a deep (similar to 3-5 km) lithostatically-pressured low-permeability reservoir to an overlying hydrostatic reservoir. Cycles of inflation and deflation occur during short duration transient events when connectivity is established between deep and shallow hydrothermal reservoirs. The total seismic energy released (4 x 10(13) J) during the 1983-1984 bradyseismic crisis is consistent with the observed volume change (uplift) and consistent with the notion that seismic failure occurs in response to the shear stress release induced by volume change. Fluid transport and concomitant propagation of hydrofractures as fluid expands from lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure during decompression leads to ground surface displacement. Fluid decompression occurs along the fluid isenthalp (Joule-Thompson expansion) during transient periods of reservoir connectivity and leads to mineral precipitation. Each kilogram of fluid precipitates about 3 x 10(-3) kg of silica along a typical decompression path along the isenthalp. Mineral precipitation modifies the permeability and acts to reseal connection paths thereby isolating lithostatic and hydrostatic reservoirs ending one bradyseism phase and beginning another. Crystallization and exsolution of the magmatic fluid generates approximate to 7 x 10(15) J of mechanical (P Delta V) energy, and this is sufficient to accomplish the observed uplift at CF. Although magma emplacement is the ultimate origin of bradyseism, fresh recharge of magma is not a prerequisite. Instead, short to intermediate timescale phenomena associated with fluid decompression and expansion in the crust with large variations in permeability, including permeability anisotropy, are the key elements at CF.

AB  - Purpose - This paper explores the potential for innovation in a welfare service system. The focus of the paper is on the initiation stage of the innovation process. The aim of the paper is to open up the welfare service system's internal dynamics, which enables the system's ability to see things "in a new light". 'Welfare service system' refers to a complex set of interactions and adjustments that have evolved over time. It consists of various stakeholders from the public, private and third sector.
   Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework of this paper is based on complexity science. Instead of treating complexity as a problem for a welfare service system per se, complexity here serves as a 'handle concept' that is used to discover new perspectives on innovation within the context of welfare services. The empirical data was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews and workshops with leading office holders from the Social Services Department of the City of Helsinki (n=28) and executive managers of social services producer organizations (n=14) in the Helsinki region.
   Originality/value - Complexity thinking gained popularity in the social sciences during the 1990s. However, there has been little empirical research using the findings of complexity theories to explore the potential for innovation in a welfare services context. This paper presents a theoretically founded basis for promoting innovation in welfare services, combining empirical findings with the public innovation research and previous research in the field of complexity theories. In this sense, it can be argued that this paper opens up the potential for the movement of thought in innovation research, particularly in the welfare services context.
   Practical implications - This paper reflects the empirical findings in the literature on innovation and complexity, and thereby may give new insights for practitioners to interpret their own innovation environment. It is suggested that managing innovation in complex welfare service systems requires the ability to articulate emerging themes, to stand 'co-opetition' states of diversity, to acknowledge the boundaries of rational thinking and resist the urge to rapidly draw conclusions, and reflect on one's own behaviour and its consequences. As a result, this paper presents a framework called 'creative abrasion'. Creative abrasion is a complex process that is simultaneously an emergent whole based on local interactions between different actors and a global structure that directs those interaction processes.

AB  - Human exposure to particulate matter can have significant harmful effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular system. These effects vary with number, size, and chemical composition of particulate matter, which vary significantly with space and time. The Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IITK), Kanpur, India, is a relatively clean academic campus in the northwest of a heavily polluted city, Kanpur. The major objectives of the study were to evaluate total exposure of fine and coarse fractions of PM10 to a typical IITK student resident in different indoor microenvironments within the campus; to evaluate personal exposure to student residents during outdoor trips; and to evaluate personal exposure to a typical student resident carrying out routine activities. In order to account for all the sources of particulate matter exposure, measurements on several different days during the pre-monsoon season were carried out in the most common indoor microenvironments in the campus and during outdoor trips outside the campus. A 15-channel optical particle counter (model 1.108, GRIMM) was used to measure continuous real-time particle size distribution from 0.3 to 20 mu m diameter. Using this instrument, exposure for 1 h at different indoor microenvironments was determined. Both the effects of location and activity, which, in turn, account for specific indoor sources and number of occupants, respectively, were carefully evaluated. Re-suspension of particles due to movement of people was found to be a major source of coarse particulate matter exposure. On the other hand, combustion sources led to elevated fine particulate levels. Chalk dust was found to be the major source of fine particulate matter in classrooms. Similar results on other sources of particulate matter are discussed in the paper. To assess the personal average size resolved particulate exposure on a student making a day trip outside the campus, study trips to most common public places in the city in a commonly preferred vehicle were made. Striking correlations between sources/activities and increase in fine and/or coarse particle concentration were clearly visible. To investigate the daily personal exposure and its relation to the activities of a typical student residing in the campus, a 24-h exposure study was done on a student who maintained a time-activity diary. The results provide insight into possible sources and their interaction with human activities in modifying the human exposure levels. A comparison between different microenvironments has been attempted for the first time in an Indian scenario using a real-time aerosol measuring instrument.

AB  - Based on the stratigraphic record of the deposits, analysis of previous works, historic archives, and eyewitness accounts the 1913 eruption of Volcan de Colima was reconstructed. The eruption started in 17 January and peaked in 20 January, 1913. It occurred in three main phases: 1) An opening phase with the generation of Merapi-type pyroclastic flows (units F-1, F-2, F-3) and a pyroclastic surge (S-1), 2) A vent-clearing phase with strong explosions that produced Vulcanian-Soufriere-type pyroclastic flows (F-4) and a pyroclastic surge (S-2) which destroyed the summit dome decompressing the magma system, and 3) a Plinian phase with the establishment of a similar to 23 km high column dispersing a fallout (C-1) to the NE followed by the collapse of the column that generated a pyroclastic surge (S-3) and 15-km long pumice-rich pyroclastic flows (F-5). After the eruption, remobilization of the pyroclastic material generated lahars in main gullies around the crater. Fallout C1 blanketed an area of similar to 191,318 km(2) covering the cities of Guzman, Guadalajara, and Saltillo (Coahuila) located at 725 km from the source. It had a volume of 1.4 km(3) (0.57 km(3) DRE = Dense Rock Equivalent). The total volume of pyroclastic flow and surge deposits was 0.26 km(3) (0.07 km(3) DRE) giving a total volume of the eruption of 1.66 km(3) (0.64 km(3) DRE). The Plinian column lasted 4.6 h with a total mass of 1.5 x 10(12) kg and a mass eruption rate of 9.02 x 10(7) kg/s. The column height and the ejected magma volume indicate that the 1913 eruption had a VEI = 5 being the largest event in the historical record of Colima Volcano. Juvenile scoria and pumice consisted of PI>Opx>Cpx>Hbl + accessory titanomagnetite + Ap and OI with reaction rims. Chemistry of juvenile scoria and pumice samples is andesitic very homogeneous (58.3 +/- 0.5 wt.% SiO2) and similar to the 1818 juvenile products (58.9 +/- 0.2 wt.% SiO2). The presence of banded scoria, olivine phenocrysts with reaction rims, and trace element variations strongly suggest that the 1913 eruption was caused by a magma mixing event. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fuel reduction treatments are especially urgent near homes, where a stand replacement fire would also endanger property and human lives. However, the forested properties associated with homes are often too small for cost-effective mechanized fuel treatment performed with traditional methods and equipment. This project tested a small rubber-tracked skid-steer specially modified for forestry operations that can provide all the functions of a complete harvesting system. The skid-steer can, alternately, carry a hot saw for free felling, a processor to delimb and buck felled frees, a brush cutting head for mastication, and a log-grapple to transport logs and trees. All of the equipment can be transported on a trailer pulled by a heavy pickup truck, which makes for fast, economical movement between project sites. The study confirmed that this system is well suited to small-parcel conditions around home sites and performs best on even terrain, moderate slopes, and softwood trees with a dbh between 5 and 8 in. It took from 7 to 15 productive machine-hours ac(-1) to perform all treatment phases (i.e., mastication, felling, processing, and skidding). The occurrence of delays significantly increased this figures, bringing the average 9.7 productive hours ac(-1) to 13.5 worksite hours. Treatment cost was estimated at $480 ac(-1) and S1,146 ac(-1) for whole-tree and cut-to-length harvesting, respectively. in addition to offering a reasonable treatment cost, the system has the advantage of requiring a low investment, which allows small-scale enterprises to get into the business.

AB  - As the viral diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Influenza A (H1N1) occur in many countries recently, the epidemic of those influenza viruses causes many human casualties. Moreover, the second infection from infected patients particularly within general hospitals frequently takes places due to improperly hospitalized and/or quarantined patients. Accordingly, it becomes a great concern to accommodate safer ventilation system in general hospital wards against such airborne transmitted viruses. It is also a recent trend that many urban general hospitals are designed and constructed as high-rises. If a virus is transmitted through uncontrolled air movement within a hospital and then infected other patients or healthy visitors, it might be impossible to control the spread of the disease. Thus research has been preceded scrutinizing stack effect on the indoor airborne virus transmission in large hospitals by conducting both the field measurement and numerical analysis according to the outdoor temperature and the releasing vertical points of the tracer gas assumed as a viral contaminant. In the field measurement of a high-rise hospital, the indoor airflow was affected by the stack effect of vertical chute of the building. The numerical simulation was verified by comparing its prediction results and the field measurement data. In result, very high possibility has witnessed that the airborne contaminant emitted from the infected patients in the lower floors could be transported to the higher floors through the airflow driven by the stack effect.

AB  - This research work aimed at studying the metal content of water and tilapia fish sample, Oreochromis spp., from a wastewater-fed pond around the University of Cape Coast community using instrumental neutron activation analysis. The metals studied were Al, As, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, V and Zn. In the water samples the order of elemental concentrations at sampling point 1, in mu g/g, was K (75.96 +/- A 0.92), Na (18.52 +/- A 0.35), Al (6.00 +/- A 0.89), Mn (3.28 +/- A 0.44), As (3.08 +/- A 0.40), Mg (1.56 +/- A 0.17), Ca (0.70 +/- A 0.08), Cu (0.54 +/- A 0.08) and V (0.04 +/- A 0.01). Co, Cr, Fe and Zn were below detection limits of INAA. The order of elemental concentrations in the water at point 2 was as follows: Na (4.99 +/- A 0.14), K (4.82 +/- A 0.89), Mn (4.40 +/- A 0.53), Mg (2.92 +/- A 0.37), Al (1.98 +/- A 0.21), As (0.69 +/- A 0.10), Ca (0.24 +/- A 0.07) and V (0.23 +/- A 0.06) with Co, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn falling below the detection limit of INAA. The concentrations recorded for Al, As, Cu and Mn in the water samples were all above WHO permissible limits. The mean levels of heavy metals in the soft tissue of tilapia was of the order: K > Mg > Fe > Ca > Na > Al > Mn > Zn > V > Cu > Cr > Co. Arsenic was below detection limit. The transfer factor values calculated for the metals Al, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Na and V were all greater than one indicating movement of metals from the water column to the tilapia species. The hazard index (HI) calculated for Al, Fe, Mn and V suggested possible occurrence of adverse health effects (HI > 1) where as the HI value obtained for Cr, Cu and Zn (i.e., HI < 1) suggested unlikely adverse effects occurring.

AB  - This paper aims to unpack the dynamics of displacement and the relationship of physical movement to elements of space (i.e. land) and place (or identity), in the Sundays River Valley, near the town of Kirkwood, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. It primarily uses the motif of frontiers to cast light on displacement as an ongoing phenomenon and explore the different eras of occupation of land in the Sundays River Valley, from the early nineteenth century until 1970. It relates different layers of belonging and identity to the unfolding of capitalism and apartheid in South Africa. The article argues that ties to land are multiple, contested and based upon dispossession and physical movement rather than upon stability. While such a high degree of contestation of oral evidence in the Sundays River Valley might not give current claimants a detailed legal basis for restitution, it is an academically valuable idea to explore the origins of the inhabitants in the Sundays River Valley - because it can indicate the degree to which local identities are influenced by experiences of disruption and displacement. The paper argues that frontier relationships in the SRV are central in the formation of larger systems of relationships of race and class, and that this casts new light on displacement (both as a historical event and a contemporary experience), in the formation of identity and place in southern Africa.

AB  - Purpose - Accompanying the recent concern for the quality of our nation's educational infrastructure, a growing body of research connects the quality of school facilities to both student outcomes including achievement, behavior, and attitude as well as to teacher attitude and behavior. Less is known about the mechanisms of these relationships. This paper aims to examine the link between school building quality and student outcomes through the mediating influence of school climate. Results build upon those of a recent study that confirmed a link between the quality of school facilities and student achievement in both English and Mathematics, as well as the mediating role of school climate. This qualitative follow-up study explores the complicated intricacies of how a school building's physical properties influence teaching and learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is structured according to a collective, instrumental case study design. Individual, focus group, walk-through and photo-interviews, as well as observations inform the inquiry. Two high-poverty schools are identified from the earlier quantitative study because the ratings of the quality school facilities by their faculties fall within the upper quartile. These two schools, one urban and one rural, are selected purposefully for this study, maximizing learning from cases rich in information.
   Findings - Results of the research indicate that ongoing interactions between the original design, the day-to-day reality of the built environment, and the occupants of that environment help to define the learning climate of these schools. Reciprocally, the climate helps to shape the interactions that take place, fostering environmental understanding, competence and control and supporting academic learning. From the data, several broad themes related to building quality emerge as central to this interaction between the built environment and building occupants, including movement, aesthetics, play of light, flexible and responsive classrooms, elbow room, and security.
   Originality/value - Through the stories told by occupants of these two schools, we gain further understanding of the interactions between certain building conditions and design features and how these reinforce and enhance the social environment of school, helping to foster a sense of belonging within a place, a sense of control and competence, and a sense of collective commitment to the place and its purposes. As school designers balance considerations of durability with flexibility, the voices of these occupants may serve to argue for the inclusion of design features that allow occupants some measure of control over comfort and use factors. The broad themes related to building quality that emerge from the data include movement, aesthetics, the play of light, flexible and responsive classrooms, elbow room, as well as safety and security.

AB  - The species Austropotamobius torrentium and Astacus astacus are two species known in the EU directives to require deeper understanding of their autecologic requirements before any sustainable conservation effort could be successfully applied. Therefore, the paper aims to analyze the occurrence of these two species of crayfish in the Anina Mountains (Romania) in relation to several physical-chemical indicators measured on site. The results suggest that the anthropogenic impacts registered in some of the sampling sites (e. g. organic pollution and river bed modification) might have triggered the disappearance of both species from the areas of the water sheds situated downstream villages and towns, deforestation sites and sewage treatment plants. The analysis suggest that both species might have similar ecologic requirements, with a BMWP score of 8 (out of a possible 10), therefore good indicators of pristine aquatic environments and with a possible toleration to pollution but only up to a moderate level. Nevertheless, the lack of cohabitation of the populations of both species at a local scale was discussed along with two possible explaining hypotheses: behavioral exclusion or different times and/or modalities of dispersal history.

AB  - This paper presents the earthquake response of a historical masonry minaret after a finite element model updating was undertaken using the information from full scale ambient vibration testing. The Iskenderpasa historical masonry minaret dating back to the 16th century with a height of 21m located in the city center of Trabzon, Turkey is selected as an application. Analytical modal analysis is performed on the 3D finite element model of the minaret considering field survey and engineering judgments to obtain the analytical frequencies and mode shapes. The field ambient vibration tests on the minaret under natural excitations such as wind loading and human movement are conducted. The Peak Picking and the Stochastic Subspace Identification techniques are used to extract the modal parameters from the ambient vibration test. A good correlation was found among the modal parameters identified from the two techniques. The finite element model of the minaret is updated to minimize the differences between analytically and experimentally estimated modal properties by changing some uncertain modeling parameters such as material properties and boundary conditions. The analytical model of the minaret after finite element model updating is analyzed using the 1992 Erzincan earthquake record, which occurred near the area, to determine the earthquake behavior of the minaret. At the end of the study, maximum differences in the natural frequencies are reduced on average from 27% to 5% and a good agreement is found between analytical and experimental natural frequencies and mode shapes by model updating. Also, it is seen from the earthquake analysis that the displacements increase along the height of the minaret and the maximum and minimum principal stresses occur at the region of the transition segment and the cylindrical body.

AB  - VOX Group (comprised of Jan Beran, Milos Budik, Antonin Hinst, Karel Otto Hruby, Sona Skoupilova, Vladimir Skoupil and Josef Tichy) was undeniably one of the most distinctive art groups in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and early 1970s. The group formed in Brno, which at that time was a major cultural centre, where art germinated yet a bit more freely than in the capital city. Photography found a base for itself there in official institutions (Jaromir Funke's Studio at the House of Art in Brno, the Photography Collection of the Moravian Gallery in Brno) and also in a massive amateur movement with a huge membership base, from which VOX Group partly evolved. VOX did not have a strictly formulated programme, nor was it a group striving to make a statement on behalf of a generation. The authors were brought together simply by their interest in photography, by the participation of members in International Salons of Art Photography, and by their attendance at photography courses, either as students or teachers. However, a specific attribute of VOX Group was that they created exhibitions based on uniform concepts. These could be called a kind of 'exhibition programme'. It is difficult, however, to reconstruct them today. The work of the members of VOX Group can be divided up into several streams. Milos Budik and Karel Otto Hruby created many excellent photographs inspired by the idea of the poetry of the everyday. Jan Beran's workshop produced socially critical photographs taken after the occupation in August 1968. Antonin Hinst and Karel Otto Hruby were exquisite landscape photographers, but their photographs of devastated industrial landscapes are also noteworthy and rank among the earliest works of art to give voice to the clearly ecological outlook of the artists behind them. Somewhat singular is the work of Josef Tichy, who creatively used female nudes to make powerfully stylised photographs. In each of the streams mentioned here VOX Group photographers achieved outstanding results and their work ranks firmly among the treasures of Czech culture.

TI  - Porto Alegre (Brazil) in the 1970s: Authoritarian State and Abstraction in Public Space
T2  - ON THE WATERFRONT
LA  - English
AB  - During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of South American countries went through devastating military regimes. They were supported - if not organized - by United States as a form of preventing a growing leftist influence in the continent and a possible "realignment" of such nations with the Soviet Block. The main dictatorship in Latin America occurred in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. In March 31 of 1964, Brazil deepened itself into the Military Dictatorship, which lasted more than twenty year, the longest dictatorship regime of the continent. At the time, under the presidency of Joao Goulart (elected as vice-president in 1960 that had sworn as President when the President Janio Quadros resigned, in the following year). The Goulart administration was tumultuous and followed by political instability mainly due to the measures he wanted to put in action in the country as well as by the rather conservative environment, which offered great resistance to his policies. When the president Janio Quadros resigned in august of 1961, Joao Goulart was in a diplomatic mission in Chine. The military forces and the conservative members of the congress prevented him from taking the oath and a civil war almost took place by sectors eager to guarantee he would be allowed to take the presidency. Goulart undertake of his place, as President was only possible due to a popular movement, which occurred in the city of Porto Alegre, in the South of Brazil. In that, respect the coup was only postponed...
   Joao Goulart was a rich farmer from the state of Rio Grande do Sul and was the greatest leader of a faction called "Trabalhismo" (under the Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro) of popular appeal and with significant support from the worker's class. Its policy, from "communist inspiration," according to opposition, was nothing more than popular measures of a social-democratic matrix. Goulart used to call his proposals by " Reformas de Base" [Base Reforms], that is: Educational Reform (from fighting literalness to changes in the higher educational system); Tributary Reform (with greater control of sending reserves abroad); Electoral Reform (right to vote for illiterate and the military of lower ranks); Land Reform (desappropriation of unproductive land); Urban Reform.
   In March 31 of 1964, now a well plane military coup would become a reality and President Joao Goulart was removed and send to exile. The militaries (Army, Navy and Air Force) took the government. For a few days, the president of Congress took the presidency and a great deal of political and syndical leaders, public officials, members of the military, were removed from offices and exiled. An indirect presidential election was made with the support of a submissive congress which place in the presidency the marshal Castello Branco (1964-1967). An authoritarian government was set in motion. However in 1968, forced by the democratic resistance at the second military term, under the presidency of the marshal Costa e Silva (1967-1969), the military dictatorship was aggravated and took the form of State Terrorism with clandestine prison, torture, murdering of opposition leaders, culture and press censorship without precedents. Because of that, part of the resistance to the military opted for organized guerrilla fight in distant regions of urban centers.
   his period of the Brazilian Military Dictatorship, which correspondent to the years of 1968 to 1974 (at the end of the President- general Emilio Medici dictatorship), became known as the "Anos de Chumbo"[Years of Lead], due to the great number of terror acts employed by the state. About the economic aspects, in the same period the country went through what became known the "Economic Miracle."With an extraordinary superavit of the economy, up to 10% a year (mainly due to the ingress of foreign capital). The greatest inheritance however of such "miracle,"which didn't last throughout the following decade was the public deficit (Divida Externa) and inflation rates without precedents, as well as a concentration of wealth at the hands of few which made from Brazil up to today one of the countries with the largest gap between the rich and the poor.
   Only in 1985, with the election by the Congress of the civilian opposition leader Tancredo Neves for the presidency the country would officially leave dictatorship behind. Unfortunately, Tancredo Neves would die before taking the presidency and his vice- president, a representative of the old and most backwards oligarchies of the country politically tied to the supporters of Military Dictatorship. Only in November of 1989, the country would have its first presidential elections after 29 years of dictatorship.

AB  - Poland's Animal Protection Act, as of 2002, made it legal to shoot free-ranging cats and dogs. The act triggered substantial social debate with opponents arguing that this legislation was weakly supported by scientific evidence of the ecological impacts of free-ranging pets. Our main research goal was to examine the activity of free-ranging domestic cats within a Polish protected area by applying radio-telemetry methods to determine space use and degree of encroachment into the national park. We trapped and radio-tracked 19 animals from three sites (focal households) located in Ojcow National Park (ONP) in southern Poland from June 2003 to March 2006. Annual 100% MCP home range size varied from 0.02 km(2) to 1.46 km(2), and was significantly larger for males (mean +/- SE = 0.79 +/- 0.34 km(2): median = 0.53 km(2)) than for females (mean +/- SE = 0.13 +/- 0.05 km(2); median = 0.13 km(2)). The distance travelled by individual cats from focal sites did not significantly differ between males (mean +/- SE = 232.00 +/- 21.05 m; median = 191 m) and females (mean +/- SE = 232.50 +/- 12.47 m; median = 228 m), with maximum distances of 1.5 km for males and 1.1 km for females. All monitored cats were in close proximity to nature reserves and ranged into protected areas without any human control. Cats living in the households in the park and its surrounding buffer zone, roaming at 200 m and 1000 m radius distances from their households, occupied from 6% to 100% of the park area, respectively. Our results reveal that free-ranging domestic cats roam through and potentially impact the entire national park, thus reducing its effective protected area.

AB  - The Crimean Mountains in Ukraine constitute a seismically active region that is abundant in various types of mass movement. The limestone escarpments that rise above the Black Sea coast in the vicinity of the town of Yalta are particularly subject to considerable rockfall, landslide and debris flow processes that often endanger infrastructure and human life. One of these very active slopes is the area of the ancient Taraktash rockslide, characterised by active block-type movements (lateral spreading, toppling, and incipient sliding), rockfalls, ongoing sliding activities and debris flows. The aims of this study were (i) to employ tree-ring analysis to reconstruct a record of slope instabilities (mainly block-type movements. rockfalls. landslides and debris flows) within the Taraktash slope deformation over a period of more than two centuries and (ii) to establish the degree of correlation between periods of enhanced slope activity and both historical earthquakes and climatic data. The temporal frequency of significant slope processes was addressed through a tree-ring analysis that took 738 increment cores from 255 Crimean pine trees Pinus nigra ssp. pallasiana. The tree-ring record reveals periods of increased activity of block-type movements, rockfalls and landslides during the major earthquakes in 1790, 1875, 1927 and 1986. Although the slope processes studied are predominantly driven by seismic activity, their intensity and duration are also dependent on climatic factors. This is especially true for landslides and debris flows, which occurred mainly in years characterised by high precipitation totals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe the residential history of the generations born between 1930 and 1950, living in Paris and its suburbs. It is based on the Biographies and Setting survey conducted by ined in 2001 on about 2830 people from the Ile-de-France region belonging to these generations. Their residential and geographical trajectories testify to the great moments of Ile-de-France urbanization that occurred during the course of the second half of the 20th century, particularly with the expansion of property and the phenomena of periurbanization and gentrification. From a geographical point of view, three major trends emerge: a centrifugal movement that drives people from the Ile-de-France region away from the center of the agglomeration, a certain stability in the geographical area where they have settled in Ile-de-France, denoting their attachment to Paris and their roots in the suburbs, and to a lesser extent, a return to the center of the agglomeration. Some surveys have also observed urban movements. This was the cases of the pioneers of periurbanization with access to the ownership of an individual home in a holding and of the pioneers of gentrification in certain districts of the capital located in the immediate vicinity. Analysis by generation shows the different effect on residential and geographical routes. Above all, it reveals the impact of marital changes on trajectories. Although the residential trajectories of the pre-war generations, like their family trajectories, were shown in a linear manner in a scheme that went from rental to ownership, the trajectories of the generations born after 1945 were far more chaotic, due to unions, separations and the eventual formation of new couples. Ownership, often presented as the ultimate goal of the course, becomes a stage in an increasingly complex trajectory for some.

AB  - There are two co-seismic faults which developed when the Wenchuan earthquake happened. One occurred along the active fault zone in the central Longmen Mts. and the other in the front of Longmen Mts. The length of which is more than 270 km and about 80 km respectively. The co-seismic fault shows a reverse flexure belt with strike of N45 degrees-60 degrees E in the ground, which caused uplift at its northwest side and subsidence at the southeast. The fault face dips to the northwest with a dip angle ranging from 50 degrees to 60 degrees. The vertical offset of the co-seismic fault ranges 2.5-3.0 m along the Yingxiu-Beichuan co-seismic fault, and 1.5-1.1 m along the Doujiangyan-Hanwang fault. Movement of the coseismic fault presents obvious segmented features along the active fault zone in central Longmen Mts. For instance, in the section from Yingxiu to Leigu town, thrust without evident slip occurred; while from Beichuan to Qingchuan, thrust and dextral strike-slip take place. Main movement along the front Longmen Mts. shows thrust without slip and segmented features. The area of earthquake intensity more than IX degree and the distribution of secondary geological hazards occurred along the hanging wall of co-seismic faults, and were consistent with the area of aftershock, and its width is less than 40 km from co-seismic faults in the hanging wall. The secondary geological hazards, collapses, landslides, debris flows et al., concentrated in the hanging wall of co-seismic fault within 0-20 km from co-seismic fault.

AB  - Digital photogrammetric analysis and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) techniques were applied to evaluate the volume of material involved in a complex roto-translational slide occurred in the territory of Picerno (Basilicata region, southern Italy). Analytical and digital photogrammetric techniques facilitated a multi-temporal analysis of aerial photos for the years 1997, 2004 and 2006. In order to identify different geomorphologic features (scarps, terraces and trenches) of the landslide and their development, the analytical and digital photo interpretation was performed at the maximum scale of 1:5000. Geological and geomorphological surveys were carried out to verify photo-interpretation results. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for 1997, 2004 and 2006 were produced by applying the Grid Adaptive method. The differential DEMs (2006-1997; 2006-2004; 2004-1997) for the most dangerous part of the landslide allowed us to recognize the areas affected either by deposition or erosion and also estimate any altitudinal changes in each geomorphologic unit. To detect the sliding surface and estimate the thickness of the sliding material, several transversal and longitudinal ERT profiles were obtained. The electrical images of subsurface supported by stratigraphical data from boreholes were integrated with the information from the DEMs. The altitudinal changes and the sizes of the source and accumulation areas allowed us to estimate the volume of material involved in the mass movement. The fusion of data from different sensors allows us to gather indications on the surface and subsurface characteristics of the landslide providing useful information for landslide mitigation activities. Such an approach can help both to improve our knowledge and overcome the drawbacks of each methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - P>Nearly 75% of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that impact or threaten human health are zoonotic. The majority have spilled from wildlife reservoirs, either directly to humans or via domestic animals. The emergence of many can be attributed to predisposing factors such as global travel, trade, agricultural expansion, deforestation/habitat fragmentation, and urbanization; such factors increase the interface and/or the rate of contact between human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations, thereby creating increased opportunities for spillover events to occur. Infectious disease emergence can be regarded as primarily an ecological process. The epidemiological investigation of EIDs associated with wildlife requires a trans-disciplinary approach that includes an understanding of the ecology of the wildlife species, and an understanding of human behaviours that increase risk of exposure. Investigations of the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 provide useful case studies. The emergence of Nipah virus was associated with the increased size and density of commercial pig farms and their encroachment into forested areas. The movement of pigs for sale and slaughter in turn led to the rapid spread of infection to southern peninsular Malaysia, where the high-density, largely urban pig populations facilitated transmission to humans. Identifying the factors associated with the emergence of SARS in southern China requires an understanding of the ecology of infection both in the natural reservoir and in secondary market reservoir species. A necessary extension of understanding the ecology of the reservoir is an understanding of the trade, and of the social and cultural context of wildlife consumption. Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife populations will continue to threaten public health. Mitigating and managing the risk requires an appreciation of the connectedness between human, livestock and wildlife health, and of the factors and processes that disrupt the balance.

AB  - The language of morality and legality infuses every aspect of the Middle East conflict. From repeated assertions by officials that Israel has "the most moral army in the world" to justifications for specific military tactics and operations by reference to self-defense and proportionality, the public rhetoric is one of legal right and moral obligation. Less often heard are the voices of those on the ground whose daily experience is lived within the legal quagmire portrayed by their leaders in such uncompromising terms. This Article explores the opaque normative boundaries surrounding the actions of a specific group within the Israeli military, soldiers returning from duty in Hebron in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. By examining interviews with these soldiers by an Israeli NGO, it identifies different narratives of legality and illegality which inform their conduct, contrasting their failure to adhere to conventional legal discourses with the broader "legalization" of military activities. Seeking an explanation for this disjunction, it explores the ways in which the soldiers ' stories nonetheless reflect attempts to negotiate various normative and legal realities. It places these within the legal landscape of the Occupied Palestinian Territories which has been normatively re-imagined by various forces in Israeli society, from the judicially-endorsed discourse of deterrence manifested in the day-today practices of brutality, intimidation and "demonstrating power," to the growing influence of nationalist-religious interpretations of self-defense and the misuse of post-modernist theory by the military establishment to "smooth out" the moral and legal urban architectures of occupation. The Article concludes by considering the hope for change evident in the very act of soldiers telling ethically-oriented stories about their selves, and in the existence of a movement willing to provide the space for such reflections in an attempt to confront Israeli society with the day-to-day experiences of the soldier in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

AB  - Managed turf sites (golf courses) are the most intensively managed landscapes in the urban environment. Yet, long-term watershed scale studies documenting the environmental transport of agrichemicals applied to these systems are rare. The objective of this study was to quantify the surface discharge losses of two commonly applied pesticides (chlorothalonil and 2,4-D) resulting from prevailing practices on a managed golf course. Inflow and outflow discharge waters on a subarea of Northland Country Club located in Duluth, MN were measured for both quantity and quality from April through November from 2003 to 2008. The median chlorothalonil outflow concentration (0.58 mu g L-1) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the inflow concentration, which was below the detection limit (0.07 mu g L-1). Similarly, the median outflow 2,4-D concentration (0.85 mu g L-1) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the inflow concentration (0.31 mu g L-1). Chlorothalonil concentrations occasionally exceeded acute toxicity levels (7.6 mu g L-1) reported for rainbow trout. No 2,4-D concentrations exceeded any human or aquatic species published toxicity level; however, the maximum measured 2,4-D concentration (67.1 mu g L-1), which rarely occurred, did approach the 70 mu g L-1 maximum contaminant level (MCL) for that compound. Losses of both pesticides were detectable throughout the annual sampling period. Mean annual chlorothalonil loading was 10.5 g ha(-1) or 0.3% of applied, while mean annual 2,4-D loading was 4.9 g ha(-1) or 0.5% of applied. The findings of this study provide quantifiable evidence of agrichemical transport resulting from typical turfgrass management and highlight the need for implementation of best management practices to combat the offsite transport of agrichemicals used in professional turf management.

AB  - The abstract, white architecture of the inter-war British avant garde comes to a decisive end with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. As a result the postwar period emerges somewhat divided as to what should become the new architecture of the moment with which to accommodate the needs and express the values of a newly progressive society. Although the allocation of certain stylistic tropes to different, socio-cultural situations was not so categorical as in the pre-war totalitarian societies, there were nonetheless comparable semantic inflections in British architecture over the twenty-year period which followed the end of the war. This is perhaps first evident in the prefabricated, lightweight modular building systems adopted for both emergency housing and school building; respectibely, for the accommodation of the bombed out population in the first instance and for the production of some 2500 schools in the second, most of which were built over the fifteen years between 1945 and 1960 as a consequence of the Education Act, put in place by the socialist government in 1946. Emergency housing needs were met by the minimalist, single story, prefabricated Portal house which was extensively built on vacant sites in major cities after the end of the war. The equally modular, prefabricated school system developed by the Ministry of Education came into being initially through the architect's department of the Hertfordshire County Council, under the direction of C. H. Aslin. In both instances what one effectively encountered was a lightweight, steel panel system, bereft of any recognizable iconography apart from the fact the internal walls of the schools were finished in primary colors and were furnished with stackable Scandinavian wood and metal furniture plus indoor plants; the whole often being set in diminutive picturesque landscape.
   However this modular lingua franca could not be extended to the domestic environment. Here the heritage of the Garden City movement, dating back to the turn of the century, was pressed into service in a discretely modified form to constitute the two-story housing stock that made up the bulk of the residential fabric in the fourteen new towns established by the Labor government after the War as a result of the New Towns Act of 1948. This accounts for the single and semi-detached houses that became the vehicle so to speak, to which the so-called 'peoples detailing' was to be applied. This last comprised a repertoire of shallow-pitched, tile roofs, load-bearing, cavity walls in brick, along with casement opening lights and fixed picture windows in either steel or wood, which were invariably painted white. This amiable, unchallenging, anti-street, garden city aesthetic accessed through winding roads invariably engendered a somewhat informal site layout which, together with the detailing, came under the rubric of 'contemporary' as opposed to the received prewar idea of a severely abstract modern architecture. This conciliatory everyday style was favored by the left-wing architects of the London County Council who occupied mid-level positions within this 300 man architects department. I have in mind such figures as Oliver Cox and Graham Shank land both of whom were very influenced by the socially democratic architecture of the Swedish Welfare State. However this low-rise heimatstil principle of 'people's detailing' would be modified in the case of high-rise housing since flat roofs were deemed to be more appropriate for the capping of such forms. As it happens the preferred high-rise type was also of Swedish origin; namely, a 10-story tower block with a square footprint and a central access core, serving four apartments per floor, as this type occupy a large sector of the LCC Roehampton Estate dating from 1958.
   The influence of local authorities at this time was very pervasive given that almost half of the registered architects in the country were employed by local governments and the remainder who were in private practice received most of their commissions from the same source. As Reyner Banham would observe in his canonical study The New Brutalism of 1966, Cox and Shank land had close personal contacts with Sweden at the time, moreover as he reveals the term 'brutalist' originated as a qualifying adjective in Sweden. Banham cites a letter from 1956 written by Hans Asplund to Eric de Mare of The Architectural Review.
   In January 1950 I shared offices with my esteemed colleagues Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm. These architects were at the time designing a house at Uppsala. Judging from their drawings I called them in a mildly sarcastic way 'Neo-Brutalists'. (The Swedish word for 'New Brutalists'!) The following summer, at jollification with some English friends, among whom were Michael Ventris, Oliver Cox and Graeme Shank land, the term was mentioned again in a jocular fashion. When I visited the same friends in London last year, they told me that they had brought the word back with them to England, and that it had spread like wildfire, and that it had, somewhat astoundingly, been adopted by a certain faction of younger English architects.
   It is hard to imagine something more ironic than that the categorically anti-Swedish British Brutalist line should have at least part of its origin as a style in Sweden itself.
   Despite the eclipse of the abstract British "international style" a certain vestige of a pre-war Neo-Corbusian syntax was carried over into the postwar period, most notably in the work of Lubetkin and Tecton, particularly as this applied to the rather formalistic medium-rise apartment blocks that the firm designed for the East End of London between 1945 and 1955. Typified by their Spa Green Estate built in Finsbury in 1956, this ornamental manner could hardly be more removed from the aforementioned 'peoples detailing'. The Tecton slab blocks were invariably animated by syncopated faience screens running across the balconied face of each block. Lubetkin's syntax was also evident in the plan articulation and detailing of the Royal Festival Hall realized under the direction of Leslie Martin who was then chief architect of the LCC and designed by Peter Moro who had worked for Tecton prior to the Second World War.
   A second figure, from the prewar era, was David du R. Aberdeen, who also seems to have cultivated a 'baroque' Neo-Corbusian manner as we find this elaborated in his Trades Union Headquarters built near Bedford Square in 1951 and faced in polished stone. This New Monumentality apres la lettre could hardly be made to jibe with the pitched roof populism of the New Town vernacular or with the lightweight modular manner of the prefabricated schools.
   In many respects 1951 is the annus mirabilis of postwar recovery as far as British architecture is concerned, for this not only sees the realization of the Festival of Britain and the Royal Festival Hall, but also the Coventry Cathedral Competition for which Alison and Peter Smithson submitted a totally radical shell concrete form encompassing the entire plan of a diamond ecclesiastical space.
   It is clear that the inspiration behind the Festival of Britain was the social democratic Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 which under the direction of the architect Gunnar Asplund and the critical intellectual Gregor Paulson would effectively inaugurate a new egalitarian middle class culture, closely linked fields of architecture and industrial design. As far as the propagation of popular good taste was concerned the Festival of Britain followed Stockholm to the letter with its playful tubular metal chairs, in primary colors designed by Ernest Race and the popular slogan of Black Eyes and Lemonade which summed up the playful spirit of the occasion. Like Stockholm, the Festival conveyed a mixed message as far as received taste in architecture was concerned in as much as both exhibitions celebrated Constructivist architecture as a built manifestation of a newly emergent techno-scientific society. I have in mind in the case of Stockholm Asplund's stressed skin control cabin elevated on stilts and capped by a latticework publicity mast while the parallel engineering rhetoric in the Festival was patently the Skylon; a latticework, cigar-shaped pylon stayed by wire cables designed by Powell and Moya in collaboration with the engineer Felix Samuely equally dematerialized stressed-skin dome of the Dome of Discovery by Ralph Tubbs supported at its rim by steel latticework struts as a kind of tethered flying saucer. Overall however what Alvar Aalto wrote about the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930 could have been applied just as easily to the Festival of Britain twenty years later, to the effect that:
   . . . This is not a composition of glass, stone and steel, as a visitor who despises functionalism might imagine; it is a composition of houses, flags, floodlights, flowers, fireworks, happy people and clean table cloths.
   Be this as it may, a discernible schism emerged not only between the left wing 'peoples detailing' of the low-rise domestic architecture such as find in Frederick Gibberd's Harlow New Town, but also between those who would look to pure engineering technique as the source for a new unprecedented tectonic language as this is attempted in the shell concrete Brynmawr Rubber Factory designed by the Architect's Co-partnership in 1952 in collaboration with the engineer Ove Arup. The main alternative was to look for an authentic form of expression in the street culture of the then still extant British working class. This split is already discernible in the early work of Alison and Peter Smithson which served to oscillate between heroic engineering form on the one hand as we find this in the competition entries for their Neo-Miesian Hunstanton School Norfolk of 1949 and their Nervi-like Coventry Cathedral of 1951 and, on the other, the as found sociological 'otherness' of the nineteenth century two-story worker's row housing which, comprised of brick walls and slate roofs, made up the fabric and provided the setting for everyday life in the Bye Law streets of Bethnal Green. The Smithsons first experienced this culture through visiting the Bethnal Green home of Nigel and Judith Henderson; the one a photographer and the other a sociologist and where the one captured the street life of the arena on film, the other studied its kinship structure. The Lore and Language of School Children published in 1959 by the sociologists lona and Peter Opie documented the role played by the culture of the street in the evolution of this society.
   That Henderson and the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi were crucial to the evolution of the sensibility of the Smithsons would be borne out by the patio and pavilion which made up their joint contribution to the seminal White Chapel Gallery exhibition This is Tomorrow of 1956. This 'anti-consumerist' reworking of the Abbe Langier's primitive hut plus a double spread image of all four of them incongruously seated in the middle of Limmerson Street in London, running across the spiral binding of the catalogue, eloquently summed up their l'art brut approach. This ethos was reinforced by a poetic inscription in 'child-like' script asserting the anti-idealistic ethnographic archaism of the content.
   Patio & pavilion represents the fundamental necessities of the human habitat in a series of symbols. The first necessity is for a piece of the world the patio; the second necessity is for an enclosed space the pavilion. These two spaces are furnished with symbols for all human needs. The head for man himself his brain and his machines. The tree for nature. The rocks and natural objects for stability and the decoration of man-made space. The light box for the hearth and family. Artifacts and pin ups for his irrational urges. The frog and the dog for the other animals. The wheel and aeroplane for locomotion and the machine.
   Although James Stirling and the Smithsons would rival each other throughout the trajectory of their separate careers it is of the utmost significance as far as Brutalism is concerned that they would both cultivate a 'smokestack' aesthetic in their varied iterations of a native brick vernacular irrespective of whether the location was urban and rural. This mutual sensibility surely accounts for the similarity between a number of 'degree zero' works projected and realized by these separate practices during the first half of the 50's. I have in mind as far as the Smithsons are concerned the small warehouse-like four-story infill terrace house in brick and concrete projected for the Soho area of London in 1952. Of this work they wrote: "had this been built, it would have been the first exponent of 'the new brutalism' in England".
   And equally primitive syncopated exercise in load-bearing brickwork also characterizes the remarkable housing projects realized by Stirling and Gowan in 1955 and 1957; respectively, their 3-story Ham Common flats built on a verdant site in Richmond in 1955 and the 3 to 4 story terrace housing built as a fragmented block in Preston, Lancashire in 1957. The overall cultural intention informing the latter sets forth even more explicitly than any text by the Smithsons the common sensibility of the moment as far as their mutual essays in low-rise, low-cost housing was concerned. Thus we read:
   In 19th century industrial 'by-law' towns you pass perhaps twenty or more front doors before coming to your own, with children playing in the roads, parents chatting on the pavement and sitting in doorways, and the old peering through windows. This horizontal approach through the neighborhood to get to your house seems to be a reason for the friendliness and sense of community which exists in these work towns and the 19th century solution seems more dynamic than the latter planning solutions for urban mass housing . . .
   In the initial oeuvre complete published in 1975, Stirling and Gowan make it clear that this 'nostalgia for the slums' was a broad postwar British sensibility that extended well beyond architecture and could be found in artists as diverse as the novelist Somerset Maughan, the painter L.S. Lowry and George Orwell for his 1945 working class epic On the Road to Wigan Pier. This was also the environment that the Smithsons wished to evoke in their 10-story 'street-in-the-air' Golden Lane Housing competition entry of 1952, the span-deck access of which would be realized at a more exposed scale in the Parkhill Housing built to the designs of Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith for the Sheffield City Council in 1961. This achievement proved at a larger, more windswept scale, the truth of the cryptically critical observation that: "above the 6th floor it can be accepted that the old forms of contact with the ground are no longer valid".
   This mutual nostalgia for a declining 'vernacular' would also have its rural version in the work of both of these practices in the early 50's as we may judge from Stirling's village infill housing prototype exhibited at the CLAM X congress at Aix-en-Provence in 1953 which was inspired by Thomas Sharp's 1945 study The English Village. A more or less identical theme expressly designed for the same occasion made up the substance of the Smithsons' 'fold houses' ostensibly designed for West Burton in Yorkshire of which they wrote in Uppercase 3 of 1955.
   The new is placed over the old like a new plant growing through old branches -or new fruit on old twigs. The fold is a windbreak. Each house has its back to the prevailing wind. Instead of the 'housing Manual' type of house, sent down from the suburbs -a barrow boy on the fells.
   Sixty years later the oblique references in this statement may be easily missed (i.e. the contempt of the authors for the bureaucratic imposition of petit bourgeois) for what is conjoined in their predilection for 'barrow bow' street culture as a means for revitalizing the existing rural vernacular of the Yorkshire hills.
   In a resume of the "Parallel Life and Art" exhibition staged by the Smithsons, Paolozzi, and Henderson at the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London in 1953, the Smithsons openly acknowledge how both themselves and Stirling & Gowan were equally involved with the so-called 'brutalist' ideology emerging out of the Independent Group that met at the ICA in the early 50's, comprising such figures as Reyner Banham, Theo Crosby, Colin St John Wilson, Richard Hamilton and Laurence Alloway, this last being the critic/curator of the exhibition This is Tomorrow. Two canonical buildings of the mid 60's respectively already suggest how these two practices will evolve from their mutual beginnings over the next decade as we may judge from the Smithsons' Economist Building realized in St James Street, London in 1963 and Stirling and Gowan's Engineering Faculty Building, Leicester University completed in 1964. Although both buildings comprise medium-rise towers with The Economist topping out at 17 stories and Leicester rising for 11 floors, the first inserted into dense urban fabric is unequivocally Sittesque and Neo-Miesian in character, while the second is a free-standing, Neo-Constructivist work. By this date quite different positions seem to have been established with the Smithsons opting for modular tectonic pieces having latent classical affinities and Stirling going for more strenuously organic assemblies with partial references to Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto, with last affinity coming more fully into its own with Stirling's dormitories for St. Andrew's University in Scotland also realized in the 60's. The British 19th century engineering tradition is present as a key expressive element as far as the Leicester Engineering Building is concerned (shades of the Crystal Palace and Brunel) while in St. Andrews while we are witness to a concrete and glass essay surprisingly reminiscent of the Smithsons in their Sheffield University competition entry of 1953. At the same time there are faint traces of the Gothic Revival evident in both Leicester and The Economist. In the first instance, on Stirling's own admission, Leicester makes an allusion to William Butterfield's All Saints Margaret Street, London of 184959, while in the case of the Economist Gothic is latent in the structural mullions of the building which step back like attenuated buttresses in order to express the diminution of the load as they rise upwards as in the stepped piers of Mies van de Rohe's Promontory Apartments of 1949.
   As opposed to The Economist which, as fate would have it, brought the Smithsons' building career to a virtual close in terms of achieving works of comparable status and size, the Leicester Engineering Building gave Stirling and Gowan a run of university commissions culminating in leading to what has more recently recognized as the Red Trilogy on account of the fact that they were all faced in red brick and tile, namely in sequence after Leicester the History Faculty Building at Cambridge University (1964) and the Florey Dormitory at Queen's College, Oxford (1966). All of these major works by the Smithsons and Stirling involved the creative participation of the brilliant structural engineers Ron Jenkins of Ove Arup and Partners in the case the Hunstanton School in Norfolk of 1949-54, and Frank Newby of Felix Samuely and Partners in the case of the Red Trilogy and St Andrews University.
   With the appointment of Leslie Martin to the professorship of architecture at Cambridge University in 1956the creative patronage of the 'brutalist' sensibility shifted from London to Cambridge and with this change in leadership and focus the so-called movement entered its maturity. However before turning to the exceptionally fertile studio set up in Cambridge by Martin and Colin St. John it is necessary to comment in passing on the importance of certain training offices on the London scene in the 50's and the 60's above all the practice of Lyons Israel and Ellis which served as a proving ground for the next generation, namely, John Miller and Neave Brown, both of whom worked closely with Tom Ellis; in the first instance on an annex to the Old Vic Theatre (1958) and in the second on a stacked lecture theatres in fair-faced, reinforced (white) concrete, for the Wolfson Institute at Hammersmith Hospital (1961). Patrick Hodgkinson was the third architect of exceptional talent from the same year at the AA School. As it happens Hodgkinson would play a seminal role in the development of a normative modern Aaltoesque brick aesthetic appropriate to the British climate as this would issue from the Martin/St. Wilson Studio from 1956 onwards; most notably in terms of Hodgkinson's direct involvement, load bearing brick 3-story terrace housing projected for St. Pancras, London in 1959 and the student hostel for Caius College, dating from 1962. That Hodgkinson was the decisive behind these works is testified to by the house in Burrel's Field, Cambridge that Hodgkinson realized for the retiring master of Trinity College, Lord Adrian, in 1964. Hodgkinson would assert his ultimate prowess as an independent architect with his monumental urban set-piece known as the Brunswick Centre under development and re-development between 1965 and 1973.
   It is possible to argue that the Brunswick Centre is an ultimate Neo-Brutalist work at an urban scale since executed throughout in beton brut establishes itself as a city-in-miniature, that is as a micro-cosmic city with the city, one which breaks totally within the traditional Georgian square and street patter by which it is confronted on the Marchmont Street side. It has the problematic character of being conceived in section rather than in plan in as much as it comprises two stepped five-story housing blocks facing each other across a central promenade axis, flanked with shops throughout its length plus a cinema at the point of a monumental transverse axis lead to a nearby park.
   Like Hodgkinson Miller was also working in the Martin/St. John Wilson in Cambridge before opening up his own practice with Alan Colquhoun in 1960 with a commission to design a secondary school in Stratford in East London which is completed in 1964. Like Caius College, it is significant that this two story, load-bearing structure occupies a perfect square in plan from into which voids are 'excavated' as it were in order to produce the figure of the school which in its turn is wrapped a central square double-height assembly hall.
   It is obvious in retrospect that the plan of this school is closely related to the interlocking square top-lit reading rooms that Martin and St. John Wilson designed for the new Oxford University library complex under construction from 1959 to 1979. It is possibly fair to say that that the British 'neo-brutalist' sensibility much influenced by Aalto plays itself out in the work of Martin and his colleagues, throughout the 70's in what was one final effort to create a normative modern architecture for the British Isles to be executed primarily in brick.

AB  - Many carnivores have been seriously impacted by the expansion of transportation systems and networks; however we know little about carnivore response to the extent and magnitude of road mortality, or which age classes may be disproportionately impacted. Recent research has demonstrated that wildlife-vehicle-collisions (WVC) involving carnivores are modulated by temporal and spatial factors. Thus, we investigated road mortality on a guild of small and medium-sized carnivores in southern Portugal using road-kill data obtained from a systematic 36 months monitoring period along highways (260 km) and national roads (314 km) by addressing the following questions: (a) which species and age class are most vulnerable to WVC? (b) are there temporal and/or spatial patterns in road-kill? and (c) which life-history and/or spatial factors influence the likelihood of collisions? We recorded a total of 806 carnivore casualties, which represented an average of 47 ind./100 km/year. Red fox and stone marten had the highest mortality rates. Our findings highlight three key messages: (1) the majority of road-killed individuals were adults of common species; (2) all carnivores, except genets, were more vulnerable during specific life-history phenological periods: higher casualties were observed when red fox and stone marten were provisioning young, Eurasian badger casualties occurred more frequently during dispersal, and higher Egyptian mongoose mortality occurred during the breeding period; and (3) modeling demonstrated that favorable habitat, curves in the road, and low human disturbance were major contributors to the deadliest road segments. Red fox carcasses were more likely to be found on road sections with passages distant from urban areas. Conversely, stone marten mortalities were found more often on national roads with high of cork oak woodland cover; Egyptian mongoose and genet road-kills were found more often on road segments close to curves. Based on our results, two key mitigation measures should help to reduce WVC in Portugal. The first involves the improvement of existing crossings with buried and small mesh size fence to guide the individuals towards to the passages, in road segments with high traffic volume (>1200 vehicles/night) and located in preferred carnivore habitats. The second mitigation involves cutting or removal of dense vegetation in verges of road segments with curves to aid motorists in seeing animals about to cross. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Bolu Basin in northwestern Turkey, situated in the western part of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), displays the neotectonic features of a pull apart basin. The long axis of the basin extends east-west, parallel to the fault zone and Bolu city, situated in the central part of this basin, was extensively damaged during the 17 August 1999 M=7.4 and 12 November 1999 M=7.2 earthquakes. The master strand of the North Anatolian Fault Zone cuts through the basin close to its southern edge and movement on this strand has caused tilting of the basin floor towards the south because of a small dip slip component. Almacik Mountain, to the west of the Bolu Basin, is interpreted as a plate flake and appears to play a role in the bifurcation of the North Anatolian Fault Zone around the Duzce Basin, to the west of Bolu. Thus the surface fracture associated with the right-lateral strike-slip Golyaka-Kaynasli segment of the NAFZ (which caused the 12 November 1999 M=7.2 earthquake in this region), can be traced along the northern flank of Almacik Mountain and may extend into the middle of the Bolu Basin from the west. The northern boundary of this basin is controlled mainly by an E-W-striking oblique-slip normal fault with a right-lateral strike-slip component but a major NE-SW-trending younger fracture (Kocasu Fault) has also influenced the kinematic behaviour of this sector of the NAFZ and the adjacent basin. It is concluded that the Bolu Basin opened as a pull-apart basin since the Early Pleistocene between the northern boundary faults and southern master strand, and within the complex stress-field reflected in this still-active fault regime. It has continued to develop in this style, despite the regional transpressional stress field prevailing in the western sector of the northwards-convex North Anatolian Fault Zone. New radiometric dates obtained from travertine deposits developed along the NAFZ master strand on the southern border of the Bolu Basin show that the basin is older than 3 x 10(5) years. Dip-slip normal faults observed in the poorly consolidated Quaternary fluvial sediments forming the basin floor display both ENE-WSW and N-S trends, in accordance with the transtensional kinematics of a pull-apart. The 4.5 metre co-seismic right-lateral displacement in the middle part of the Glyaka-Kaynasli segment of the NAFZ that occurred during the 12 November 1999 earthquake appears to have loaded stress on to the eastern part of this segment, possibly causing it to propagate eastwards, into the middle of the Bolu pull-apart basin and creating an east-west-trending high strain zone north of Bolu city, suggesting the route of the possible continuation of the segment.

AB  - (Aspects of the biology and phenology of Oryza latifolia Desv. (Poaceae) in the Pantanal wetland in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil). Oryza latifolia, a wild species of rice, aquatic emergent, tolerant of flooding, occurs on floodplains of the Pantanal wetland, mainly in the Paraguay River sub-region. The aim of this study was to describe aspects of the biology and phenology of O. latifolia in two areas (Serra do Amolar and Bracinho) along the Paraguay River, in the township of Corumba (state of Mato Grosso do Sul). Five patches of wild rice were observed in each area. Twenty replicates of quadrats (1m x 1m) were randomly established monthly in each patch, and percent cover was estimated; flowering, fruiting, production of dry inflorescence and water depth were monitored from December 2006 to November 2007. Percent cover is correlated with water level and day length in the plots, reaching up to 80% at flood time in both areas. Recruitment of seedlings occurs during the dry season only on the plot edges. The reproductive phase of the species is short and starts after the flood peak. This period is correlated with a set of environmental variables such as day length and water level. Dispersal occurs by barochory, hydrochory and ictiochory, at the onset of receding water, and seeds stay viable for five months up to the dry period.

AB  - The present work establishes a discussion about the areas under risk of accidents by mass-wasting in Serra do Pilar, located in the Vila Nova de Gaia - Portugal. The analysis base was the topographic map of Vila Nova de Gaia in scale of 1: 2000 and images available on Google Earth software. The analyzes have been accomplished through field works by access of the community with describing the houses' characteristics (construction material, finishing work, size, and contention works) as well as the area features indicating susceptibility to mass-wasting. To determine the location of field observations and of the houses at risk, we used a recipient of the Global Positioning System (GPS). For the georeferencing and vectorial edition of the topographic map and images, we have applied the SPRING 4.2, while for the elaboration of the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) the applicative applied was the Surfer 8.0. The final edition of the maps has been accomplished in the Corel Draw graphic program. The houses are made of masonry showing an assorted level of finishing work. One can observe two situations regarding the susceptibility to mass-wasting: a portion with the occurrence of rocks exposure in highly accentuated declines and other portion where occurs a concentration of the water flow with the development of a soil/alterite which allows the vegetation fixing. At least six cut landings are verified in the back and front of the houses. Such cuts, together with the saturation of regolith with pluvial water and sewer accumulation, may act as conductors of the occurrence of processes in the slope. The most serious situations occur where the thickening of the occupations is larger in the center-west region. In order to decrease the risks, it is necessary to carry out a plan of structural interventions addressed to their reduction or erradication in concomitance with the searching for a community organization that may be participative in the projects of permanent monitoring and of accidents prevention.

AB  - Field analysis and differential interferometry derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) of the epicentral area of the May 12 2008 M (w) 8.0 Wenchuan (ae +/- a center dot e) earthquake zone reveal details about fault ruptures and ground displacements, with field-documented vertical offsets reaching 12 m along the trace of the main fault rupture, and PALSAR-measured horizontal displacements reaching 12.3 m. We document slip indicators on the fault scarp that show initially sub-horizontal then progressively steeper slip increments with time along the same fault during the 2 min earthquake, suggesting that the rupture propagated as a mixed Mode II-III fracture, with strike-slip movement at the tip directing energy from the initial rupture to points north of the epicenter, followed by vertical displacement in the interior of the slipped region. Field, seismic, and PALSAR-measured displacements are dominantly thrust near the epicentral region, and dextral in northeasterly areas, showing that slip was partitioned along the fault in space and time during the earthquake. The changing slip directions may correlate with three main pulses of energy release at 0, 23, and 57 s during the earthquake as recorded by seismograms. The earthquake generated massive landslides > 100 km north of the epicenter along the trace of the fault. These massive sturzstroms formed where entire mountainsides collapsed and moved at high velocity down populated mountain valleys, jumping smaller mountains and ricocheting off steep canyon walls. These avalanches rode on cushions of water and compressed air that generated air blasts from beneath the debris, knocking down trees high on opposing mountain slopes. The concentration of massive landslides and ground deformation so far north of the epicenter was related to the Mode II-III fracture propagation focusing seismic energy along the fault towards the north, explaining why so much devastation occurred > 100 km from the epicenter, such as in the destroyed city of Beichuan (aOEua center dot e). Understanding near-surface earthquake processes and geological hazards associated with massive earthquakes in populated mountainous areas has the potential to save many lives in the future.

AB  - Nature-like fishways have been designed with the intent to reconnect river corridors and provide passage for all species occurring in a system. The approach is gaining popularity both in Europe and North America, but performance of these designs has not been quantitatively evaluated in a field setting for any North American species. Two nature-like fishways and three technical fishways in New England were evaluated for passage of anadromous adult alewives Alosa pseudoharengus by using passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry. A perturbation boulder rock ramp (32 m long; 4.2% slope) constructed in Town Brook (Plymouth, Massachusetts) passed 94% of the fish that made passage attempts, with most fish ascending the ramp in less than 22 min. In the East River (Guilford, Connecticut), a step-pool bypass design (48 m long; 7.1% slope) passed only 40% of attempting fish, with a median transit time of 75 min. In Town Brook, a technical pool-and-weir fishway (14 m long; 14.3% slope) exhibited poor entry and poor passage for the fish. In contrast, in the East River, two technical steeppass fishways (3 m long; 29.6% and 9.6% slopes) passed the majority of available fish, although one of these steeppass fishways may have lacked sufficient flow to attract fish to the entrance. In both Town Brook and the East River, tagged fish passed rapidly downstream through all fishways after spawning. In the East River, the amount of time fish spent in the spawning habitat before migrating downstream ranged from 1 to 41 d. These studies demonstrate that some nature-like and technical fishway designs can effectively facilitate passage of alewives, but a fishway's location in relation to a spillway is important, and further evaluations are required to more precisely identify the influence of the vertical drop per pool and the specific local hydraulics on alewife behaviors and passage performance.

AB  - To establish existing conditions for dredge material beneficial use projects and to help implement principles of Regional Sediment Management (RSM) into projects and studies, this paper is an assessment of sediment sources and sinks, physical processes, and longshore sediment transport along the west and south shore of Lake Erie. This summary compiles information from a widely scattered technical literature and synthesizes the results in preparation for development of a sediment budget.
   The U.S. shore of Lake Erie has 28 river or harbor mouths protected with jetties and structures, of which 16 are Federal navigation projects. Much of the sediment management since the mid-1800s has revolved around providing safe navigation, maintaining depth in navigation channels, and disposing of the dredged material.
   Sediment sources include material brought down the rivers (often fine-grained); industrial dumping and runoff from sewers, gravel, sand, and clay eroded from glacial till bluffs and clay banks; sediment created in situ from bedrock bluff weathering (primarily from shale); and limited supply from lake bed lowering and offshore outcrops. Losses include wave- and ice-induced transport to deep water, sediment trapped in fillets at harbor jetties, sediment dredged from harbor entrance channel and placed in confined disposal facilities (CDFs) or placed offshore, bluff armoring, and (formerly) beach mining.
   Today, the south shore of Lake Erie is severely sand-starved compared with conditions that existed 200 years ago. The lack of available sediment is largely due to man-made causes. As the shore developed and became urbanized after the mid-1800s, residents, industries, and municipalities attempted to arrest bluff erosion with the use of structures and vegetation. Now the U.S. shoreline of Lake Erie is almost 83% protected, a larger percentage than any ocean coast except in urban areas. It means that little sediment exchange occurs compared with predeveloped conditions, which, in turn, means that managers must recycle and reuse existing sediment to maintain recreation beaches. Managing sediment to benefit a region sustainably potentially will save money, allow use of natural processes to solve engineering problems, and improve recreation resources and natural habitat.

CP  - ASME 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability
AB  - This paper highlights the work done by the authors to develop and test a novel, biologically inspired, non-rotational wind energy extraction device. This device capitalizes on the principles of a wind deflected shaft and vortex induced vibrations to generate micro-scale power. Piezoelectric and magnetic flux methods are explored as options to convert the stored energy of mechanical deflection to electrical power.
   The device is modeled after long-stemmed grasses, grains, and bamboos and geometrically mimics their aspect ratio in order to replicate their movement in low altitude, turbulent flows. This design is based on a significant sampling of the shaft aspect ratios and head shapes of naturally occurring biological samples collected in the field. This concept has been affectionately christened the AWOG (Amber Waves of Grain) and shows promise for use in highly turbulent, low-level air flows close to the ground or mounting surface. Potential operating sites of the AWOG, include locations very close to ground level, along building rooflines, and in urban settings.
   To determine the efficiency and power output of a single AWOG unit, wind tunnel testing and in-situ field testing were performed. Power stored in a single deflected AWOG has been experimentally determined to be 430 w/m<^>2, which is comparable to existing wind turbine designs. Initial tests outlined in this paper are only able to recover a fraction of the stored energy.
   Practical applications of AWOG units would be to use them in formation and examinations are included for several proposed grouping methods. Analysis is performed to determine the ideal arrangement for grouped AWOG units based on experimental and field data from biological specimens and wind tunnel tests. This includes analyzing the effect that different configurations have on individual power output and efficiency of the formation as a whole. Recommendations are made as to the feasibility of use in a variety of settings and consideration is given concerning scaling of the AWOG to the micro-scale and to larger scales.

AB  - Much of the land available for application of biosolids is cropland near urban areas. Biosolids are often applied on hay or grassland during the growing season or on corn ground before planting or after harvest in the fall. In this study, mesophilic anaerobic digested (MAD) biosolids were applied at 56,000 L/ha on a sandy-loam soil over large containment lysimeters seeded to perennial covers of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), or planted annually to maize (Zea mays L). Portable rainfall simulators were to maintain the lysimeters under a nearly saturated (90%, volumetric basis) conditions. Lysimeter leachate and surface ponded water samples were collected and analyzed for somatic phage, adenoviruses, and anionic (chloride) and microbial (P-22 bacteriophage) tracers. Neither adenovirus nor somatic phage was recovered from the leachate samples. P-22 bacteriophage was found in the leachate of three lysimeters (removal rates ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 log(10)/m). Although the peak of the anionic tracer breakthrough occurred at a similar pore volume in each lysimeter (around 0.3 pore volume) the peak of P-22 breakthrough varied between lysimeters (<0.1, 0.3 and 0.7 pore volume). The early time to peak breakthrough of anionic and microbial tracers indicated preferential flow paths, presumably from soil cracks, root channels, worm holes or other natural phenomena. The concentration of viral contaminants collected in ponded surface water ranged from 1 to 10% of the initial concentration in the applied biosolids. The die off of somatic phage and P-22 in the surface water was fit to a first order decay model and somatic phage reached background level at about day ten. In conclusion, sandy-loam soils can effectively remove/adsorb the indigenous viruses leached from the land-applied biosolids, but there is a potential of viral pollution from runoff following significant rainfall events when biosolids remain on the soil surface.

AB  - On May 1st 2008 Mount Chait,n (southern Chile) interrupted a long period of quiescence, generating a sequence of explosive eruptions and causing the evacuation of Chait,n town located a few kilometers south of the volcano. The activity was characterized by several explosive events each associated with plumes which reached up to about 19 km above sea level. The products were dispersed across a wide area, with the finest ash reaching the Atlantic coast of Argentina. Our field observations in the proximal-medial area (3-25 km from the vent) indicate that the May 2008 tephra deposit consists of numerous layers, most of which can be correlated with individual eruptive events. These layers vary from extremely fine-grained ash to layers of lapilli and blocks, composed of both juvenile and lithic material. Here we describe the stratigraphy and physical characteristics of the May 2008 deposits, and propose a reconstruction of the timing of the May 2008 events. The deposits are mainly associated with the three main explosive phases which occurred on 1st-2nd May, 3rd-5th May and 6th May, with an estimated bulk tephra volume of 0.5-1.0 km(3) (integration of both exponential and power-law fitting). For the 6th May event, represented by a layer composed mainly of lithic lapilli and blocks (> 2 mm), an isopleth map was compiled from which a 19 km plume height was determined, which is in good agreement with satellite observations.

AB  - In spite of the occurrence of spectacular forms in the granitic basement of Sardinia, geomorphosites m these environments are still poorly known Morphosites of geological interest in northern Sardinia are mainly located along the coastline, favoured by marine act wily processes forming spectacular landscapes Recent geological surveys, focused on the evolution of the hydrographic network of north-eastern Sardinia, outline examples of morphosnes of geological interest linked to the complex evolution of pluton emplacement Schematically the major plutonic units of Sardinia batholith show mainly granodioritic and granitic composition and are broadly crosscut by late-satellite stocks mainly of fine-grained granites, as well as by a dike swarm of basaltic and aplogranitic rocks The Fizza Ona outcrop, located near the small town of Padru west of Olbia, is a good example of morphosite in the inner zone developed at the edge of different plutonic units It is a well exposed pillow-like horizon that does not exceed 5 m in thickness, observable in the field at least for 200 m, underlined by the occurrence of large lafont form. In detail, the pillow-like horizon is made up of sub-roundly to subrounded elements of granitic to micropegmatitic rocks up to 100 cm in diameter, dispersed into the fine-grained granitic host-rock matrix, these elements are commonly edged by a continuous greenly coloured corona of aphyric rocks that does not exceed 5 cm in thickness In the field, the observed pillow-like structure looks-like the mingling structures commonly observed for mafic and acidic magma interactions Under the microscope however, aphyric rocks may be classified as granophyres, graphic textures are commonly observed in the surrounding fine-grained rocks In addition, similar granitic composition observed m samples of investigated area, indicate that pillow-like structures may be due to the occurrence of local filter-press mechanism under fast-cooling conditions (i e. granophyric and graphic textures occurrence), during the emplacement in upper crustal levels of satellite bodies Overall, the outcrop represents a quite good and rare example of emplacement mechanism of granitic magmas of the Sardinian batholith Collapse, dismembering and complex uplift of several parts forming the hercynian collisional chain, favoured the development of deep valleys and the incision of the erosional surface in the so called "Salti di Budduso" plateau
   The hydrographic network is strictly controlled by the structural features of exposed granitoids The upper part of this plateau indicates a strong denudation process of the Sardinia block at the end of the hercynian orogenesis (the so-called post-hercynian peuepiano), to be later redefined mainly during Oligo-Miocene time
   Many preserved forms underlined the up mentioned denudation processes testified by the occurrence of mselbergs that characterize the whole Gallura landscapes as well as the north-eastern tilting of northern block of Sardinia basement referable to the Oligo-Miocene tectonic movements

AB  - A loess landslide occurred in the morning of October 6, 2006, in Gaolou district of Daming town, Hua country, Shaanxi, China. The landslide originated from a valley side slope of the loess 'yuan' (dissected loess plateau), below which many houses are densely located. The displaced materials smashed several houses and killed 12 persons, after traveling down a long but gentle valley channel. Field surveys revealed that the displaced materials were highly fluidized. Because there was no rainfall before this event, the leakage of irrigation water from the canal on the top of the slope may be the reason for the initiation. To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the initiation and movement of this landslide, laboratory tests on the loess samples from the source area were performed.

AB  - A moderate size earthquake (ML 4.3, Mw 4.0) occurred in southeastern England on 28 April 2007. The earthquake was of some significance as it caused damage in the town of Folkestone and produced the largest peak horizontal ground acceleration (PGA, 0.1g) measured in the United Kingdom to date. It was followed by 12 aftershocks between ML 0.8 and 1.7. The earthquake was the first of this size recorded by a significant number of newly installed broadband stations in the United Kingdom. The hypocenter of the event was at a depth of about 5 km beneath Folkestone, with an error ellipse indicating horizontal errors in a location of about 5 km. The depth was well constrained using a number of techniques, of which local travel-time inversion and teleseismic depth phase modelling are most reliable. A stress drop of 28.6 bars and a source radius of 0.5 km were determined from the analysis of displacement source spectra. We derived a near-surface attenuation factor kappa = 0.02 from the aftershock data that were used in the spectral analysis of the mainshock. Applying the horizontal to vertical (H/V) spectral ratio technique to microtremor data recorded at a station 2 km from the epicenter revealed site amplification at frequencies of 0.4 and 3.9 Hz. This amplification is likely to have contributed to the mainshock PGA of 0.1g measured at the same site. Similar site conditions may have been responsible for the damage in parts of Folkestone. The moment tensor computed from regional broadband data showed a strike-slip mechanism with a normal component and either right-lateral movement on a west-southwest-east-northeast-striking or left-lateral movement on a north-northwest-south-southeast-striking nodal plane. The north-northwest-south-southeast-striking nodal plane matches the trend of the main faults affecting the Kent coalfield and also possibly the Variscan front. It is thus possible that the causative fault was associated with the Variscan front, a major structural boundary at the northern limit of late Carboniferous folding and thrusting.

AB  - In order to construct a predictive scheme of short-term torrential rainfall events over NE China a case study is made of the development of a meso-beta-scale convective system (MCS) that produced exceptionally heavy rainfall there on August 10, 2006, together with meso-scale environment, by means of automatic station data, satellite imagery and conventional observations. As an event of 100-yr return character, the downpour occurring in the central-western portion of NE China produced the maximal 1-hr precipitation of 90.8 mm at Tailai, with 82 mm thereof in the latter half hour. IR satellite and high-resolution visible cloud maps are employed to investigate how the MCS evolved from a meso-gamma into a meso-alpha MCC (Meso Convective Complex). Analysis shows that associated with higher than 33 mm in 30 min at 6 city-and county-level regions, the MCS was separated into 2 phases. In the first phase, i.e., before the MCC formation, the MCS moved mainly eastward, merging finally into the MCC, and in the second phase, i.e., the MCC mature stage, the MCS were in the southwestern fringe of the MCC, with the strongest precipitation observed there. Inspection of even higher-resolution visible images yields that where the northern and western cumulus lines met, the MCS developed vigorously enough to produce downpour. Examination of the MCS intensification and precipitation happening indicates that 1) high temperature, high humidity and convectively unstable stratification existed over the rainbelt, in conjunction with significant increase in convective available potential energy and decline of lifted condensation level and free convective height, in favor of the torrential rains; 2) mergence of meso-beta scale cloud clusters allowed MCS to develop quickly for rainfall; 3) the northern and western cumulus lines corresponded to two convergence lines on the surface wind field and at their meeting point strong convergence resulted in sufficiently intensely growing meso-beta cloud clusters to produce rainfall. Analysis of MCS propagation southwestward in the MCC yields that the movement of the rainstorm-producing MCS was dependent on the shift direction and velocity of the convergence lines.

AB  - A Mw 6.3 magnitude earthquake occurred on October 6, 2008 in southern Damxung County within the N-S trending Yangyi graben, which forms the northern section of the Yadong-Gulu rift of south-central Tibet. The earthquake had a maximum intensity of IX at the village of Yangyi (also Yangying) (29 degrees 43.3'N: 90 degrees 23.6'E) and resulted in 10 deaths and 60 injured in this sparsely populated region. Field observations and focal mechanism solutions show normal fault movement occurred along the NNE-trending western boundary fault of the Yangyi graben, in agreement with the felt epicenter, pattern of the isoseismal contours, and distribution of aftershocks. The earthquake and its tectonic relations were studied in detail to provide data on the seismic hazard to the nearby city of Lhasa.
   The Damxung earthquake is one of the prominent events along normal and strike-slip faults that occurred widely about Tibet before and after the 2008 Mw 7.9 magnitude Wenchuan earthquake. Analysis of these recent M >= 5.0 earthquake sequences demonstrate a kinematic relation between the normal, strike-slip, and reverse causative fault movements across the region. These earthquakes are found to be linked and the result of eastward extrusion of two large structural blocks of central Tibet. The reverse and oblique-slip surface faulting along the Longmenshan thrust belt at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau causing the Wenchuan earthquake, was the result of eastward directed compression and crustal shortening due to the extrusion. Prior to it, east-west extensional deformation indicated by normal and strike-slip faulting events across central Tibet, had led to a build up of the compression to the east. The subsequent renewal of extensional deformational events in central Tibet appears related to some drag effect due to the crustal shortening of the Wenchuan event. Unraveling the kinematical relation between these earthquake swarms is a very helpful approach for understanding the migration of strong earthquakes across Tibet. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Primula veris that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and diseases, history and conservation.
   Primula veris is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte, mostly found in well-drained, herb-rich meadows and grasslands, in scrub or woodland rides and edges, and on calcareous cliffs. It occurs on base-rich loams or clays, on limestone, and sometimes in dunes.
   Native to the British Isles, it is characteristic of many mesotrophic and calcicolous lowland grassland communities, but it also extends into upland valleys in northern England and Scotland. In Ireland it is also native and most abundant in the central plain. Primula veris occurs throughout the temperate areas of Europe as far east as the Russian border.
   Primula veris is a shade-intolerant species that shows reduced performance and flowering under shade or increased competition. The species is not able to penetrate anoxic soil layers and is therefore mostly absent from locations that are characterized by a high water table. It has a well-developed drought tolerance.
   Primula veris is an obligate outbreeder which entirely depends on foraging insects for successful pollination. Although the species shows heterostyly, with two reciprocal morphs (pin and thrum), only relatively low levels of intermorph pollination have been reported. Seed dispersal is restricted to a few centimetres from maternal plants, whereas pollen flow is wider, but still limited to a few metres from parental plants. Both are factors that contribute to a significantly fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood size.
   At several locations throughout the British Isles, P. veris occurs together with P. elatior and especially P. vulgaris. The hybrid P. veris x P. vulgaris = P. x polyantha occurs frequently in mixed populations, whereas the hybrid P. veris x P. elatior = P. x media has been rarely reported in Britain.
   Although P. veris is still a widespread grassland herb, it is less abundant in the British Isles and continental Europe than before. This decline can be attributed to changes in land-use practices, such as the loss of traditional hay-meadow management, the loss of grazing and an increase of ploughing, in combination with ongoing destruction and nutrient enrichment of permanent grasslands. However, from 1980 onwards the species has increased substantially in many areas of the UK, largely because its seeds are included in wildflower seed-mixtures that are sown on new or upgraded road and motorway verges, embankments and urban conservation areas.

AB  - The devastating earthquake that occurred in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China, on the 12th May 2008, caused widespread damage and devastation to rural communities and economy. The terrain of the entire region has been weakened and is now highly susceptible to long-term slope instability that will trouble this region for many years to come. Before the earthquake, the maximum seismic intensity expected in the region was VI-VIII in the 12-degree Liedu scale (the intensity measure adopted in China). However, the actual intensity caused by the earthquake ranged between VIII and XI. The seismic intensity map is practical for regional guidance but lacks the detail to provide an adequate representation of the true damage level, in terms of current status and future potential in such a seismically active and populated region, especially when the hazards and risks are likely to be multiple and cascading in high relief areas. This paper presents a GIS based novel approach to earthquake damage zone modelling using satellite remote sensing and DEM data. The novelty is to take into account the co-seismic ground deformation (measured using differential SAR interferometry) as an important modulating factor in modelling the susceptibility of earthquake related geohazards, together with conventional multi-criteria factors which draw on geological and topographical variables such as rock competence, slope, proximity to drainage, and fracture density. The modulating effect of the earthquake greatly enhances the susceptibility in the areas where the majority of the ensuing landslides and debris-flows actually took place. When this susceptibility model is further modulated by the mapped surface disruption caused by the earthquake (which encompasses all forms of mass movement and urban destruction), it is directly linked to seismic intensity and we call it "earthquake damage". The output earthquake damage map represents both the current damage status as well as the future damage (hazard) potential. The resulting earthquake damage map for the Beichuan region clearly defines a series of zones of increasing seismic intensity, approximately corresponding to Liedu values VIII-XI but with great details.

(2) For the profiles at southwestern and western Huaiyuan Town, the rapid uplift in Late Himalayan initiated front 20Ma in the west to 7 similar to 5Ma in the east and continued up to now, i. e., the beginning time of the uplift became younger from west to east, which is well corresponding with the eastwards progressive thrusting of the Longmenshan orogeny. (3) Some of local uplift events occurred at 165 similar to 155Ma, 140 similar to 77Ma and 55 similar to 22Ma.

AB  - Hybrid zones between species provide natural systems for the study of processes involved in divergence, reproductive isolation and speciation. Townsend's Dendroica townsendi and black-throated green D. virens warblers are phenotypically and genetically divergent groups that occur in western and eastern North America respectively, with potential for range contact in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, where other west-east avian pairs come into contact. Although one potential hybrid (a phenotypic Townsend's warbler with the black-throated green mitochondrial DNA) has been previously reported, there have been no studies of interactions between the taxa in potential areas of sympatry. To determine whether interbreeding between these species is a regular occurrence we examined variation in individuals across the area of putative range overlap. Analysis of plumage, morphology, and mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear molecular markers (CHD1Z and numt-Dco1) shows surprisingly extensive hybridization between these species, with at least 38% of individuals in the hybrid zone being either hybrids or backcrosses. Each of the traits displays a sigmoidal cline centred along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains (molecular cline centres averaging 50 km east of the crest of the Rockies, ranging from 41 to 56 km). The clines are narrow (average molecular cline width is 60 km, ranging from 40 to 87 km) relative to the dispersal distance of related warbler species, suggesting that selection is maintaining the hybrid zone; we discuss possible sources of selection. Given the narrowness of the zone we recommend the two forms should continue to be treated as separate taxonomic species. Townsend's warblers also form an extensively studied hybrid zone with their more closely related southern relative, the hermit warbler D. occidentalis. The combined system of three discrete forms separated by narrow hybrid zones provides an excellent system for the study of hybridization, reproductive isolation and speciation.

AB  - Coxiella burnetii is an environmentally resistant bacterium that has been reported in wildlife populations. Frequent contact on pasture between white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and cattle has been reported by farmers in the Northeast U.S., and transmission of C. burnetii is thought to occur between wild deer and domestic livestock such as cows, sheep, and goats. Blood samples were collected from white-tailed deer throughout New York State in 2009 and 2010 and examined for anti-C. burnetii phase II antibodies via indirect microimmunofluorescence assays. Exploratory spatial cluster analysis revealed a lack of significant clustering of C. burnetii-seropositive deer. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between the C. burnetii serostatus of deer and sex, percent agriculture, shrub, and forest cover, and townships with more than 10 bovine herds. A lack of significant association was revealed between the serostatus of deer and the year of sampling, soil type, percent wetland and open water cover, total annual precipitation, and townships with more than two sheep or goat herds. Because four different land cover types were associated with a higher probability of C. burnetii seropositivity, it is likely that land cover is not a discriminating factor in C. burnetii exposure. This is probably because C. burnetii environmental contamination is widespread and not localized to certain cover types. The social behavior of male deer may contribute to the lack of spatial clustering. Bucks typically travel over greater distances, which leads to a greater variety of encountered environments and a greater chance for exposure to C. burnetii. Because increasing agricultural land cover and townships with greater than 10 bovine herds are associated with an increased probability of diagnosing a seropositive deer, it appears likely that transmission of C. burnetii between domestic livestock and white-tailed deer may occur.

AB  - During the landslide emergency many kinds of data, even if preliminary, can help to better understand the complexity of the investigated phenomenon and to give a valid contribution to the successive damage valuation. The electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method was applied for investigating the deep characteristics of a landslide body that occurred in March 2006 close to Potenza town in Basilicata region (southern Italy): the landslide slid on a road near some farmers' houses which had to be evacuated. The information obtained by the application of this indirect technique appeared to be particularly useful for end users involved in the risk management. The high resolution of the 2D ERT technique allowed the detection of possible sliding surfaces and the characterization of high water content areas in which the increase of the saturation degree and of pore pressures could cause a weakening of the slopes and a reactivation of the movement. Due to the comparison between ERT results and stratigraphical data from boreholes carried out in the area it was possible to decide on the adoption of other evacuation decrees.

AB  - This paper reports the first systematic excavations at Essouk-Tadmakka (Mali), one of the major West African trading towns that enabled the unprecedented flourishing of trans-Saharan trade during the early Islamic era (c. AD 650-1500). The 6.5 m excavated sequence (dating from the mid-first millennium AD to c. 1400) significantly improves understanding of Essouk-Tadmakka's 'prehistoric' and historic periods and, in doing so, provides a wealth of new evidence to help answer key questions about early Islamic trans-Saharan trade. Firstly, the excavations shed light on the changing scale of trade over time and space, providing unprecedented early (eighth/ninth century AD) evidence for extensive trade and new ideas about the geography of early trade routes. Additionally, new ideas are provided on socio-cultural developments in the trade, including changes that occurred both during the Almoravid expansion and the rule of the Empire of Mali. Lastly, the excavations significantly improve understanding of the movement of trans-Saharan commodities, especially gold.

TI  - A Non-Uniform Uniform System. The Implementation of the Soviet Passport System in the Estonian SSR
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA  - Estonian
KW  - CRIME
AB  - This article continues the examination of the Soviet passport system, focusing on the establishment of the passport system in the Estonian SSR during 1945-1947 and the so-called "consolidation of the passport system" during the subsequent years. NKVD, MGB, MVD, Militia Administration and Passport Department reports and statistical summaries that have thus far been little used provide the main source base for this research.
   The mechanism of internal passports and the compulsory registration of one's place of residence, the so called Uniform Passport System established in the Soviet Union in the early 1930's, remained in effect almost without change through six decades. The passport system was established in the Estonian SSR after the war in three stages: the urban population was provided with passports in 1945, the residents of the border zone were added to the system in the autumn of 1946, and the remaining rural areas were added in the autumn of 1947. Estonia, together with Latvia and Lithuania, was an exception in the Soviet Union, since the extension of the passport system to the entire population took place elsewhere 30 years later. Continual "consolidation of the passport system" took place during the subsequent years as routine work, consisting of an extensive plan of measures that included the constant checking of the population, keeping records of the movement of people and of their location, and the penalisation of persons caught violating the passport system.
   From the viewpoint of the regime, the passport system was successfully applied in the service of political repressions and by using its possibilities; hundreds of people who had escaped mass deportation were sent to Siberia. Hundreds of people were jailed and banished because they had tried to have a say in choosing their place of residence and employment by violating the rules of the passport system. An estimated 5000 criminal convictions were meted out during the post-war Soviet period in 1944-1941 in the Estonian SSR for "violating the passport system", with an additional 400 000 administrative cases. This immense amount demonstrated the regime's "willingness" to totally control its population.
   The system was not successful in achieving its objectives. Large gaps occurred in the control of migration and the curbing of crime failed. Regardless of its great potential, the system was not particularly effective. It got bogged down in bureaucracy and dealt with keeping records of minor details. Regardless of this, the passport system kept people in fetters and in fear through its existence and disciplined the citizenry.

AB  - The painter Remedios Varo was born in Angles, a town in the province of Gerona, situated to the north of Barcelona. She acquired her artistic background in the Escuela de Bellas Artes in Madrid. Her life, however, was to be marred by political instability in Spain and the events of the Civil War. These circumstances led her to immigrate first to France where she established contact with the members of Surrealism. This movement had a deep influence on her work. Her life in France was further interrupted by the Nazi occuation in 1940 and she was forced to immigrate to Mexico where she lived until her death. In Mexico she was able to continue her work and her inquiries into the nature of art. Above all, she was able to achieve her own language. Her paintings would thus be de fined. In her paintings, feminine issues, daily life, the domestic world of home and the things that fill it, and in addition, nature and the cosmos, all were inspired by an artistic conscience that sees the world as a planet where everything is linked in a network of relationships.

AB  - Relative Contribution of Potential Modes of Surface Dust Lead Contamination in the Homes of Boatyard Caulkers: Orrapan UNTIMANON, et al. Bureau of Occupational and Environmental Diseases, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand Objectives: The aim of this study was to quantify the relative contributions to surface lead contamination of boat-caulkers' houses of three contamination modes, namely "take-home" lead from the caulker, "natural" spatial dispersal from boatyard to household and "redistribution" of accumulated lead-laden dust within the house. Methods: Boat-caulkers' houses situated in areas surrounding boat repair yards were recruited. Caulkers' houses that were located close together were divided into location-matched pairs, within which one was randomly assigned to be given a cleaning and designated a CL house, and the other was to be left uncleaned and designated a NCL house. Geographically isolated caulker's houses were randomly assigned to one of the two categories. The nearest non-boatyard worker's house (NB) was additionally recruited for each set. The surface lead loading rate (SLLR), defined as the mass of lead deposited in dust per unit area of surface per unit time, was measured over a period of 3 mo in all houses, and the data were modeled using linear mixed effects regression. Results: Adjusted values of SLLR differed only slightly between CL and NCL houses (0.96 to 1.02 times) but were between 1.65 and 2.03 times higher in CL and NCL houses than in NB houses depending on proximity to the boatyard and between 2.12 and 2.61 times higher in houses within one km of a boatyard than in more distant houses depending on category of house. Conclusions: Newly deposited dust lead likely resulted from the take-home and spatial dispersion modes. The contribution of redistribution is very small. (J Occup Health 2012; 54: 165-175)

TI  - The Sketch in Czech Periodicals of the First Half of the Nineteenth Century: A Contribution on an Historical Form
T2  - CESKA LITERATURA
LA  - Czech
AB  - In this article the author discusses the important role of the character sketch in the development of narrative prose in the mid-nineteenth century - its sources for content and form (the accent on description of milieu, the first-person narrator, the realia) helped to overcome the straight-jacket of the influence of the sentimental, novelistic storyline. The article, a result of the author's long-term research on Czech Revivalist periodicals from 1786-1850, brings together material on the typology and development of the sketch. She notes the 1830s-40s boom in sketches and the prestige that the form enjoyed in the period - for instance, the participation of leading writers in its cultivation, its publication in serious periodicals and annuals, and its inclusion with high literature in Jungmann's Slovesnost (Verbal art, 1845). Czech periodicals of the 1830s and 1840s largely contained translations of works by foreign writers including Henry Bonaventure Monnier, Charles Dickens, Charles Paul de Kock, Jules Janin, and Faddei Venediktovich Bulgarin). Translation too, however, contributed to the development of the character sketch, which, on the one hand, adopted the fundamental attributes of the Western form (the moralizing, satirical tone, and attention to problems of big-city life and the special features of marginal peoples), and, on the other hand, pointed out special domestic features, in particular a nationalist and Slavophil propaganda function (for example, the thematization of the Bohemian or Slav countryside, the past and present of the Revival movement, the idealization of the rural Bohemian community as representative of the nation, and a critical, satirical view on national renegades or fashionable jingoism). The author has not, on the other hand, found any of the features that distinguish a Vienna type of Biedermeier 'sketch'. The artistically most valuable, she believes, are original sketches like Frantisek Ladislav Celakovsky's (1799-1852) 'povahopisy', Josef Kajetan Tyl's (1808-1856) Prague and Kutna Hora physiological sketch' influenced both by both Romantic views and by Revivalist ideology, the social-critical and critical patriotic sketch by Karel Havlicek (1821-1856), and the social-anthropological sketch that concentrates on the portrayal of the Bohemian and Slavonic folk by Karel Vladislav Zap (1812-1871) and his wife Honorata (1825-1856), as well as Bozena Nemcova (1820?-1862), Daniel Sloboda (1809-1888), Ludvik Rittersberk (1809-1858), and Bedrich Moser(1821-1864) in his satirical sketch of 1848. In addition to this topic, the author indicates numerous occurrences of a related form, the Lebensbild, which, like the sketch, endeavours to present a milieu, mostly socially problematic, but, more important, seeks to use the story line and the actants. Nemcova's Babicka (The Grandmother, 1855) represents the height of the form.

AB  - Nitrate-N concentrations in the Raccoon River have increased beginning in the early 1970s. Since thus river is the predominant water supply for the City of Des Moines in Iowa, there is concern about the potential long-term impacts of these trends. Improvements in water quality from agricultural watersheds are critical to protect the water supply, and understanding the factors affecting water quality will lead to potential changes in agricultural management to improve water quality. The historical database of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations sampled at the Des Moines Water Works were combined with observations oil N fertilizer use, animal production, crop yields, land-use changes, and precipitation patterns to evaluate these interrelationships. Mean annual NO3-N concentrations in the Raccoon River watershed have been increasing since 1970 in spite of no significant change in N fertilizer use for the past 15 years. There have been three years with maximum NO3-N concentrations above 18 mg L-1. However, these spikes occurred throughout the past 30 years and are not isolated to the last 10 years of record. Nitrate-N loads from the Raccoon River watershed have shown a slight decrease in the past ten years because of the increased crop yields and increased removal of N in the corn (lea mays L.) and soybean (Gylcine max [L.] Merr.) grains. Production numbers for cattle have decreased by 63% since the early 1980s, while hogs have shown a 20% decrease over the same time period. Therefore, N available for application into the basin has decreased by 25%. Annual variations in NO3-N loads are signifcantly related to precipitation in the first five months of the year. A significant correlation was found between the land area within the watershed cropped to small grains and hay crops and the increase of NO3-N since 1970 (r = -0.76). This relationship was caused by alteration in the seasonal water-use patterns and loss of N during the fall or early spring in the water movement in contrast to corn or soybean, which have a limited N uptake pattern concentrated between June and early September. Changes in the water-use patterns caused by shifts in cropping patterns provide an explanation for the positive correlation between precipitation and flow during the early part of the year. Development of agricultural management practices that can potentially affect water quality will have to be more inclusive of all components in agricultural systems, rather than only changing fertilizer rate or timing.

AB  - Hydrophobic treatments are often used in porous ceramic floor tiles to prevent the occurrence of stains during the use phase.
   Premature failure of the ceramic pavement of several apartments and townhouses of a golf resort in Portugal occurred between 2006 and 2007. The problem took place three to four years after application. It consisted of tile detachment, which resulted in markedly irregular pavement surfaces.
   The anomaly affected only those tiles treated with a silicone-based hydrophobization product, regardless of them being located in a ground or upper floor. Similar, but non-hydrophobized tiles, which had been used before in some dwellings, showed no anomalies.
   This article describes the problem in detail and presents the work carried out to identify its causes. It included site-inspections with collection of samples, as well as thermal (EN ISO 10545-8) and moisture (EN ISO 10545-10) expansion tests.
   It is concluded that the anomaly was probably due to the confluence of four main factors: (i) presence of moisture in the buildings; (ii) high moisture expansion of the ceramic tiles, (iii) poor application of the tiles; (iv) use of the hydrophobic treatment in these tiles.

AB  - A large rock avalanche occurred at 03:27:30 PDT, 6 August 2010, in the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex southwest British Columbia. The landslide initiated as a rock slide in Pleistocene rhyodacitic volcanic rock with the collapse of the secondary peak of Mount Meager. The detached rock mass impacted the volcano's weathered and saturated flanks, creating a visible seismic signature on nearby seismographs. Undrained loading of the sloping flank caused the immediate and extremely rapid evacuation of the entire flank with a strong horizontal force, as the rock slide transformed into a debris flow. The disintegrating mass travelled down Capricorn Creek at an average velocity of 64 m s(-1), exhibiting dramatic super-elevation in bends to the intersection of Meager Creek, 7.8 km from the source. At Meager Creek the debris impacted the south side of Meager valley, causing a runup of 270 m above the valley floor and the deflection of the landslide debris both upstream (for 3.7 km) and downstream into the Lillooet River valley (for 4.9 km), where it blocked the Lillooet River river for a couple of hours, approximately 10 km from the landslide source. Deposition at the Capricorn-Meager confluence also dammed Meager Creek for about 19 h creating a lake 1.5 km long. The overtopping of the dam and the predicted outburst flood was the basis for a night time evacuation of 1500 residents in the town of Pemberton, 65 km downstream. High-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery obtained on 16 October 2010 was used to create a post-event digital elevation model. Comparing pre- and post-event topography we estimate the volume of the initial displaced mass from the flank of Mount Meager to be 48.5 x 10(6) m(3), the height of the path (H) to be 2183 m and the total length of the path (L) to be 12.7 km. This yields H/L = 0.172 and a fahrboschung (travel angle) of 9.75A degrees. The movement was recorded on seismographs in British Columbia and Washington State with the initial impact, the debris flow travelling through bends in Capricorn Creek, and the impact with Meager Creek are all evident on a number of seismograms. The landslide had a seismic trace equivalent to a M = 2.6 earthquake. Velocities and dynamics of the movement were simulated using DAN-W. The 2010 event is the third major landslide in the Capricorn Creek watershed since 1998 and the fifth large-scale mass flow in the Meager Creek watershed since 1930. No lives were lost in the event, but despite its relatively remote location direct costs of the 2010 landslide are estimated to be in the order of $10 M CAD.

AB  - In order for the Habsburg Monarchy not to completely insulate itself from the developments that took place in contemporary Europe it had to adapt to them From the mid-18(th) century onwards it was compelled to take account of economic and social changes that were occurring along its borders Sovereigns such as Empress Maria Theresa and her successor Joseph II met the task with a fair degree of success The situation had already become critical during the reign of Leopold II largely due to the aftermath of the French Revolution and wars against Napoleon Emperor Franz 11 proved to be even less capable of keeping the situation under control Regulations introduced by him sometimes appeared a means unto itself Police interference in the lives of subjects was becoming increasingly troublesome
   The construction of transport routes within and beyond the borders of the monarchy began in the mid-18th century Improved connections brought a multitude of noveltius in the state both good and bad An ever-growing portion of the population moved within the state seeking employment selling various products receiving education in different cities or just travelling the country The number of foreign travellers was on the rise as well The central government tried to maintain complete control over the convivial crowd a task most easily accomplished by means of various travel documents The latter were not an invention of the Viennese authorities as the same measures were also employed by other European courts The ban on issuing travel documents to individual groups of the population facilitated surveillance and restriction of their movement Hence the ban on travel was sometimes imposed on individual groups of craftsmen and sometimes on students doctors assistant craftsmen, et, Occasionally the ban applied to travelling to a certain country In this manner, the authorities aimed to keep various vagrants beggars and homeless people from roaming the country Such measures were intensified during preparations for military operations Due to the constant lack of soldiers local authorities were compelled to verify all foreigners arriving in their areas If their documents were not in order they would soon find themselves wearing a military uniform Local authorities also kept a close eye on deserters and often recruited innkeepers to exercise surveilliace and submit daily reports on foreigners coming to their inns
   The police had an important role in supervising both local and foreign travellers The task of the local police was to oversee passengers, its opinion on individual applicants for travel documents was of utmost importance Without its consent an applicant would not be granted a travel document, nor could he or she book a seat on a stagecoach In tunes of relative peace the police slackened their vigilance somewhat allowing imperial royal subjects as well as foreigners to move around more freely However during increased military tensions particularly at the onset of World War I surveillance was immediately intensified

CP  - 23rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS-2010)
AB  - The performance of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is often summarized by three characteristics of the services it provides: availability, continuity and integrity. Integrity is a measure of the probability that a WAAS user computes Hazardously Misleading Information (HMI). The top level WAAS integrity requirement is stated as follows: "The probability of HMI shall not exceed 1x10(-7) per approach (or hour) at any point in the service volume. Undetectable conditions must be extremely rare and follow no predictable pattern. Detectable failures must meet this allocation under the worst detection scenarios."
   WAAS validates the integrity requirement by using a mathematical proof in conjunction with data driven analyses. This proof uses fault tree analysis to show that WAAS meets the top level integrity requirement. The foundation of the proof is predicated on a set of carefully constructed assertions. These assertions require periodic monitoring to ensure that the physical environment has not changed in a manner that would invalidate the claim. Certain satellite failure modes have a priori event probabilities that must be detected and corrected in a reasonable amount of time in order to limit the user's exposure to the failure.
   In each case, the assertion has been carefully scrutinized against the following criteria:
   a. The hazard will occur with a sufficiently small probability.
   b. The hazard does not have a major impact on the user's integrity.
   c. An action exists which can correct the problem.
   The application of such criteria was made after careful consideration from the WAAS Integrity and Performance Panel (WIPP). Offline monitoring is applied in cases where the WIPP, using engineering judgment, concluded that even though the system still would likely meet the integrity requirements even in the face of the hazard, it would be prudent to limit the exposure time to a possible degradation of integrity performance due to some unanticipated change in environmental conditions.
   WAAS has instituted offline monitoring to satisfy this periodic monitoring requirement and the capability to perform this monitoring now resides with the WAAS Operations Group at the FAA's Aeronautical center in Oklahoma City. The monitoring is focused on specific environmental and satellite performance threats. The current environmental factors monitored are reference station measurement error (primarily multipath), ionospheric storms, and movement of reference station antennas. For satellite specific threats, the monitoring includes code carrier coherence, ephemeris, signal quality, and clock runoff. The results from this monitoring are reported quarterly to the WIPP.
   This paper will present the WAAS offline monitoring capability including the specific analyses conducted, representative results, criteria used for pass/fail and the process that WAAS follows should it be determined that a particular assertion may be violated. This process is of particular interest since it determines if the anomalous condition needs to be addressed and the allowable exposure time. The paper will also provide a few examples of WAAS anomalies that this processing is intended to capture.

AB  - An assessment was carried out on the highway from Jimma to Addis Ababa in November 2009 to investigate the incidence and distribution of Mimosa diplotricha. This assessment revealed the occurrence of the weed M. diplotricha on the road sides from Jimma to Wolisso town. The roadsides from Beda Buna, near Jimma town, to Assendabo were seriously invaded whereas patches were observed from Asendabo to Wolisso. The farmers indicated that the weed has invaded the area for the last three to five years and confirmed that the spread of the weed was associated with the road construction from Addis Ababa to Jimma and the allied movement of soils and heavy machineries and vehicles. The literature study confirmed that the weed was known in many parts of the world as an invasive weed. In Ethiopia, there are evidences that indicate the presence of the plant in Southwestern Ethiopia for more than 20 years with the name Mimosa invisa. Mechanical, chemical and biological control methods were attempted in different countries with varying degrees of success. An integrated control method with land management practices has been suggested as the most effective. Though some farmers around Jimma started controlling the plant thicket by burning, no other control method was attempted. To this end, a country-wide survey was suggested on distribution and impacts of the weed and investigations on its biology, ecology, mechanisms of invasion success and its management.

AB  - In this study the factors affecting the retrogressive Yaka Landslide, its mechanism and the hazard of debris flow on the town of Yaka are investigated. In the landslide area, the first landslide was small and occurred in March 2006 on the lower part of the Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope near the Gelendost District town of Yaka (Isparta, SW Turkey). The second, the Yaka Landslide, was large and occurred on 19 February 2007 in the soil-like marl on the central part of Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope. The geometry of the failure surface was circular and the depth of the failure surface was about 3 m. Following the landslide, a 85,800 m(3) of displaced material transformed to a debris flow. Then, the debris flow moved down the Eglence Valley, traveling a total distance of about 750 m. The town of Yaka is located 1,600 m downstream of Eglence Creek and hence poses a considerable risk of debris flow, should the creek be temporarily dammed as a result of further mass movement. Material from the debris accumulation has been deposited on the base of Eglence Valley and has formed a debris-dam lake behind a debris dam. Trees, agricultural areas, and weirs in the Eglence Creek have seen serious damage resulting from the debris flow. The slope angle, slope aspect and elevation of the area in this study were generated using a GIS-based digital elevation model (DEM). The stability of the Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope was assessed using limit equilibrium analysis with undrained peak and residual shear strength parameters. In the stability analyses, laboratory test results performed on the soil-like marls were used. It was determined that the Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope is found to be stable under dry conditions and unstable under completely saturated conditions. The Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope and its vicinity is a paleolandslide area, and there the factor of safety for sliding was found to be about 1.0 under saturated conditions. The Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope and the deposited earthen materials in Eglence Creek could easily be triggered into movement by any factors or combination of factors, such as prolonged or heavy rainfall, snowmelt or an earthquake. It was established that the depth of the debris flow initiated on the Yaka Landslide reached up to 8 m in Eglence Creek at the point it is 20 m wide. If this deposited material in Eglence Creek is set into motion, the canal that passes through Yaka, with its respective width and depth of 7 and 1.45 m, could not possibly discharge the flow. The destruction or spillover of this canal in Yaka could bring catastrophic loss to residents which are located within 3-5 m of the bank of the canal. Furthermore, if material present in the landslide source area slides and this displaced material puts pressure on the unstable deposited material in Eglence Creek, even more catastrophic loss would occur to the town of Yaka. In this study, it was determined that debris flows are still a major hazard to Yaka and its population of 3,000. The results provided in this study could help citizens, planners, and engineers to reduce losses caused by existing and future landslides and debris flow in rainfall and snowmelt conditions by means of prevention and mitigation.

AB  - The underground connections of the special British intelligence services (Section D and MI(R), then SO2 or SOE) to illegal European groups held a special place in the scope of the preparations for the Anti-Nazi and Anti-Fascist resistance. Among the European groups, those of Czech and Slovene/Yugoslav origins had a great deal in common during the first few years. Thus, an "intelligence triangle" formed between British intelligence and the Czech and Slovene/Yugoslav underground movements in the period between the end of 1938 or the beginning of 1939 and the attack of the Axis powers on Yugoslavia in 1941. In this paper, the author offers an insight into the reports of this activity in the original British documents kept in The National Archives in London.
   Since the summer of 1939, the British received an increasing amount of intelligence on the engagement of secret and/or paramilitary organisations/groups in Czechoslovakia, which had begun to set up right after Munich at the end of September 1938. In August 1939 discussions between the British and Czech representatives began. On one hand, the indication of the beginning of Czech resistance gave the British considerable hope that it would be possible to organise an effective resistance. On the other hand, the realisation of those ambitious plans soon met with difficulties as the German invasion effectively protected all important sites. Some other characteristics were revealed as well: the Czechs were willing to engage in serious resistance, but wanted to preserve a certain independence. They decided to use the strategy of waiting for a better moment, when larger scale resistance could be aroused. During the first years of the war, the same general tactics were used by the British, as they doubted that mass resistance movements in occupied lands would succeed right away. Apart from distrust on the part of the British, which to a certain degree included Edvard Bend himself, disagreements among the Czechs were also the causes of some problems.
   During the fist two years, 1939 and 1940, the connections of the Czech underground movement to Section D in the territory of Yugoslavia and the neighbouring countries became more prominent. It was becoming increasingly clear that Yugoslavia would be important to Czechoslovakia and the Czech representatives stressed to the representatives of the British intelligence agencies the need to possess a wireless transmitter in Belgrade and thus form a communication system in a circle throughout Europe. The Czechs chose Yugoslavia as they believed that they could smuggle material and people across its territory. Sending a transmitter to Belgrade was problematic and so difficulties ensued. This was as late as 1940. After that time, MI(R) and Section D began to foster an idea that the Czechs, through their network in Yugoslavia, could contribute to the realisation of one of the most important goals of the time: sabotaging the river Danube. No important objectives were achieved. Trouble was also present when, in June 1940, the sections were united into a single group SO2 and in the following period, as SOE wanted a different kind of cooperation with the Czech underground, particularly those operatives who were evacuated by the British to the Middle East. Obviously, the Czechs acted primarily under the wing of Military Intelligence 6/Secret Intelligence Service, while SOE remained subordinate.
   The beginnings of the underground cooperation of British intelligence and the Czechs in Slovene territory and the cooperation of the latter with Slovene underground organisations were surely influenced by the fact that some Slovenes were already very well connected with the Czechs before the war. Among the most important Slovene operatives, associated with the Czech underground, were Vladimir Kalan, Albert Kramer, Franjo Kokolj, Milko Brezigar and their colleagues in Maribor, Celje, Ljubljana and other Slovene and Yugoslav cities. The most important organisation to be connected with the predecessors of the SOE was Brezigar's "Branco". Meanwhile, the cooperation of Vladimir Vauhnik and Ante Anic with the Czechs remains unexplained. In Slovenia and Yugoslavia, the British generally leaned on representatives of the Czech and Slovak minorities; of these, Branko Plhak was the most important in the territory of Slovenia. With respect to the Czech underground, the most important representatives were Frantisek Hieke (Stoj), Jaroslav Hajicek, Jaroslav Selner, Jaroslav Kaspar, Lobkowitz De Lorne, Karel Fiser and others. Czech refugees were assisted particularly by Brezigar; Ela Potocnik was also important. Some Slovenes from Primorska, operating within the TIGR organisation, like Albert Rejec, Ivan Marija Cok and Ivan Rudolf also cooperated with the Czech underground.
   The results of underground activities of the "intelligence triangle" have practically manifested themselves as the realisation of 11 acts of sabotage, the distributing of Anti-Nazi propaganda and the collecting of intelligence.

AB  - A coarse conglomerate, known as "the Gravel of Reno," fills a deep channel incised into a 2.6 Ma sedimentary section a few km west of Reno, Nevada. The canyon and its conglomerate fill record an abrupt shift in both provenance and paleocurrent direction compared with the underlying lake-marginal Neogene strata. Notably, the intermediate volcanic provenance of the Neogene section is supplemented in the overlying conglomerate by large plutonic clasts derived from the Sierran batholith. The syntectonic Gravel of Reno signals the initiation of Pleistocene faulting along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada near latitude 40 degrees N.
   Structures within the Neogene and Quaternary rocks reveal the progressive deformation of the Sierra Nevada's eastern margin. There is no discordance between the basal Gravel of Reno conglomerate and the underlying Neogene sedimentary section, and both are presently tilted 23 east. Therefore, significant tilting did not occur until after channel incision and deposition of the basal conglomerate. The dip within the Gravel of Reno decreases with stratigraphic height, documenting ongoing tilting during deposition. Several pervasive fault sets cut the Neogene rocks; one set of normal faults probably predates much of the tilting, but strike-slip faults appear to have been active synchronously with it. Fault sets include early west- and northwest-dipping normal faults, and two mutually cross-cutting sets of strike-slip faults: northwest-striking dextral faults and northeast-striking sinistral faults. The most continuous mappable fault surfaces, with probably much of the most recent movement, are north-striking faults with normal or oblique-slip motion. Overall, these faults accommodate east-west extension. In summary, the structural style at the northern termination of the Carson Range is characterized by distributed slip along many minor faults, and faulting was synchronous with tilting of the sedimentary section.
   Gravity studies constrain the location and geometry of the main structures as they project eastward under the Reno basin. A negative anomaly extends eastward from the east-tilted Gravel of Reno. This gravity low (and the Gravel of Reno it represents) terminates eastward against a steep, north-striking gravity gradient under central Reno; we interpret this to mark a west- dipping normal fault, the " Virginia Street fault," which was active throughout deposition of the coarse clastic section. A more localized and pronounced gravity low in west Reno corresponds to the eastward projection of the east-dipping Neogene diatomite that is exposed at the ground surface. The abrupt termination of this negative gravity anomaly requires that the diatomite terminates eastward at depth, therefore documenting the eastern margin of the Neogene lacustrine environment. Other gravity anomalies document both the relief on the sub-Neogene unconformity and a complex pattern of faults that offset Neogene and younger rocks in the Reno basin, consistent with the multiple fault sets seen in outcrop west of Reno.

AB  - Background: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture that cause functional limitation and are attributed to non-progressive disorders which occur in the fetal or infant brain. In recent years, with the increase in life expectancy of individuals with CP, several studies have described the impact of musculoskeletal disabilities and functional limitations over the life cycle. Objective: To characterize adults with CP through sociodemographic information, classifications, general health, associated conditions, physical complications and locomotion. Methods: Twenty-two adults with CP recruited from local rehabilitation centers in an inner town of Brazil participated in this study. A questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbities, and physical complications. A brief physical therapy evaluation was carried out, and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) were applied. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results: The mean age was 28.7 (SD 10.6) years, 86.4% of participants lived with parents, and 4.5% were employed. Most of the sample consisted of spastic quadriplegic subjects, corresponding to levels IV and V of the GMFCS and MACS. Different comorbidities and important physical complications such as scoliosis and muscle contractures were present. More than half of the participants were unable to walk. Coclusions: Most participants demonstrated important restrictions in social participation and lower educational level. Adults with CP can be affected by several physical complications and progressive limitations in gait.

At first glance, this may seem easy enough, but the forces that contribute to success in this niche are complex. Indeed, success as a companion is rarely measured in terms of biological fitness, and empirical measures of the breeding value of stock remain elusive. The challenges in the niche are manifold and reflect the need for companion animals to show behavioural flexibility, an attribute variously labelled compliance, tolerance, and even forgiveness. The borders of the niche are blurred and there is often negligible communication between buyers and suppliers of companion animals. In addition, demand for a given phenotype is subject to considerable flux. Paradoxically, companion animals may be victims of their own success. We value the social feedback they provide and yet often leave them alone for lengthy periods. There is an inherent tension between the desire to share the company of these animals and the reality that some humans find an animal's need for social contact, and indeed many species-specific behaviours, unacceptable. Also, the animal-sense of owners may be declining, reflecting reduced community exposure to animals in non-companion contexts, such as on farms and as modes of transport. Often, in the case of dogs, the companion-animal niche is occupied by a breed that was developed to work in a specific role that required endless energy and high reactivity. We select for conformation and movement in what were once working animals and yet many owners reject animals for behavioural traits that were subject to scarcely any primary selection. Since neutering of companion animals is, for many excellent reasons, now so common, the genes of outstandingly suitable pets are routinely lost to the gene pool. Companion animals may be living longer and yet, as they age, the dog-human relationship can shift diametrically. Senior dogs often become less appealing to and yet more dependent on, and needful of attention from, their owners. In Australia, urban companion-animal ownership per capita is declining in tandem with falls in living space. Despite this reduced demand, the pet industry uses positive imagery and targeted research to promote pet acquisition, helping to maintain a situation in which supply generally exceeds demand. This results in the annual euthanasia of thousands of excess animals in shelters and pounds. The pet industry also motivates owners to be consumers so it is unsurprising that expenditure on pets in Australia is rising. Sometimes food is promoted as a means of demonstrating affection. In many developed nations, unfortunately, pet owners have the resources to respond to marketing (among other forces) by overfeeding animals, often to the point of obesity. Obesity is considered to be a significant welfare problem for companion dogs. In summary, it seems that these shifts and growing paradoxes are making the companion-animal niche more challenging than ever. Perhaps science will help make the niche more predictable, but this alone will not guarantee the welfare of the animals that occupy it.

AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females throughout the developed world. Population screening using fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) facilitates early detection and greater chance of survival, but participation rates are low. We developed a Web-based decision tool to provide information tailored to an individual's decision stage for CRC screening and attitude toward screening utilizing the Preventive Health Model (PHM) and Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) as theoretical frameworks for screening behavior. We describe the practical steps employed in the tool's design and the subsequent conduct of an exploratory study.
   Objective: To design a decision tool for CRC screening and conduct an exploratory study among average- risk men and women to (1) test the impact of message type (tailored vs non-tailored) and message delivery modality (Web-based vs paper-based) on attitudes toward screening and screening uptake, and (2) investigate the acceptability of the decision tool and relevance of materials.
   Methods: Participants (n = 100), recruited from a population sample of men and women aged 50-76 residing in urban Adelaide, Australia, were randomly assigned to a control group or one of 4 interventions: (1) Web-based and tailored information, (2) paper-based and tailored information, (3) Web-based and non-tailored (generic) information, or (4) paper-based and non-tailored information. Participation was augmented by snowball recruitment (n = 19). Questionnaires based on PHM variables were administered pre- and post-intervention. Participants were given the opportunity to request an FOBT. Following the intervention, participants discussed the acceptability of the tool.
   Results: Full data were available for 87.4% (104/119) of participants. Post-intervention, perceived susceptibility scores for individuals receiving tailored information increased from mean 10.6 (SD 2.1) to mean 11.8 (SD 2.2). Scores on self-efficacy increased in the tailored group from mean 11.7 (SD 2.0) to mean 12.6 (SD 1.8). There were significant time x modality x message effects for social influence and salience and coherence, reflecting an increase in these scores for tailored Web- based participants only; social influence scores increased from mean 11.7 (SD 2.6) to mean 14.9 (SD 2.3), and salience and coherence scores increased from mean 16.0 (SD 2.2) to mean 17.7 (SD 2.1). There was no greater influence of modality or message type on movement toward a decision to screen or screening uptake, indicating that neither tailored messages nor a Web modality had superior effect. Overall, participants regarded tailored messages positively, but thought that the Web tool lacked "media richness."
   Conclusions: This exploratory study confirms that tailoring on PHM predictors of CRC screening has the potential to positively address attitudes toward screening. However, tailoring on these variables did not result in significantly increased screening uptake.

TI  - Analysis of the AKP Government's Policy Toward the Kurdish Issue
T2  - TURKISH STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The Kurdish issue emerged as a result of the Kemalist modernization policy. For many years Kurds and other groups were forced to absorb Turkish values and culture instead of developing their own local identities. For this reason, Kurdish uprisings occurred. By describing these uprisings as ethnic separatist movements, the government authorities instituted military measures against Kurdish groups in order to suppress their demands. But, for the first time in 1992 former President Turgut Ozal accepted the reality of the Kurdish issue rather than describing it as an ethnic separatist movement. Accordingly, he suggested taking social, political and cultural measures as supplements to military operations. Ozal's approach has been seriously taken up by the AKP government. As opposed to traditional policy, the existing government has noted that the problem emerged from violation of democratic rights of Kurdish people by state authorities and advocated that serious measures be taken to improve the socio-economic conditions in Southeastern Anatolia. The AKP government took considerable steps to improve democratic conditions in Turkey despite the PKK attack on the Dalca gendarme station on October 21, 2007. Permission to freely use the Kurdish language and changing the names of some towns back to original Kurdish were some of the results. But the military elites, the opposition parties - the CHP and the MHP - and the Kurdish-originated PDP party opposed the government's policy. Still, in order to find a peaceful solution to the question, the government has to make fundamental constitutional amendments in order to improve conditions and guarantee the rights of Kurdish people. In the meantime, it has to take serious steps to improve socio-economic conditions in the region as well as disarm the PKK terrorists.

AB  - Objectives. Waterborne outbreaks offer an opportunity to study joint symptoms after a simultaneous exposure. In November 2007, a gastroenteritis outbreak due to faecal contamination of tap water took place in a Finnish town. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of joint symptoms after the outbreak.
   Methods. The authors conducted a controlled, population-based questionnaire survey to study the occurrence of joint symptoms within 8 weeks after the exposure. The survey covered three areas: contaminated and uncontaminated parts of the town and a control town. A total of 1000 residents were randomly selected from each area, and the joint symptoms were first analysed separately and thereafter categorized as arthritis-like if joint swelling, redness, warmth or pain in movement was reported.
   Results. A total of 2123 responses could be evaluated. The overall prevalence of joint symptoms was 13.9% in the contaminated group, 4.3% in the uncontaminated group and 1.5% among the control group, and the frequency of arthritis-like symptoms in the groups was 6.7, 2.1 and 0.5%, respectively. Gastrointestinal symptoms predicted joint complaints, diarrhoea and blood in faeces being the most significant. Residing in the contaminated area was associated with any joint symptom [odds ratio (OR) = 4.0, 95% CI 1.8, 9.0] and joint pain (OR = 7.3, 95% CI 2.1, 24.8) without preceding gastroenteritis.
   Conclusion. The frequency of joint symptoms was high in the contaminated group and also increased in the uncontaminated group. Furthermore, the risk of joint symptoms was increased in the contaminated group even without gastroenteritis.

AB  - Anthropogenic changes in landscapes can favor generalist species adapted to human settlement, such as the Common Raven (Corvus corax), by providing new resources. Increased densities of predators can then negatively affect prey, especially rare or sensitive species. Jackson Hole and the upper Green River valley in western Wyoming are experiencing accelerated rates of human development due to tourism and natural gas development, respectively. Increased raven populations in these areas may negatively influence the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a sensitive sagebrush specialist. We investigated landscape-level patterns in raven behavior and distribution and the correlation of the raven data with the grouse's reproductive success in western Wyoming. In our study areas towns provide ravens with supplemental food, water, and nest sites, leading to locally increased density but with apparently limited (< 3 km) movement by ravens from towns to adjacent areas of undeveloped sagebrush. Raven density and occupancy were greatest in land covers with frequent human activity. In sagebrush with little human activity, raven density near incubating and brooding sage-grouse was elevated slightly relative to that expected and observed in sagebrush not known to hold grouse. Raven occupancy near sage-grouse nests and broods was more highly correlated with sage-grouse success than were raven density and behavior, suggesting that the majority of nest predation by ravens is most likely carried out by resident territorial individuals. Integrated region-wide improvement of sagebrush habitat, removal of anthropogenic subsidies, and perhaps removal or aversive conditioning of offending ravens might benefit sage-grouse populations in our study area.

AB  - Relatively little is currently known about the influence of changes in climate on phenology (timing of natural events) in the southern hemisphere, even though the implications to humans and the natural environment can be large. This paper sources recent phenological Australian studies and assesses the extent to which phenological shifts have occurred and the influence of climate on any observed phenological changes. Datasets considered include avian migration timing (covering the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain, south-western Australia, south-eastern Australia, suburban and peri-urban Melbourne), avian breeding timing (Australia wide and localised marine and terrestrial species), plant phenology (southern Australia) and insect phenology.
   Results so far indicate that the impact of climatic change on species phenology is varied; depending on species, region and season. For example, over 30% of species listed in the migration timing studies appear to have altered their migration phenology in response to changes in minimum temperature; in some regions species responded by mainly altering their arrival timing while in other regions changes in departure dates dominated (e. g. Nullarbor Plain and south-western Australia). Not all studies considered changes in precipitation but, when included, rainfall changes were also associated with altered migration timing. This was particularly evident in south-western Australia, where the most notable reduction in winter rainfall occurred. In this region, changes in precipitation appeared to have a greater influence on migration phenology than temperature, particularly for waterbirds and landbirds associated with littoral zones, highlighting potential differences in responses of Australian and northern hemisphere species to climate change.
   Part of the complexity of determining how changes in climate may impact on species is determining which climate variables are most relevant to that species biology. It is expected that some species will be more or less sensitive to particular meteorological conditions and that this sensitivity may vary over time (including over various aspects of their life cycle) and over the range of the species. For example, the mechanisms for causing shifts in phenology for plants are likely to differ from that for invertebrates which will, in turn, differ from vertebrates. For species which migrate, or undergo large-scale movements, precise information is required on where and when they move, and locations visited en-route, to fully model climatic influences on movement timing. In many cases, the effect of climate may be lagged.
   Not all species or populations studied in Australia have changed their phenology in response to changes in climate. Is phenology in these species driven by factors other than climate or are the changes currently observed in the climate system still within that species 'normal' operating range? This is a question that still needs to be addressed.
   Improved knowledge of the impacts of climate on species' phenology will significantly improve natural resource management decisions, aid policy development and increases public awareness of climate change and its impacts in Australia. Currently our knowledge is limited (temporally, spatially and by taxa) but significant progress is being made to improve available data, including the development of systems to collect phenological data on multiple species for the same location. Improved observation networks are urgently required, in order to better model, understand, and manage Australia's natural systems.

AB  - Background: Musculo Skeletal Disorders (MSD) contribute 37% of the disease burden which is attributable to occupational risk factors globally, resulting in substantial disability. Despite mechanization and automation, there is an ever increasing incidence of MSD, which has an adverse impact on the individual and the society. Little information on the prevalence of MSD is available in South India.
   Aim: The present study was aimed primarily to evaluate the prevalence of MSD in industrial workers and also secondarily to identify the location specific MSD, to generate guidelines to optimize the work, to minimize the risk of injury development and to maximize the output quality.
   Material and Methods: This cross sectional pilot study included 219 subjects of age groups ranging from 18 to 55 years, from three different industries. Questionnaires were administered to assess the work exposure and health. The range of movement of the joints was calculated by using a Goniometer. The postural workload was assessed by using a RULA work sheet. A clinical examination was done to diagnose MSD. Results: 32.6% of the subjects suffered from MSD. The highest prevalence of MSD was seen among pyrotechnics (44.4 %), followed by match makers (32.7%) and litho offset printers (19.2%). An increased prevalence of symptom severity was observed in women (36.1%) and in individuals who performed moderately strenuous tasks (52.8%). Conclusion: The present study has estimated the baseline prevalence of MSD in industrial workers, which can be effectively applied for the optimisation of the work system to minimise the risk of injury and to maximise productivity.
   Key message: The knowledge of musculoskeletal disorders and its prevalence among industrial workers can be effectively applied for the optimisation of the work system to minimise the risk of injury and to maximise productivity.

AB  - A massive debris flow induced by Typhoon Morakot buried the southern Taiwan village of Siaolin in Jiaxian township and caused the deaths of an estimated 474 people. To reconstruct the mechanisms triggering the tragic debris flow, researchers must identify the subsurface structures of the debris-flow sediments. For this purpose, we conducted 2-D, electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) surveys along networked lines where the village once stood. With the imaging results, we identified three layers, including the basement of Yenshuikeng Shale, the newly accumulated debris-flow deposits; and the old fluvial deposits amid the basement and the debris-flow sediments. According to the resistivity results, the bottom of the debris-flow deposits is under the old ground surface in three eroded areas, C1, C2 and C3. Resistivity anomalies in the debris-flow sediment layer are well correlated with the locations of houses and the major roads in the piling area (P1) and the eroded area (C2). Hence these findings indicate that the basal erosion of the debris flow may have occurred in areas C1, C2 and C3 since a specific mass movement may undercut into the basal sediments or rocks and forms a filled trench in its basement. These eroded areas may be related to different events of mass movements due to their different orientations of basal erosion. From the resistivity image we estimated the volume of debris flow is underestimated for about 24.5 per cent to the estimated volume of the debris flow from digital terrain models (DTMs) in the study area. We conclude that the volume of a debris flow may be underestimated because of the basal erosion if only data from DTMs are used for its calculations and present new means for its correction by combining DTM and ERI results.

AB  - At the beginning of the 20-th century the social and political context encouraged the appearance of two new traditionalist orientations in the Romanian culture: the Samanatorism and the Poporanism. Under the influence of these orientations the literature reflected the national spirit which was believed to be found only in the village, a space opposed to the town, seen as a place of degradation. Some literary critics considered the Samanatorism a moment of crisis in our culture, their main argument being this very brutal breach between the national and the universal. An important part of I.L. Caragiale's prose is written, apparently, within the confines of the Samanatorist movement, but using parody and irony the author changes the fictional message dramatically. The previous patterns are adopted by I.L. Caragiale only to be reevaluated and transformed and thus originality is achieved. In this process irony plays an important part, especially because the parodist brings the relation between the author and his text into focus.
   The parodic text creates and trains its own type of reader which has a major interpretative role - it is on his capacity of understanding the ultimate fictional message that the achievement of parody depends. Nevertheless, the reader's perception is constantly manipulated by the author who places clues in his text to help the reader grasp the ultimate ironic message. In I.L. Caragiale's prose, parody is part of his literary doctrine and using it the writer rejects the exaggerations that often occured in the traditionalist literature. The narrator ironically places himself above the text he ironizes, but, in the same time, he places himself even above his own text. Caragiale remains a complete and modern writer that builds his fictional world resorting to innovative strategies - parody, imitation and irony - by means of which the worthless aspects are rejected.

AB  - On 12 May 2008, the M-w 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake occurred at the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau along the Longmen Shan fault. Based on previous geological and geophysical studies and offset maps from Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar ALOS/PALSAR data, a layered crustal structure and a five-segment rupture model are established to study the coseismic deformation of this event. Using the constrained least-squares method, a preferred coseismic slip model is derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. In particular, the Helmert variance component estimation (HVCE) method is used to determine the relative weight ratio between the GPS and InSAR data. In contrast to the initial weight ratio (0.752/0.246/0.002) among three-type observations (GPS horizontal, GPS vertical, and InSAR LOS displacement), the final optimal weight ratio is found to be 0.473/0.279/0.248, and the overall root mean square (rms) misfit for all three datasets decreases from 9.15 cm without HVCE to 5.46 cm with HVCE. As revealed by the preferred slip, the slip changes obviously along the strike direction from southwest to northeast and exhibits four asperities close to Hongkou town, Yuejiashan town, Beichuan County, and Nanba town, respectively. Two major asperities are located on the Hongkou and Beichuan segments with the maximum slip close to 10 m. The slips of Hongkou, Yuejiashan, and Beichuan segments are dominated by the thrust movement with a significant right-lateral strike-slip component. The Qingchuan segment experiences a dominant right-lateral strike slip with an average magnitude of 1-2 m. Most of the slip asperities are shallower than 10-km depth, except for the southwest part near the hypocenter where the slip may exceed 20 km. The seismic moment of the Wenchuan earthquake is 8.19 x 10(20) N m (M-w 7.91) based on the layered crust model, which is slightly larger than that using a corresponding homogeneous crust model (M-w 7.87).

AB  - The March 04, 2010, Jiashian, Taiwan earthquake (M-w 6.4) ruptured an unknown fault at depth in southwestern Taiwan. The main shock initiated near the town of Liuquei at 23 km depth and the rupture propagated westward. Measurements of coseismic displacements from Taiwan Continuous GPS Array indicate horizontal displacements of 5-27 mm in the NW-SW directions to the west of the epicenter; while horizontal movements to the east of the epicenter are absent. The GPS vertical displacements show an uplift motion of about 5-25 mm near the epicenter, in contrast to a small movement of about 5-10 mm observed in the far-field GPS sites. We use coseismic GPS displacements and an elastic half-space dislocation model to invert for fault geometries and coseismic slip distribution associated with the Jiashian earthquake. Our preferred model exhibits 0.05-0.1 m of reverse slip and similar to 0.04 m of left-lateral slip on a N324 degrees -trending fault with dip of 40 degrees to NE, consistent with the earthquake focal mechanisms from BATS, USGS/NEIC, and Global CMT. The highest slip of 0.12 m mainly occurs to the west of the epicenter at a depth range of 15-20 km. Given the rigidity modulus of 60 GPa, the geodetic moment is 4.95 x 10(18) N-m, equivalent to a M-w 6.4 earthquake and consistent with the seismic moment estimated from seismic waveform inversion. Additionally, we notice that the mainshock rupture area is surrounded by high seismicity between 1991 and 2007, suggesting that the Jiashian earthquake may be triggered by the high stress concentration in the vicinity. The calculated Coulomb stress changes on nearby fault systems imparted by the coseismic slip suggest that the Jiashian earthquake may encourage failures on the Chukou fault and inhibit ruptures on the Hsinhua fault. However, the Coulomb stress changes are more complicated on the Chaochou fault and Chishan fault with both positive and negative stress changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - On 19 February 2007, a landslide occurred on the Alaard&Aumlaut +/-double dagger Slope, located 1.6 km south of the town of Yaka (Gelendost, Turkey.) Subsequently, the displaced materials transformed into a mud flow in Eglence Creek and continued 750 m downstream towards the town of Yaka. The mass poised for motion in the Yaka Landslide source area and its vicinity, which would be triggered to a kinetic state by trigger factors such as heavy or sustained rainfall and/or snowmelt, poise a danger in the form of loss of life and property to Yaka with its population of 3,000. This study was undertaken to construct a susceptibility mapping of the vicinity of the Yaka Landslide's source area and to relate it to movement of the landslide mass with the goal of prevention or mitigation of loss of life and property. The landslide susceptibility map was formulated by designating the relationship of the effecting factors that cause landslides such as lithology, gradient, slope aspect, elevation, topographical moisture index, and stream power index to the landslide map, as determined by analysis of the terrain, through the implementation of the conditional probability method. It was determined that the surface area of the Goksogut formation, which has attained lithological characteristics of clayey limestone with a broken and separated base and where area landslides occur, possesses an elevation of 1,100-1,300 m, a slope gradient of 15A degrees-35A degrees and a slope aspect between 0A degrees-67.5A degrees and 157A degrees-247A degrees. Loss of life and property may be avoided by the construction of structures to check the debris mass in Eglence Creek, the cleaning of the canal which passes through Yaka, the broadening of the canal's base area, elevating the protective edges along the canal and the establishment of a protective zone at least 10-m wide on each side of the canal to deter against damage from probable landslide occurrence and mud flow.

AB  - Studying long term-evolution of gravitational slope evolution is a key to understanding deep-seated landslide processes. This paper deals with three large Deep-Seated Landslides (DSLs) at a front of a subalpine meridional chain, on the "La Marbriere" slope near the town of Grasse (Alpes-Maritimes, France). The geological framework controlling the stability and morphology of the DSLs is associated with thick and tamped Triassic layers of mudstone with gypsum overlain by highly faulted Jurassic limestone. Gravitational deformation affects the entire slope, involving a movement of about 1.1 x 10(8) m(3) of rock material. It creates large disturbances in landscape morphology, such as scarps, counter-slope scarps, trenches and other typical gravitational morpho-structures. Geomorphological mapping coupled with deep electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) reveals a strong correlation between these morpho-structures and inherited brittle tectonic features. This observation relies on spatial and geometrical relations (on the surface and at the depth of more than 150 m, checked by ERT) between the most persistent fault and the gravitational morpho-structures. The specific distribution of the morpho-structures on the basis of their morphological typologies and variations in the stage of evolution of three DSLs provides an interpretation of their kinematics during the last 400 ka. It appears that soft substratums combined with inherited persistent anisotropies are key factors in the development of the DSLs. Indeed, outflow of mudstone due to the lithostatic pressure imposed by individual limestone compartments has led to general slope subsidence. Then, a progressive toppling of a rock mass may have led to the catastrophic rock collapse along bedding planes.
   The evolution of the DSLs can be divided into three distinct stages represented by three zones: a young collapse stage (zone 1), a pre-collapse stage (zone 2) and an old mature stage (>400 ka, zone 3). As the DSLs occur on the same slope and in the same geological context, this area offers interesting perspectives for understanding factors controlling the long-term gravitational evolution of slopes.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is a nutrient and neurotoxicant sometimes associated with mood, motor and neurological effects. Reports of health effects from occupational exposure to Mn are well known, but the reported links to environmental airborne Mn (Mn-Air) are less conclusive. Marietta, OH (USA) is a previously identified community with elevated Mn-Air from industrial emissions. Households were randomly selected in Marietta and the comparison town (Mount Vernon, OH). The responders were used to recruit on a voluntary basis 30- to 75-year-old residents, i.e. 100 in Marietta and 90 in Mount Vernon. They were administered the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), motor efficiency, and mood tests, along with a comprehensive questionnaire including demographics, health and work history. Blood Mn (MnB), serum ferritin, and hepatic enzymes were measured. Results were compared with those of 90 residents from a demographically similar comparison town, Mount Vernon, OH, where Mn-Air from industrial emissions was not of concern. Mn-Air exposure indices were modeled for Marietta residents. The Mn-exposed participants resided on average 4.75 miles (range 1-11) from the Mn point source. Their modeled residential Mn-Air estimate ranged from 0.04 to 0.96 mu g/m(3) and was on average 0.18 mu g/m(3). The group means of MnB were similar for the Mn-exposed (9.65 mu g/L) and comparison (9.48 mu g/L) participants. The Marietta group reported more generalized anxiety on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) than the comparison group (p = 0.035). Generalized anxiety in Marietta was related to a cumulative exposure index (p = 0.002). based on modeled Mn-Air concentration and length of residence. Higher generalized anxiety scores were related to poorer performance on UPDRS tests [adjusted relative risk (95%CI): 2.18 (1.46-3.25) for motor-related activities of daily living, 3.44 (1.48-7.98) for bradykinesia, and 1.63 (1.06-2.53) for motor/movement]. Group differences in SCL-90-R generalized anxiety between the two towns and the observed relationship between exposure indices and generalized anxiety suggest an association between environmental Mn exposure and anxiety states. Whether this association is due to direct neurotoxic effects of Mn-Air or concern about the health effects of air pollution remains an open question. The results highlight the importance of measuring anxiety in relation to neuropsychological and neurological endpoints, and should be validated in other studies of Mn-exposed communities.

AB  - The beginning of the 20th century brought the world the First World War and the break-up of European powers. It also brought Poland independence, after more than one hundred and twenty years when it had been partitioned between three neighboring empires. A large increase in the number of Lublin's inhabitants, along with the development of the area of the city that followed the increase, caused an increase in the number of newly designed streets. The new lines of communication needed new names. Several, or even several dozen streets came into existence at one time, which favored giving them names connected with history. Additionally, the area of the town increased by absorbing the neighboring villages whose streets already had names. This caused overlapping of the names, which, in turn, made the town authorities solve the problem by giving one of the streets a new name. In the course of the 20th century the political situation in Poland changed, and this influenced the life of Lublin. Each new authority tried to make a sign of its presence in the town by organizing places of collective memory. Names of streets are a special area in the topography of the town, in which historical memory has always been handed down to next generations.
   The last period when Lublin belonged to the Polish Kingdom, which was part of the Russian Empire, comprises the years 1901-1915. In that time only two streets were given names commemorating important Poles: Frederic Chopin and Wincenty Pol. Commemorative names started being given in Lublin when the Russian authorities were replaced by Austrian ones at the end of July 1915. The three years of Austrian rule in Lublin brought an increase in the area of the town and new names given to six communication lines. At that time five commemorative names were given in Lublin. In the twenty-year period between the World Wars the number of commemorative names increased from seven in 1918 to seventy-eight just before the outbreak of World War II. In 1919 a special commission was established in the town whose task was to prepare suggestions for changing street names in Lublin. After regaining independence the first changes in the names of Lublin streets were effected in August 1923. Forty-six streets were named or renamed then. In 1923 all the streets that had not had names received ones. The people after whom the streets were named in the period between the two World Wars may be divided into four groups: outstanding Poles, people connected with Lublin, poets and artists; a separate group was constituted by historical events. Among the groups the people who rendered service to the country are most numerous. Giving names to streets that could be ascribed to one of the five groups was especially frequent in the 1930s, when the village Dziesiata was included into the town, and on both sides of Aleja Raclawicka new streets were marked out for houses designed for military officers and civil servants. On the example of a few streets, like Narutowicza Street, Norwida Street or Staszica Street it is easy to see that the changes were also suggested by Lublin inhabitants.
   After establishing the General Government the Germans gave new names to Lublin streets and squares. They mainly changed those streets names that were connected with the Poles' fight against Germans. During the occupation a total of thirty-three street names were changed, and the remaining ones were translated into German, or the German words Strasse or Gasse were added to the Polish names. New names were given to the streets in the center of the town. Lublin's main square - Plac Litewski - was given the name of the leader of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler. One of the obvious possibilities of erasing the Polish character of the town was changing the names of those streets that had been named after Poles. In this way the names of nine streets were changed, leaving only Chopin Street under the name of Chopin Strasse.
   After Lublin was liberated from the German rule in July 1944 the new authorities started changing the names of streets that had been introduced by the German authorities. Between July and November almost all the streets in Lublin were given back their pre-war names. Only three streets were an exception to this rule: Bychawska, Spokojna and Zamojska were renamed to Kunickiego, 22 Lipca and Buczka, respectively. The next changes were to take place in October 1945.
   On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of establishing the Polish Committee of National Liberation a common meeting was held of the Provincial National Council and the Town National Council. It was then that four socialist activists: Stanislaw Dubois, Georgi Dimitrov, Malgorzata Fornalska, Marceli Nowotko, and the hero of socialist labor Wincenty Pstrowski were commemorated.
   In December 1949, on the occasion of Joseph Stalin's 70th birthday, the Club of Council-men of the Polish United Workers' Party put forward a proposal concerning commemorating "the Leader of Humanity" by giving the name of Comrade Stalin to Lublin's main square, Plac Litewski.
   During the extensive change of names effected in March 1951 as many as twenty-one street names connected with the Church were changed. Among the new street names four commemorated heroes of the new political system: Rosa Luxemburg, Hanka Sawicka, Lucjan Szenwald and Ludwik Warynski, and one concerned the Communist ideology: Heroes of Labor Street. In the Stalinist period, in the years 1944-1956, twenty commemorative names that the new system considered right were given to streets. Among them only two did not survive the test of time and disappeared from the town plans in the autumn of 1956. In the Stalinist period people connected with the struggle for independence during the First World War and the Polish-Bolshevik War disappeared from street names for the whole period of the Polish People's Republic.
   During Wladyslaw Gomulka's rule sixteen commemorative names connected with the workers' movement were given in Lublin. In the center of the town six streets received new names, including one that was newly marked out (Jana Hempla Street).
   In the decade of Edward Gierek's rule thirteen names connected with the ideology of the Polish People's Republic were given. Most of them commemorated heroes of the Communist Party of Poland. In the first half of the 1970s the country prepared for celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the PPR. The new housing estate in Kalinowszczyzna was given the status of the Estate of the Thirty Years of the Polish People's Republic. During the last decade of the PPR only two streets were given names connected with the Communist ideology.
   In 1989 party ideologists who gave new names to streets were replaced by experts. In the period of transformation from the socialist system to the democratic one a special team was established consisting of nine people headed by dr. Mieczyslaw Buczynski who in 1964 had written a master's dissertation at the Maria Curie-Sklodowska University. The subject of the thesis was the etymology of Lublin street names, and later he also worked on the names of parts of Lublin, as well as on Slavonic geographical names.
   Despite the systemic transformation and a lot of changes in the names of streets effected in the years 1989-1991, ten heroes of the Communist system have survived as patrons of Lublin streets. Analyzing the plan of Lublin of 2001 we can find thirteen names of streets that because of their ideological meaning would be more adequate for the previous epoch.

AB  - Questions concerning the drama at Schoonder Sigt: A closer look at the suicide of Robert Jacob Gordon in 1795
   Colonel Robert Jacob Gordon (1743-1795) is a famous explorer of Southern Africa, its geography, people, flora and fauna. His reputation as Military Commander of the Cape of Good Hope is, however, not so good. His resistance against the British attack in 1795 was defensive, mostly evading direct combat, and after three months he surrendered. Subsequently, some five weeks later, on the 25th of October 1795, Gordon committed suicide. South African historiography, based on prevailing rumour at the time, was convinced: his suicide was due to feelings of shame and remorse, reaction to social isolation and contempt. People accused Gordon of cowardice and his treacherous defence of the Cape, claiming that as an Orangist and Anglophile, Gordon had handed the Cape over to the British to prevent a Jacobin revolution, whereby he could be assured that the British custody would take care of the Cape until the restoration of the House of Orange.
   That Gordon was neither a coward nor a traitor, is the thesis of this article; and his suicide therefore had to have had another origin. Indeed, Gordon was an opponent of the 1789 French Revolution, and his Scottish stock might have him helped to cooperate with the British. But he did not neglect his duties and he was not betrayed by the British. Backed up by Commissioner Sluysken and the unanimous Political Council, he followed a defensive line of action, seeing the English opponent being the majority - in guns, men and professional experience - while he was not sure of the reliability of his own men, mercenaries and unruly burgher militia's - the countryside was in open conflict with the Company regime. For three months, Gordon kept the enemy at bay and retained his honour as a soldier, then he surrendered: as a professional soldier, he knew that prolonged warfare was useless, and would result in more victims and much damage. Fighting to the end, sacrificing oneself for one's honour or freedom of the nation - such feelings were foreign to 18th century officers.
   There is no knowledge of any sign of treason or sneaky cooperation by Gordon with the British army; nor is there any indication of disappointment by Gordon about the policy of the British occupier Some forty British officers honoured Gordon by being present at his funeral. There was indeed a small number of burghers and soldiers, inspired by Jacobin revolutionary nationalism, who deplored the surrender of the Cape to the British. They wrote to the Government in the Netherlands (by now the Batavian Republic) and accused the Colonial Government of treason. In their writings they called Gordon a coward and his behaviour treasonous and declared his suicide as being the result of remorse (the British forgot their promises to maintain the rights of the Dutch on the Cape Colony), social rejection and isolation.
   The accusers of the policies of Governor Sluysken and Commander Gordon are well-known: a junior clerk/schoolmaster (H. D. Campagne, as Jacobin agitator expelled by the British and for years kept imprisoned in England), an artillerist (PW.Marnitz), an assistant (assistent - C. L. Neethling, expelled, went to Holland), and the assistant ship's doctor (onderchirurgijn - J.P. Woyer, Graaff-Reinet, active in the so-called Swellendam Republic movement). Not the type of people with the knowledge to judge the situation! Their accusations were met with no response by the Batavian Government, which approved the official report by Governor Sluysken. This was an indirect disapproval of Neethling's book which was an attack of Sluysken's report, and he and his comrades were not rewarded for their revolutionary fervour: Neethling got nothing at all, Woyer was sent to the East (where he never arrived), only Campagne got some financial help, while as prisoner in England.
   It is evident that the South African historiography has given much too much credit to the revolutionary propaganda and gossip of Campagne, Marnitz, Neethling, Woyer and the anonymous pamphlet written in French Apologie de Robert de Gordon (1796). Encapsulated in the anti-imperialistic paradigm, dear to colonial historians (George McCall Theal) and the Afrikaner nationalists (C. Beyers), both the British and the VOC Regime are blamed The VOC leadership yielded to the reality, and Gordon had nothing to feel embarrassed about: the British were too strong, war is never the ultimate goal. There was not even a British plan to get hold of the Cape for ever; only to secure the Cape from the French hegemony (and the Batavian Republic was a vassal of Paris!). Not only the defence of the Cape, but also the interpretation of the mentality at the Cape, of the so-called Cape Town Jacobins and the "Republican movement" in the outermost districts Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet, have been described according to that paradigm. Their character and impact evidently are misunderstood, and both have been attributed an anachronistic ideology.
   In the context of this ideological historiography, everybody has explained the suicide of Gordon as idiosyncratic. However; there are many indications for another explanation of Gordon's suicide. Gordon wasn't the kind of man to suffer from gossip or the idiot accusations of stupid common soldiers. People said that his wife had rejected him, driving him to commit suicide - an all too common story. But there were other, serious problems. Since his last journey through the interior parts of the Cape, Gordon was ill. An illness that made him visibly meagre, and sometimes his behaviour was odd. His endeavours to strengthen the walls of the forts by hides and woolsacks were an evident example, and his riding around the Cape during the war remarkable. Some of his children, many years later, ended in a lunatic asylum. In a letter; written only two days before his death, Gordon confessed: I am almost distracted; his writing showed how emotions seemed to have overcome him. Gordon was ill. He felt that his tough body and strong mind were deteriorating - the idea to become a shadow of the man he used to be, seemed intolerable to him, and afraid of further physical and psychical decline, he took his pistol and shot himself

AB  - This paper focuses on Truman Capote's nonfiction novel "In Cold Blood". By example of the first part of the text called "The last to see them alive", the author analyses the specificity of the narrative space presentation in the nonfiction novel. Narrative space is a space, in which parallel events, unified by a narrative thread, occur at the same time. These events are presented in the text from different points of view. The total of rhythmically organized individual points of view forms a spatial net. It functions in the narrative as a lineal and cognitive category. As a lineal category, the spatial net divides the text into individual perspectives. The structural elements of an individual perspective are as follows: 1) the deictic centre; 2) focal objects; 3) verbs of movement, adverbs and prepositions of place and direction. The individual spatial perspectives of the first part of "In Cold Blood" can be organized into four groups: 1) the murderers; 2) the victims; 3) the witnesses; 4) the narrator. They are rhythmically interlaced. Interchange of the individual perspectives belonging to different groups creates the effect of simultaneous actions and causes suspense; interchange of the individual perspectives within the same group emphasizes a common emotional atmosphere. The segments of the spatial net are also rhythmically organized in accordance with their length: the rhythm of shortening segments creates tension. As a cognitive category, spatial net divides the narrative space into frames. A frame is a possibly minimal amount of information about the essence of an object, phenomenon, event, situation, process. A frame consists of a name and slots. Often, smaller frames act as slots, so the frame takes the form of "matryoshka". Frames are connected into a net through ako ("a kind of") links. The top frame of ''The last to see them alive" is Kansas: from Olathe to Holcomb (about 400 km). The narrative space of the text coincides with the real space of the Kansas state. This spatial frame is filled with three smaller frames (slots): 1) Holcomb; 2) Olathe; 2) the way between the two towns. Each of these frames, in their turn, is filled with smaller frames, etc. The smallest spatial frames, coinciding with individual spatial perspectives, are called scenes. A scene consists of a focalizing subject and focal objects. The shift in focalization marks the shift to the next scene. Presenting the narrative space of "In Cold Blood" in scenes helped Capote to reduce the volume of the book from 8000 to 219 pages. Thus, as a lineal category, the spatial net divides the narrative space of the non-fiction novel "In Cold Blood" into individual perspectives, as a cognitive category - into frames. Division into individual spatial perspectives contributes to the objectivity of the non-fictional narrative; division into frames allows reducing the text, preserving the adequacy of interpretation. Rhythmical interchange of the segments creates the desirable emotional atmosphere.

TI  - The Castaneda's contribution to the professionalization of Mexican psychiatry, 1910-1968

AB  - On September 1, 1910, more than two thousand people celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of Mexico's Proclamation of Independence with the inauguration of a psychiatric hospital. According to the event's official chronicler, the 25 buildings constructed by order of president Porfirio Diaz on the site of the former Castaneda Hacienda would place Mexico among the leading countries in the world in treating mental health pathologies. But, what had been Mexico's development in this field during the XIX century? Could we consider La Castaneda the birthplace of public psychiatry in Mexico?
   This work analyzes La Castaneda's contribution to the professionalization of psychiatry in Mexico, not only by looking at the place that research and teaching traditionally had in hospitals, but also by looking at other mechanisms that help to form a discipline, such as the capacity to bring light to scientific societies and to bring credibility to a new medical field such as psychiatry, so much in need of therapeutic successes in those years.
   In the XIX century around 400 articles, theses and books by Mexican, Hispanic and foreign authors were published that dealt with topics associated with psychiatry. The old hospitals of the colonial system such as San Hipolito and La Canoa established a form of treatment called moral treatment., precursor to psychiatry, and were directed by a doctor substituting a director-administrator. Between 1865-1910, five projects for a modern mental hospital were made, one of which saw fruition in the form of La Castaneda. In 1887 the first course dealing with mental illness was taught and in 1906 the first specialization in psychiatry was brought about. Nonetheless, this movement was cut short by the Revolution of 1910 which assailed the country for almost a decade and provoked that La Castaneda be left without state support.
   The professionalization of Mexican psychiatry can be divided in three stages: 1910-1925, a period marked by the decomposition brought on by the war; 1925-1945, characterized by the major medical and administrative reform of the hospital, and 1945-1968, a stage which included the slow dismantling of La Castaneda. In the first stage, La Castaneda saw a certain level of deterioration in its assistance practices, as 25% of patients who entered between 1914-1916 were not diagnosed, and 45% of patients of those entering between 19171920 were not diagnosed either. This fact is explained by the institution's instability in those years. Between 1910-1923, La Castaneda had twelve directors. Academic courses in mental illness continued to be offered and a medical society was formed, but with few results.
   In 1925 Public Welfare asked doctor Enrique Aragon to inspect the Asylum and present a detailed report of any reforms needed. The three most serious problems he discovered were: the deficient way in which doctors handled patient's clinical records, shortages and poor training of personnel and the fact that there was almost no research being done.
   From 1925-1945, La Castaneda experienced great reforms thanks to three doctors who wanted to professionalize psychiatry in Mexico and place it at a competitive level with hospitals around the world, which they had seen in visits to Europe and the U.S. These doctors were Samuel Ramirez Moreno, Alfonso Millan Maldonado and Manuel Guevara Oropeza, who received support from the federal government. In 1929 a system of occupational therapy was established as a means of rehabilitation, and outpatient services were offered to those not needing hospitalization. In 1932 a Children's Ward was inaugurated and the following year the School for Abnormal Children, both directed by Mathilde Rodriguez Cabo, the first woman psychiatrist in Mexico. Alongside Ramirez Moreno, she began a project offering courses in psychiatric nursing and caregiving. In 193,5 the Drug Addicts Unit was inaugurated, and in the years following shock therapies were introduced. A laboratory was established to perform traditional clinical analyses, as well as bacteriological and pathological analyses, and microphotography, both to improve diagnoses and to move research forward. All was influenced to a great extent by Spanish neurobiology which came about after the Spanish Civil War, when exiles such as Dionisio Nieto were received in Mexico.
   In order to strengthen the guild, at this stage there were important initiatives. In 1934, the Revista Mexicana de Psiquiatria, Neurologia y Medicina Legal, the first journal in its field in Mexico, was published. In 1937 the Sociedad Mexicana de Neurologia y Psiquiatria was founded, as well as its official organ, Archivos do Neurologic y Psiquiatria de Mexico.
   Around 1943, a project which would become Mexico's policy of mental health for the years 1945-1968 began to be conceived. This policy would lead to the demolition of La Castaneda, and replace it with farms or field homes for the mentally ill. This therapeutic model, with chronic patients in mind, was based on recreational and occupational therapies, and its intention was to place patients in contact with nature, under a regimen of liberty and dedicated to productive and dignified activities. Yet these farms were located far from urban centers, isolating patients even further from family. In fact, psychiatry itself was also isolated from the rest of the medical world.
   La Castaneda closed on June 29, 1968, and with it more than 68 000 lives, could they talk today, might well tell this story differently.

AB  - In the last twenty years in particular, the Slovenian (as well as Croatian) and Italian ritual practices that refer to, celebrate, or commemorate events or persons from the period dealt with in the joint report by the Slovenian-Italian historical committee - that is, from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1950s - have been characterized by a problematic relationship and intertwining of various discourses of different branches of authority on both sides of the border, discussions by historians of various ethnic backgrounds and orientations (e.g., negationist, revisionist, realistic, etc.), numerous Partisan and Italian exile organizations, neo-fascist and other subcultures, Internet forums, and so on. Based on an analysis of individual cases in Slovenian-Italian contacts, the author outlines some constants of discourse that assigns ethnic qualities, and occasional internal disagreements or ambivalences, and at the same time reveals the options for a more reflective relationship towards the past that have already been applied before.
   On 10 February, just over a week after commemorating the millions of Holocaust victims, the Italians annually commemorate the exodus of over 200,000 Italians (among these were also Slovenians and Croatians that opposed communism) from Yugoslavia, and especially the victims disposed of in karst shafts - foibe when the Yugoslav Army drove the German army out of Trieste and ruled it for 40 days until the beginning of June 1945, when it had to relinquish it to the Anglo-American allied forces. In February 2007, the exodus and the victims were also commemorated by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, a former communist, who gave a speech at Quirinal Palace on the barbarism, Slavic expansionism, and bloodthirsty rage of Tito's army. He repeated the content of this speech again a year later, and then partly mitigated his views in 2009 by mentioning the fascist crimes that occurred before the tragic exodus and killings connected with the karst shafts. Napolitano's words had a great impact in Slovenia and Croatia; the Croatian president saw elements of racism, revisionism, and the like in them. The European Commission disregarded the speech, but rebuked Croatian President Stjepan Mesic for reacting "inappropriately" to Napolitano's speech.
   This official Italian position raises the question of the extent to which subcultural productions (especially graffiti, YouTube videos, and other video production) find their roots and a haven in the dominant discourse of certain official branches of authority. Is it possible that the graffiti on the memorial to the Slovenian victims of World War II in Bagnoli della Rosandra-Boljunec near Trieste and on the atmospheric Partisan monument in the village of Trnovo, and the video Trieste - ultima frontiera (Trieste: The Final Frontier) on YouTube, which revives the ideological discourse of a great Italy as the last outpost of civilization, apply certain similar or even identical elements (e.g., the Slavs as barbarians, loss of memory of the fascist violence from 1919 to 1943) as the discourse of the authorities?
   However, in addition to these options that reproduce the continuation of a conflict treatment of critical historical periods, there are also other options, especially at the local level. On the one hand, this involves the discourse of municipal authorities (e.g., between the mayors of and Gorizia at the towns' joint Europe Square/Transalpine Square) and the efforts of certain groups, such as Concordia et pax, which seek the harmonious coexistence of all ethnic communities in this territory. Together with the mayors, they commemorate all of the victims from this critical period, clean the monuments that the members of certain far-right parties such as the Tricolor Flame Social Movement (MS FT) and New Force (Forza Nuova) daub with fascist symbols, try to understand this tragic period by organizing dialogue, and seek opportunities for new views. Among the successful campaigns, one needs to be highlighted in particular: the discussion between Lucio Toth, the former president of the Venezia-Giulia and Dalmatia National Association (ANVGD) exile organization and a former senator, Milos Budin, a former Italian senator and ethnic Slovenian. This discussion was attended by all of the mayors from the Karst region; by stressing the grievances of and injustices against individuals and ethnic communities from the 1920s to the 1950s, the following thought in particular stood out: "We cannot build a common past, but we can build a common present and future."
   In addition, there is an effort to build a common memory, especially in the Nova Gorica-Gorizia/Gorica region. The Concordia et Pax association is particularly active in this regard: in 1995, they erected a joint memorial commemorating all victims, fallen soldiers, and others on Sveta gora (Holy Mount), raising the question of what to write on this sign. Among various options, the phrase "Concordia et Pax" (Harmony and Peace) proved to be the best choice.

KW  - Territorial differences
AB  - The Sierra de Cordoba is a distinct spatial area in the province and the whole of Andalusia. The people of marianicos spaces are the basic element in the occupation of that territory, characterized by a strong rural character. The study of recent population dynamics of marianicos spaces and regional differences, is the main objective of this work, with trying to identify possible inequalities and concomitants both regional and county differences.
   The demographic variables orused to characterize recent developments in marianicos spaces are: the general evolution of the population in absolute and relative terms, crude birth rates and mortality, total fertility rate, infant mortality and vegetative growth.
   The study of the human component of the settlement will begin from the mid-twentieth century. The starting date is justified because the 50s mark a turning point in demographic trends that began rising from mid-nineteenth century, since different regions of the Sierra de Cordoba will suffer an exodus of migration, unprecedented in its history, which will result in a drastic reduction of its strength, reaching in some of them more than a half thereof.
   This phenomenon was not unique to our area, but it is common in inland areas and in the mountains of Andalusia. As we know it was motivated by a set of facts of a socioeconomic nature-related crisis in the agricultural sector determined by the low yields, poor ownership structure and the attraction that woult hold certain areas of immigration on the basis of new economic incentives. The immediate circumstances that compel the exodus of the population can relate dependence on a primary agriculture sector, mining, and poor development of the area in relation to the rest of the country. More specifically we have to emphasize the influence the decline a agricultural productivity compounded by the almost absolute predominance of rainfed crops on a lower soil component, together with extensive practices and a low level of mechanization. This acted to the detriment of the income levels of the laborers and small landowners who were driven-forced to emigration.
   On the other hand, the high natural increase recorded since the beginning of the century, except for the parentheses of the Civil War, to the led-headed marianicas counties towards a situation of overcrowding of employees who had no place in farming or mining, and in decline from the previous decade. The important migratory flow was generated in the marianicas regions, like so many others produced in the Spanish territory not only assumed the depopulation of large areas but also a profound change in the relations of the population with the territory. The changes affect not only agricultural structures but also the settled areas and habitat types, especially in the case of permanent migration flows. The almost complete loss of the spread settlement, the reduction in all entities of population, including the municipal, heading caused an irreparable loss in manpower and an aging in the population structure, a situation which in practice meant the isolation of a part of the territory and the loss of weight in the regional and provincial economy.
   We can say that the final step that completes the process of modernization of the population from Cordoba mountain ton has the peculiarity that it is an acceleration produced as a result of the effects of population aging and reduced fertility. Until the fifties there was a clear relationship between economic development and demographic transition which were modified by the various components of the natural movement of the population. Since the fifties the phenomenon of migration alters the relationship between economic development and demographic transition, reaching a demographic similar to those of more developed regions although for some different causes more characteristic of underdeveloped areas.
   In conclusion the natural dynamics of the Sierra de Cordoba may be summarized in the period covered by the second half of the twentieth century saying that positive growth of the fifties led to the emigration of the decades that immediately followed, while such migration was the cause of altering the structure of age in population that finally resulted in a dynamic population whose most characteristic feature was the involution of the same one.
   The mountain town that had experienced the last stages of demographic transition during much of the twentieth century debated in recent years of that century and the beginning of this one with a burden of an exceptionally low population growth and a relatively stable migration net resulted in a continuous flow of people out of their counties. On the other hand, a group of foreign immigrants in increasing numbers, although hesitant to the same extent that economic stagnation is more evident. A situation that raises more questions than answers regarding the future evolution, composition and structure of the population, which establishes the relations of production and determines not only the different economic exploitation but also the pattern of settlement and an important agricultural component in landscapes as a rural environment. The reduction in the agricultural workforce as a result of such an outflow and the rationalization of farming and agricultural practices has meant in practice an abandonment of the settlement of many mountain villages and a significant loss of rural habitat, not only of buildings but also traditions and agricultural uses that were the livelihood of an exceptionally rich traditional architecture.
   Regarding the immediate future, it seems reasonable that they will not produce any news worthy of consideration with regard to various demographic variables: low birth and death will increase as a consequence of the aging population although life expectancy at birth will rise. Therefore, the medium growth to long term population depends very specifically on the input and output flows of immigrants, given that internal migration tends to stabilize, the arrival of immigrants takes on a particular relevance in the indisputable evolution of Andalusian population, but not as munch ass in the province of Cordoba, let alone marianicos spaces. So, all these circumstances draw an impossible generational replacement capacity, ie a regressive or stationary population situation in the Sierra de Cordoba, given the evolution of various demographic variables analyzed and the already negative projections that exist for the Cordoba area.

AB  - Introduction The study of the early neonatal and infant behavior has called the attention of several researchers with the purpose of establishing an early diagnostic of neurological damage. Ferenc Katona identifies, from the 28th week of gestation to the third month of extrauterine life, a group of locomotion and verticalization innate behaviors which are called Complex Elementary Movements (CEM). These sequences of generalized motor activity of central origin, with automatic movements, generate sensory impulses to the spinal cord, brainstem and superior systems in response to gravitational and acceleration stimulus. These impulses cause continuous and repetitive movements of the head, trunk and limbs, and lead to verticalization and locomotion. They also prefigure the human behavior by organizing structures and cerebral functions ontogenetically mature at birth and with greater resistance to damage. In normal European neonates and infants, the constancy and stability has allowed for the diagnose of early Nervous System dysfunction (SN). European researchers have applied procedures that include CEM for neurohabilitation.
   Katona explains that when CEM are induced, they stimulate the vestibular system performance. The repetitive and/or sustained muscular contractions of trunk and extremities during the attempts of verticalize or locomotion, transmit new stimulus that strengthen the initial stimulation. During the time that the infant maintains the pattern activation, the thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex are stimulated, simultaneously and proportionally, occurring changes in the muscular tone, the movement dynamics and posture within a critical period of cerebral plasticity. The movements of head, trunk and extremities are refined or reorganized as in normal child maturity (development). This prevents and avoids risks and altered functions. In Mexico, according to the information sources reviewed, there ore no studies describing the normal postnatal development variations. It is important to differentiate normal movements from the pathological ones to make early diagnosis of neurological damage in Mexican populations. Material and methods The Tlalpan outpatient family medicine clinic of the Institute of Security and Social Services for State Employees (ISSSTE) referred 25 infants, considered with low perinatal biological risk, residents of Mexico City. The Heinz Prechtl neurological sieve was applied to each infant to confirm an adequate neurological maturity. Fifteen infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria, the parents of nine infants agreed on their child participation in four evaluations, scheduled monthly, according to the day of birth. The parents signed the informed consent letter. In each evaluation, the ten maneuvers of activation were applied twice. They were distributed 6 at the first month, 9 at 2 and 3 months, and 8 at 4 months. Five maneuvers were applied to activate locomotion: Mcgraw, Bauer, reinforced Bauer, crawling on an inclinate slide and assisted crawling. Also five maneuvers were put into practice for verticalization: carry sitting, antigravity verticalization, stand up reaction, elementary walking and sitting in the air. Five behaviors and movements were described: crying, visual behavior (eyes closed or open with or without visual fixation), limbs, trunk and head movements. The evaluations were recorded in 8mm digital format and reviewed instantly during the evaluation. The camera's timer was used to measure the time they took to activate movements of locomotion or verticalization.
   To calculate frequencies and central tendency measures, the SAS statistical software JMP, version 7.0 was used. Results 320 activating maneuvers were used, 82.5% activated locomotion and 58% verticalization. The children awaked spontaneously with rude movements and cried, in 63% of the evaluations including the five locomotion patterns: 58.7% in the Alternating Cross Pattern (ACP), 10% for the Incomplete Simultaneous Pattern (ISP), 10% in the Lower Limb Alternating Pattern (LLAP), 1.25% on Complete Simultaneous Pattern (CSP) 2.5% and Homo lateral Pattern (HP). The most frequent pattern observed was the Alternate Cross Pattern (PAC) 58.7% and the less frequent was the Homo lateral Pattern (PH) 1.25%. In verticalization two patterns were observed: 58% with complete trunk and head alignment, 42% with incomplete alignment. The latencies to enable MEC were from 0-120 seconds, with M 27.7, DE +/- 48.8 for locomotion and M 9.43, DE +/- 20.7 for verticalization. Opening the eyes and visual fixation in the locomotion maneuvers occurred in the 43%, 20% in the first month, 31% in the 2nd month, 42% in the 3rd month and 75% in the 4th month. Verticalization maneuvers occurred in 64%, 47% in the first month, 49% in the second month, 64% in the 3rd month and 95% in the 4th month. As the children grew, the open eye and visual fixation conducts increased in presence. Locomotion appeared in the 43% of the children and verticalization in 64%.
   Discussion Katona reports that the MEC activation is given from birth to three months, with exception in two maneuvers: crawling on an inclined slide that appears until two months and on the four month the manifestation of elementary march. In this research, the locomotion and verticalization patterns appeared sometimes until the fourth month, with frequencies that change in 12% to 100% of the cases according to the maneuvers form. Two patterns were identified but not described, the PH with a case frecuency of 1.25% and the PSC with 2.5%. Katona suggested that infants up to three months old are able to activate several seconds to complete verticalization, due to vestibular activity. In our experience, until two months they are mainly short and incomplete patterns of vertical integration then completed and sustained during the third and fourth month.
   Concerning the time required to activate MEC, Katona reported latencies of 5-100 sec. with absence of responses until the 4th month. Except for elementary walking, we observed that the latency time varies with age. In this investigation the locomotion time was 27.7 sec average, founding 0-120 sec intervals. In verticalization, latencies were faster than the average latency time of 9.43 sec. With intervals of latency in the first two months of age of 0-19 sec. elementary walking and the stand up reaction with age took but in activating and to the fourth month in several cases no longer they appeared.
   Katona reported that the newborn is capable of a brief visual fixation with the presentation of the face or with a flashing object 20cm away. The results of the locomotion and verticalization maneuvers showed that the behavior was present in the first month, in less of the 50% locomotion assessments and in less of 70% in verticalization. When the maneuver allowed controlling the head or maintaining the face to face line sight, the infant opened and fixed visually.
   Conclusions In the nine Mexican infants explored, variations were reported in the postnatal MEC evolution, with respect to the age of appearing, patterns type, trunk and limbs movements, time required for activation (latencies), visual activity and crying presence were not observed. If these variations are confirmed we could establish more accurate reference parameters and analyze their relationship with biological and environmental factors. Thus, to strengthen a prevention method in neurohabilitation/neurorehabilitation for high-risk population benefit.
