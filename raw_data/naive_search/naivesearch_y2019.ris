AB  - Research in the field of ecology suggests that two main strategies, corridors and stepping-stones, can enhance urban habitat connectivity. While highly relevant to planning, no synthesis of this literature addresses planning research or implications. This review describes the effectiveness of corridor and stepping-stone strategies, actions that could enhance their ability to support animal movement, and the state of knowledge on connectivity planning, implementation, and outcomes. It concludes by identifying four significant gaps in our knowledge of planning for urban connectivity. Most critically, few studies assess the on-the-ground results of habitat connectivity planning and none examine the long-term outcomes.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is critical for ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation, yet urbanization is increasing habitat fragmentation. Green corridors that connect isolated remnant habitat patches (e.g. parks) can increase connectivity and provide ecosystem services in cities. Vacant land, especially prevalent in shrinking cities, presents a unique opportunity to reconnect these landscapes. This paper provides a practical and replicable approach for assessing landscape connectivity patterns and identifying priority locations for green corridors. The methodology integrates social and ecological factors coupled with site-scale multifunctional greenway designs and is applied to the city of Detroit as a proof of concept. First, we use FRAGSTATS to evaluate structural landscape connectivity patterns at a census tract scale. A functional connectivity assessment based on graph theory and Conefor software is used to validate the results, which indicate that habitat is highly fragmented in Detroit. To identify opportunities to reduce this fragmentation, we use a least-cost path approach to map potential green corridors linking city parks through vacant parcels, alleys, and smaller green spaces, and prioritize these corridors using a gravity model and network analysis. To make the model more concrete and useful for decision-makers, we develop site-level multifunctional corridor design typologies. This study presents a novel approach to assessing urban connectivity and a multi-scalar, systematic methodology for planning urban green infrastructure networks that connects landscape ecology with practical planning and design considerations to maximize social and ecological functions.

AB  - Urbanization poses a serious threat to local biodiversity, yet towns and cities with abundant natural features may harbor important species populations and communities. While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; and sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness, and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded >10% (98) of Guyana's bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas. Both species and landcover information should be integrated into urban land-use planning in the rapidly urbanizing Neotropics to maximize the conservation value of cities. This is imperative in the tropics, where anthropogenic pressures on species are growing significantly, and action needs to be taken to prevent biodiversity collapse.

AB  - The total amount of sealed surfaces is increasing in many urban areas, which presents a challenge for sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants when extreme rainfall events occur. One promising solution approach is the application of decentralized eco-technologies for water management such as green roofs and constructed wetlands, which also have the potential to improve urban biodiversity. We review the effects of these two eco-technologies on species richness, abundance and other facets of biodiversity (e.g., functional diversity). We find that while green roofs support fewer species than ground-level habitats and thus are not a substitute for the latter, the increase in green roof structural diversity supports species richness. Species abundance benefits from improved roof conditions (e.g., increased substrate depth). Few studies have investigated the functional diversity of green roofs so far, but the typical traits of green roof species have been identified. The biodiversity of animals in constructed wetlands can be improved by applying animal-aided design rather than by solely considering engineering requirements. For example, flat and barrier-free shore areas, diverse vegetation, and heterogeneous surroundings increase the attractiveness of constructed wetlands for a range of animals. We suggest that by combining and making increasing use of these two eco-technologies in urban areas, biodiversity will benefit.

AB  - Connectivity, the degree to which the landscape structure allows movement between resource and habitat patches, is vital for facilitating a wide range of ecological processes across transformed and anthropogenic landscapes. Connectivity is critical for dispersal of individuals from natal sites, colonisation of patches across a landscape by populations, the structuring of populations, and their persistence across metacommunities. Here, we present a replicable methodology for conservation and land-management practitioners to promote maximal functional connectivity for multiple taxa across a mixed land-use mosaic containing natural habitat patches. We used the maximal functional diversity present in three key taxa (trees, birds, and mammals) responsible for the persistence of forests and the provisioning of ecosystem function and services, in a mosaic landscape of natural, agricultural, and urban land-use practices to map probabilistic connectivity corridors. We used a hybrid of Circuit Theory, least-cost resistance pathways and pinch-points based on the traits and ecological parameters of a surrogate taxon to map functional connectivity across an anthropogenically-fragmented and critically endangered forest biome, the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. By using functional diversity measures, rather than taxonomic species richness, we ensured that maximal ecosystem services were safeguarded, concurrently achieving high-priority conservation goals of protecting specialist, endangered, and range-restricted species and traits that may otherwise be lost through high turnover of generalists at the expense of specialist species. Mapping circuit/least-cost corridors and critical pinch-points in remnant natural, yet unprotected forested patches, highlighted priority habitat to be conserved for promoting maximal functional connectivity, cognisant of the restricted budgets available for conservation planning and landscape-level protection. Our approach simultaneously protects ecosystem services, threatened specialist species and traits, and range-restricted and endangered habitats, linking current Protected Areas while prioritising landscape features of connectivity importance to be conserved for land-management practitioners with limited budgets.

AB  - The maintenance and enhancement of connectivity for multispecies is a challenging issue for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. It is well-known that different elements of the landscape matrix provide different levels of permeability to species moving across the landscape, but such effects may be species-specific. Whilst the spatial articulation of connectivity corridors is highly dependent on how we define them, and which species group we intended to provide connectivity for, it is also important to understand the optimal land cover mix to promote the maximum number of species. We demonstrate an approach to (1) identifying multispecies networks and examine how it compares to previous network approaches for a case study city of Sheffield, UK and (2) developing specific proposals for how green networks in Sheffield could be improved. We modelled least-cost corridors for four bird, three mammal and three reptile species. After validating the derived corridors, we created a union of least-cost corridors that identified the multispecies connectivity zones and compared the derived multispecies networks with the pre-existing networks (Sheffield City Council - the Green Network and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust- the Living Don ecological network). We found that a particular mix of land covers (particularly, woodlands, mixed vegetation and unimproved grassland) have a high potential to provide corridors for the maximum number of species around the edges of the city centre or the suburbs. A significant proportion of the Green Network and the Living Don ecological network coincide spatially with these land covers. Based on the comparisons of the derived and existing corridors, we discuss specific proposals for how Sheffield green networks could be improved and which areas to prioritise. Utilising species relevant connectivity models which incorporate a group of species with complementary and contrasting habitat requirements will enable a much more complete picture of potential landscape connectivity across the landscape and more informed decisions for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns and environmental drivers of freshwater diversity and community structure is a key challenge in biogeography and conservation biology. However, previous studies have focussed primarily on taxonomic diversity and have largely ignored the phylogenetic and functional facets resulting in an incomplete understanding of the community assembly. Here, we examine the influence of local environmental, hydrological proximity effects, land-use type and spatial structuring on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic (using taxonomic relatedness as a proxy) alpha and beta diversity (including the turnover and nestedness-resultant components) of pond macroinvertebrate communities. Ninety-five ponds across urban and non-urban land-uses in Leicestershire, UK were examined. Functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity were negatively correlated with species richness. At the alpha scale, functional diversity and taxonomic richness were primarily determined by local environmental factors while phylogenetic alpha diversity was driven by spatial factors. Compositional variation (beta diversity) of the different facets and components of functional and phylogenetic diversity were largely determined by local environmental variables. Pond surface area, dry phase length and macrophyte cover were consistently important predictors of the different facets and components of alpha and beta diversity. Our results suggest that pond management activities aimed at improving biodiversity should focus on improving and/or restoring local environmental conditions. Quantifying alpha and beta diversity of the different biodiversity facets facilitates a more accurate assessment of patterns in diversity and community structure. Integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity into conservation strategies will increase their efficiency and effectiveness, and maximise biodiversity protection in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Large cities in the tropics often comprise a myriad of manmade and natural elements that influence wildlife composition. Based on a citizen science-based project conducted in 2015, this study examined the combined effects of landscape factors on the bird assemblages in Kuala Lumpur and its conurbation, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 48 species including 2,599 individual birds were recorded; the majority of which (>80%) were species of open habitat. Generalized linear mixed model indicated that the area of green cover had the strongest influence on number of individuals. Specifically, the abundance of individuals was increased by the presence of river corridors and roadside reserves. Areas located further away from water bodies and with less green cover had fewer birds. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating a varied landscape matrix into urban planning so as to maintain urban bird diversity and demonstrate the usefulness of citizen science in biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - The ability to predict spatial variation in biodiversity is a long-standing but elusive objective of landscape ecology. It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of 'bigger, better, and more joined up'. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a GIS-coupled Bayesian Belief Network approach to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales in complex landscapes where current data and appropriate modelling approaches are lacking, and our findings have important implications for ecologists, conservationists and planners.

AB  - Background. Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong'an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities.
   Methods. A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity.
   Results. Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD).
   Discussion. Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species ff-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region. Finally, based on the biodiversity hotspots identified by this research, ecological corridors should be carefully planned to improve the stability of regional bird communities.

AB  - Population expansion and land transformation reduce biodiversity, potentially reducing environmental functionality. These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species' colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.

AB  - Context Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens often comprise a large portion of urban forests. Objectives We quantify structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston's neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some birds and arboreal mammals. Methods The urban landscape was classified by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Results Back yard tree canopy cover was 65.23%. The majority of canopy links were on residential land (60.95% total), and particularly in backyards. Back yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65% total). Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at similar to 23% of total canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy. Conclusions The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities. Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and increased.

AB  - Understanding how environmental changes driven by urbanization impact the biodiversity in urban riparian areas has great importance for landscape planning and river ecosystem conservation. There have been many studies on the response of bird communities to different environmental variables in urban parks; however, although supporting some of the highest bird diversities, case studies in urban riparian areas remain limited. In existing research, few studies have considered the impact of both local waterfront characteristics and surrounding environmental variables at a larger scale. In this study, we selected birds as the indicator to clarify their response to both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables in riparian areas of Tsing river, Beijing, in terms of (a) vegetation composition, (b) human disturbance, (c) land cover, and (d) landscape connectivity. We hypothesized that birds with different biological characteristics may respond differently to environmental variables. Birds were then further grouped according to the habitat type, residential type, and feeding type. It turned out that the coverage of grass and the disturbance of pedestrians are the most influential variables. Besides, compared with the land cover and landscape connectivity, the total contribution of vegetation characteristics and human disturbance accounts for the main proportion of explained variance. Information pertaining to these environmental variables can provide evidence to support bird conservation efforts in urban areas, and the identified distance threshold provides a basis for future landscape connectivity assessments.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most pervasive agents of contemporary landscape change globally. Rapid land use change and competing land uses pose multiple challenges for biodiversity conservation, particularly in periurban fringe areas where suburban development encroaches into natural habitats. The quenda (Isoodon fusci-venter) is one of the very few ground-dwelling critical weight range mammals to persist in the peri-urban fringe of the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We investigated the genetic connectivity of 42 populations of quenda across the Greater Perth metropolitan region using microsatellites and generalised dissimilarity modelling to evaluate the impact of landscape elements on functional connectivity. Spatially-explicit Bayesian cluster analysis indicated quenda exhibit significant population structure across the Perth region, which, at the broadest scale, was associated with hydrological and topographical features. Inter-population genetic connectivity was facilitated by the presence of native vegetation, particularly low vegetation (< 1.4 m height) that is the species' preferred habitat. Surprisingly, measures of urbanisation were not significant predictors of gene flow, potentially as quenda show some characteristics of urban utilizers. Given the rapid pace of development in the region, knowledge on the distribution and population structure of quenda, and understanding the processes that contribute to them, provides a basis for a landscape conservation approach to urban planning. Retention of suitable habitat that facilitates persistence of this important mammal is critical.

AB  - Rapid urbanization results in changes in land use, biogeochemical cycles, climate, hydrosystems, and biodiversity. Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health.

AB  - Urban green space structure and pattern have been one of the highlights in Landscape Architecture studies, accompanying with urgent demands of promoting ecological spatial structures in urban construction. Focusing on functional connectivity and construction strategies of the structure of green space network in Haidian District of Beijing, this research builds resistance surface and identifies linkages through habitat quality evaluation of the InVEST Model and the simulation with the Least-Cost Model, while adopting functional connectivity index (NL, NC, IIC, PC, and dIIL) to indicate the structural characteristics of green space network at varied distance thresholds. Results reveal that, on the whole, the distance threshold of 2,200 meters is most appropriate for the structure of the existing green space network of Haidian District, when 10 components and 353 linkages are identified and six important nodes and three important linkages that require a protection priority are further determined. Findings also disclose that the forest network of target tree species and that of water network of target water bird species are highly fragmented. Forest network serves in forms of dominant patch structure, local network structure, and fragmented cluster structure in the western mountainous area, the northern plain area, and the southeastern urban area, respectively. Moreover, the research proves that by introducing ten important linkages, the connectivity of forest network can be improved by 1.7 times, completing the overall structure in multiple directions and helping form a stable and resilient structure of the network. Finally, the research puts forward strategies for urban green space construction, including identifying construction objectives and target species, identifying and protecting important nodes and important linkages, and introducing possible important linkages and improving the structure of green space network, to help efficiently improve urban ecological quality.

AB  - Worldwide, cities are investing in greenspace to enhance urban quality of life and conserve biodiversity. Cities should ensure these investments do not unintentionally result in ecosystem disservices. Municipal management decisions regarding urban greenspaces, such as mowing frequency, could influence mosquito communities and public health. We examined how mowing, resultant vegetation characteristics, and landscape context influenced adult mosquito abundance in urban vacant lots. We sampled adult Culex and Aedes mosquitoes in a network of vacant lots within eight Cleveland, Ohio, USA neighborhoods in 2015 and 2016 using CO2-baited light traps and grass-infused gravid traps. For each lot, we quantified vegetation characteristics, including plant diversity, bloom area, and biomass, as well as the surrounding landscape composition at radii of 60 and 1000 m. We found that periodic mowing did not significantly affect mosquito abundances. However, vacant lots with more diverse plant communities were associated with a greater light trap capture of both Culex and Aedes. Both mosquito genera declined in light trap catches with increased impervious surface at 60 m. Similarly, Culex (gravid trap) declined with the amount of built infrastructure at 1000 m. In contrast, Aedes (light trap) increased with the concentration of buildings in the landscape at 1000 m. Our findings indicate that reducing the frequency of mowing within vacant lots will not necessarily increase adult mosquito abundance. Nonetheless, mosquito surveillance and management should be considered when planning conservation-focused greenspaces, as vegetation design choices and the landscape context of a site do influence vector abundance and potentially disease risk.

AB  - Context Cities are a challenging habitat for obligate nocturnal mammals because of the ubiquitous use of artificial light at night (ALAN). How nocturnal animals move in an urban landscape, particularly in response to ALAN is largely unknown. Objectives We studied the movement responses, foraging and commuting, of common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) to urban landscape features in general and ALAN in particular. Methods We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN. Our study is the first individual-based GPS tracking study to show sensitive responses of nocturnal wildlife to light pollution. Approaches to protect urban biodiversity need to include ALAN to safeguard the larger network of dark habitats for bats and other nocturnal species in cities.

AB  - Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners.

AB  - Research on urban wildlife can help promote coexistence and guide future interactions between humans and wildlife in developed regions, but most such investigations are limited to short-term, single-species studies, typically conducted within a single city. This restricted focus prevents scientists from recognizing global patterns and first principles regarding urban wildlife behavior and ecology. To overcome these limitations, we have designed a pioneering research network, the Urban Wildlife Information Network (UWIN), whereby partners collaborate across several cities to systematically collect data to populate long-term datasets on multiple species in urban areas. Data collected via UWIN support analyses that will enable us to build basic theory related to urban wildlife ecology. An analysis of mammals in seven metropolitan regions suggests that common species are similar across cities, but relative rates of occupancy differ markedly. We ultimately view UWIN as an applied tool that can be used to connect the public to urban nature at a continental scale, and provide information critical to urban planners and landscape architects. Our network therefore has the potential to advance knowledge and to improve the ability to plan and manage cities to support biodiversity.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is a leading process for the global environmental problems such as climate change, massive loss of natural habitats, an increase of air, water, soil quality and social troubles. Within the scope of elimination of these effects, detecting, preserving and managing a strategically planned ecological network can provide ecological, economic, social and cultural benefits. Specially, connectivity of landscape patches in urban areas is an important factor for urban ecosystem cycle. Ecological studies under these circumstances are concentrated in urban areas and strategies are being developed to create green systems by establishing links between green areas. In this study, a method based on the graph theory has been proposed to create ecological links between important landscape patches in the Chennai City and the effects of the created system on the city has been discussed. Firstly, a comprehensive database is created for Chennai in the GIS. And then, important urban landscape patches and connectivity are detected with use of Conefor software that enhances the quality of landscape patches and ensures that landscape connectivity is sustainable. With this scope, we used integral index of connectivity (IIC) index and the probability of connectivity (PC) index that have been known to show an enhanced performance for urban habitat conservation planning and change monitoring applications. Ultimately, the resulting findings are mapped in the GIS environment, and the ecological, social and cultural impacts of the system are discussed based on international literature.

AB  - The anthropogenic fragmentation of habitats has altered the distribution and size of populations of many species worldwide. To predict fate of populations and establish management practices that ensure their viability, we need to understand the demographic and genetic consequences of fragmentation. In this study, we analyzed whether the spatial configuration of remnant habitat patches within a fragmented landscape has shaped the patterns of genetic diversity and differences in local populations of the Montane brown frog (Rana ornativentris) in Tokyo, Japan. The species inhabits secondary forests and is particularly affected by fragmentation due to its habitat selectivity and low dispersal capability. We determined allele frequencies of six microsatellites to estimate genetic diversity of 33 local populations and pairwise genetic distances among them. Habitat suitability maps were developed based on two models, one with only climatic and topography as predictor variables (HSn), the second incorporating the potential barrier effect of urbanization as an additional variable (HSu). Ecological distances were calculated using the circuit theory applied to the habitat suitability maps. We found that within-population genetic diversity decreases as the HSu habitat suitability decreases. Moreover, pairwise population genetic distance showed the highest correlations with resistance (i.e., ecological) distances when the HSu map was used. Our results confirmed the expectation that urbanized lands are barriers to gene flow, and that habitat fragmentation restricts inter-population dispersal, thus reducing the genetic diversity of local populations. Our results also demonstrate that landscape genetics is a useful approach for identifying key factors affecting dispersal.

AB  - Environmental policies and the objective of no net loss highlight the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss, especially due to urbanization. In the environmental impact assessment context, habitat connectivity and the spatio-temporal dynamics of biodiversity are crucial to obtaining reliable predictions that can support decision-making. We propose a methodological framework 1) to quantify the overall impact of a development project on the functioning of an ecological network, and 2) to select the best locations for implanting new habitat patches intended to enhance landscape connectivity. The amount of reachable habitat concept was applied to three representative terrestrial mammal species: the red squirrel, the Eurasian badger and the European hedgehog. All three species are recognized as vulnerable to human pressures and potentially affected by the construction of a new stadium in our study site, Lyon (Southern France). The method combines the species distribution model Maxent with the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. The results showed that using any one of the avoidance and reduction measures on its own was unsuccessful in achieving the objective of no net loss when habitat connectivity is considered. However, the combination of new habitat patches and corridors offered a higher gain than distinct measures. This is especially important in the short term, when new hedgerow plantations have not yet developed enough to be used by the target species. Our findings indicate, first, the need to take the temporal scale into account in environmental impact assessment. We also show that applying the optimal scenario, constructed using a cumulative patch addition followed by a similar process testing a set of potential land-use changes, maximizes habitat connectivity. Our methodology provides a useful tool to increase target species' habitat connectivity within the mitigation hierarchy and to enhance development project design for increased environmental efficiency.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01; n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.

AB  - Urbanization negatively impacts the diversity of aquatic insect assemblages in headwater streams and can lead to the homogenization of insect communities at the regional level. However, less is known about the impact of urbanization on insects in headwater streams within smaller cities that have significant upstream portions outside of urban land use. We collected insects monthly from April to September in 2014 and 2015 from five streams that flowed from rural upstream through urban downstream land use, plus two rural reference streams, in Greater Binghamton, New York, in the northeast USA. While urbanization was associated with lower insect taxonomic richness (<mml:mo stretchy="false"><overbar></mml:mover>) and elevated stream water conductivity, the regional diversity () was similar among urban and rural land use. This corresponded to higher dissimilarity among urban sites () than among rural sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of higher urban stream insect community -diversity. Our results suggest that urbanization in this medium-sized city negatively impacts stream insect richness, but the change of community assemblages is not homogenous across the urban landscape. Connectivity between upstream rural sites and downstream urban sites may provide some relief from the impacts of urbanization in smaller cities.

AB  - Landscapes are becoming increasingly urbanized, causing loss and fragmentation of natural habitats, with potentially negative effects on biodiversity. Insects are among the organisms with the largest diversity in urbanized environments. Here, we sampled predator (Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and Crabronidae) and parasitoid (Tachinidae) flower-visiting insects in 36 sites in the city of Rome (Italy). Although the diversity of herbivorous insects in urban areas mostly depends on the availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, predators and parasitoids generally require a larger number of resources during their life cycle, and are expected to be particularly influenced by urbanization. As flower-visitors can easily move between habitat patches, the effect of urbanization was tested at multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and sub-regional). We found that urbanization influenced predator and parasitoid flower-visitors at all three spatial scales. At the local scale, streets and buildings negatively influenced evenness of predators and species richness and abundance of parasitoids probably acting as dispersal barrier. At the landscape scale, higher percentage of urban decreased predator abundance, while increasing their evenness, suggesting an increase in generalist and highly mobile species. Area and compactness (i.e. Contiguity index) of urban green interactively influenced predator communities, whereas evenness of parasitoids increased with increasing Contiguity index. At the sub-regional scale, species richness and abundance of predators increased with increasing distance from the city center. Compared to previous studies testing the effect of urbanization, we found little variation in species richness, abundance and evenness along our urbanization gradient. The current insect fauna has been probably selected for its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, being the result of the intensive anthropogenic alteration occurred in the area in the last centuries. Conservation strategies aimed at predator and parasitoid flying insects have to take in account variables at multiple spatial-scales, as well as the complementarity of resources across the landscape.

AB  - Urban areas are often perceived to have lower biodiversity than the wider countryside, but a few small-scale studies suggest that some urban land uses can support substantial pollinator populations. We present a large-scale, well-replicated study of floral resources and pollinators in 360 sites incorporating all major land uses in four British cities. Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate city-scale effects of management interventions on plant-pollinator community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator 'hotspots': gardens due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator diversity and leverage on city-scale plant-pollinator community robustness. Household income was positively associated with pollinator abundance in gardens, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic factors. Our results underpin urban planning recommendations to enhance pollinator conservation, using increasing city-scale community robustness as our measure of success.

AB  - Apex predators are important indicators of intact natural ecosystems. They are also sensitive to urbanization because they require broad home ranges and extensive contiguous habitat to support their prey base. Pumas (Puma concolor) can persist near human developed areas, but urbanization may be detrimental to their movement ecology, population structure, and genetic diversity. To investigate potential effects of urbanization in population connectivity of pumas, we performed a landscape genomics study of 130 pumas on the rural Western Slope and more urbanized Front Range of Colorado, USA. Over 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using double-digest, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). We investigated patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity, and tested for correlations between key landscape variables and genetic distance to assess the effects of urbanization and other landscape factors on gene flow. Levels of genetic diversity were similar for the Western Slope and Front Range, but effective population sizes were smaller, genetic distances were higher, and there was more admixture in the more urbanized Front Range. Forest cover was strongly positively associated with puma gene flow on the Western Slope, while impervious surfaces restricted gene flow and more open, natural habitats enhanced gene flow on the Front Range. Landscape genomic analyses revealed differences in puma movement and gene flow patterns in rural versus urban settings. Our results highlight the utility of dense, genome-scale markers to document subtle impacts of urbanization on a wide-ranging carnivore living near a large urban center.

AB  - Riparian forests along urban streams are affected by flashy hydrological regimes and adjacent upland land-use, and their downstream dynamics are altered by forest fragmentation and by frequent river network truncation. This can lead to lower riparian habitat quality, decreased dispersal along the river network and increased recruitment of novel plant communities including non-native species. Compared to forested landscapes, our understanding of riparian plant community diversity and composition along urban river networks is poor. We investigated riparian plant communities and riparian habitat variables along seven river networks situated along an urban gradient in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Six land-use metrics classifying the intensity of urbanisation on three spatial scales (sub-catchment, upstream riparian buffer, site buffer) were tested to explain the variation in riparian plant communities along the river networks and to describe the differences in riparian habitat. Riparian plant diversity peaked at sites which had between 40% and 70% of built-up land cover within sub-catchments; however, these communities contained a large number of non-native species compared to the forested streams. While total species richness and native species richness were more related to river network factors (catchment area), non-native richness was also affected by land-use within a site. Community composition was more related to local land-use than catchment area. Geographical distance between sites (both overland and hydrological) was increasingly more important for community heterogeneity along the urbanisation gradient. Riparian habitat worsened along the urbanisation gradient, with higher disturbance and soil pH and lower soil organic content and bryophyte cover in the more urban catchments. Riparian habitat variables were also related to the position along the river networks. Our results provide important insights into how riparian plant communities and riparian habitat differ along a gradient of urbanisation. Compared to previous studies we investigated the patterns in riparian vegetation in the context of river networks, including a variety of land-use metrics, and analysed data across different spatial scales. This revealed important trends in plant diversity, demonstrated that urban land-use increases the occurrence of non-native species, and showed that the land-use at the local scale is a stronger determinant of plant assemblages compared to land-use at broader scales. These novel findings can be applied to land management in order to mitigate the effects of urbanisation on riparian ecosystems and the functions they provide for adjacent streams and rivers.

AB  - Effective management and conservation of urban herpetofauna is challenging because little is known about the distribution, population dynamics, or habitat use of most species in urban areas. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the occupancy dynamics of seven common species in the Chicago, Illinois, USA, metropolitan area using artificial cover objects and aquatic trapping. From 2009 to 2012, we detected seven focal species 899 times, ranging from 49 detections of Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) to 223 detections of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta). We used single-species multi-season (dynamic) occupancy models and a suite of environmental covariates to determine how natural (e.g., canopy cover) and urban (e.g., road density) habitat features influence rates of occupancy and turnover at local (n = 159 monitoring points) and landscape (n = 27 preserves) scales while explicitly incorporating detectability. Our results suggest that natural habitat features were generally better predictors of occupancy and turnover than anthropogenic features. At the local scale, extinction was more common than colonization, while at the landscape scale, colonization was more common than extinction. This study provides important baseline information to guide future research and management decisions and we recommend managing urban preserves for habitat diversity and connectivity to maximize herpetofaunal diversity.

AB  - ContextUrbanization is a substantial force shaping the genetic and demographic structure of natural populations. Urban development and major highways can limit animal movements, and thus gene flow, even in highly mobile species. Characterizing varying species responses to human activity and fragmentation is important for maintaining genetic continuity in wild animals and for preserving biodiversity. As one of the only common and wide-ranging large wild herbivores in much of urban North America, deer play an important ecological role in urban ecosystems, yet the genetic impacts of development on deer are not well known.ObjectivesWe assessed genetic connectivity for mule deer to understand their genetic response to habitat fragmentation, due to development and highway barriers, in an increasingly urbanized landscape.MethodsUsing non-invasive sampling across a broad region of southern California, we investigated genetic structure among several natural areas that were separated by major highways and applied least-cost path modelling to determine if landscape context and highway attributes influence genetic distance for mule deer.ResultsWe observed significant yet variable differentiation between subregions. We show that genetic structure corresponds with highway boundaries in certain habitat patches, and that particular landscape configurations more greatly limit gene flow between patches.ConclusionsAs a large and highly mobile species generally considered to be well adapted to human activity, mule deer nonetheless showed genetic impacts of intensive urbanization. Because of this potential vulnerability, mule deer and other ungulates may require further consideration for effective habitat management and maintenance of landscape connectivity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - As a primary concern in biodiversity conservation, understanding the impact of land use/cover change (LUCC) on functional connectivity has the overarching significance. Yet, LUCC simulation models used in previous studies are insufficient to tackle the complex and non-linear interactions of land-use components, and thus may not be able to provide the accurate impact assessments. This paper aimed to fill this gap and to find a solution that avoids significant connectivity loss in the future LUCC. The artificial neural network (ANN) based cellular automata (CA) and graph theory were combined, to explore potential changes in functional connectivity under alternative urban expansion scenarios. Results show that, both urban land and forested land will increase in all of future scenarios; however, functional connectivity of each species will still decrease except under a population change based scenario. The increase in forested land and the contrary connectivity loss proved the strong barrier effect caused by urban expansion. The impacts vary by species: small forest mammals might benefit more from the gain in the stepping-stone-like patches, while the infra-patch connectivity loss is the primary threat for large terrestrial mammals. Finally, we identified the key connecting patches (i.e., stepping-stones) and suggested that those patches should be prioritized for protection.

AB  - Urbanization can profoundly influence the ecosystem service for biodiversity conservation. However, few studies have investigated this effect, which is significant for maintaining regional sustainable development. We take the rapidly developing, mountainous and biodiversity hotspot region, Jinghong, in southern Yunnan Province as the case study. An integrated ecosystem service model (PANDORA) is used to evaluate this regional BESV (ecosystem service value for biodiversity conservation). The modeled BESV is sensitive to landscape connectivity changes. From the 1970s to 2010, regional urban lands increased from 18.64 km(2) to 36.81 km(2), while the BESV decreased from $6.08 million year(-1) to $5.32 million year(-1). Along with distance gradients from the city center to the fringe, BESV varies as an approximate hump-shaped pattern. Because correlation analysis reveals a stronger influence of landscape composition on spatial BESV estimates than the landscape configuration does, we conclude that the projected urban expansion will accelerate the BESV reduction. Of the projected urban land, 95% will show a decreasing BESV trend by approximately $2 m(-2) year(-1). To prevent this, we recommend compact urban planning for the mountainous city.

AB  - We present the first major systematic study of land snail diversity on green roofs. We surveyed 27 green roofs and the adjacent ground habitat in six major cities in the southeastern United States. We found a total of 18 species of land snails, with three considered to be non-native or invasive species. The majority of land snails encountered in surveys are widespread, generalist species, typically adapted to open habitats. Twelve of the land snails encountered are "greenhouse" species that are very commonly transported via the horticultural trade. Therefore, we infer that at least some land snail species are introduced to green roofs via initial green roof installation and associated landscaping. The major determinants of snail species richness and abundance are the size of each roof and the quality of green roof maintenance regime.

AB  - Urban forests associated with green infrastructure for sustainable outcomes are particularly critical in the Global South, where some of the world's fastest-growing cities are located. However, compared to temperate cities, the drivers of urban tree species distribution in tropical cities remain understudied. In this study, we quantify the spatial distribution and abundance of urban forests in the tropical city of Georgetown, Guyana. British colonialism has shaped this city, including forced movement of peoples under slavery from Africa and indentured servants from the Indian Subcontinent. We studied how this multicultural context has influenced tree species distributions in the capital city of the only Anglophone country in South America. We quantified the abundance of tree species using a stratified sampling design to distribute transects across fifteen neighborhoods that vary in distance to the colonial center of the city and ethnic composition. We recorded a total of 57 unique species, the majority of which (73%) were cultivated for their edible fruits. We identify tree species that likely represent Guyana's unique multicultural heritage by comparing our species list to flora in nine cities in neighboring countries (Venezuela and Brazil) with different colonial histories. This international comparison identified a set of tree species that occurred only in Guyana. Relationships between ethnic composition and colonial history and tree species distribution were weak at the neighborhood scale, where proportion of East Indian residents had little explanatory power and distance to colonial center was correlated with abundance of only some species groups. This apparent discrepancy between neighborhood and national scales may relate to the establishment of Guyanese food as a unifying national identifier across ethnicities. The prominence of edible fruit trees in our study suggests a set of species that could be incorporated into urban planning to strengthen biocultural linkages, foster cultural integration, and promote food security.

AB  - Cities need to build on their resilience to cope with a broad range of natural and manmade hazards that threaten their competitiveness, livability, and functionality. Recognizing this need, the resilience concept is increasingly used as an organizing principle to guide research design and facilitate a more informed decision-making process. However, despite the abundance of studies on urban resilience, research on the link between urban form and resilience is limited and fragmented. This study sheds more light on this issue by reviewing and synthesizing theoretical and empirical evidence on how physical structure of cities can facilitate or hinder urban resilience. Acknowledging that each city is located within a nested hierarchy of scales that is characterized by cross-scale dynamics, only the macro-level aspects and elements of urban form are analyzed in this paper. These are namely 'scale hierarchy', 'city size', 'development type', 'degree of clustering', and 'landscape/habitat connectivity'. Key criteria and indicators for analyzing resilience of each element/aspect are specified and used to discuss how macro-scale urban form is related to various resilience properties such as robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, modularity, flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency. Findings indicate that urban form has major implications for social, ecological, and economic functionality of cities and can play a key role in enhancing their resilience and sustainability.

AB  - The decline and near extirpation of lichens from urban areas was documented worldwide over the past 2 centuries, with the lowest diversity observed in many cities during the 1960s and 1970s. One major contributing factor to this observed decline was high levels of unregulated air pollution, which has a strong negative impact on lichen growth and survival. Since then lichens have begun recolonizing cities, in many cases at a rapid rate. New York City followed these same trends in urban lichen diversity changes. To better understand the current state of New York City lichen diversity, we have been conducting surveys at green spaces throughout the city. During one of these surveys we found a single thallus of Usnea on one very large, old red oak (Queirus rubra L.) at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. The individual was too poorly developed to identify by its morphology and chemistry, so we took a DNA barcoding approach. Molecular data confidently assigned the thallus as Usnea mutabilis Stirton. Finding this thallus was highly notable, as it is the first report of an Usnea from New York City since 1824. The thallus is about 1.5 cm long, which suggests that it established within the last 30 yr. This finding highlights the continued improvement of urban environments for lichen recolonization, and the importance of cemeteries in providing stable green spaces for urban biodiversity.

AB  - Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil.

AB  - Studying the effects of urbanization on native wildlife presents an opportunity for us to learn how to design anthropogenic habitats that can best support wildlife and humans alike. In order to explore which types of suburban development best support bird diversity, a network of 16 bird feeders was installed across a university campus to compare bird diversity and community composition at locations varying in land covers such as natural forest, lawn, plantings, pavement, and buildings. Birds were observed at all feeder stations over three seasons and mist-nets were used to capture and band birds during the summer. Bird species richness, diversity, and invasive species dominance varied significantly across the feeder station sites, with higher diversity in less urbanized locations with larger areas of natural forest. Invasive House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) dominated the most urban sites and were associated with larger areas of buildings and herbaceous plantings. However, when sites with natural forest were removed from the analysis, the area of trees planted over lawn was associated with higher diversity, indicating that an increase in tree cover can support diversity in a completely developed landscape. Midscale suburban developments typically feature lawns, pavement, and landscaped plantings, but our results indicate that replacing lawns with trees, or better yet, restored forest patches, may allow us to preserve and even increase the biodiversity of our rapidly multiplying suburban landscapes.

AB  - Urban-rural interfaces represent complex systems that require complex solutions for sustainable development and resilience against pollution, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss and impaired flux of ecosystem services (ES). Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly recognised as an effective tool for addressing such a complexity, but needs priority setting to maximise benefits and minimise drawbacks of implementation. Therefore, a prioritisation approach focused on biodiversity and ES in peri-urban areas is required. In the present work, a systematic and hierarchical framework is proposed for setting priority GI objectives, location and actions aimed at enhancing local biodiversity, ES flux and farming sustainability in urban peripheries. By means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome, the framework allowed identification of the main demand for ES and biodiversity; the most suitable location for GI implementation; and the best cost-effective actions. The GI implementation showed an improvement in terms of wooded hedgerow density, an increase regarding the ecological connectivity of riparian ecosystems, and an increment of agroecosystems designated to enhance the ecological network and wildlife support. Finally, the prioritisation framework contributes to fostering environmental benefits while complying with regulations and management practices from the regional to the farm/field decision level.

AB  - Agriculture has long been a part of the urban landscape, from gardens to small scale farms. In recent decades, interest in producing food in cities has grown dramatically, with an estimated 30% of the global urban population engaged in some form of food production. Identifying and managing the insect biodiversity found on city farms is a complex task often requiring years of study and specialization, especially in urban landscapes which have a complicated tapestry of fragmentation, diversity, pollution, and introduced species. Supporting urban growers with relevant data informs insect management decision-making for both growers and their neighbors, yet this information can be difficult to come by. In this study, we introduced several web-based citizen science programs that can connect growers with useful data products and people to help with the who, what, where, and when of urban insects. Combining the power of citizen science volunteers with the efforts of urban farmers can result in a clearer picture of the diversity and ecosystem services in play, limited insecticide use, and enhanced non-chemical alternatives. Connecting urban farming practices with citizen science programs also demonstrates the ecosystem value of urban agriculture and engages more citizens with the topics of food production, security, and justice in their communities.

AB  - The provision of health and well-being is one of the fundamental tasks of urban green infrastructure. This requires a new estimation of the strategic distribution and accessibility of green areas. Gorizia and Nova Gorica are two cities lying next to each other on either side of the border between Italy and Slovenia. Due to political circumstances, they developed independently, which applies to their green areas as well. Urban city areas and other land cover classes were extracted from the CORINE Land Cover map; the digital data were processed using ArcGIS. At the landscape hierarchical level, the importance of natural vegetation remnants was assessed based on current land use maps. Forest patches, hedgerows, remnants of natural vegetation, and spontaneous afforestation on abandoned agricultural lands were detected and delineated using CNES digital images and digital orthophoto images. The green areas positioned in the two interior city areas were delineated separately according to data on the two cities' green areas. We estimated the forest continuum separately, based on the oldest cartographic sources from the end of the 18th century, the Franziscean cadastre from the early 19th century, and the Italian cadastre from 1940. We estimated the interior or core area of the forest patches based on studies of habitat fragmentation and the depth of the forest edge. Our research theory is based on the proven sustainability of indispensable spatial patterns emerging from landscape ecology that are especially necessary in altered (rural, urban) landscapes. Our results show that the most important pattern of green areas supporting the well-being of both cities' inhabitants can be achieved by the mutual development of the two major urban forests, each situated in one of the cities, in addition to riparian corridors and bits of nature represented by public parks. Collaborative planning between the two cities would enhance common benefits, including future economic and social influences and innovations.

AB  - Urban community gardens offer unique social and ecological benefits in cities. However, given the dynamic nature of cities and the profound effects of variable land uses on green space provisioning for people and wildlife, investigating community gardens from a landscape perspective offers valuable insight into the functions of these spaces in terms of ecosystem services and sustainable development. In this study, we use garden locations provided by stakeholder groups and fine-scale spatial data to compare community gardens across three cities: New York City, NY, Chicago, IL, and Baltimore, MD (USA). In each city, we assess the spatial distribution of gardens and compare the natural vegetation and impervious surface cover within these gardens to the surrounding neighborhood and landscape. We then compared these cities to clarify the role of community gardens in metropolitan development. Our findings demonstrate that gardens cluster in neighborhoods in New York City and Chicago, but they are more spatially distributed across the landscape in Baltimore. The distribution of Baltimore's community gardens is more likely to be contributing to a greater network of ecosystem services across a broader urban landscape. Moreover, at the garden scale, gardens in NYC and Chicago have more canopy cover and built infrastructure than the more herbaceous gardens in Baltimore. This suggests that our case study cities exhibit different garden typologies, histories, and potential for ecosystem services. This work provides critical insight into the typology in and around community gardens in different cities, which is useful in understanding the potential ecosystem services and planning trajectories of these cities.

AB  - Aim Habitat loss and alteration are widely considered one of the main drivers of current pollinator diversity loss. Yet little is known about habitat importance and preferences for major groups of pollinators, although this information is crucial to anticipate and mitigate the current decline of their populations. We aim to rank and assess the importance of different habitats for bees, to determine the preference for and avoidance of particular habitat types by different bees and to quantify the diversity of bees within and among habitats. Location North-eastern USA. Time period The sampling was done over 15 years (2001-2015). Major taxa studied Apoidea. Methods We used an unprecedented extensive dataset of >15,000 bee specimens, comprising more than 400 species collected across north-east USA. We extracted habitat information from the sample points and used network analyses, null models comparisons and beta-diversity analysis to assess habitat importance, habitat preference, use and diversity. Results We found that natural habitats sustain higher bee diversity and a different set of species than agricultural and urban areas. Although many bee species used human-altered habitats, most species exhibited strong preferences for forested habitats and only a few preferred altered habitats over more natural habitats. In contrast to previous studies, landscape composition only had moderate buffer effects on diversity loss. The loss of biodiversity in human-altered environments could have been higher but it was partially compensated by the presence of human commensals and exotic species. Main conclusions Although human-altered environments may harbour a substantial number of species, our work suggests that preserving natural areas is still essential to guarantee the conservation of bee biodiversity.

AB  - Landscape connectivity for wildlife populations is declining globally due to increasing development and habitat fragmentation. However, outside of full protection of undeveloped wildlife corridors, conservation planners have limited tools to identify the appropriate level of densification such that landscape permeability for wildlife is maintained. Here we sought to determine the development characteristics that contribute to movement potential in an exurban landscape for a large carnivore, the puma. We first fit a piecewise step-selection function from movement paths from 28 male pumas to identify threshold levels of development that produce barriers to movement. We then applied this threshold to projected housing densities of existing parcels under a full General Plan buildout scenario in Santa Cruz County to illustrate how parcels at risk of increasing above the puma movement threshold can be identified. Finally, we tested the relative importance of characteristics associated with parcels and the surrounding area on relative puma movement. We found that pumas exhibit avoidance of housing density that saturates at a threshold, and that puma utilization of parcels at risk of densification above this threshold is predicted by parcel area and the housing density and area of surrounding parcels. Our work suggests that maintaining permeability in developing landscapes is likely contingent on preventing densification and parcel subdivision in exurban areas. We discuss how our findings and approach can be used by conservation planners to promote landscape permeability in already partially developed landscapes.

AB  - Green Infrastructure (GI) definition, deriving from the United States green infrastructure for hydro-geological rebalancing through imitating the nature stormwater management, was consolidated in Europe by GI Planning Guide. Nowadays GI can be considered a valid and meaningful approach for ameliorating urban complex ecosystems, and could also be considered as mitigation action of land consumption, according to the guidelines on the soil sealing of the European Commission (2012). The metropolitan area of Naples located in south Italy is characterized by an unauthorized and chaotic urban development. The land-use map reported an average of 30% of urbanization in the metropolitan area, rising up to 50-60% and as high as 98% in the north core area of the city. This high level of urbanization is directly related to the habitat fragmentation. The National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy defines several challenges and targets to counteract the biodiversity loss in Italy, identifying urban areas as places exposed to the greatest pressures on ecosystems. Therefore, the integration of different policies limiting habitat fragmentation, heat island effect and natural soil hydro-geological degradation into spatial planning, especially through green corridors and ecosystem enhancement in urban areas is an urgent need for the society. Spatial planning has to be renewed in metropolitan areas, where threats and weaknesses to biodiversity conservation are stronger than in any other place, according to the Law n. 56/2014, (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica ltaliana, 2014) committing metropolitan cities to the enactment of General Territorial Plan. In the current paper, we aim at designing an ecological network for the metropolitan area of Naples one of the biggest city of southern Italy. The analyses include the adopted methodological procedure, i.e., ecological network analysis and design, and the introductory elements of a spatial analysis on a pilot ecological network of several patches. Finally, the paper illustrates the network analysis conceived as a monitoring system and also in future perspective, as a planning support system.

AB  - Coastal seascapes are composed of a diversity of habitats that are linked in space and time by the movement of organisms. The context and configuration of coastal ecosystems shapes many important properties of animal assemblages, but potential seascape effects of natural and artificial habitats on nearby habitats are typically considered in isolation. We test whether, and how, the seascape context of natural and urban habitats modified fish assemblages across estuaries. Fish were sampled with underwater videos in five habitat types (mangroves, rock bars, log snags, unvegetated sediments, armoured shorelines) in 17 estuaries in eastern Australia. Different habitats supported distinct fish assemblages, but the spatial context of mangroves and armoured shorelines had pervasive ecological effects that extended across entire estuaries. In most estuarine habitats, fish diversity and abundance was greatest when they were in close proximity of mangroves, and decreased due to the proximity of armoured shorelines. Many cities are centred on estuaries, and urban expansion is often associated with the fragmentation of mangrove forests. Our findings emphasize that these transformations of urban estuarine landscapes are likely to propagate to broader ecological impacts detectable in multiple habitats beyond mangrove forests.

AB  - Light pollution constitutes a major threat to biodiversity by decreasing habitat quality and landscape connectivity for nocturnal species. While there is an increasing consideration of biodiversity in urban management policies, the impact of artificial light is poorly accounted for. This is in a large part due to the lack of quantitative information and relevant guidelines to limit its negative effects. Here we compared the potential of two sources of information on light pollution, remote sensing (nocturnal picture taken from the International Space Station ISS) and ground-based (location of streetlights) data, to measure its impact on bats. Our aims were to (i) evaluate how light pollution affected Pipistrellus pipistrellus activity at the city scale, (ii) determine which source of information was the most relevant to measure light pollution's effect and (iii) define a reproducible methodology applicable in land management to account for biodiversity in lighting planning. We used citizen science data to model the activity of P. pipistrellus, a species considered light tolerant, within three cities of France while accounting for artificial light through a variable based on either source of information. We showed that at the city scale, P. pipistrellus activity is negatively impacted by light pollution irrespective of the light variable used. This detrimental effect was better described by variables based on ISS pictures than on streetlights location. Our methodology can be easily reproduced and used in urban planning to help take the impact of light pollution into consideration and promote a biodiversity-friendly management of artificial light.

AB  - Evidence is growing that human modification of landscapes has dramatically altered evolutionary processes. In urban population genetic studies, urbanization is typically predicted to act as a barrier that isolates populations of species, leading to increased genetic drift within populations and reduced gene flow between populations. However, urbanization may also facilitate dispersal among populations, leading to higher genetic diversity within, and lower differentiation between, urban populations. We reviewed the literature on nonadaptive urban evolution to evaluate the support for each of these urban fragmentation and facilitation models. In a review of the literature with supporting quantitative analyses of 167 published urban population genetics studies, we found a weak signature of reduced within-population genetic diversity and no evidence of consistently increased between-population genetic differentiation associated with urbanization. In addition, we found that urban landscape features act as barriers or conduits to gene flow, depending on the species and city in question. Thus, we speculate that dispersal ability of species and environmental heterogeneity between cities contributes to the variation exhibited in our results. However, >90% of published studies reviewed here showed an association of urbanization with genetic drift or gene flow, highlighting the strong impact of urbanization on nonadaptive evolution. It is clear that species biology and city heterogeneity obscure patterns of genetic drift and gene flow in a quantitative analysis. Thus, we suggest that future research makes comparisons of multiple cities and nonurban habitats, and takes into consideration species' natural history, environmental variation, spatial modelling and marker selection.

AB  - The ecological impacts of landscape modification and urbanisation have transformed the composition of plant and animal assemblages, and altered the condition of ecosystems globally. Landscape transformation influences the spatial distribution of species and ecological functions by selecting for generalist species with wide ecological niches, which can adapt to opportunities in highly-modified environments. These effects of landscape modification can shape functional diversity on land, but it is not clear whether they have similar functional consequences in the sea. We used estuaries as a model system to test how landscape transformation alters functional diversity in coastal seascapes, and measured how variation in level of urbanisation, catchment modification and habitat loss influenced fish diversity across thirty-nine estuaries in eastern Australia. Fish were surveyed with baited remote underwater video stations and functional diversity was indexed with three metrics that describe variation in the functional traits and niche space of assemblages. The extent of landscape transformation in the catchment of each estuary was associated with variation in the functional diversity of estuarine fish assemblages. These effects were, however, not what we expected as functional diversity was highest in modified estuaries that supported a large area of both urban and grazing land in their catchments, were bordered by a small area of natural terrestrial vegetation and that contained a moderate area of mangroves. Zoobenthivores and omnivores dominated assemblages in highly-modified estuaries, and piscivorous fishes were common in natural waterways. Our results demonstrate, that the modification and urbanisation of ecosystems on land can alter functional diversity in the sea. Intense landscape transformation appears to select for abundant generalists with wide trophic niches, and against species with specialised diets, and we suggest that these changes might have fundamental consequences for ecosystem functioning in estuaries, and other highly modified seascapes.

AB  - Maintaining urban greenspace is important for stimulating diverse human-nature interactions. Yet, which greenspace to prioritize for conservation under threat of urban densification is a major planning challenge. Besides ecological knowledge and objective use, people's subjective perception or opinion of urban greenspace has been emphasized in assessing the conservation value of urban greenspace and guiding present-day urban planning. Better understanding on people's perception of urban greenspace and its influencing factors are, therefore, needed. Here we employ a Public Participatory Geographic Information System (PPGIS) survey on "unique urban nature" in the city of Helsinki to explore people's perceived uniqueness (i.e., perceived conservation value) of urban forest patches. We use generalized linear modeling (GLM) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate the relationship between this perceived uniqueness and measurable conservation factors, specifically four biodiversity indicators (BDIs) and seven environmental factors characterizing vegetation structure, landscape features and urban context of the forest patch. Results show that biodiversity has a strong positive impact on perceived uniqueness (PU), while environmental factors have variable impacts on PU, either directly or indirectly through their impacts on biodiversity. While the size and surrounding population density of an urban forest are positively correlated with both biodiversity and PU, its connectivity, surrounding constructed land-use, and canopy cover exhibit negative correlations with PU. Our results highlight the importance of biodiversity in affecting PU both as a direct influencing factor and as a mediator of the impact of environmental factors. We detected distinct effects of environmental factors (e.g., connectivity, canopy cover) on biodiversity and PU, implying different responses of biodiversity and PU to these factors, and a potential trade-off between biodiversity (natural conservation value) and people's conservation value when managing urban forests.

AB  - Urban ecosystems, as mosaics of residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural land, present challenges for species survival due to impervious surface, degradation, fragmentation, and modification of natural habitat, pollution, and introduced species. Some urban habitats, such as community gardens, support biodiversity and promote ecosystem services. In gardens, local factors (e.g., vegetation, groundcover) and landscape surroundings (e.g., agriculture, built or impervious cover) may influence species abundance, richness, and functional traits that are present. We examined which local and landscape factors within 19 community gardens in the California central coast influence ground beetle (Carabidae) activity density, species richness, functional group richness, and functional traitsbody size, wing morphology, and dispersal ability. Gardens with higher crop richness and that are surrounded by agricultural land had greater carabid activity density, while species and functional group richness did not respond to any local or landscape factor. Gardens with more leaf litter had lower carabid activity, and gardens with more leaf litter tended to have more larger carabids. Changes in local (floral abundance, ground cover) and landscape (urban land cover) factors also influenced the distribution of individuals with certain wing morphology and body size traits. Thus, both local and landscape factors influence the taxonomic and functional traits of carabid communities, with potential implications for pest control services that are provided by carabids.

AB  - Context Many connectivity metrics have been used to measure the connectivity of a landscape and to evaluate the effects of land-use changes and potential mitigation measures. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of how to accurately quantify landscape connectivity. Objectives A number of metrics only measure between-patch connectivity, i.e. the connectivity between different habitat patches, which can produce misleading results. This paper demonstrates that the inclusion of within-patch connectivity is important for accurate results. Methods The behavior of two metrics is compared: the Connectance Index (CONNECT), which measures only between-patch connectivity, and the effective mesh size (m(eff)), which includes both within-patch and between-patch connectivity. The connectivity values of both metrics were calculated on a set of simulated landscapes. Twenty cities were then added to these landscapes to calculate the resulting changes in connectivity. Results We found that when using CONNECT counter-intuitive results occurred due to not including within-patch connectivity, such as scenarios where connectivity increased with increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. These counter-intuitive results were resolved when using m(eff). For example, landscapes with low habitat amount may be particularly sensitive to urban development, but this is not reflected by CONNECT. Conclusions Applying misleading results from metrics like CONNECT can have detrimental effects on natural ecosystems, because reductions in within-patch connectivity by human activities are neglected. Therefore, this paper provides evidence for the crucial need to consider the balance between within-patch connectivity and between-patch connectivity when calculating the connectivity of landscapes.

AB  - ContextLight pollution can alter animal movements and landscape connectivity. This is particularly true in urban landscapes where a need to incorporate conservation issues in urban planning is urgent.ObjectivesWe investigated how potential light-reduction scenarios at conurbation scale change landscape connectivity for bats.MethodsThrough random stratified sampling and species distribution modelling, we assessed the relative importance of light pollution on bat presence probability and activity. We recorded bats during one entire night on each 305 sampling points in 2015. In 2016, we surveyed 94 supplementary points to evaluate models performance. We used our spatial predictions to characterize landscape resistance to bat movements. Then we applied a least-cost modelling approach to identify nocturnal corridors and estimated the impact of five light-reduction scenarios on landscape connectivity for two light non-tolerant bat species.ResultsWe found that light pollution detected from satellite images was a good predictor of bat presence and activity up to 700m radius. Our results exhibited contrasting responses to average radiance: M. daubentonii responded negatively, P. nathusii had a positive response for low values then a negative response after a threshold radiance value of 20W.m(-2).sr(-1) and E. serotinus responded positively. Five and four light-reduction scenarios significantly improved landscape connectivity for M. daubentonii and P. nathusii respectively.ConclusionsLight-reduction measures should be included in urban planning to provide sustainable conditions for bats in cities. We advocate for the use of our methodological approach to further studies to find the best trade-off between conservation needs and social acceptability.

AB  - The transportation system in urban areas plays a critical role in evacuation and resource supply during disasters. Transportation diversity, i.e., the availability and distribution of transportation modes across a community, impacts the mode complementarity, which can affect population movements and connectivity among spatial units-especially during extreme events when a failure in one mode can be compensated by other modes. However, few quantitative efforts have explored the impact of physical infrastructure configurations, and more specifically transportation diversity, on urban mobility and connectivity in an actual disaster context. In this paper, we measure transportation diversity with two factors-functional richness and functional evenness translated from the concept of diversity in ecological systems. Disaster resilience is regarded as a dynamic process pre, during, and post disaster in distinct communities and is tracked and quantified based on geospatial Twitter data of population cross-ZIP code tabulation areas movements with an ecology-inspired method-Fisher information-over time. Specifically, we compared the resilience of different neighborhoods in the city of Houston in Hurricane Harvey and found that neighborhoods with a higher level of transportation diversity demonstrated higher resiliency in their mobility during and after the hurricane. This study contributes to understanding how the availability and distribution of transportation infrastructure can impact the disaster resilience of human-infrastructure systems in urban areas. The results can improve transportation design and future urban planning, especially in the context of climate change and natural hazards.

AB  - Forest fragmentation as a result of urbanisation can adversely affect gene flow between wildlife populations. Although gene flow among fragmented populations has been investigated for many species, there has been little research into the effects of urbanisation on gene flow in large mammals. Singapore is a small, densely urbanised tropical city-state where more than 99% of its original forest has been cleared. The wild pig is currently the largest native terrestrial mammal in Singapore and has important roles in maintaining plant diversity and seed dispersal. Pigs are widespread and present in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) as well as other forest patches in Singapore. Due to the extent of urbanisation, it is unclear if genetic connectivity exists between the CCNR and other forest fragments. In this study, genome libraries from 48 samples of pig blood were collected from two sites: 1) the CCNR and 2) forest fragments in the northeast of Singapore. Genome-wide SNP loci were used to understand the population genomics of the two pig populations. The results indicated that the pig populations formed two distinct genetic clusters that did not align with the respective sites. Both sites included individuals with signatures from both genetic clusters, although with different frequencies. This suggests that pigs can move across heavily urbanised landscapes. Future studies should involve long term collaring studies to identify specific corridors used by the pigs for dispersal, and a larger population genomic assessment to understand pig dispersal and gene flow to and from forest patches other than the CCNR and the Northeast.

AB  - Urban resilience is increasingly considered a useful approach to accommodate uncertainties while achieving sustainability in urban systems, especially in the context of rapid urbanization and global environmental change. However, current research on the quantitative assessment of urban resilience is limited. This study introduces four proxies of urban resilience, i.e., diversity, connectivity, decentralization, and self-sufficiency, and the perspective of the urban landscape for the measurement of urban resilience and further guidance on planning practices by establishing connections between resilience potential and landscape characteristics. Using multi-source data and employing landscape-based analysis methods, urban resilience is investigated from 1995 to 2015 in the central city of Shenyang. The results indicate that the composition and configuration of the urban landscape changed significantly during this period, which had a great influence on urban resilience. The temporal and spatial evolution of urban resilience showed obviously directional preferences and an evident distance effect. Overall, the resilience level increased slightly, while the internal differences experienced a declining trend. The four characteristics can be deployed as practical principles to shape urban resilience. The adjustment and trade-offs of these aspects to enhance responsive structures and simultaneously maintain sustainable ecosystem services can be effective ways to realize long-term resilience.

AB  - Pollen dispersal in tropical seed plants is established mainly by biotic vectors, both in intact and fragmented environments. In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats' territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant's year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.

AB  - The Slow City (Cittaslow) concept represents an emerging global trend where participant small cities commit to growing sustainably by preserving their authenticity while celebrating their local culture and diversity. Meanwhile, marketers increasingly find authenticity to be critical for campaigns with efficacy. Using a sample of 762 residents from slow cities, neighboring cities, and other Turkish cities, the authors empirically examine the Slow City movement and demonstrate its positive impact on place authenticity. Slow City membership also positively moderates the effect of perceived authenticity on both perceived entrepreneurial opportunities and economic development, which positively impact quality of life and intention to stay respectively. The results also indicate that the benefits of the Slow City movement spill over to neighboring cities. The Slow City movement offers much promise for place marketing and has potential to slow down the heavy migration from rural to urban areas in emerging markets.

AB  - More than 30% of global crop plants rely on pollinators to set fruit or seed. While several studies have documented the negative effects of habitat degradation and distance from natural habitats on pollinator diversity in tropical areas, such studies have focused on single crops in particular areas without examining entire plant-pollinator communities. Here, we compared the plant-pollinator network structure between mixed fruit orchards that were near to (< 1 km) and far from (> 7 km) tropical forests and further investigated the effect of landscape composition in surrounding areas on plant-pollinator network structure. Our ten pairs of orchards were in Thailand and grew a range of tropical fruits pollinated by Insects, birds and bats. The average number of visitor-flower interactions was higher at sites near the forest. Similarly, network robustness (the resistance of the network to losing species as a result of primary species removal) and interaction evenness (evenness of interactions among species) were higher at the sites closer to the forest. Robustness was strongly positively influenced by the proportion of lowland mosaic within a 1 km radius, while interaction evenness was positively affected by the proportion of urban area and montane mosaic within a 4 km radius of each site. Conservation of (semi-) natural habitats is therefore important for maintaining the diversity of wild pollinators and agricultural production.

AB  - The spread of invasive plants in urban forests is of great concern to land managers and ecologists. Here, we analyse the distribution pattern and potential occurrence of a problematic invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, on Mt. Umyeon, in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea, using multiple species distribution modelling with geographic information system layers and a time series of Landsat 8 satellite imagery data. Also, we identify this species' potential dispersal corridors using a network-based landscape lattice approach. All five species distribution models performed well with a range of test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.843-0.899 with an average of 0.876. Distance from trails had the greatest effect on its occurrence probability, and generally exerted a negative influence within ca. 20m of trails, indicating that urban forest trails facilitate the spread of invasive plants. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, 7 August 2016 tasselled cap brightness index was an important variable having a negative effect on the presence of A. altissima. Elevation generally had a positive effect on its presence, although it was less important than tasselled cap brightness index. We explicitly detected the distribution pattern of high invasion risk corridors, mostly located on or around trails, which follow the central ridgeline of the study area. The results and approaches employed here can be useful for understanding, monitoring, and predicting invasive plant distribution and spread for the management of urban natural resources and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Urbanization causes tremendous pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems at the global scale. China is among the countries undergoing the fastest urban expansion. For a long time, ecological environment protection has not been a priority in China's urban planning process. Current urban growth optimization research has some limitations regarding the selection of more scientific ecological constraint indicators and the interaction between urban expansion and ecological factors. This paper at first aimed to establish a reasonable comprehensive biodiversity constraint indicator based on the indicators of net primary productivity, habitat connectivity and habitat quality, and then conducted a case study in Beijing and compared biodiversity loss and urban growth patterns under different developing situations. The integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs model and GIS-related methods were used to obtain biodiversity and ecological spatial distribution layers. Then an ecological priority-oriented urban growth simulation method was proposed to search for minimum biodiversity loss. The results showed that the important biodiversity security areas were mostly distributed in the western part of the study area and that the ecological degradation in 2000 had a radial pattern and was well in line with the urban construction and ring road distribution patterns. Meanwhile, biodiversity loss with the biodiversity constraint was much less than actual urban growth in 2000-2010. Under the guidance of ecological optimization, urban growth in the research results reflects decentralized and multi-center spatial development characteristics. This type of urban growth not only provides a new model for breaking the inertia of urban sprawl but also proposes 'biodiversity security' as an applicable regulatory tool for urban planning and space governance reforming.

AB  - Global change has been occurring at unprecedented rates throughout the last century. A source of recent heated debate has been how such global changes, including land transformation, affect species richness and ecosystem functioning. Growing scientific consensus suggests that more diverse communities support greater ecosystem functioning; however, species numbers might fluctuate over time, and ecosystem processes are shaped by both species richness and species identities. In recent decades, habitat loss and major biodiversity change has occurred on the edge of urban centres because of land transformation to suburban development. Biological surveys provide a valuable record of how biodiversity has responded to this habitat transformation, especially if they have been conducted in the same location over time. Here, we examine changes in species richness, composition and phylogenetic structure between two surveys of vascular plants conducted over 50years apart on Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec, Canadaa UNESCO Biosphere Reserve surrounded by residential development. We found 198 more species in the more recent survey, but failed to detect 70 species that had been recorded in the earlier survey. A significant number of species gains were closely-related introduced non-native species. Species found only during the first survey (species losses) were frequently native species of special conservation status, and these species tended to be more evolutionarily distinct than species gained. Our results demonstrate that, in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, there have been significant changes in species richness and composition over the last half-century that might have far-reaching effects on ecosystem properties.

AB  - ContextMaintaining biodiversity in multifunction landscapes is a significant challenge. Planning for the impacts of change requires knowledge of how species respond to landscape heterogeneity. Some insect groups are known to respond to heterogeneity at the mesoscale, defined here as hundreds of metres. However, for many taxa these effects are poorly known.ObjectivesTo identify key elements of mesoscale landscape heterogeneity influencing community composition in flower-visiting beetles, and whether landscape explains any variation in beetle communities beyond that driven by immediate habitat cover.MethodsFlower-visiting beetles were sampled from 36 transects, laid out using a 6km(2) grid located in southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was measured for 30 and 200m buffers around the transects and the relative response of beetle communities to each assessed using ordination analyses followed by variation partitioning.ResultsThe composition of immediately adjacent habitat (30m) and mesoscale landscape heterogeneity (200m) explained unique portions of the variation in flower-visiting beetle communities. A number of species, including those affiliated with deadwood habitats, were positively linked to tree cover in the surrounding mesoscale landscape. Gardens covered a smaller area than trees but modified beetle communities to the same extent.ConclusionsThe local abundance of some flower-visiting beetles is modified by the composition of the surrounding landscape. Results highlight the importance of tree cover for maintaining insect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, while suggesting that gardens associated with small urban areas may have a disproportionate influence on biodiversity.

AB  - As a Nature-Based Solution, urban forests deliver a number of environmental ecosystem services (EESs). To quantify these EESs, well-defined, reliable, quantifiable and stable indicators are needed. With literature analysis and expert knowledge gathered within COST Action FP1204 GreenInUrbs, we proposed a classification of urban forest EESs into three categories: (A) regulation of air, water, soil and climate; (B) provisioning of habitat quality; and (C) provisioning of other goods and services. Each category is divided into EES types: (a) amelioration of air quality; restoration of soil and water; amelioration of the microclimate; removal of CO2 from the air; (b) provision of habitat for biodiversity; support for resilient urban ecosystems; provision of genetic diversity; and (c) provision of energy and nutrients; provision of grey infrastructure resilience. Each EES type provides one or more benefits. For each of these 12 benefits, we propose a set of indicators to be used when analyzing the impacts on the identified EESs. Around half of the 36 indicators are relevant to more than one single benefit, which highlights complex interrelationships. The indicators of wider applicability are tree and stand characteristics, followed by leaf physical traits and tree species composition. This knowledge is needed for the optimization of the EESs delivered by urban forests, now and in the future.

AB  - Target 2 of the European Biodiversity Strategy promotes the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services < (ES) as well as the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems by creating green infrastructure (GI). The purpose of the this research is to present a GI proposal that combines the delivery of regulating services with the restoration and ecological reconnection of urban forests and trees in a densely urbanised context.
   The project area covers about 3 000 ha in the urban sector of the metropolitan area of Rome and the GI components consist of 533 ha of areal green spaces and of more than 500 km of road verges. Planned interventions include forest restoration and tree plantations, with a varying service supply according to type and condition of the different components. Potential natural vegetation (PNV) models and dispersal potential of representative forest species, together with structural and functional vegetation models for the enhancement of air pollutants removal, guided the selection of the species to be promoted and of the planting pattern. Environmental benefits of the proposal include more than 30 ha of restored urban forests, about 15 000 planted individuals of native oaks, a sevenfold improvement in ecological connectivity and halved isolation between green spaces. On the other hand, the expected socio-economic benefits include almost 300 000 potential beneficiaries of the improved air quality and avoided costs for damages to human health that range between 40 700 and 130 200 EUR per year.
   Notwithstanding their preliminary character, these estimates allowed the proposal to highlight the relationship between GI and public health. Moreover, they showed the economic and social effectiveness of nature-based solutions in comparison with further development of grey infrastructure. These results promote the definition of a national GI strategy in Italy.

AB  - Questions Extensive green roofs (EGRs) are novel ecosystems and essential tools in mitigating the negative effects of urbanization. However, the extent to which traditional community assembly insights apply to spontaneous plant and trait diversity and composition on EGRs and novel ecosystems in general is unclear: (a) is a dispersal filter present because of EGRs' fragmented nature (e.g., roof height, urban environment); (b) can we confirm the strong abiotic filtering due to extreme EGR conditions (e.g., limited substrate depth); and (c) does the presence of the planted vegetation lead to biotic filtering? Location The Flanders and Brussels region of Belgium. Methods The vegetation of 129 EGRs was sampled during a field campaign. Information on local (e.g., substrate, roof height) and regional characteristics (e.g., connectivity indices) were collected and species traits were collected from multiple databases. All data were used to construct (generalized) linear mixed models that tested the effects of the dispersal-, local abiotic- and local biotic filters on plant community formation. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate predictor effects on functional composition and null models were constructed to assess trait divergence/convergence. Results Our results show that the spontaneous plant species diversity is not affected by their landscape context (dispersal filtering), while their functional composition is. Additionally, the importance of abiotic filtering is confirmed, as substrate depth and exposure have a strong impact on species diversity and decreasing substrate depth negatively impacts functional diversity. Finally, we show that biotic filtering by increased planted species cover leads to trait divergence, changes in functional composition and reduced cover of spontaneous species. Conclusions We find that a broad perspective that includes the regional and local biotic and abiotic environment is needed to assess all factors that influence the vegetation on EGRs. As biotic interactions are present, EGRs should not be considered as static systems.

AB  - Green infrastructure is one of the key components that provides critical ecosystems services in urban areas, such as regulating services (temperature regulation, noise reduction, air purification), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic benefits), but due to rapid urbanization, many environmental impacts associated with the decline of green space have emerged and are rarely been evaluated integrally and promptly. The Chinese government is building a new city as the sub-center of the capital in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. A series of policies have been implemented to increase the size of green urban areas. To support this land-use decision-making process and achieve a sustainable development strategy, accurate assessments of green space are required. In the current study, using land-use data and environmental parameters, we assessed the urban green space in the case study area. The bio-energy and its fluxes, landscape connectivity, as well as related ecosystem services were estimated using a novel approach, the PANDORA model. These results show that (1) in the highly urbanized area, green space is decreasing in reaction to urbanization, and landscape fragmentation is ubiquitous; (2) the river ecology network is a critical part for ecosystem services and landscape connectivity; and (3) the alternative non-green patches to be changed to urban, urban patches which can improve landscape quality the most by being changed to green, and conservation priority patches for biodiversity purposes of urban green were explicitly identified. Conclusively, our results depict the spatial distribution, fluxes, and evolution of bio-energy, as well as the conservation prioritization of green space. Our methods can be applied by urban planners and ecologists, which can help decision-makers achieve a sustainable development strategy in these rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide.

AB  - The configuration of urban land-covers is essential for improving dwellers' environments and ecosystem services. A city-level comparison of land-cover changes along the Belt and Road is still unavailable due to the lack of intra-urban land products. A synergistic classification methodology of sub-pixel un-mixing, multiple indices, decision tree classifier, unsupervised (SMDU) classification was established in the study to examine urban land covers across 65 capital cities along the Belt and Road during 2000-2015. The overall accuracies of the 15 m resolution urban products (i.e., the impervious surface area, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies) derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were 92.88% and 93.19%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.85 in 2000 and 2015, respectively. The built-up areas of 65 capital cities increased from 23,696.25 km(2) to 29,257.51 km(2), with an average growth rate of 370.75 km(2)/y during 2000-2015. Moreover, urban impervious surface area (ISA) expanded with an average rate of 401.92 km(2)/y, while the total area of urban green space (UGS) decreased with an average rate of 17.59 km(2)/y. In different regions, UGS changes declined by 7.37% in humid cities but increased by 14.61% in arid cities. According to the landscape ecology indicators, urban land-cover configurations became more integrated (oShannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) = -0.063; oPatch Density (PD) = 0.054) and presented better connectivity (oConnectance Index (CON) = +0.594). The proposed method in this study improved the separation between ISA and bare soil in mixed pixels, and the 15 m intra-urban land-cover product provided essential details of complex urban landscapes and urban ecological needs compared with contemporary global products. These findings provide valuable information for urban planners dealing with human comfort and ecosystem service needs in urban areas.

AB  - The dusky rattlesnake, Crotalus triseriatus, used to be very abundant in many parts of the highlands of central Mexico, but with the increasing human population and associated activities, the rattlesnake habitats and populations have suffered drastic reductions and fragmentation. At the moment, the most important habitat features, associated with the presence of C. triseriatus, the current potential distribution and the landscape connectivity amongst the populations of the State of Mexico and Mexico City, are unknown. Therefore, we used the maximum entropy modelling software (MAXENT) to analyse the current potential distribution and most important habitat features, associated with the presence of the species. The variables with the highest contribution to the model were: proportion of Abies forest, minimum temperature of coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, proportion of Pinus forest and annual precipitation. Furthermore, we found connectivity corridors only within mountain chains. Our results highlight the necessity for conserving the patches of Abies forest and preserving the populations of C. triseriatus and the connectivity of the landscape.

AB  - We evaluated how the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities of butterflies and their community-weighted traits are affected by urbanization in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this purpose, a dataset of Nymphalidae species distributed across 15 urban, semiurban, and rural fragments was analyzed. Urbanization was defined by a set of environmental variables. Furthermore, the total area of each fragment was also considered in the analyses but did not influence the results, in which disturbance level and patch connectivity drove the environmental variation across the urban matrix. Species diversity increased towards the more connected fragments, while phylogenetic and functional diversity did not vary in relation to urbanization. A high forewing:hindwing ratio and the frequency of tiger-like wings were positively related to the urban fragments, while a low forewing:hindwing ratio and iridescent wings were related to the semiurban and rural fragments. The suitability of highly interconnected rural habitats for the maintenance of butterfly diversity was corroborated as expected. Nonetheless, our results also showed that semiurban fragments preserved the ecologically relevant traits of butterflies related to forested habitats, expressed in butterfly groups possibly linked with dispersal capability to avoid predation. Careful management of semiurban fragments and urban landscaping, including highly structured and native vegetation outside urban parks, may increase the functional and taxonomic diversities or at least maintain the current levels of functionality in the urban matrix. Thus, it is possible to preserve the biological diversity of native fauna and flora and recover relevant ecosystem services, ensuring the conservation of Neotropical urban centers.

TI  - Nesting Density and Dispersal Movements between Urban and Rural Habitats of Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) in Wisconsin: Are These Source or Sink Habitats?

AB  - Cites are relatively new landscapes for breeding Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) that nest commonly in urban and rural habitats throughout North America. There is a call for data that may indicate if cities are low quality, sink habitats, as for some other raptors, or if cities function as high-quality, source habitats. Source habitats should exhibit high nesting densities, high reproductive output, and they should produce net emigration to sites that offer the potential for greater fitness. There are no reports of connectivity via dispersed individuals and their reproductive success (i.e., gene flow) between rural and urban subpopulations for Cooper's Hawks in North America. We report one of the highest nesting densities in North America, one nest/238 ha in the city of Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 2015, with regular spacing of nests suggestive of the saturated, stable population which occurs elsewhere throughout the state. Averages of 4.7 eggs and 4.1 nestlings per nest in Oshkosh, respectively, rank among the highest metrics for the species, and are similar to the stable and high reproductive indices found elsewhere throughout rural and other urban Wisconsin habitats across 34 y (1980-2015). An apparent low index of hatchling mortality rate (10%), or the loss of offspring from clutch to brood counts, was also found in Oshkosh. We detected both breeding and natal dispersal, with relatively high clutch and nestling counts, among eight individual Cooper's Hawks of both sexes moving into and emigrating from Stevens Point, Wisconsin with surrounding rural habitats. Most dispersal movements were less than 10 km. A relative similarity in maximum dispersal distances across 38 y (1980-2017) for rural-to-rural movements in males (35 km) and females (79 km), with those distances in males (27 km) and females (48 km) that moved between Stevens Point and its rural surroundings, suggest the maximum extent of natal dispersal movements is not habitat-specific in Wisconsin Cooper's Hawks. Discussion of various demographic contexts, including potentially confounding ecological variables, revealed limitations to previous reports and interpretations of reproductive output and nesting densities for the species, including assessments of habitat quality. We suggest high-quality rural and urban nesting habitats in Wisconsin are not source habitats for Cooper's Hawks within the state given none comparatively appears to offer the potential for greater fitness. Therefore, there should be no net dispersal among habitat types.

AB  - Ecological security patterns composed of ecological sources and corridors provide an effective approach to conserving natural ecosystems. Although the direction of ecological corridors has been identified in previous studies, the precise range remains unknown. To address this crucial gap, ant colony algorithm and kernel density estimation were applied to identify the range and restoration points of ecological corridors, which is important for natural conservation and ecological restoration. In this case study of Beijing City, ecological sources were identified based on habitat importance and landscape connectivity. The results showed that, in total 3119.65 km(2) of ecological land had been extracted as ecological sources, which were mainly located in the northern, northwestern and northeastern mountainous areas. The identified key ecological corridor covered an area of 198.86 km(2), with 567.30 km(2) for potential ecological corridors, both connecting the ecological sources. 34 key points were also identified with priority in restoring ecological corridors.

AB  - Many grassland specialist plant populations in Europe have become restricted to remnant habitats. The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.

AB  - Mycorrhizas face unique anthropogenic stressors in urban environments, but the factors influencing their abundance in cities remains comparatively unstudied. Using green roofs as a model system, we built a conceptual model outlining the biotic and abiotic factors influencing arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal abundance in cities. We then tested this model and its multiple causal hypotheses with structural equation modeling using plant, soil, and AM fungal abundance measurements from 60 plots across 12 green roofs in Chicago, USA. The best direct predictor of AM fungal abundance was not plant cover, plant richness, or soil nutrients, but instead green roof age, suggesting temporal accumulation of AM fungal propagules in degraded urban environments. Soil P had the strongest total effect on AM fungal abundance both directly and via indirect promotion of plant cover. This study highlights knowledge gaps and challenges to studying the urban ecology of AM fungi. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite repeated calls to action, proposals for urban conservation are often met with surprise or scepticism. There remains a pervasive narrative in policy, practice, and the public psyche that urban environments, although useful for engaging people with nature or providing ecosystem services, are of little conservation value. We argue that the tendency to overlook the conservation value of urban environments stems from misconceptions about the ability of native species to persist within cities and towns and that this, in turn, hinders effective conservation action. However, recent scientific evidence shows that these assumptions do not always hold. Although it is generally true that increasing the size, quality, and connectivity of habitat patches will improve the probability that a species can persist, the inverse is not that small, degraded, or fragmented habitats found in urban environments are worthless. In light of these findings we propose updated messages that guide and inspire researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to undertake conservation action in urban environments: consider small spaces, recognize unconventional habitats, test creative solutions, and use science to minimize the impacts of future urban development.

AB  - Connectivity and quality of vegetation in cities, including urban forests, can promote urban biodiversity. However the impact of anthropogenic pressures at the forest-matrix edge, particularly artificial light at night (ALAN), on connectivity has received little attention. We assessed the influence of artificial light at forest edges on insectivorous bats. We acoustically surveyed 31 forest edges across greater Sydney, Australia, half with mercury vapour streetlights and half in ambient darkness, and compared the bat assemblage and activity levels to urban forest interiors. We also sampled the flying insect community to establish whether changes in insect densities under lights drive changes in insectivorous bat activity. We recorded 9965 bat passes from 16 species or species groups throughout our acoustic survey. The activity of all bats, and bats hypothesised to be sensitive to artificial light, was consistently higher in forest interiors as opposed to edges. We found that slower flying bats adapted to cluttered vegetation or with a relatively high characteristic echolocation call frequency; Chalinolobus mono, Miniopterus australis, Vespadelus vulturnus, and Nyctophilus spp., were negatively affected by artificial light sources at the forest edge. The emergence time of Vespadelus vulturnus was also significantly delayed by the presence of streetlights at the forest edge. Conversely, generalist faster flying bats; Chalinolobus gouldii, Ozimops ridei, Austronomous australis, Saccolaimus fiaviventris, and Miniopterus orianae oceanensis, were unaffected by artificial light at the edge of urban forest, and used light and dark forest edges in a similar way. Insect surveys showed that larger lepidopterans seemed to be attracted to lit areas, but in low numbers. Artificial light sources on the edges of urban forest have diverse effects on bats and insects, and should be considered an anthropogenic edge effect that can reduce available habitat and decrease connectivity for light-sensitive species.

AB  - In the process of rapid urbanization in coastal cities, the issue of landscape fragmentation, resulting from continuous expansion of artificial landscapes, has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is of great significance to build up ecological networks to connect fragmented habitats and protect biodiversity. From the perspective of impacts on natural landscapes of road system, the paper takes Dafeng, a coastal county in China, as a case study area, processes the selection of ecological sources, assignment and correction of resistance surface, and finally accomplishes the construction of ecological network, supported by techniques including GIS, Conefor Sensinode and so forth. The results demonstrates that the road network hinders the biological circulation between coastal wetland and interior landscape, resulting in the destruction of natural landscape integrity; with the modification of resistance surface based on the construction of road buffer, it can be observed that regional ecological resistance level increases significantly and the original long linear ecological corridors tend to be short with twists and turns; the wetland patches and corridor connecting them rank first in terms of the importance of landscape connectivity, which indicates that coastal management should be strengthened in avoidance of the aggravation of the landscape fragmentation under the stress of road landscape.

AB  - The recent shift towards greater emphasis on biodiversity and urban ecosystems has increased the need for greater understanding of the green areas in cities as ecological environments. However, landscape ecology and urban morphology have yet to be integrated into a joint field. In this paper steps are taken towards developing an integrated socio-ecological urban morphology based on developments in each field. Such a morphology can inform professional practice in urban design. Comparisons of the different objects of description in the two fields are made and their different means of description - notably the patches, corridors and the matrix in landscape ecology, and the streets, plots and buildings in urban morphology. This provides a basis for a joint description in which these elements together form a configuration of patches.

AB  - Urbanization is driving the transformation of natural and rural ecosystems worldwide by affecting both the abiotic environment and the biota. This raises the question whether urban ecosystems are able to provide services in a comparable way to their non-urban counterparts. In urban grasslands, the effects of urbanization-driven ecological novelty and the role of plant diversity in modulating ecosystem functioning have received little attention. In this study, we assessed the influence of biodiversity, abiotic and biotic novelty on ecosystem functioning based on in situ measurements in non-manipulated grasslands along an urbanization gradient in Berlin (Germany). We focused on plant aboveground biomass (AGB), intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and N-15 enrichment factor (Delta delta N-15) as proxies for biomass production, water and N cycling, respectively, within grassland communities, and tested how they change with plant biogeographic status (native vs alien), functional group and species identity. Approximately one third of the forb species were alien to Berlin and they were responsible for 13.1% of community AGB. Community AGB was positively correlated with plant-species richness. In contrast, iWUE and Delta delta N-15 were mostly determined by light availability (depicted by sky view factor) and urban parameters like the percentage of impervious surface or human population density. We found that abiotic novelty potentially favors aliens in Berlin, mainly by enhancing their dispersal and fitness under drought. Mainly urban parameters indicating abiotic novelty were significantly correlated to both alien and native Delta delta N-15, but to AGB and iWUE of alien plants only, pointing to a stronger impact of abiotic novelty on N cycling compared to C and water cycling. At the species level, sky view factor appeared to be the prevailing driver of photosynthetic performance and resource-use efficiency. Although we identified a significant impact of abiotic novelty on AGB, iWUE and Delta delta N-15 at different levels, the relationship between species richness and community AGB found in the urban grasslands studied in Berlin was comparable to that described in non-urban experimental grasslands in Europe. Hence, our results indicate that conserving and enhancing biodiversity in urban ecosystems is essential to preserve ecosystem services related to AGB production. For ensuring the provision of ecosystem services associated to water and N use, however, changes in urban abiotic parameters seem necessary.

AB  - Urbanization has altered fish communities in many ways. However, as cities expand and redevelop, it is challenging to assess the impacts of new projects given existing alteration. We investigated how new and old infrastructure alters fish communities over a 4-year period in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada). We compared fish communities from a stream altered by a new rapid transit rail line and seven reference sites over 4 years, from before to after construction. We provide evidence that new and old projects depress the density, species richness, and diversity of fish communities. During and after construction, sections of the altered stream had one fewer species and lower density compared with preconstruction and reference streams. Streams without existing culverts had more species and greater diversity than those with culverts, but only in some years. Diversity was lower in 1 year of the study across all streams. We argue that most monitoring in Canada is insufficient to detect the incremental changes that new projects may cause and suggest improvements in monitoring and protecting reference streams.

AB  - Urban sprawl has increased in Western Europe principally due to conversion of farmland areas, which has constrained remaining farmland to more intensive use. Urban densification aims to counteract urban sprawl; however, it threatens urban green spaces that act as sustainable alternative habitats for wildlife. In this study, we used the Common Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) as a model species to develop sustainable planning recommendations for urban green spaces. Using species distribution models (SDMs) in combinations with high-resolution predicting variables (2 x 2 m grid cell), we defined the suitable habitat of a Common Redstart territory in a moderately urbanized environment. We then predicted how the distribution would be affected under realistic scenarios of land-use modification (termed conservation scenario and threat scenario) in an effort to provide recommendations for urban green space planning. Tree canopy cover was the principal land-cover type in the SDMs that explained the current species distribution followed by impervious surface and short-cut lawn. In the conservation scenario where tree canopy coverage was increased we predicted an increase in optimum habitat for the Common Redstart from 7% to 27% of the study area. In contrast, under a threat scenario based on urban densification, we predicted a decrease in the optimum habitat to only 4% of the study area. The SDMs results were used to highlight the importance of the suitable areas that have a predicted potential to conserve and promote an interconnected urban green space networks to maintain urban biodiversity.

AB  - Although large and medium-sized herbivorous mammals avoid urbanized areas, they have recently begun to colonize towns and cities. In general, ungulates continue to avoid the centres of urban areas, and utilize mainly their thinly built-up outskirts. While extension of urban development is preventing ungulates from penetrating the urban landscape, the influence of noise and light pollution on the occurrence of mammalian herbivores is still poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the hypothesis that habitat availability shapes the distribution of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and artificial lightening discourages them from penetrating the urban landscape. Roe deer was recorded on 37% of randomly selected sample plots (N=60) located within the city of Krakow (S Poland). The occupied plots contained significantly more open habitats, woodland patches were larger in them, but proximity to rivers, and noise and light pollution were significantly lower. The logistic regression model revealed that an increasing area of open habitats was positively correlated with the probability of roe deer occurring. However, the artificial lighting at night was negatively correlated with the probability of the species occurring: the negative effect of light pollution was mitigated by the greater area of open habitats. Our study highlights the very considerable potential of light pollution as a predictor of the occurrence of large mammals in the urban landscape. We argue that urbanization and the related artificial lighting at night may be a factor preventing ungulates from penetrating potentially suitable habitats in urban areas.

AB  - Aim We test whether urbanization drives biotic homogenization. We hypothesize that declines in abundance and species diversity of aerial insects are exacerbated by the urbanization-driven loss of species with low habitat generalism, mobility and warm-adaptedness. We predict this homogenization to be more pronounced for nocturnal taxa, and at wider scales for mobile taxa. Location Belgium. Time period Summers 2014-2015. Major taxa studied Lepidoptera. Methods We compare communities along urbanization gradients using a shared, replicated and nested sampling design, in which butterflies were counted within 81 grassland and macro-moths light-trapped in 12 woodland sites. We quantify taxonomic and functional community composition, the latter via community-weighted means and variation of species-specific traits related to specialization, mobility and thermophily. Using linear regression models, variables are analysed in relation to site-specific urbanization values quantified at seven scales (50-3,200 m radii). At best-fitting scales, we test for taxonomic homogenization. Results With increasing urbanization, abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity severely declined, with butterfly and macro-moth declines due to local- versus landscape-scale urbanization (200 vs. 800-3,200 m radii, respectively). While taxonomic homogenization was absent for butterflies, urban macro-moth communities displayed higher nestedness than non-urban communities. Overall, communities showed mean shifts towards generalist, mobile and thermophilous species, displaying trait convergence too. These functional trait models consistently fit best with urbanization quantified at local scales (100-200 m radii) for butterfly communities, and at local to wider landscape scales (200-800 m radii) for macro-moth communities. Main conclusions Urban communities display functional homogenization that follows urbanization at scales linked to taxon-specific mobility. Light pollution may explain why homogenization was more pronounced for the nocturnal taxon. We discuss that urbanization is likely to impact flying insect communities across the globe, but also that impacts on their ecosystem functions and services could be mitigated via multi-scale implementation of urban green infrastructure.

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) is planned at various scales, including a regional one: city-regions. Strategic GI planning included in the city-regions spatial development policy can contribute to their sustainable development through, among others, providing a range of ecosystem services. In order to meet the challenge of planning GI on a regional scale, the authors present the Method of Landscape-Functional Units (Method LaFU), which is used for the planning and evaluation of such systems. This method was tested in the Wrocaw Functional Area (WFA), which is characterized by many negative processes, primarily uncontrolled development of built-up areas, fragmentation of landscape, and declining natural and semi-natural areas. The presented results show the effectiveness of the Method LaFU in GI planning and, above all, in its assessment, which makes it possible to identify problem areas that are at risk but still important for the functioning of the GI system. This allows for quick decision making by entities responsible for spatial planning in the region. The proposed method can also be used in other city-regions.

AB  - Context In the last 30 years, the number of golf courses has increased dramatically worldwide. Since no other sport occupies and manages such large areas of green space, landscape context is crucial for determining their impacts or benefits. Objectives (1) Examine how they affect the main landscape socio-environmental landscape components; (2) analyze the knowledge network structure characterizing the research focused on golf courses; (3) discuss the most common best management practices to mitigate their environmental impacts; and (4) suggest new research perspectives. Methods This paper has reviewed 239 papers from academic library databases through a literature review and co-word network analysis. Results Golf courses have impacted negatively on water and soil components, while positively on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and tourism, mainly in urban contexts. The best management practices have focused on soil, biodiversity and ecosystem services, water quality and quantity, and have given specific indications for amphibians, birds, turtles, and bee species. Few articles have considered the landscape perspective, despite the potential impact on natural or semi-natural landscapes. Conclusions New clusters of research and management issues, in order to link biodiversity conservation with landscape perspective, have emerged: the need to increase (1) studies focused on the effects of golf courses on the ecological processes behind the functioning of the landscape, taking into account its composition and spatial configuration; (2) the proportion of native vegetation in the landscape composition, and density and complexity of vegetation in the landscape configuration.

AB  - Globally, connectivity conservation projects exist across all inhabited continents. Typically created through Geographical Information Systems and modelling processes at regional and even continental scales, these projects are seldom evaluated or 'ground-truthed' for their potential application at the local level where land use is fully allocated and replete with human occupation. This article reviews the accuracy of one such continental-scale connectivity conservation network, the National Green Network, through assessment and redesign by a design charrette at the local scale in York, Western Australia. Breaking with traditional process, this research considered the National Green Network model not as a final plan, but as point of departure for an iterative adjustment and redesign process through the charrette and an additional detailed design stage. Commonplace in architecture and urban planning disciplines, the application of charrettes to connectivity conservation design offers the benefits of improving design accuracy and enhancing their potential for implementation through providing valuable feedback and iterative design adjustment. The fine-tuning conducted by this research enabled the design to factor in human land-uses and influences across complex landscapes, while considering in a critical manner cultural factors that could also influence the system's design and its success. The framing of the network as green infrastructure rather than as connectivity conservation in addition to further illustration by the landscape architect provided a spectrum of both ecological and cultural outcomes across the case study landscape, demonstrating potential impacts and opportunities offered through a series of spatially accurate and ground-truthed plans.

AB  - The urbanization process of Bogota has a direct impact on tree cover, because construction projects prioritize logging instead of transplant, and their landscape projects do not generate sufficient compensation. The progressive reduction of green spaces and trees, diminish the necessary habitats for the birds. In the management of the urban trees that includes activities of planting, pruning, transplant and logging, the city applies procedures to reduce its impact on avifauna. Its environmental authority has generated information to expand knowledge and allow understanding of the dynamics between trees and urban birds, which serves as a basis to analyze the efficiency of its action, both in the birdlife management procedure and in the design and selection of species in new tree plantings. This article shows statistics from a review of avifauna management final reports in various infrastructure projects and the work's results of a study prepared between the District Department of Environment -SDA- and the Bogota's Ornithology Association -ABO-, in which technical criteria are formulated for the ecological connectivity with emphasis on bird conservation and consolidation of restoration processes in the city's main ecological structure.

AB  - Prior to the arrival of Dutch elm disease to the United States in 1930, American elm (Ulmus americana) had become one of the most beloved and commonly planted urban trees throughout the country, especially in the Northeastern United States. The trees were revered for their beauty, hardiness, and the corridor-like shade provided to city streets. Syracuse, NY stands as an example of this popularity: in 1951, when the disease first arrived in the city, over 50,000 elms grew in the city. But over the course of twenty years, nearly all elms in the city had become infected and succumbed to the disease. Although efforts to control the fungus in Syracuse ultimately failed to stop elm loss, the case study can be used to better inform contemporary urban forest management practices today by highlighting the effects of mixed property ownership in cities and its effects on pest management.

AB  - Transportation infrastructure is critical to any community. Disturbances such as natural hazards can hinder transportation infrastructure performance impacting a community's quality of life through disruptions in service and effects on interdependent systems. Ecological systems are robust and resilient and have similarities with infrastructure systems. Diversity is a fundamental element of ecological resilience and is recognized as an important factor in transportation resilience. However, measures of transportation diversity are not well-developed. Accordingly, this paper adapts the ecological diversity concepts of richness and evenness to develop an approach to characterize transportation system diversity and distinguishes the approach from existing methods. Measures of transportation functional richness and evenness are derived and applied to New York City at the zip code level. The results facilitate identification of zip codes in New York City with varying levels of transportation diversity. Those zip codes with low diversity generally have limited availability (low richness) and disproportionate distribution (low evenness) of alternative transportation modes. Further, these zip codes are potentially susceptible to system disturbances as a consequence of routine disruptions or natural hazards. For instance, many low diversity zip codes are in hurricane evacuation zones. Limited complementarity in the transportation system of these zip codes will likely impact evacuations during hurricanes and recovery to pre-disturbance performance levels. Ultimately, the transportation diversity approach presented should lead to better understanding of transportation system characteristics such as inherent and augmented complementarity, which will enhance transportation system performance in urban communities.

AB  - One of the main constraints affecting invertebrate diversity in many freshwater lentic habitats is the presence of a dry phase which forces aquatic organisms to avoid this period through the migration to other water bodies or the production of resting stages. Field studies show contradictory results when comparing invertebrate diversity in permanent (PW) and temporary lentic waters (TW). Our objective was to test how diversity is influenced by the permanence of water in lentic habitats, and which factors affect the magnitude and direction of this difference, including sampling design. Through a systematic review, 66 publications were selected and classified according to the sampling design (spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal datasets). Meta-analysis of the spatial dataset, which included 70% of the studies, revealed that diversity in PW was higher than in TW, and this difference was not influenced by annual precipitation, dispersal mode, habitat type or level of anthropogenic impact (proximity to urban or agricultural areas). We found a significantly higher effect size (PW greater than TW) when considering species richness rather than cumulative richness or Shannon diversity index, disconnected water bodies (hindering the exchange of individuals through water connection), organisms with passive dispersal (which cannot actively avoid the dry period), and study sites with high anthropogenic impact (where temporary habitats could undergo impacts; e.g. concentration of pollutants and eutrophication). We also found that the differences in diversity between PW and TW may decrease with increasing sampling effort. This result may be attributable to high species turnover due to the higher temporal environmental variation in TW relative to PW. Also, it indicates that sampling effort should be comparatively higher in TW to properly characterize the biodiversity in these environments in order to compare with PW. As global climate continues to change, our results suggest that loss in aquatic invertebrate diversity of TW will be likely to occur in regions where the frequency of drying events increases.

AB  - Urbanization processes spur the need for urban green infrastructure (GI) to support the well-being of urban dwellers and underpin a sustainable planning strategy. It is a challenge for urban planning to make cities equitable in a socio-spatial way for which strategic planning are demanded based on measured gradients of spatial equity for GI. Strategically, urban GI planning should pay tribute to the inherent spatial patterns and foster a fair distribution of GI towards spatial equity. Our aim is hence to investigate the spatial patterns of urban GI and disclose how spatial patterns affect spatial equity of GI in typical residential areas. The sample sites are in a central European city, Leipzig, the fastest growing city in Germany at present, with high pressure on urban growth. To elaborate an innovative approach, this study draws up a cascade of three methodological stages: 1) deploy the approach of an urban Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to compare urban GI patterns in three typical residential local districts, 2) use the GI-adapted Gini coefficient to measure spatial equity of GI distributions, and 3) explore the relationships between GI spatial patterns and spatial equity of GI for each residential type. In the context of three typical residential areas in Leipzig (i.e. (semi-)detached houses, linear multistorey housing estates, and perimeter blocks), a combination of the MSPA and a spatial equity measurement assists our novel exploration to disclose the relationships between the spatial patterns and the equity of GI distributions. Thus, we can prove strong similarities on the characteristics of spatial patterns in each residential type and observe a tendency of increasing equity from (semi-)detached houses to linear housing and further to perimeter blocks. As significant findings for the support of strategic urban GI planning, we discover that GI cores provide a restricted increase of spatial equity that limited to the lack of space. Furthermore, we suggest more GI bridges to enhance structural connectivity as well as spatial equity. This paper depicts the spatial equity of GI distributions in typical residential areas from morphological perspective, and thus further underpins urban GI planning for strategic networks as a key principle of the urban GI concept.

AB  - Urban forest and urban trees are currently facing several challenges arising from a changing climate, complex inner-city environments and severe threats of pathogen and insect attacks. The latter have already had serious consequences for many cities, with outbreaks of diseases and pests causing large-scale tree losses that will take a long time to resolve. The pest species Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) and citrus longhorned beetle (A. chinensis) have large numbers of host species and genera and can hence be classified as one of the most serious future threats to the urban (and natural) tree landscape. The question is not whether these new threats will arrive in northern Europe, but rather when an infestation will occur and how well prepared are cities to deal with it. This study presents an up-to-date compilation of the urban tree population in 10 major Nordic cities, based on recent tree inventories, and investigates and discusses the effects of an outbreak of the two longhorned beetle species, based on information taken from a review of 35 papers presenting host-related data on these species. Evaluation of the data on host susceptibility to the two longhorned beetles revealed clear differences in tree losses between scenarios, with predicted tree losses of 15-98% in the different cities.

AB  - Within urban landscape planning, debate continues around the relative merits of land-sharing (sprawl) and land-sparing (compaction) scenarios. Using three of the ten districts in Greater Manchester (UK) as a case-study, we present a landscape approach to mapping green infrastructure and variation in social-ecological-environmental conditions as a function of land sharing and sparing. We do so for the landscape as a whole and in a more focussed approach for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sharing-sparing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space. These trade-offs are complex due to the parallel influence of patch attributes such as land-cover and size and imply that both ecological restoration and spatial planning have a role to play in reconciling tensions between land-sharing and sparing strategies.

AB  - Settlements, cities and regions function as integrated systems. This resulted in the creation of functional connections and when linked, networks within which trade occurred. This played an important role in the creation of scope economies. This is based on the notion that various networks formed a unique exchange environment from which economic development benefitted. Furthermore, networks evolve and grow when independent cities or regions strive to co-operate and in the process created higher and lower-order settlements which support the outcomes of economic space development and cities as sites of renewed economic dynamism. Networks consist of two important elements: (1) nodes, denoting location and size and (2) links, denoting distance and capacity that display the forces of interaction. These forces of interaction are the underlying principles of the complex relationships that exist between different urban centres (gravitational properties) due to the agglomeration of economic activities. Applying a regional network model, considering gravitational properties provides a solution, whereby a city's functionality within a network is established. The model provides a framework denoting a city's rise in performance as either mega, primary, secondary or intermediate which ultimately measures a city's role and 'place' within economic space development. The framework allows cities to realise their 'place' of potential allowing them to respond proactively and innovatively to develop and promote economic development.

AB  - The several changes happening in environmental, social, economic, technological and geopolitical spheres of our society result in countless risks, challenges and opportunities for human development. The global population crosses 7.7 billion with the loss of biodiversity, increasing pressure on food, water, and energy resources. The migration of people from rural to urban in large scale is a matter of concern; as the global urban population will almost reach 68% by 2050, approximately 6 billion. A very high concentration of people living in urban areas and growth projection pose a serious challenge for large cities for vulnerability. Amongst the several challenges, food security will be a serious issue for the future of cities. In this context, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and movement towards creating Smart Cities have to provide solutions and opportunities to deal with those challenges. In this opinion paper, we seek to discuss the future of cities, with a holistic vision of several actions to deal with food security challenges in urban centers.

AB  - Terrestrial mammalian carnivores are generally sensitive to urbanization. Yet, some mesocarnivores have adapted to the urban and suburban environment. The response of small carnivores to urbanization is poorly studied, partly due to methodological difficulties. We assessed the impact of urbanization on a representative of small carnivores - the least weasel Mustela nivalis. Data from 254 trapping sessions of monitoring small mammals (27 810 trap-days) conducted in different urbanized and non-urbanized habitats (Poland, Central Europe) were used and analysed in a logistic regression model. The probability of occurrence of weasels was tested in relation to the land cover type, abundance of rodents (weasel's food base), proportion of a built-up area (on the 500 m radius buffer) and trapping effort. The weasel avoided urban areas and if the percentage of a built-up area was higher than 32% the probability of occurrence of the weasel was low (P < 0.5). Within urbanized areas, least weasel were only detected on the outskirts of a city or in the valleys of large rivers. Conversely, habitat type did not predict the presence of least weasel in non-urbanized areas. The possible reasons for the lack of the weasel in urban green areas are narrow food specialization (mainly rodents as prey; no use of anthropogenic food sources), high energetic demands, and fragmentation and isolation of green areas. Despite the high ecological plasticity of this species, the strong negative response of the least weasel to urbanization causes that their occurrence can be an indicator of well-planned urban greenery. The occurrence of the least weasel indicates both the functional connectivity of green areas in the city and the abundance and availability of the prey base - ground-dwelling animals from lower trophic groups.

AB  - Despite the widespread recognition of the risks of disease transmission associated with international trade in domestic animals and movement of exotic animals, less is known about the role of rats in carrying pathogens between continents. The genus Bartonella, a highly prevalent and extremely diverse group of bacteria, includes species that are excellent sentinel organisms for evaluating the transoceanic and intra-continental movement of the pathogens carried by rats of the genus Rattus. The patterns of spatial distribution, occurrence, and genetic diversity of Bartonella species infecting rats and their arthropod ectoparasites depend on the geographic locations within metropolitan areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. One of the points addressed in this review is a comparison of the diversity of Bartonella species carried by rats in their original habitats in Southeast Asia and in the cities occupied by rats recently. The invasion of Rattus rats into new urban territories create significant risk for human health.

AB  - As one of the eight major green wedges within Shanghai's overall urban planning in the city center, Sanlin Valley Park serves as an important intersection between ecological corridors along the Huangpu River and Shanghai's outer ring road. During the rapid urbanization process, the city's ecology has been facing constant deterioration. Furthermore, the city is experiencing an alarming loss of biodiversity, as well as increasingly severe urban heat island effect. To alleviate these issues, the project adopts a "valley" concept as the core of its design and utilizes thoughtful design strategies in five aspects: water management, wind corridors and micro-climates, ecosystem, transportation, and program and experience. With these strategies, the design team aims to improve the site's connectivity, restore its ecology, reshape habitats, create a resilient landscape, and forge a vibrant urban hub that can also serve as the city's ecological research base.
   During the design process, the design team adopts certain principles of landscape practices within the USA - that a project should encourage public participation of all socio-economic levels and place emphasis on the experience and benefits of the public. This form of multi-lateral cooperation allows for the park to constantly have its design plan reviewed and improved. It also allows for iterative responses to issues on the ground during construction. Last but not least, it instigates careful considerations of how to manage the park and its ecosystem, both in terms of cost and feasibility. By adopting all of these principles, the design team aspires to truly accede to citizens' needs, all while introducing a sustainable ecosystem that would, ultimately, contribute to a much improved ecology and economy.

AB  - Scolia hirta (Schrank) and Scolia sexmaculata (O.F. Muller) are Palearctic, parasitic Aculeata inhabiting forests and forest steppes. At present, the abundance and dispersal of these species are increasing considerably in Poland and other European countries, allowing observation of their possible habitat preferences. The analysis of the preferences of S. hirta and S. sexmaculata was conducted in Northern and North-Eastern Poland based on the evaluation of their occurrence in six types of habitats: (A) psammophilous and xerothermic grasslands, (B) old fields, (C) city outskirts, (D) sites in housing/industrial zones, (E) sand quarries, (F) post-industrial wastelands, and in a total of three types of landscape: 1) semi-natural, 2) urban, and 3) industrial. We demonstrated that the habitat most frequently colonized by S. hirta is post-industrial wastelands, while S. sexmaculata were most often sampled in old fields, with the frequency of 100% and 94.11%, respectively. At the same time, the abundance of the species in these habitats was also the highest, with a mean of 8.00 and 10.88 individuals, respectively. Moreover, S. hirta was relatively frequently found in the urban landscape (67% in city outskirts and 88.23% in the housing/industrial zones), while S. sexmaculata colonized these areas to a considerably low degree (25% in city outskirts and 29.41% in the housing/industrial zones). We also established that the occurrence of the species was affected by the forest cover in the closest vicinity of the study sites, which significantly modified the habitat preference of the species analyzed.

AB  - We investigated the patterns of genetic diversity and structure of African forest elephants in a human-modified landscape in the Gamba complex of protected areas (GCPA), a tropical wilderness area along the southwest coast of Gabon. We collected 298 elephant fecal samples from four sites (Sette Cama, Gamba area, Vera Plains, and Mayonami), along approximately 80 km of coastline from north to south. We used microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to successfully genotype 295 of the 298 fecal samples, and identified 213 individuals. Using sex markers, we identified 84 males and 118 females; we could not determine the sex of the remaining 11 individuals. We also characterized the sex, group size, and social status of crop-raiding elephants and did not find characteristics distinguishing them from nonraiders. Overall, our mtDNA and microsatellite markers revealed that elephants in the research area maintain high levels of genetic variation and low levels of subdivision. Gene flow appears to be mostly mediated by male dispersal away from natal herds. Our structure analysis revealed two highly admixed genetic clusters, attributable to high connectivity among the protected areas. However, forest areas within the GCPA have become increasingly fragmented by human-induced habitat modification. We detected a pattern of isolation by distance, accentuated by the presence of the town of Gamba between Sette-Cama and Mayonami. We found a high degree of connectivity among sampling locations within the GCPA. This supports the importance of establishing agricultural best practices to reduce habitat loss that may sever gene exchange and to maintain connectivity, as well as to avoid human-elephant conflict that can result in retaliatory killing of elephants in this area. This study emphasizes the importance of conducting baseline monitoring of demographic data, genetic diversity, and structure to enable future comparisons to assess the long-term impact of human-induced habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Despite their diversity and abundance, the importance of native, forest bee communities to pollination services and inherent biological diversity conservation is often overlooked. We studied forest bee communities in Delaware and Pennsylvania, USA, to better understand how forest bee community structure varies with changing land use and microhabitat quality among small, urban and suburban forest fragments in the mid-Atlantic United States. Our hypotheses were that (1) microhabitat quality would affect relative abundance of bee taxa, (2) surrounding landscape composition would drive local patch colonization-extinction dynamics, and (3) forest patch size would not affect community structure and composition. We found a lack of spatial autocorrelation among forest patches, indicating the importance of individual fragments in the autonomous generation and/or maintenance of bee communities. Community analyses revealed the importance of both landscape context and microhabitat quality in defining forest bee communities. By partitioning beta diversity into its constituent components, we also found that landscape composition drove changes in the relative abundance of taxa, while both landscape and microhabitat characteristics significantly influenced species turnover. Neither landscape composition nor quality of the microhabitat influenced initial site occupancy or colonization-extinction dynamics. Bisected by highways, suburban neighborhoods, agricultural lands, and urban development, many urban and suburban forest patches in the eastern United States are similar in composition to our study sites. As many native forest bees have limited capacity for long-range movement between forest patches, these remaining forest fragments are critical to the conservation of unique and speciose forest bee communities.

AB  - The increasing urban sprawl has contributed to the extensive fragmentation and reduction of natural habitat worldwide. Urbanization has a range of adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, including the disruption of plant dispersal processes across the landscape. Urban fragmentation can alter the distance and directionality of dispersal, leading to disrupted gene flow among populations. The dispersal processes of plants that rely on animal-mediated dispersal (zoochory) may be disproportionately affected by urbanization, as many animals avoid urban areas or restrict their movements within urban habitats. This could alter the efficiency of animal dispersal vectors and modify seed movements across urban habitats. While recent studies suggest that seed dispersal networks can be complex and dynamic even in highly managed green areas with relatively low biodiversity, zoochory in urban environments remains understudied. We synthesize the existing literature on zoochory in urban environments and place the findings in the context of ecosystem dynamics. We assess the ecological and evolutionary consequences for seed dispersal, following urbanization, by considering how zoochory is affected by specific features of urban environments. These include the complexity of habitats with varying continuity; high disturbance and intense management; a high proportion of alien species combined with low natural biodiversity; animal behavioral adjustments in different urban settings; and rapid evolutionary change due to urbanization. We conclude that (1) urbanization can disrupt and alter zoochory processes; and (2) successful zoochory can, in turn, alleviate or worsen the challenges to ecosystem dynamics originating from increased urbanization. The dynamic urban seed dispersal networks are emerging as useful models for the adaptability of seed dispersal communities. Their study can also shed light on eco-evolutionary processes under anthropogenic selective pressures, including species interactions. Finally, urban zoochory processes are critical to the functioning of urban ecosystems and as such, constitute an important ecosystem service with management implications. We propose directions for further research into urban zoochory processes to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics as urbanization continues.

AB  - Background: Lack of information about the dispersal of vector species barricade surveillance and control. Aims: Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the species diversity of Culex mosquito's larvae in the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. Methods: Mosquito larvae were collected from six places in three main environmental categories: urban (UA), rural (RA) and uninhabited areas (UNA), using dipping technique. Four dips were taken from each breeding site (350 ml each). Larval investigation was conducted two times a month during the study period. Diversity studies were conducted separately for each category by calculating classic diversity indices. Results: In total, 1369 specimens belonging to 10 different species were collected and identified, as follows: Culex hortensis, Cx. laticinctus, Cx. mimeticus, Cx. perexiguus, Cx. pipiens, Cx. modestus, Cx. sinaiticus, Cx. theileri, Cx. torrentium and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. None of these mosquito species have been recorded previously in this region. Diversity analysis indicated higher species richness for RA (Margalef 1/26). The average diversity indices for the three environment types ranged from 1.50 to 1.64 for Shannon index and from 0.730 to 0.738 for Simpson index. Conclusions: Biodiversity analysis indicated that species diversity in rural, urban and uninhabited areas is somewhat similar. Therefore, attention to all areas in vector control programs is essential.

AB  - The targets and challenges of the sustainable city of tomorrow are wide. In Hanoi city (Vietnam), the sustainable aspects of the urban landscape evolution are affected by a rapid urbanization, inefficient urban spatial planning, and the pressures of contemporary socioeconomic growth. This paper describes the evolution of urban landscape in Hanoi during the period 1990-2030. The background is the urbanization and the changes in urban planning. Urban land use/land cover of Hanoi city in 1993, 2000, 2007, 2012, and 2015 is described using LANDSAT satellite images. Land use/land cover of Hanoi in 2030 is projected by the Markov-cellular automata, which are a hybrid model of Markov chain analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, and cellular automata. The results show that Hanoi is becoming a metropolis, gradually having more dynamics and more diversity, but having less green in its pattern until 2030. All over Hanoi city, the built-up areas expanded, while the non-built area and water bodies narrowed. Residential, industrial, commercial, and service areas grow increasingly faster and become dense in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the city. New lakescapes and water corridors orient new urban development. Green areas become smaller and more fragmented. Agricultural rings have been cleared and replaced by new urban areas. Planning and managing the urban evolution toward sustainable development are imperative in Hanoi. The methods described in this paper can be effective tools expected to help planners, managers, and residents to deal with these concerns in the future. Moreover, socioeconomic development, environmental protection, improving urban planning efficiency, and integrating local governance into urban planning should be prioritized for a sustainable Hanoi city in the future.

AB  - Nectarivorous bats are essential to the functioning to both agricultural and natural ecosystems in the tropics, yet these pollinator communities are declining as a result of habitat loss and hunting. Temporal variation and habitat changes lead to both roost and floral resource loss, which is the major driver of bat pollination decline. This study aims to determine how the bat pollination networks in mixed-fruit orchards are affected by flowering seasons and different land-use types. We estimated the abundance of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats using video observations to determine floral visitation rates from 18 mixed-fruit orchards in Southern Thailand. Pollination networks were then created based on network level indices (number of interactions and specialisation) and species level indices (strength-dependence of plant on each bat, and generalised degree-the number of interactions per species divided by the number of possible interacting partners) for each bat group at each orchard. We found that specialisation in low season networks was higher than those from peak season. Nectarivorous bats showed higher levels of normalised degree, and strength than frugivorous bats. The normalised degree of frugivorous bats, but not nectarivorous bats increased with the proportion of urban area within 30 km radius. The strength of bats was positively correlated with the proportion of plantations within a 2 km radius. Our results show that both bat guilds are strongly integrated into pollination networks where they occur and provide evidence that increasing the area of plantation and urban alters the degree of generalization of pollinators which can significantly impact pollination success of plants.

AB  - Interference of the geolocalized digital layer makes it is necessary to launch a new artificial nature called augmented environment (AE). The design and construction of this emerging landscape, that has a hybrid physical and digital ecology, is based on the network interaction between fields of sensors and actuators. In the contemporary scenario, there is a need to explore the symptoms of this occurrence that seems to redefine the future of our cities.This article anticipates a model that structures the sensory environment of AE and contributes with a selection of case studies from three concrete landscapes.

AB  - This paper focuses on the suitability of urban expansion in mountain areas against the background of accelerated urban development. Urbanization is accompanied by conflict and intense transformations of various landscapes, and is accompanied by social, economic, and ecological impacts. Evaluating the suitability of urban expansion (UE) and determining an appropriate scale is vital to solving urban environmental issues and realizing sustainable urban development. In mountain areas, the natural and social environments are different from those in the plains; the former is characterized by fragile ecology and proneness to geological disasters. Therefore, when evaluating the expansion of a mountain city, more factors need to be considered. Moreover, we need to follow the principle of harmony between nature and society according to the characteristics of mountain cities. Thus, when we evaluate the expansion of a mountain city, the key procedure is to establish a scientific evaluation system and explore the relationship between each evaluation factor and the urban expansion process. Taking Leshan (LS), China-a typical mountain city in the upper Yangtze River which has undergone rapid growth-as a case study, the logic minimum cumulative resistance (LMCR) model was applied to evaluate the suitability of UE and to simulate its direction and scale. The results revealed that: An evaluation system of resistance factors (ESRFs) was established according to the principle of natural and social harmony; the logic resistance surface (LRS) scientifically integrated multiple resistance factors based on the ESRF and a logic regression analysis. LRS objectively and effectively reflected the contribution and impact of each resistance factor to urban expansion. We found that landscape, geological hazards and GDP have had a great impact on urban expansion in LS. The expansion space of the mountain city is limited; the area of suitable expansion is only 23.5%, while the area which is unsuitable for expansion is 39.3%. In addition, it was found that setting up ecological barriers is an effective way to control unreasonable urban expansion in mountain cities. There is an obvious scale (grid size) effect in the evaluation of urban expansion in mountain cities; an evaluation of the suitable scale yielded the result of 90 m x 90 m. On this scale, taking the central district as the center, the urban expansion process will extend to the neighboring towns of Mianzhu, Suji, Juzi and Mouzi. Urban expansion should be controlled in terms of scale, especially in mountain cities. The most suitable urban size of LS is 132 km(2).This would allow for high connectivity of urban-rural areas with the occupation of relatively few green spaces.

AB  - Recent research has highlighted the significance of cities for biodiversity, making them important places for conservation in their own right. Current conservation approaches in cities are mostly defensive. Thus, they focus on remnant pockets of natural areas or try to protect particular species that occur in the built environment. These approaches are vulnerable to further urban development and do not create habitats. An alternative strategy is to make wildlife an integral part of urban development and thereby create a new habitat in the built-up area. Here we address the challenge of choosing target species for such wildlife-inclusive urban design. The starting point of our conceptual framework is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data. The existing habitat types on and around the development site and dispersal barriers limit the species numbers to the local species potential. In the next step, the site's potential for each species is analyzed-how can it be upgraded to host species given the planned development and the life-cycle of the species? For the final choice of target species, traits related to the human-animal interaction are considered. We suggest that stakeholders will be involved in the final species selection. Our approach differs from existing practice, such as expert choice of priority species, by (1) representing an open process where many species are potential targets of conservation, (2) the involvement of stakeholders in a participatory way. Our approach can also be used at larger spatial scales such as quarters or entire cities.

AB  - Debates of polycentricity or dispersal concerning the locational patterns of decentralized employment have caused widespread concern owing to their differing social and economic consequences. However, studies relating to these debates do not account for the reasons for the inconsistencies. Based on available point employment data, this paper seeks to respond to the debates by documenting and explaining the spatial transformation of Shanghai at different geographic scales. We find that the period from 2004 to 2008 captures a trend of employment centralization. But a reverse trend of decentralization occurred between 2008 and 2013, which is characterized by general dispersal at a large scale, accompanied by polycentricity at a small scale. These results contribute to the literature by highlighting the role of scale effect in addressing the debates about polycentricity or dispersal and provide insights for identifying urban spatial structure in planning practice.

AB  - Although it is well known that the increasing size of the human population has a negative effect on freshwater biodiversity, the subject of whether or how the intersection of roads and streams (hereafter road crossings) influence the diversity of stream macro-invertebrates is under-researched. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we collected stream macro-invertebrates from road crossings (bridges and culverts) and compared their diversity with upstream and downstream sections. We found that road crossings had negative effects on the richness and abundance of native macro-invertebrates, as well as on the number of protected taxa. Our results showed also that alien individuals were more abundant at road crossings. These findings support the assumption that road crossings contribute to the spread of alien species. The assessment of environmental variables indicated that road crossings caused habitat modifications, and based on these it can be assumed that habitat modifications and associated phenomena (e.g. pollutants and storm events) were the major drivers of the observed patterns in biodiversity. Our results fill a knowledge gap and contribute to the deeper understanding of the effect of road crossings on freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - Urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers, but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa, rather than through the emergent properties of communities. Here, we use replicated, catchment-scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs. We postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year (2016-2017) at 18 sites across 3 river systems in South Wales (United Kingdom). Contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing, water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality, with small increases in nitrate, phosphate, temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates, however, were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge. Food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by: (i) reduced taxonomic and functional diversity; (ii) simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance; and (iii) reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus). Although correlative and partially confounded by other effects, these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population, community and ecosystem-level effects in urban river systems, and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution.

AB  - The expansion of urban areas leads the loss of green spaces causing many environmental and economic problems. The infrastructure has been carried to the rural areas to deal with the needs of populations, reducing the green vegetation. This isolates one habitat area from other habitats and increases the fragmentation. A green corridor can connect fragmented habitats. Thus, this research aims to analyze and provide a green corridor in four different cities of Jordan. Through study some case studies, review of articles, researches, data collection, GIS, observations and maps derived from Jordanian ministries were used for the analysis of a green corridor in four cities in the northwest of Jordan. This research provides a comprehensive planning of the biogeographically areas, ecotourism sites and variety of vegetation in the protected areas of namely, Ajloun Forest Reserve and Dibben Forest Reserve, to link them in the biodiversity and conservation regions of the Al-Salt and north Amman, after identifying these diverse areas of vegetation cover and wildlife in each governorate. In addition, the research discusses ecological, environmental and economic effects of applying a green corridor as a sustainable city approach in Jordan. In other words, the purpose of this study is to suggest a sustainable proposal by analyzing green area zones and green corridor axes to improve the nature and the environment in Jordan. This proposal adapts urban areas with the establishment of green corridor connecting conservation areas in Jerash and Ajloun to Al-Salt and north of Amman Such a green corridor can lead an increase of local and international tourism which may improve the economic strength and can increase the job opportunities for citizens to live in a more ecological urban environment.

AB  - Numerous cities face the serious problems of rapid urbanization and climate change, especially in recent years. Among all cities, Wuhan is one of the most affected by these changes, accompanied by the transformation of water surfaces into urban lands and the decline of natural ventilation. This study investigated the impact of surface urban heat island enlargement (SUHI) and block morphology changes in heat balance. Accordingly, the interactive impact of building diversity with major building forms (low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise) on thermal balance and microclimate changes under the influence of urban land expansion at the residential block scale was studied. To investigate the heat balance changes by air temperature intensification and air movement reduction, a long-term and field observational analysis (1980-2018) coupled with computational fluid dynamic simulation (CFD) was used to evaluate the impact of building diversity on thermal balance. Outcomes show that urban heat island intensity (UHII) increased by 2 degrees C when water surfaces in urban areas decreased; consequently, there was a deterioration in the air movement to alleviate UHII. Thus, the air movement declined substantially with UHII and SUHI enlargement, which, through increased urban surfaces and roughness length, will become worse by 2020. Furthermore, the decline in air movement caused by the transformation of urban water bodies cannot contribute to the heat balance unless reinforced by the morphology of the urban blocks. In the design of inner-city blocks, morphological indicators have a significant impact on microclimate and heat balance, where increasing building density and plot ratio will increase UHII, and increasing water surfaces will result in an increase in urban ventilation. Lastly, a substantial correlation between air temperature and relative humidity was found, which, together with the block indicators, can help control the air temperature and adjust the urban microclimate.

AB  - Unplanned urbanization, demographic and environmental changes have forced many cities into more uncertainty and risk, challenging economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In this context nurturing resilience in the face of various uncertainties of environmental, socioeconomic and other sociopolitical risk is an urgent matter. Resilience has become an important goal for many cities throughout the world leading to the enhancement of urban ecology and maintenance of essential ecosystem goods and services to make sure the sustainable future for all. The Kathmandu metropolitan city is one of the fastest-growing capital cities with recent and frequent evidence of unplanned development, loss of green space, tragic events of an earthquake, flood and other environmental problems causing devastation, economic damages, and loss of human life/health, and habitats. In this background, the paper evaluates suitable sites for urban green space development using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) based multi-criteria analysis methodswith geographical information system (GIS).Variables taken for this study are school point data, health facility's location data, emergency service's locations, water bodies, emergency road network data, recent land use/land cover data, population data, existing park, and slope. The unit of a study is ametropolitan city. Our evaluations demonstrate the spatial distribution of different not suitable areas, less suitable, moderate suitable, and highly suitable area respectively, of the 4.47%, 7.19% of the area are high andmoderate suitable area, while the largest area 78.87% is less suitable and 9.47% are not suitable for the development of green open space. The result indicates human occupancy is everywhere and per capita, open green space in the city is very below the global average. The local government must think about different modality for development of green open space in collaboration with other government agency occupyingmore open space or engagement with private sectors. This finding could contribute a planner for spatial planning of green space development in a Metropolitan City.

AB  - Periurban areas of growing cities in developing countries have been conceptualised as highly dynamic landscapes characterised by a mixture of socioeconomic structures, land uses and functions. While the body of conceptual literature on periurban areas has significantly increased over the past two decades, methods for operationalising these multi-dimensional concepts are rather limited. Yet, information about the location and areal extent of periurban areas is needed for integrated planning in the urban-rural interface. This article presents the results of a study aiming at classifying and mapping periurban areas along the urban-rural gradient of Tamale, a medium-sized city in Ghana. The study used a quantitative, multi-dimensional methodology involving the following as core elements: (1) a relative measure of how urban a place and its people are in terms of services, infrastructure and livelihoods (urbanicity index); (2) the diversity of households regarding their livelihoods and access to urban services; and (3) land use dynamics. Therefore, data from a household survey, as well as land use and other secondary geospatial data were collected and analysed at different spatial scales. The findings suggested that the periurban space consists of two main zones. Inner periurban areas are driven by urban expansion and the conversion of non-urban into urban land use is most visible here. These areas exhibit higher levels of socioeconomic diversity, compared to both rural and urban areas. Outer periurban areas are less dynamic in terms of land use change and exhibit lower building densities, and compared with rural areas, hold stronger links to the city related to the movement of people and goods. The spatial analysis revealed that periurban areas develop mainly along major transport corridors across administrative divisions, as well as in the form of periurban islands in the rural zone. This study set out to extend existing methodologies to map urban and periurban development in medium-sized cities in sub-Saharan Africa, useful for urban and regional planning beyond administrative boundaries.

AB  - The theme of "urban mobility" has been widely discussed not only for its role in structuring urban systems and the development of cities, but also for the various problems arising from its dynamics. Such problems have jeopardized the pursuit of the goals associated with the Healthy Cities movement, promoting and improving quality of health and the urban environment according to World Health Organization guidelines. With the Lisbon Metropolitan Area as a study area, the objective of this paper is to understand if its municipalities show similar trends regarding the contributions of urban mobility to healthier municipalities, and if the trends are convergent among them. The methodology is based on an indicator board representative of the studied subject. Firstly, considering two periods (one in the 2000s and another in the 2010s), using dispersion measures we discuss the existence or not of tendencies of spatial convergence between metropolitan municipalities as well as to identify positive contributions of the various dynamics associated with urban mobility for healthier municipalities. Subsequently, the application of factorial analysis in main components followed by cluster analysis for the most recent period makes it possible to identify the different realities found in the metropolitan context. There were several spatial convergence tendencies but not a clear positive evolution for healthier municipalities in all indicators. For the recent period, a greater similarity between the municipalities of North LMA (three groups of municipalities) and a greater diversity in the South LMA (six groups of municipalities) were identified.

AB  - Urbanization imposes notable threats to global biodiversity. Masonry retaining and city walls offer unusual ruderal habitats for spontaneous establishment of unique plant communities which may flourish despite urban disturbance and intensification. We comprehensively surveyed the wall-plant communities in Chongqing in southwest China to investigate their special urban ecology and their role in sustaining urban biodiversity. From 289 masonry walls, we recorded 205 plant species under 164 genera and 78 families. Perennial and annual herbs were the most common growth forms by species number. Despite accommodating 27 tree species and 6538 tree individuals, three dominant ones, respectively two Moraceae members Ficus virens which is a strangler fig and Broussonetia papyrifera, and Robinia pseudoacacia (Leguminosae), constituted 94% of the wall-tree stock. Detailed analysis of tree height distribution shed light on species recruitment dynamics. The dispersal agents differentiated sharply by growth form, with 73% herbaceous species wind-dispersed in comparison with 70.2% woody species bird-dispersed. The endemism and floristic characteristics of wall-plant communities were influenced by the regional urban flora, particularly for dominant wall trees; similar traits were found in the wall flora of Nanjing and Hong Kong. The low similarity in species composition between walls and nearby ground plant communities suggested the critical role played by walls in protecting the disturbance-intolerant native plants, including many Pteridophytes. The conservation values and biodiversity contributions of masonry walls in Chongqing are worthy of special attention. The findings could provide the basis to maintain urban ecosystem services and for nature-based ecological urban designs.

AB  - The article presents the urban transformations resulting from the advent of the industrial revolution as a historical process formed by three distinct and successive moments, through which three major ruptures occurred on the spatial configuration of cities. The studied period goes from the remodeling of Paris in the nineteenth century, passing through modernist urbanism with the creation of the car oriented cities in the twentieth century, up to the phenomenon of urban sprawl or contemporary urban nebula. The theoretical-methodological strategy adopted focus on the changes in the urban spatial syntax, understood as the relationships established between the structuring elements of the urban form and the daily socio-spatial practices. The article proposes, by way of conclusion, that the three key moments must be understood as part of a larger historical process, highlighting the dialectic established between continuity and rupture in the processes of space production.

AB  - Understanding the social organization of coastal dolphins, particularly those that reside adjacent to major cities and urbanized regions, is important for understanding the vulnerability of populations to human impacts. We investigated the sexual segregation and social dynamics in a population of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) inhabiting the near-urban embayment of Moreton Bay, Queensland. Over 160 vessel-based surveys, 148 adults were photographically identified. This included 116 assumed females and 32 assumed males. The population was sexually segregated (SSAS = 0.52, p < .001) and individuals preferred to associate with others of the same sex occupying the same spatial area (p < .025). Association indices between paired males were almost double those of females (x over bar HWI=0.09, SD = 0.04 and x over bar HWI=0.05, SD = 0.02, respectively). However, females were more gregarious than males and maintained a larger network of associates based on preferred companionships. The social network was also modular with five clusters identified, and a limited number of individuals had a disproportionate influence on connectivity between clusters. This highly fragmented social network implies that the population may be vulnerable to social disruptions from human impacts.

AB  - In cities, trees planted along streets could play an important ecological role for spontaneous plants growing at their bases. For example, these trees could represent corridors by potentially connecting large green spaces (e.g., parks, gardens), which allow species to move within the urban matrix. We considered sets of urban trees in 15 streets in Paris, France, as metapopulations for 15 plant species. Our objective was to determine the factors influencing the dynamics of colonization and extinction of populations based on the distance of the streets to green spaces and biological traits of each species. Plant species in 1,324 tree bases of the Bercy District of Paris were surveyed annually from 2009 to 2015. For each species and each street, we used SPOMSIM software to identify the best-fit metapopulation model between four models with different colonization and extinction functions: propagule rain model (PRM) and Levins' model with or without rescue effect. Results demonstrated that species more often conformed to the PRM in streets near green spaces, which suggested that green spaces could act as sources for the populations in those streets. Species with seeds with long-term persistence more often conformed to the PRM, indicating that a soil seed bank helps species invade entire streets. Finally, a higher percentage of species with a short height conformed to models with a rescue effect, which indicated that those small species resisted the effects of weeding by the city technical services better than taller species. Synthesis and applications. This study showed how biological traits of species and geography of the district determine the dynamics of plants in the streets, and these results may provide important information for biodiversity management in cities.

AB  - Human activities associated with urbanization have negatively affected the biodiversity of native plant communities globally. Establishing native species assemblages on green roofs may help conserve native plant diversity in urban areas, but these assemblages are susceptible to colonization by species from the surrounding landscape. In natural communities, colonization from the regional species pool reflects the filtering effects of both abiotic and biotic factors, but the relative effects of these factors on green roof colonization are not well-understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied colonization dynamics of 10 green roofs in New York City (NY, United States), each established at the same time with the same source materials. On each roof, 12 plots were established, with one-half of each plot planted with an erect C-4 graminoid dominant (Hempstead Plains: HP) and the other half with a tuft C-3 graminoid and forb dominant (Rocky Summit: RS) species assemblage derived from native communities. Six of the 12 split-plots contained shallow growing medium, while the other six contained deeper growing medium. Resident plants were planted in October 2010. Fifty-eight non-resident plant species colonized plots between August 2011 and August 2012, with two native and 10 non-native species accounting for 90% of total colonist dry mass. Colonist dry mass and richness decreased with increasing resident plant cover, but the effects of growing medium depth on colonist dry mass and richness differed between assemblages. Forbs accounted for 81% of the colonist dry mass from the HP assemblage, but just 31% in the RS assemblage. Further, forbs accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in June and July, while graminoids accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in August. These results indicate colonization of planted green roofs may be strongly affected by the composition of established plant assemblages and that these effects may vary temporally with colonist management regime, even within a single growing season. Further, the inconsistent effects of growing medium depth suggest that niche overlap and complementarity in rhizosphere dynamics may influence colonization more in some systems compared with others. Additional research is required to describe the effects of colonist management strategies, as well as the roles of priority effects, niche complementarity and community assembly, on long-term dynamics of colonization on green roofs planted with native plants.

AB  - Aedes vigilax (Skuse) is a pest and vector species associated with coastal wetlands and the abundance of this mosquito has been identified as contributing to increased risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. As urban development continues to encroach on these coastal wetlands, pest and public health impacts are becoming of increasing concern and in the absence of broadscale mosquito control. Urban planners are looking to buffer zones and other land use planning options to minimize contact between mosquitoes and humans but gaps in the understanding of dispersal ranges of mosquitoes hamper the adoption of these strategies. A mark-release-recapture experiment was conducted to measure the dispersal of this mosquito from an urban estuarine wet-land in Sydney, Australia. An estimated total of over 150,000 wild caught female mosquitoes were marked with fluorescent dust and then released. A network of 38 traps was then operated for 5 d within an area of 28 km(2). A total of 280 marked mosquitoes was recaptured, representing less than 1% of the estimate 250,000 marked mosquitoes released. Marked mosquitoes were recaptured up to 3 km from the release point, providing an insight into the dispersal range of these mosquitoes. The mean distance traveled by marked mosquitoes was 0.83 km, a result reflecting the greater proportion of marked mosquitoes recaptured near release point. The findings of this study indicate that effective buffer zones between estuarine wetlands and high-density urban developments would be an impractical approach to minimizing pest and public health impacts associated with this mosquito.

AB  - Reduction of terrestrial vegetation and degradation of water quality are among the factors driving insect population decline in growing cities. In this study, we investigated the extent of habitat deterioration, behavioral and physiological responses, and fitness of a damselfly [Hetaerina americana (F.)] population in a semitropical region in central Mexico. The study population was located in a riverine area that crosses a small urban area (Tehuixtla city). We related two habitat variables (tree/shrub covered area and numbers of wastewater outlets) to presumable damselfly responses (larval and adult abundance, duration of adults exposed directly to sunlight, lipid content and muscle mass, and egg survival) over the years 2002 and 2016. We detected a reduction in terrestrial vegetation cover, an increase in wastewater outlets, and a decrease in larval and adult abundance. Adults were more exposed to sunlight in 2016 than in 2002 and showed a reduced lipid content and muscle mass in 2016. Egg survival also decreased. Although correlative, these results suggest impairment of damselfly condition (via lipid and muscle reduction) and fitness as urbanization increases.

AB  - The anthropogenic impact on natural environments and the loss of species diversity along with changes in functional diversity call for effective steps to ensure habitat conservation. The functional diversity in particular has suffered in recent decades due to investment and land use changes. The translocation of whole turfs of certain vegetation plots prior to being destroyed is one possible solution for maintaining habitat functional diversity. In the presented paper, we analyse the functional changes in adaptive, regeneration and urbanity plant traits for meadow, heath and fen that were translocated from a rural site to a post-industrial site in a city. After five years of monitoring, we checked the changes in the functional diversity (FD) and community weighted means with the adoption of nine traits and Rao's quadratic entropy for calculating the FD and the relative treatment effect (RTE) to evaluate the influence of time. We found that the overall FD of that trait set was not significantly changed. The FD of the seed dispersal type significantly increased. The means of autochoric, anemochoric and hemerochoric species decreased, and nautochoric and zoochoric species increased significantly, with respect to the frequency and abundance. The flowering season was shorter for meadows and heaths with earlier start and termination. The most important factors of the FD changes are probably linked to the microclimate of the urbanized area and the cessation of grazing. Our study demonstrated that translocation of vegetation plots from rural to urbanized environments can be a fairly effective measure in landscape shaping and in promoting biodiversity in urban ecosystems.

AB  - ContextSocioeconomic and landscape factors influence mosquito abundance especially in urban areas. Few studies addressed how socioeconomic and landscape factors, especially at micro-scale for mosquito life history, determine mosquito abundance.ObjectivesWe aim to predict mosquito abundance based on socioeconomic and/or landscape factors using machine learning framework. Additionally, we determine these factors' response to mosquito abundance.MethodsWe identified 3985 adult mosquitoes (majority of which were Aedes mosquitoes) in 90 sampling sites from Charlotte, NC, USA in 2017. Seven socioeconomic and seven landscape factors were used to predict mosquito abundance. Three supervised learning models, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were constructed, tuned, and evaluated using both continuous input factors and binary inputs. Random forest (RF) was used to assess individual input's relative importance and response to mosquito abundance.ResultsWe showed that landscape factors alone yielded equal or better predictability than socioeconomic factors. The inclusion of both types of factors further improved model accuracy using binary inputs. kNN also had robust performance regardless of inputs (accuracy>95% for binary and>99% for continuous input data). Landscape factors group had higher importance than socioeconomic group (54.4% vs. 45.6%). Landscape heterogeneity (measured by Shannon index) was the single most important input factor for mosquito abundance.ConclusionsLandscape factors were the key for mosquito abundance. Machine learning models were powerful tools to handle complex datasets with multiple socioeconomic and landscape factors to accurately predict mosquito abundance.

AB  - "Residence" and "employment" are the two main spatial and temporal elements of urban residents, and the spatial dispersion of residence and employment is the origin of commuting traffic. With the rapid development of cities and economy, urban traffic problems have become more and more serious, especially the problem of urban traffic congestion caused by commuter traffic. The law of commuting behavior in eco-city can directly reflect the spatial structure of the city. Exploring the interaction between eco-city commuting and occupational residence distribution is of great significance for alleviating urban traffic congestion and promoting urban development.
   Based on the big data of time and space commuting, the system develops the relationship between commuting traffic and occupational residence distribution in eco-city. The main work and achievements are as follows:
   (1) Analysis of population distribution. This paper visualizes the population distribution of ecological city commuting data at different spatial scales and time scales;
   (2) Analysis of commuting exchange situation. This paper visualizes the attendance traffic data of popular plots through dynamic O-D diagrams;
   (3) Crowd movement analysis. In this paper, the traffic data of the subway station's traffic attendance of the popular block is visually analyzed through the dynamic chart, and the dynamic movement of the taxi trajectory during the early peak period is used to analyze the flow of the urban population;
   (4) This system takes the eco-city commuting as the research object, explores the distribution characteristics of eco-city commuting in urban space, thus realizing the urban occupational commuting analysis system that assists urban planning. The system breaks through the traditional "duty and residence balance" analysis method, and realizes the visual analysis of commuting data of eco-city in Chongqing and Beijing based on spatio-temporal big data, thus providing reference for urban planning, in order to assist the coordinated development of urban transportation planning and land use.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological communities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.

AB  - Ecosystem functioning is positively linked to biodiversity on land and in the sea. In high-diversity systems (e.g. coral reefs), species coexist by sharing resources and providing similar functions at different temporal or spatial scales. How species combine to deliver the ecological function they provide is pivotal for maintaining the structure, functioning and resilience of some ecosystems, but the significance of this is rarely examined in low-diversity systems such as estuaries. We tested whether an ecological function is shaped by biodiversity in a low-diversity ecosystem by measuring the consumption of carrion by estuarine scavengers. Carrion (e.g. decaying animal flesh) is opportunistically fed on by a large number of species across numerous ecosystems. Estuaries were chosen as the model system because carrion consumption is a pivotal ecological function in coastal seascapes, and estuaries are thought to support diverse scavenger assemblages, which are modified by changes in water quality and the urbanization of estuarine shorelines. We used baited underwater video arrays to record scavengers and measure the rate at which carrion was consumed by fish in 39 estuaries across 1,000 km of coastline in eastern Australia. Carrion consumption was positively correlated with the abundance of only one species, yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus australis, which consumed 58% of all deployed carrion. The consumption of carrion by yellowfin bream was greatest in urban estuaries with moderately hardened shorelines (20%-60%) and relatively large subtidal rock bars (>0.1 km(2)). Our findings demonstrate that an ecological function can be maintained across estuarine seascapes despite both limited redundancy (i.e. dominated by one species) and complementarity (i.e. there is no spatial context where the function is delivered significantly when yellowfin bream are not present) in the functional traits of animal assemblages. The continued functioning of estuaries, and other low-diversity ecosystems, might therefore not be tightly linked to biodiversity, and we suggest that the preservation of functionally dominant species that maintain functions in these systems could help to improve conservation outcomes for coastal seascapes.

AB  - Fast-growing urban demand drives increase of production at a global scale. A full understanding of how carbon footprint is driven by socioeconomic factors in local, domestic and international economies is essential. Herein, we develop a cross-boundary carbon tracking approach based on input-output analysis, network control analysis and structural decomposition analysis. Using Beijing as a case study, we quantify both urban embodied and controlled carbon footprints over 1985-2012, and look into how they are impacted by socio-economic factors in local, domestic and foreign regions. We find that the carbon controlled by urban economy from inside accounts for 60% of the total footprint over 1985-2000, while this proportion decreased to 45% in 2012 due to externalization of production supply chains. Carbon intensity and urban consumption strongly compete with each other and together determine the variation trend of the city's consumption-based and controlled carbon footprint. Compared to a consumption-based perspective, this control approach reveals a higher impact of production structure transition on urban carbon footprint, and clearly tracks how carbon emissions are increasingly manipulated by other regions. The local-production-related carbon footprint have decreased by 15-22% over 2000-2012, while meanwhile that from domestic and foreign imports has increased dramatically by 700-960%. Network control approach is able to unveil drivers of carbon emission that are actually regulated by a city as a consequence of its interactions with the rest of global economy.

AB  - In developing countries, where political instability, former conflicts and social breakdown take place, heritage can be included in urban regeneration processes as a driver for economic development but also for social cohesion and cultural identity. This paper presents a heritage-based method for urban regeneration, developed for the city of Luanda (Angola), within the elaboration of its Metropolitan Plan (2016). Actions focus on the rehabilitation of buildings and public spaces, creating the conditions to implement effective financial mechanisms able to cover the costs of urban regeneration by results. Here, rehabilitation measures are combined with the implementation of mixed-use development models, addressing one of the key issues of urban regeneration: attracting private investments. From a practical perspective, the proposed approach focusses on the elaboration of heritage preservation, valorization and requalification strategies, moving from a geographical urban delimitation of Heritage Sets to a regeneration process based on a radius of influence that goes beyond the single building. From the regeneration of the built environment and public spaces in these Heritage Sets, the surrounding area is naturally affected. Strategic actions applied to Heritage Sets aim to produce a domino effect of regeneration that involves multiple spatial scales: from buildings and public spaces to neighbourhoods and, consequently, to the entire city. The implementation of this approach to several Heritage Sets delimited across the city, would, in the long-term, create a connected heritage network that results in an integrated urban regeneration process. Criteria for the delimitation of Heritage Sets are proposed, dealing with the concept of diversity, namely: time, historical, symbolic and functional diversity. The results from this study aim to support decision-makers in integrating heritage-based urban regeneration approaches into public policies and local planning practice.

AB  - The grouping of parcel data based on proximity is a pre-processing step of GIS and a key link of urban structure recognition for regional function discovery and urban planning. Currently, most literature abstracts parcels into points and clusters parcels based on their attribute similarity, which produces a large number of coarse granularity functional regions or discrete distribution of parcels that is inconsistent with human cognition. In this paper, we propose a novel parcel grouping method to optimise this issue, which considers both the urban morphology and the urban functional connectivity. Infiltration behaviours of urban components provide a basis for exploring the correlation between morphology mechanism and functional connectivity of urban areas. We measured the infiltration behaviours among adjacent parcels and concluded that the occurrence of infiltration behaviours often appears in the form of groups, which indicated the practical significance of parcel grouping. Our method employed two parcel morphology indicators: the similarity of the line segments and the compactness of the distribution. The line segment similarity was used to establish the adjacent relationship among parcels and the compactness was used to optimise the grouping result in obtain a satisfactory visual expression. In our study, constrained Delaunay triangulation, Hausdorff distance, and graph theory were employed to construct the proximity, delineate the parcel adjacency matrix, and implement the grouping of parcels. We applied this method for grouping urban parcel data of Beijing and verified the rationality of grouping results based on the quantified results of infiltration behaviours. Our method proved to take a good account of infiltration behaviours and satisfied human cognition, compared with a k-means++ method. We also presented a case using Xicheng District in Beijing to demonstrate the practicability of the method. The result showed that our method obtained fine-grained groups while ensuring functional regions-integrity.

AB  - Urbanization of coastal habitats is increasing worldwide. However, most man-made structures are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace and can strongly impact the diversity and functioning of coastal habitats. The value of coastal engineering can be enhanced by the provision of microhabitats that facilitate colonization by marine life. One step forward is moved in this research by combining species coexistence theory, resource patchiness and applied ecology in order to find ways that maximize the biological diversity of coastal defence structures. Featureless areas of a seawall were modified by the addition of microhabitats (resource) that were distributed in different configurations of patchiness. Gastropod diversity peaked at intermediate levels of microhabitat patchiness. This appeared to be driven by different patterns of resource use among species. Gastropods dispersed longer distances on unmodified seawalls than on natural rocky shores, but when microhabitats were added the dispersal decreased. The ability to find microhabitats differed among species. Our results confirm that patchiness in microhabitat distribution affects biodiversity. The extent of microhabitat patchiness could potentially be tailored by coastal engineers to meet specific conservation priorities: increasing diversity versus increasing number of individuals.

AB  - Gene flow between populations can help maintain genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding, which is especially important for small, fragmented habitats. Many plant species rely on pollinators to move pollen between populations. In urban areas, insufficient pollinator services may result in limited gene flow, which can have negative consequences such as genetic drift and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, restored populations that are established with few founders of low genetic diversity may have limited long-term population persistence. Here, we tested the hypotheses that populations of a self-compatible forb established on urban green roofs from nursery stock are genetically depauperate and that limited gene (pollen) flow between populations will result in increased inbreeding. We compared the neutral genetic diversity of Penstemon hirsutus, using nine microsatellite loci, between three green roof populations established from nursery stock and three natural populations. We also established ten experimental populations on green roofs and measured rates of outcrossing and inbreeding and identified the movement of pollen within and between roofs using a paternity analysis. We found that neutral genetic diversity of populations established from nursery stock was lower than that of natural populations, although the level of inbreeding was also lower on the green roofs. In our experimental populations, we found that the rates of outcrossing and inbreeding varied between the roof populations. Our results suggest that inbreeding may be correlated with cover of co-flowering species but not with any of the other measured site properties. The location of likely pollen donors suggested that on average, 75% of pollen was derived from plants within the population (including self) and 25% came from plants on different roofs. Our results document realized pollen movement within and between green roofs, demonstrating that these habitats provide important connectivity in a fragmented environment.

AB  - Mouvements-network: The interconnexion between technology, environment and social life in the urban space. The emergence of digital networks and the imminence of a global environmental catastrophe are the two great pressures of the contemporary era. The article aims to combine the reflection on technology and the digital with the reflection on the territory and the habitat. It seeks to understand the role of these elements in the articulation of new forms of organization and social mobilization that emerge in urban space, as the occupation and resignification of unusual spaces in the big cities. The notion of network-movements is proposed to designate these phenomena characterized by the hybridism between society, technology and environment, and also by relational, associative and non-projective aspects.

AB  - As accessibility becomes a basic need of modem society, the issue of sustainable transportation continues to gain importance. On the large scale, it concerns interconnecting cities and metropolises, and, on a smaller scale, it refers to connection networks for pedestrians, cyclists and other means of public transport. The study aims to assess the importance of sustainable transport as a principle of New Urbanism in contemporary redevelopment projects. It introduces possible ways of implementing these principles, as well as dangers coming from misunderstanding them. The approaches and methods used in this article combine field studies conducted during the research trips, desk research and interviews with professionals at various stages of two urban renewal projects - Clichy Batignolles (France) and the main train station area in Lodz (Poland). The study revealed the strategic role of rail line redevelopment projects in both rebuilding the continuity of the urban fabric (Clichy Batignolles) and in creating a new centrality for an area with attractive cultural activities and services (Lodz). As urban project timeframes are often long, both case studies show that high flexibility and the ability to adapt investments to changing conditions are often required. Nevertheless, the realization of the key infrastructure elements should be maintained all along. Furthermore, functional diversity can provide an important support for the sustainability of the project as it ensures the quality of urban tissue through height level representative public projects, thereby giving the area in question a new image. As exemplified by the housing policy in France, the distribution of functions can also serve as a pertinent response to the strategic needs of the entire agglomeration as well as a useful solution to local problems. One of the most crucial elements of redevelopment projects is the implementation of sustainable transportation that provides quick and comfortable connections by various means of public transport within different urban scales: metropolises, cities, districts and the city. As an element of sustainable urban policy, an effective public transportation network in the inner city should be supported by the limitation of car park ratio for non-residents within the redevelopment project. Altogether, the impact that other New Urbanism principles exert on developing urban structures is a pertinent question. Today, the real challenge for this movement has moved into the city, rather than on the outskirts, as in the past.

AB  - Recent scholarship has called for widening investigations of cities through the analysis of everyday practices that shape urban life. Critical water studies have contributed to this emerging debate by using an everyday lens to document the diversity of practices of accessing and distributing water. Thus far, little attention has been given to the everyday practices of setting water prices and how these shape access. We contribute to this gap by investigating the practices of setting prices in two distinct service modalities within Lilongwe's water supply network. Our study reveals the hybrid and dynamic arrangements that shape pricing regimes, formed through the formal and informal negotiations on subsidies, incentives, tariff increases and distribution of profits. In these negotiations, the decision makers opportunistically mobilise their different and at times conflicting mandates (business and social) and guiding principles (equity versus cost-recovery). We conclude that pricing regimes are the outcome of intertwined structural processes and everyday practices that exacerbate uneven water flows in the city.

AB  - Given the ongoing decline of many species, it is important to perform multifactorial analyses of conservation status and to assess the effects of species extinction on ecosystem services. In this study, we used long-term surveys to assess the influence of habitat change, landscape alteration and invasive species on extinction risk of the native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. We reviewed the existing literature to assess which ecosystem services are threatened by local extinction of A. pallipes and replacement with alien crayfish. We sampled 196 streams and wetlands in northern Italy. Of these, 117 received multiple surveys over a 13-year period (2004-2017), thus allowing accurate measurement of extinction rate. Thirty-four percent of A. pallipes populations underwent extinction between 2004 and 2017. The occurrence of alien crayfish in the catchment basin and urban growth in the landscape surrounding streams were associated with A. pallipes extinction. The probability of persistence was significantly higher in populations close to stream springs and with physical barriers (especially waterfalls) separating them from basins with alien crayfish. Extinction of native crayfish alters community structure and impairs regulating services such as detrital breakdown and pest regulation. Replacement by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius limosus) also threatens supporting and regulating services by altering nutrient cycling, food webs, sediments and erosion. The implementation of management practices that control river connectivity using selective barriers is needed to prevent further local extinction of native species. Integrating information on extinction with knowledge of impacts on ecosystem services is essential in developing more effective conservation policies.

AB  - In the literature on how urbanization affects agricultural landscapes, little attention has been focused on differentiating and comparing the changes in irrigated agricultural landscapes to non-irrigated agricultural landscapes. Additionally, there have been few applications of landscape metrics for understanding agricultural landscape changes. The objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze and compare the changes of both irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural lands in a rapidly growing region; (2) identify the spatial patterns and hotspots of these changes; and, (3) examine the spatial relationships between changes in agricultural landscapes and urban development. We adopted landscape metrics and gradient analysis to assess where and how agricultural landscape changes occurred in northern Utah over the past 30 years. A revised urban gradient was also developed to detect the changes of agricultural landscapes in relation to new urban development. We found that irrigated agricultural lands were more affected by urban development than non-irrigated agricultural lands, with evidence of more patches, more irregular patch shapes, and less connectivity among patches. This study contributes not only to the existing literature on the dynamics of both irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural lands in relation to urban development, but also helps fill the gap of scant applications of landscape metrics and urban gradient analysis in agricultural areas. Most importantly, such a comprehensive examination of Utah's agricultural landscapes will serve as part of the scientific foundation for informing land use policy in the region, as well as provide lessons for other places that are facing similar agricultural land conversion challenges.

AB  - Blackening and odorization of heavily polluted rivers has become a vital aquatic environmental problem in developing countries and has threatened river ecosystems. Monitoring the contamination and functional degradation conditions is important for bioremediation of river ecosystems. In this study, the diversity, composition, co-occurrence pattern, and function of bacterial communities collected from a heavily polluted urban river sediment were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis. The degree of pollution in the river was divided into three levels, and the clustering result based on the relative abundance of bacterial communities was consistent with the pollution levels in the river. The community assembly analysis further demonstrated that bacterial community assembly was mainly driven by environmental selection (95.84%) in Jinchuan River. Composition of bacterial communities were clearly different at different pollution level sites, although no apparent changes in alpha diversity were observed. The complexity of the bacterial co-occurrence network decreased with aggravation of the pollution level, as indicated by topological features, suggesting that the interactions among bacterial communities were weakened. A phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States analysis predicted that the relative abundance of functional genes was negatively correlated with pollution levels, and those related to energy metabolism as well as xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism decreased significantly. These results provide an ecological reference for monitoring and bioremediation of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The ecological network can be considered in different ways: as a strictly interrelated system of habitats, as parks and protected areas network, as a multi-purpose ecosystemic scenario, as a sequence of natural, rural and open landscapes. Nevertheless, all the interpretations of natural landscapes not always have been considered in the lexicon of urban and regional planning, relegating natural and rural areas to an "inessential" role (and generically defining them as "in state of pre-urbanisation").
   This contribution reflects about the ecological meaning of landscape, and therefore about its primary ecosystemic role, introducing a review proposal of the current programs and planning paradigms, highlighting its importance in the economic, entrepreneurial and policy debates in Europe. The main objective is promote new clear and specific local planning regulations, direct to the project of new ecological corridors with a more and useful consideration of the binominal value "landscape-biodiversity", and in general of the "natural-rural-urban" correlation, as an essential condition for defining a new vision of sustainable urban and regional development.

AB  - ContextAlthough the edge effect is known to be an important factor influencing the recruitment of trees in temperate forests, little is known of its synergistic relationships with landscape and fragment attributes.ObjectivesWe investigated how the edge effect on regeneration of oaks (Quercus spp.) varies with respect to fragment geometry, connectivity and landscape composition.MethodsWe recorded oak sapling density along edge-interior gradients in 29 forest fragments at the periphery of Mexico City and examined the data with Generalized Additive Models.ResultsA nonlinear and landscape-mediated edge effect was supported by data, including the interactions of the edge distance with patch connectivity, shape and size. Saplings were more abundant at a distance of ca. 50m from the edge of small, large and connected patches, but large patches also exhibited reduced recruitment towards the interior of the patch. Conversely, sapling density in simple-shaped or connected patches was lower at the edge, exhibiting linear and concave-down increase trends towards the interior of patches, respectively.ConclusionsBoundary conditions could be interacting with interior forest conditions, making regeneration more frequent at 50m from the edge. Shady and cooler sites in large patches may be inhibiting oak regeneration. The activity of acorn-dispersing animals and oak predators may increase in unconnected patches, thus increasing the likelihood of edge effects. These results provide insights into the restoration of temperate forest patches in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes.

AB  - The longstanding emphasis on community and public health benefits provided by urban greenways has been joined by growing interests in their environmental and ecological values and benefits, including their role as urban habitat and their ability to enhance connectivity across urban landscapes. Here we examine how environmental, ecological, and societal values were integrated into greenway planning documents from 29 major cities throughout the southeastern United States. Utilizing a qualitative assessment rubric to score the degree to which different greenway functions were integrated into each planning document, we identified specific design objectives and goals as well as broader, more descriptive content about greenways and their benefits. While all of the greenway plans touched on a diverse suite of benefits, those functions associated with community development were integrated into specific planning targets far more frequently and in much greater detail, with functions such as improving recreational opportunities, physical health of users, and local economic development specifically mentioned in more 90 percent of all plans. In contrast, an average of 44 percent of the rubric's biodiversity functions were present in the greenway planning documents. Further, while plans often cited potential greenway benefits, they less commonly discussed how intended greenway services would be achieved or methods that would be used to quantify success through long term monitoring and assessments, particularly of species populations. This disparity in the presence and quality of functions in greenway plans illustrates the challenges inherent in managing the needs of both humans and the natural world.

AB  - Changing environmental conditions, including those caused by human activities, reshape biological communities through both loss of native species and establishment of non-native species in the altered habitats. Dynamic interactions with the abiotic environment impact both immigration and initial establishment of non-native species into these altered habitats. The repeated emergence of disease systems in urban areas worldwide highlights the importance of understanding how dynamic migratory processes affect the current and future distribution and abundance of pathogens in urban environments. In this study, we examine the pattern of invasion of Trypanosoma cruzi-the causative agent of human Chagas disease-in the city of Arequipa, Peru. Phylogenetic analyses of 136 T. cruzi isolates from Arequipa and other South American locations suggest that only one T. cruzi lineage established a population in Arequipa as all T. cruzi isolated from vectors in Arequipa form a recent monophyletic group within the broader South American phylogeny. We discuss several hypotheses that may explain the limited number of established T. cruzi lineages despite multiple introductions of the parasite.

AB  - While the national discourse on 'eco-civilization' drives conceptual thinking on sustainable urban development in China, in practice a systematic implementation gap appears to exist when it comes to local implementation. This paper examines how the leakage occurring in the trajectory from central government ideas to municipal and district level construction projects can be explained. More specifically, it aims to spot whether it is merely the result of mismatches resulting from ineffective interactions among players in the policy process, institutional misalignment between policy goals and policy instruments, or even if the mobilization of bias in the policy process is systematic enough to justify a neo-Marxist explanation of the abovementioned implementation gap. I found two main sources of structural bias: capital accumulation in the mechanisms for urban development and power accumulation in the mechanisms underlying the administrative process.

AB  - Coral reefs are in decline worldwide. In response to this habitat loss, there are efforts to grow, outplant, and restore corals in many regions. The physical oceanographic habitat of corals-such as sea temperature, waves, ocean currents, and available light-is spatially heterogeneous. We therefore hypothesize that outplant location may affect microbiomes, and ultimately, coral health and restoration success. We evaluated the influence of the physical oceanographic habitat on microbes in wild Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea. Tissue samples were collected at four Florida reefs in March, June, and September of 2015. We estimated oceanographic conditions from moored instruments, diver observations, remote sensing data, and numerical models. We analyzed microbiomes using amplicon 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing data. We found microbial alpha-diversity negatively correlated with in situ sea temperature (which represented both the annual cycle and upwelling), as well as modeled alongshore currents, in situ sea-level, and modeled tide. Microbial beta-diversity correlated positively with significant wave height and alongshore currents from models, remotely-sensed relative turbidity, and in situ temperature. We found that archaea from the order Marine Group II decrease with increases in significant wave height, suggesting that this taxon may be influenced by waves. Also, during times of high wave activity, the relative abundance of bacteria from the order Flavobacteriales increases, which may be due to resuspension and cross-shelf transport of sediments. We also found that bacteria from the order SAR86 increase in relative abundance with increased temperature, which suggests that this taxon may play a role in the coral microbiome during periods of higher temperature. Overall, we find that physical oceanographic variability correlates with the structure of these coral microbiomes in ways that could be significant to coral health.

AB  - In the following article, a method of modeling urban environment exposed to road noise pollution for the purpose of noise nuisance assessment has been proposed. In order to accomplish it, GIS technology has been applied to divide the area under study into hexagonal fields. The presented case shows an area of urban environment exposed to noise pollution by means of object feature mapping, in each of the adopted elements. An acoustic and non-acoustic analysis of spatial distribution of the researched object features with the application of the adopted assessment indicators has been conducted. In particular, as assessment indicators, the following have been used: landscape entropy (H), L-Aeq (noise_sr), Simpson's diversity index (SIDI), area and length of transportation network (R-a, R-l), buildings (GSI) and number of stories (FSI), predominance of land cover (LIPI), equality of class distribution (SIEI), and geodiversity index (G(d)). The statistical analysis of the validity of the aforementioned indices has also been carried out. For the purpose of noise annoyance assessment modeling, the application of statistically relevant assessment indicators has been proposed with the special use of the neural network method.

AB  - Physically and socially heterogeneous mountain landscapes support high biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services. But rapid landscape transformation from fast urbanisation and agricultural intensification around cities to abandonment and depopulation in higher and more remote districts, raises urgent environmental and planning issues. For anticipating their future in a highly uncertain socio-economic context, we engaged stakeholders of a dynamic urban region of the French Alps in an exemplary interactive participatory scenario planning (PSP) for co-creating salient, credible and legitimate scenarios. Stakeholders helped researchers adapt, downscale and spatialize four normative visions from the regional government, co-producing four storylines of trend versus break-away futures. Stakeholder input, combined with planning documents and analyses of recent dynamics, enabled parameterisation of high-resolution models of urban expansion, agriculture and forest dynamics. With similar storylines in spite of stakeholders insisting on different governance arrangements, both trend scenarios met current local and European planning objectives of containing urban expansion and limiting loss and fragmentation of agricultural land. Both break-away scenarios induced considerable conversion from agriculture to forest, but with highly distinctive patterns. Under a commonly investigated, deregulated liberal economic context, encroachment was random and patchy across valleys and mountains. A novel reinforced nature protection scenario affecting primarily mountain and hilly areas fostered deliberate consolidation of forested areas and connectivity. This transdisciplinary approach demonstrated the potential of combining downscaled normative scenarios with local, spatially-precise dynamics informed by stakeholders for local appropriation of top-down visions, and for supporting land planning and subsequent assessment of ecosystem service trade-offs.

AB  - Artificial light at night is a pervasive anthropogenic stressor for biodiversity. Many fast-flying insectivorous bat species feed on insects that are attracted to light-emitting ultraviolet radiation (10-400 nm). Several countries are currently focused on replacing mercury vapour lamps, which emit ultraviolet light, with more cost-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which emit less ultraviolet radiation. This reduction in ultraviolet light may cause declines in insect densities in cities, predatory fast-flying bats, and some edge-foraging and slow-flying bats. Capitalising on a scheme to update streetlights from high ultraviolet mercury vapour to low ultraviolet LED in Sydney, Australia, we measured the activity of individual bat species, the activity of different functional groups and the bat and insect communities, before and after the change in technology. We also surveyed sites with already LED lights, sites with mercury vapour lights and unlit bushland remnants. Species adapted to foraging in cluttered vegetation, and some edge-space foraging species, were more active in unlit bushland sites than in all lit sites and decreased in activity at lit sites after the change to LED lights. The change to LED streetlights caused a decrease in the fast-flying Chalinolobus gouldii but not Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis, the latter being more influenced by seasonal and environmental variables. Insect biomass was not affected by changing light types, but instead was negatively correlated with the moon's percentage illuminance. Changing streetlights to LEDs could result in a decline in some insectivorous bats in cities. This study confirms that unlit urban bushland remnants are important refuges for high bat diversity, particularly for more clutter-adapted species and some edge-space foraging species. Preventing light penetration into unlit bushland patches and corridors remains essential to protect the urban bat community.

AB  - Social media provides big data for researchers to perform real-time analytics, as digital ethnographers, on what places and attributes people value in the historic urban landscapes they live or visit, enough to share with their social network. However, the use of these data to further our knowledge on heritage and their values, or to support heritage planning and management is still very limited. This article proposes a methodology for the analysis of viewpoints location-view scenes-tags data for photos posted on Flickr to provide insights into all facets of the perceived landscape character that identifies people-centered heritage at the city level. The analysis visualizes convergence and divergence between locals' and tourists' preferences. It also reveals heritage concerns in the context of daily-life practices and everyday landscape, as well as political and religious concerns in post-conflict areas. Additionally, the analysis questions the limits of heritage areas and categories used for identifying cultural values. Results showed that the different analyses complement one another to eventually provide insights into everyday encounters with the historic urban landscape. They also show the difference between experts' and users' documentation and characterization languages when defining heritage. When the first apply domain-specific classification models, the latter express personal reflections without following a specific hierarchy or a closed categorical system. It is believed that the outcome can help heritage scholars to further our understanding for the diversity of heritage places and attributes, as well as, heritage professionals, to inform decision-making processes in heritage planning and management on both experts' and users' understanding of heritage.

AB  - Urbanization leads to the occupation of green areas, directly contributing to a high level of fragmentation of urban green spaces, which, in turn, results in numerous socioeconomic and environmental problems. Consequently, an understanding of the relationships between patterns of urban green spaces and urbanization processes is essential. Although previous quantitative studies have examined this relationship, they have not included an exploration of spatial heterogeneities in the effects of urbanization on the spatial patterns of urban green areas. We therefore applied a spatiotemporal perspective to examine the above relationship, while considering the wider planning context. First, we quantified the extent of fragmentation of urban green spaces using landscape metrics comprising the largest patch index (LPI) and landscape shape index (LSI). Next, using the calculated spatial metrics and nighttime light data (NTL) for central Beijing for the period 1992-2016, we applied a geographically weighted regression model to assess variations in the spatiotemporal effects of urbanization on the fragmentation of urban green spaces. The results showed that urbanization initially occurred mainly in the northern parts of Beijing, whereas urbanization of southern urban fringe areas occurred after 2008. The reduction in green spaces along with increasing fragmentation and complex spatial patterns are indicative of issues relating to Beijing's rapid urbanization and planning policies. This study contributes to an understanding of how urbanization influences fragmentation of urban green spaces and offers insights for the planning of urban green spaces from the perspective of promoting sustainability.

AB  - Habitat complexity conferred by vegetation characteristics mediates key processes that govern the assemblage of insect communities. Thus, species within the community should only persist if their functional traits are well-matched to the conditions of their environment. Here, we compared ant assemblages between habitats in terms of species richness and functional-trait distribution at the species and the assemblage level. Ants were collected from 36 sites representing different degrees of habitat complexity mediated by standing vegetation. We found fewer ant species in simpler habitats, supporting the "habitat-heterogeneity" hypothesis. We measured key functional traits of ants that reflect their foraging and dispersal strategies, such as body size, femur length, antenna scape length, and head length / width. Interactions of species traits with measured habitat complexity variables were assessed at the species and the assemblage level using a fourth-corner approach. Ant traits were closely related to environmental complexity. In wooded habitats, ants were larger and had broader heads, while ants with longer antenna scapes prevailed in habitats with a dense herb / grass layer. Our study suggests that vegetation structural complexity can act as an environmental filter, driving ant assemblages in terms of both species numbers and functional traits. Our results can be used to predict turnover patterns in ant assemblages due to changes in management practices.

AB  - Examining the movement of apex predators is difficult in urban environments due to private land ownership; however, understanding their movement is critical given the current and rapidly increasing rate of urbanization globally. Of equal importance is the understanding of what landscape factors allow these movements to occur. We used the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), an urban apex predator in Melbourne, Australia, as a case study to understand their movement ecology in urban environments.
   Owl movement was recorded using automated GPS logging devices deployed on ten powerful owls, resulting in 10870 GPS locations. In combination with these positions, four environmental covariates, and a priori understanding of owl ecology were used to assign movements to three different states (prey handling/eating, foraging and transitory) based on step length and turning angles between sequential locations in a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the environmental covariate combination of time of night, Euclidean distance to riparian vegetation, and NDVI best described movement states. Owl movement states changed across the night. Shorter movements with many turns were made towards the beginning of the night in riparian areas with high NDVI. This behavior is most likely linked to prey handling, suggesting powerful owls are more likely to hunt early in the evenings and as such travel short distances while carrying large prey items. Transitory movements with limited changes in turning angles were the dominant movement state towards the end of the night. As owls leave areas of high NDVI, they quickly travel long distances across cleared land and impervious surfaces to connect to the next habitat patch where they then transition back into shorter step lengths where NDVI is higher.
   This research highlights the critical importance of riparian vegetation and high NDVI areas in driving powerful owl movement and foraging in urban landscapes. Conservation priority should be placed on retaining and restoring riparian corridors as areas not only for powerful owls and their prey, but also for many other species that utilize similar resources.

AB  - Protists are ubiquitous components of terrestrial and aquatic environments, as well as animal and human microbiomes. Despite this, little is known about protists in urban environments. The similar to 7400-mile sewer system of New York City (NYC) collects human waste from similar to 8 million human inhabitants as well as from animals, street runoff, and groundwater, providing an ideal system to study these microbes. We used 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile raw sewage microbial communities. Raw sewage samples were collected over a 12-month period from 14 treatment plants of the five NYC boroughs, and compared with samples from other environments including soil, stormwater, and sediment. Sewage contained a diverse protist community dominated by free-living clades, and communities were highly differentiated across environments. Seasonal differences in protist composition were observed; however, network analysis and functional profiling demonstrated that sewage communities were robust and functionally consistent. Protists typically associated with human and animal guts or feces were frequently detected. Abundance of these parasites varied significantly both spatially and temporally, suggesting that spikes could reflect trends in the source population. This underscores sewage as a valuable model system for monitoring patterns in urban microbes and provides a baseline protist metagenome of NYC.

AB  - Hedgerows and riparian buffers in agricultural landscapes can help increase landscape multifunctionality and thereby mitigate conflicts among agricultural production and environmental stewardship objectives. However, the relative merits of conserving versus increasing non-production perennial vegetation (NPPV) are not well understood despite the universal conflicts among such objectives in rapidly urbanizing and intensifying agricultural regions worldwide. Hence, using the most intensive agricultural region of British Columbia, Canada as a case study, we aimed to (i) evaluate the current status of NPPV in terms of carbon stocks and landscape connectivity metrics (ii) compare options for conservation relative to agricultural expansion in terms of maintenance of landscape multifunctionality (iii) identify management options for NPPV that could maximize ecological benefits using a normative scenario analysis. We determined that 83% of the NPPV found on the farmland in our study area is likely susceptible to conversion to expanding agricultural production or urban development. Scenario analysis showed planting hedgerows along all farm parcel boundaries and riparian buffers along all farmscape waterways will not compensate for the loss of multifunctionality from agricultural intensification based on expansion. Conserving or planting hedgerows alone however resulted in a disproportionate increase in connectivity given the relative loss of productive agricultural land. This analysis clearly highlights the potential trade-offs among the indicators evaluated as well as the benefits of intensification on land already in production. In the assessed landscape, protecting existing large patches of NPPV and augmenting the landscape pattern with hedgerows is an effective approach to conflicting objectives and ensuring landscape multifunctionality.

AB  - Predicted increases in the human population, in a context of climatic change and limiting freshwater resources, have raised awareness of the need to preserve aquatic ecosystems, their functions, and the biodiversity they harbor. The ecological reconciliation approach proposes the long-term co-existence of biodiversity preservation and the development of human activities. We investigated the ecological and evolutionary contributions of irrigation and hydroelectric canals in the highly fragmented and regulated Durance River (Rhone basin, Southern France), to the genetic diversity patterns of two interbreeding cyprinid species, the native Parachondrostoma toxostoma, and the introduced Chondrostoma nasus species. We observed a high degree of genetic homogeneity along the length of the river. The maintenance of gene flow despite the presence of dams, and the detection of admixed populations and hybridization events in canals suggest that these canals may act as ecological corridors and hybrid zones with the potential to influence genetic resources for the native and introduced species. These anthropogenic structures vary considerably in terms of their spatial organization, size, and overall management, increasing habitat diversity in the urbanized section of river. Together with the restoration of natural habitats, canals can be considered as important structures for biodiversity dynamic in such urban conditions.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that specialist insect herbivores are more likely to locate and colonize host plants growing in relatively sparse or pure stands compared to host plants growing amongst diverse non-host vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the apparency and accessibility of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in small polyculture gardens would boost their colonization by the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic native species of conservation concern. We established replicated gardens containing the identical mix of milkweeds, flowering nectar sources, and non-host ornamental grasses but arranged in three different spatial configurations that were monitored for monarch colonization over two successive growing seasons. Monarch eggs and larvae were 2.5-4 times more abundant in gardens having milkweeds evenly spaced in a 1m corridor around the perimeter, surrounding the nectar plants and grasses, than in gardens in which milkweeds were surrounded by or intermixed with the other plants. Predator populations were similar in all garden designs. In a corollary open-field experiment, female monarchs laid significantly more eggs on milkweed plants that were fully accessible than on milkweeds surrounded by non-host grasses of equal height. In addition, we monitored monarch usage of 22 citizen-planted gardens containing milkweed and nectar plants in relation to their botanical composition, layout, and surrounding hardscape. Multivariate analysis explained 71% of the variation, with significantly more eggs and larvae found in gardens having milkweeds spatially isolated as opposed to closely intermixed with non-host plants, and in gardens having 100m north/south access unimpeded by structures. Numerous programs encourage citizens to establish gardens with milkweed and nectar plants to help offset habitat loss across the monarch's breeding range. Our findings suggest guidelines for garden design that can help make the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration more rewarding for participants, and of greater potential value to monarch recovery.

AB  - Understanding the local ecology of urban Norway rats (Rattus norevgicus) is necessary to inform effective rat mitigation strategies. While Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) methods can be used to acquire such ecological information (e.g., abundance, movement patterns, and habitat use), these techniques assume that all individuals of the study population are equally trappable. To test whether urban rats adhere to this assumption, we conducted a 4-week CMR study in an urban neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, to evaluate whether rat characteristics (i.e., age, sex, size, wound status, and infection with the pathogen Leptospira spp.) were associated with trappability. We found that the majority of rats entered traps in the first 2 weeks of trapping, and that larger rats were caught earlier in the trapping period. However, smaller, sexually immature rats were recaught more often than were larger, sexually mature rats, suggesting that prior capture affects the ability to recapture urban Norway rats. This highlights the need for CMR studies to account for size, sexual maturity, and prior capture when interpreting data.

AB  - Corridors are intended to increase species survival by abating landscape fragmentation resulting from the conversion of natural habitats into human-dominated matrices. Conservation scientists often rely on 1 type of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current-flow model, to construct a linkage design, and their choice is not usually based on theory or empirical evidence. We developed a method to empirically confirm whether corridors produced by these 2 models are used by target species under current landscape conditions. We applied this method in the Gamba landscape between 2 national parks in southwestern Gabon. We collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and 2 apes, western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), on transects. We used patch-occupancy models to identify least-cost and current-flow corridors for these 4 species. On average, 28.7% of current-flow corridors overlapped with least-cost corridors, confirming that the choice of corridor model can affect the location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors by monitoring signs and examining camera detections on new transects within and outside modeled corridors. Current-flow corridors performed better than least-cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors for the 3 taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3% of their combined surface was common among 2 species. We used centrality metrics to calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize corridors. As a result, we recommend protecting at least 17.4% of the land surface area around Gamba town to preserve the preferred travel routes of the target species.

AB  - Social media and online communication have changed the way citizens engage in all aspects of lives from shopping and education, to how communities are planned and developed. It is no longer one-way or two- way communication. Instead, via networked all-to-all communication channels, our citizens engage on urban issues in a complex and more connected way than ever before. So government needs new ways to listen to its citizens. The paper comprises three components. Firstly, we build on the growing discussions in the literature focused on smart cities, on one hand, and social media research, on the other, to capture the diversity of citizen voices and better inform decision-making. Secondly, with the support of the Australian Federal Government and in collaboration with the local government partners, we collect citizen voices from Twitter on selected urban projects. Thirdly, we present preliminary findings in terms of quantity and quality of publicly available online data representing citizen concerns on the urban matters. By analyzing the sentiments of the citizen voices captured online, clustering them into topic areas, and then reevaluating citizen's sentiments within each cluster, we elaborate the scope and value of technologically-enabled opportunities in terms of enabling participatory local government decision making processes.

AB  - We investigate the relation between large negative house price co-movements in the cross-section of US cities and the national business cycle. The occurrences of large negative house price co-movements across cities cluster over time and these clusters are closely linked to NBER recession dates. A simple co-movement measure that aggregates large negative city-level house price returns reliably predicts future recession periods. Weighting cities according to population or GDP when constructing the negative co-movement variable yields the largest forecasting power, indicating that larger cities that contribute more to the national GDP are more influential in terms of correctly signalling future recessions. Moreover, large negative house price co-movements contribute above and beyond traditional recession predictors, suggesting an important role for city-level housing information as an early warning indicator.

AB  - Aims We investigated whether biotic homogenization of plant communities occurs over three decades in a small urban protected forest, and what the possible drivers are underlying the observed changes. Location A 96 ha temperate forest, Montreal, Canada. Methods We surveyed vegetation and explanatory variables (ecological conditions, disturbances, spatial structure) in 62 plant communities in 1980 and 2011. We collected plant attributes to identify functional groups (FGs). We evaluated changes in beta diversity using tests for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions. We used space-time interaction models to assess changes in FGs spatial structures. We used multivariate analyses to identify relationship between spatial patterns and explanatory variables, and variation partitioning analyses to identify the drivers involved in beta diversity changes. Results Beta diversity declined only in the herb-shrub communities. About 35% of their FGs had significantly changed their spatial distribution over time. Those that contracted their distribution were mainly composed of plants with wind-dispersed seeds or with low to intermediate vegetative propagation capabilities, while those that expanded were plants with fleshy fruits or extensive vegetative propagation capabilities. In 1980, communities were structured into small isolated clumps, while in 2011, clumps expanded and coalesced near disturbed areas. In 1980, the spatial assembly processes relied essentially on endogenous factors while in 2011 exogenous factors, such as disturbances, became more influential. Multivariate analyses suggested that edge effect, past agricultural disturbances, and beaver activities facilitated the decrease of beta diversity (homogenization process). Conclusions The homogenization of herb-shrub communities likely resulted from changes in their clumped spatial structure. FGs with the most adapted attributes to disperse under urban forest conditions were those that expanded spatially. Structural changes seem to have begun with an unpredictable stage governed by dispersal limitation processes, followed by a predictable stage mostly driven by land-use legacy and disturbances.

AB  - The study of the arthropod parasite community of wild and peridomestic fauna in the urban-rural-natural interphase is of public health importance, because these communities may serve as the link between possible zoonotic pathogens in the arthropod parasites and humans. This is the case of the grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and peridomestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in central Mexico. Because of freedom of movement of the dogs between the urbanized and natural environments, the possibility exists of the interchange of species of parasites between the two canids. The present study was done in central Mexico, where nine grey foxes and 21 peridomestic dogs were inspected for arthropod parasites. In total, 339 ectoparasites were found, including seven species of Siphonatera from three families and six genera (324 individuals), as well as 15 tick species of the family Ixodidae. Both canids had similar total species richness, with six ectoparasite species, but the structure of the community was different. The dominant species in both canids was Pulex simulans, suggesting that this species may play a role as a vector of important zoonotic diseases. The differences found between the two ectoparasitic communities indicates that despite the shared use of the habitat by both species, fleas were more common and had greater richness in the grey fox which indirectly reflects differences by the two canids in the use the habitats.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species that has spread globally and can transmit several arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The species was first reported in Brazil in 1986 and since then has been found in 24 of the 27 Brazilian states, often in peri-urban environments close to highly urbanized areas. To date, population genetics of this important mosquito in areas in the city of Sao Paulo has not been investigated. In this study, we used 12 microsatellite loci to investigate the microgeographic population genetics of Ae. albopictus, which is present throughout the city of Sao Paulo. All the analyses revealed structuring of the populations studied, divided into two groups with restricted gene flow between them and without evidence of isolation by distance. We propose two hypotheses to explain the results: (i) low dispersal capability-limited gene flow between populations is due to the low dispersal capability inherent to Ae. albopictus; and (ii) multiple introductions-the structure identified here results from multiple introductions, which led to different dispersal patterns within the city and more genetic heterogeneity.

AB  - The emerging threat to the coastal urban ecosystems from increased intensity and frequency of weather events is a compelling reason for improving our understanding of the integrity of the existing ecosystem. Resilience of an ecosystem is a critical property that aids recovery and adaptation when subject to intense stress. Quantifying the resilience of an ecological system requires a detailed understanding of the vulnerabilities and interactions within a complex web of interconnected social, technological and economic networks. Through an ecological network analysis of ascendency and redundancy of the flux of energy and material flows, the causal relationships are established through structural equations modeling (SEM) techniques. A model based-on the five factors of driving force (D), pressure (P), state (S), impact (I), and response (R) (DPSIR), recognizes the different roles these factors play in the coastal urban ecological security system of China. Energy and material flows transmission equations of the ecological security network are developed to evaluate the resilience of the ecological security network. The results show that the ecological security network of Chinese coastal cities has a relatively high network occupation rate (A/C = 0.6898), indicating a relatively mature state of the ecological security network of coastal cities with sufficient metabolic capacity and steady status. The low vacancy rate (R/C = 0.3102) shows that the coastal ecological security network lacks flexibility of surplus space. The energy and material flows conversion and dissipation ability in the network are strong: the live factors of DPSIR are highly interdependent, and the ecological security network framework is both steady and mature. However, the resilience of the coastal urban ecosystem against external impacts is weak. It is critical for coastal cities to broaden their planning protocols to introduce more flexible space to increase resilience and guarantee a robust pathway for sustainable development This study contributes to a rational method for testing the internal causal relationships among DPSIR linkages toward quantifying our understanding of the resilience of a security ecosystem.

AB  - Urbanisation has contributed to significant biodiversity loss, yet, urban areas can facilitate biodiversity conservation. For instance, there is evidence of urban trees supporting natural establishments of orchids, the most species-rich plant family on Earth. However, the germination nicheswhich include both suitable biophysical conditions and orchid mycorrhizal fungus/fungi (OMF)are not sufficiently known for most species, especially tropical epiphytic orchids. The fate of their dispersed seeds is poorly understood as well. We conducted fungal baiting and seed sowing experiments, next-generation sequencing, generalised linear models, and seed viability tests to detect and identify potential OMF, investigate biophysical factors that influenced OMF availability and orchid germination, and assess seed longevity. Ceratobasidiaceae- and Serendipitaceae-associated OMF were successfully detected in three of four orchid species. In general, orchid species and humus presence had significant effects on OMF availability. Orchid species and temperature were predictive of germination. Post-experiment viability tests revealed that one orchid species, Grammatophyllum speciosum Blume, may produce long-lived seeds. The results suggest that urban trees can support OMF and orchid germination, but both processes are limited by biophysical factors. This study also indicates the possibility of seed persistence among epiphytic species. As orchid germination niches are complex and tend to be unique to individual species, we do not encourage generalisations. In contrast, species-specific information can help formulate useful recommendations towards conservation.

AB  - Two of the dominant processes shaping today's European cities are the ageing and diversification of the population. Given that the range of action usually decreases in later life, the living environment around the place of residence plays an important role in the social integration of the older generation. Hence, spatial patterns of residence indicate the extent of opportunities for the older population to engage in urban life and, therefore, need to be addressed by urban planning and policy. The aim of this article is to study the interrelation between diversity in later life-in terms of migrant history, gender, social class, and age-as well as planned and actual (past) movements of elders. We have chosen Berlin as a case study and draw from a quantitative survey with elders (age 60+) from diverse backgrounds (N = 427). Our results from descriptive analysis and statistical hypothesis tests show that age impacts people's past and planned movement; we observe a peak in the decisions to move at the age of 65-75 and a drop in the inclination to move among people over 80. None of the other factors is similarly influential, but we observe appreciable tendencies regarding the impact of gender and social class on planned movements. Our study suggests that variables other than classic socio-demographic data, such as apartment size, rent, social networks, and health, and their interrelations may offer a promising starting point for achieving a full picture of older people's movement behaviour.

AB  - The rate of dam building has declined in the United States, but dam building is still considered an integral part of water supply management, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Understanding how dams affect river connectivity is a key component of river basin management. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of fragmentation in the Guadalupe-San Antonio River System (GSARS) and how these patterns were related to dam size, age, and purpose. Using a shapefile of registered dams and the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution (NHD-HR) as input data for the Barrier Assessment Tool (BAT), six successive connectivity models were created. The average length of functional river networks (FRNs) decreased over time but the number of FRNs over 100km stayed relatively stable. Fragmentation in the GSARS was concentrated around urban centers, and the majority of fragmentation occurred gradually as dams separated small FRNs along tributaries and headwaters. This gradual decline in longitudinal connectivity was punctuated by sporadically large separations of river networks by particular dams based on their location and time of commissioning. The methodology presented here provides a way to analyze both the extent and the temporal evolution of fragmentation in a river system.

AB  - River ports represent a special type of urbanized area. They are considered to be an important driver of biological invasion and biotic homogenization on a global scale, but it remains unclear how and to what degree they serve as a pool of alien species. Data for 54 river ports (16 German, 20 Czech, 7 Hungarian, 3 Slovak, and 8 Austrian ports) on two important Central European waterways (the Elbe-Vltava and Danube waterways) were collected over 40 years. In total, 1056 plant species were found. Of these, 433 were alien, representing 41% of the total number of species found in all the studied Elbe, Vltava, and Danube ports. During comparison of floristic data from literary sources significant differences in the percentage of alien species in ports (50%) and cities (38%) were found. The number of alien species was closely related to port size, but the proportion of alien species expressed as a percentage of the total number of species did not depend significantly on port area. The proportion of alien species in both studied waterways decreased with distance from the sea and was highest in the Hungarian ports and lowest in the Czech Republic, Austria and Bavaria. Lower levels of shipping towards inland regions due to decreased river flow are likely the reason for this trend. The dissimilarity in the species composition of alien and native flora between individual river ports increased with increasing inter-port distance. Neophytes presented a stronger distance decay pattern than did either native species or archaeophytes of the Danube inland ports, potentially due to the different cargoes of individual ports, which may affect the introduction of different neophytes from different geographic areas. The results show that river ports in Central Europe should be regarded as a type of industrial area and deserve full attention with regard to the distribution and spread of alien plants.

AB  - Land cover change monitoring in rapidly urbanizing environments based on spaceborne remotely sensed data and measurable indicators is essential for quantifying and evaluating the spatial patterns of urban landscape change dynamics and for sustainable urban ecosystems management. The objectives of the study are to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of urbanization patterns of Kigali, Rwanda over the last three decades (from 1984 to 2016) using multi-temporal Landsat data and to assess the associated environmental impact using landscape metrics and ecosystem services. Visible and infrared bands of Landsat images were combined with derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) variance texture and digital elevation model (DEM) data for pixel-based classification using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Seven land cover classes were derived with an overall accuracy exceeding 87% with Kappa coefficients around 0.8. As most prominent changes, cropland was reduced considerably in favour of built-up areas that increased from 2.13 km(2) to 100.17 km(2) between 1984 and 2016. During those 32 years, landscape fragmentation could be observed, especially for forest and cropland. The landscape configuration indices demonstrate that in general the land cover pattern remained stable for cropland, but that it was highly changed for built-up areas. Ecosystem services considered include regulating, provisioning and support services. Estimated changes in ecosystem services amount to a loss of 69 million US dollars (USD) as a result of cropland degradation in favour of urban areas and in a gain of 52.5 million USD within urban areas. Multi-temporal remote sensing is found as a cost-effective method for analysis and quantification of urbanization and its effects using landscape metrics and ecosystem services.

AB  - Explanations of how organisms might adapt to urban environments have mostly focused on divergent natural selection and adaptive plasticity. However, differential habitat choice has been suggested as an alternative. Here, we test for habitat choice in enhancing crypsis in ground-perching grasshoppers colonizing an urbanized environment, composed of a mosaic of four distinctly coloured substrates (asphalt roads and adjacent pavements). Additionally, we determine its relative importance compared to presentday natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. We found that grasshoppers are very mobile, but nevertheless approximately match the colour of their local substrate. By manipulating grasshopper colour, we confirm that grasshoppers increase the usage of those urban substrates that resemble their own colours. This selective movement actively improves crypsis. Colour divergence between grasshoppers on different substrates is not or hardly owing to present-day natural selection, because observed mortality rates are too low to counteract random substrate use. Additional experiments also show negligible contributions from plasticity in colour. Our results confirm that matching habitat choice can be an important driver of adaptation to urban environments. In general, studies should more fully incorporate that individuals are not only selective targets (i.e. selected on by the environment), but also selective agents (i.e. selecting their own environments).

AB  - Genetic diversity is the basis of the evolutionary potential of species to respond to environmental changes. However, restricting the movement of species can result in populations becoming less connected which can reduce gene flow and can subsequently result in a loss of genetic diversity. Urban expansion can lead to the fragmentation of habitats which affects the ability of species to move freely between areas. In this study, the genetic diversity of the African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis) in Gauteng (South Africa) was assessed using non-invasive sampling techniques. DNA was extracted from spraint (faecal) samples collected along nine rivers and genotyped using 10 microsatellites to assess population structure and genetic diversity. Samples were grouped based on locality and by catchment to determine whether isolated subpopulations exist. Genetic diversity of A. capensis in Gauteng was found to be low (mean observed heterozygosity (Ho)=0.309). Analysis of genetic structure provides support for the otter populations being panmictic with high gene flow between populations from different rivers. Results from the study indicate that the movement of A. capensis is not affected by physical barriers in urbanised areas. However, because the genetic diversity of the species in the study area is low, these animals may not be able to cope with future environmental changes.
   Significance:
   Genetic structure analysis of the sampled Gauteng otter population indicates the population is panmictic; however, a low level of genetic diversity in this population has also been identified and may affect how the population copes with future environmental changes.
   Physical restrictions in urbanised areas do not appear to be affecting movement of the species.

AB  - Managers are moving toward implementing large-scale coastal ecosystem restoration projects, however, many fail to achieve desired outcomes. Among the key reasons for this is the lack of integration with a whole-of-catchment approach, the scale of the project (temporal, spatial), the requirement for on-going costs for maintenance, the lack of clear objectives, a focus on threats rather than services/values, funding cycles, engagement or change in stakeholders, and prioritization of project sites. Here we critically assess the outcomes of activities in three coastal wetland complexes positioned along the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon, Australia, that have been subjected to restoration investment over a number of decades. Each floodplain has been modified by intensive agricultural production, heavy industry and mining infrastructure, urban/peri urban expansion, aquaculture development and infrastructure expansion. Most development has occurred in low-lying coastal floodplains, resulting in major hydrological modifications to the landscape. This has left the floodplain wetlands in a degraded and hydrologically modified state, with poor water quality (hypoxic, eutrophication, sedimentation, and persistent turbidity), loss of habitat, and disconnected because of flow hydraulic barriers, excessive aquatic plant growth, or establishment of invasive species. Successful GBR wetland ecosystem restoration and management first requires an understanding of what constitutes "success" and must be underpinned by an understanding of complex cause and effect pathways, with a focus on management of services and values. This approach should recognize that these wetlands are still assets in a modified landscape. Suitable, long term, scientific knowledge is necessary to provide government and private companies with the confidence and comfort that their investment delivers dividend (environmental) returns.

TI  - Immigration Policy - A New Field of Activity for Cities?

KW  - MIGRATION
KW  - POLITICS
AB  - The regulation of migration has mostly been regarded as a core task of the nation-state, which has the right to control its territorial borders and issue entry visas and citizenships. In the field of urban research, cities and municipalities are therefore regarded as largely dependent on state "migration regimes". This special issue examines the central question of whether there is also a "local turn" in the field of immigration policy. The cities of Europe are dependent on immigration in order to stabilise their population figures; without immigration they would shrink. In most cases, urban policy is growth- and competition-oriented. Nevertheless, most cities have not yet developed explicit immigration strategies. Wherever this does occur, it is for the most part socially highly selective: many urban development concepts merely articulate the desire for the immigration of young and qualified workers. Many cities still rely on the influx of the "creative class" when competing with other municipalities. The immigration of refugees and asylum seekers, on the other hand, is often seen as a burden by the municipalities and is delegated to integration policy. Due to the dispersal of refugees and asylum seekers by the German state, cities have very little room for manoeuvre in terms of controlling the influx of these immigrant groups. Against this background, this conceptual introductory article examines two key questions: (i) Which migration policy options do cities have and how are they theorised? (ii) Which proactive strategies can cities develop for the purpose of targeted recruitment of immigrants?

AB  - Microcrustaceans have a series of adaptations that allow their development in temporary aquatic environments. The colonization and consequent structuring of the communities in these systems is influenced by several environmental and spatial factors. Among them, urbanization is one of the important structuring factors of these communities. Metacommunity theory is an important tool for assessing how local (e.g. environment, competition and predation) and regional/spatial (e.g. dispersion) factors can influence the structure of communities distributed in patches in an area. We evaluated the diversity of the metacommunity of microcrustaceans in two categories of urban aquatic environments, preserved and constructed, looking for how the environmental and spatial factors influenced their diversity. We also sought to verify which beta diversity mechanism explained the dissimilarity between communities. We hypothesized that the richness of taxa would be greater in aquatic environments of preserved areas and in constructed areas there would be a loss of species, thus generating a beta diversity explained by the nestedness pattern. We sampled temporary environments in an urban area, eight in a preserved and six in a construction area. The results showed a clear difference between the two areas, both in environmental characteristics and in the composition of taxa. In relation to the richness of taxa, the areas did not present significant differences, thus rejecting our first hypothesis. The beta diversity was explained mainly by the turnover mechanism, refuting our second hypothesis. This pattern was mainly explained by the difference in the composition of taxa between the preserved and construction area environments.

AB  - Based on compiled small mammal trapping data collected over 12 years from Benin and Niger (3701 individual records from 66 sampling sites), located in mainland Africa, we here describe the small mammal community assemblage in urban habitats along the commercial axis connecting the two countries, from the seaport of Cotonou to the Sahelian hinterland, with a particular focus on invasive species. In doing so, we document extant species distributions, which highlight the risks of continuing the range expansion of three synanthropic invasive rodent species, namely black rats (Rattus rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), and house mice (Mus musculus). Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal. Patterns of segregation are also observed between native Mastomys natalensis and invasive rats R. rattus and R. norvegicus, suggesting potential native-to-invasive species turn over. Consequences of such processes, especially in terms of public health, are discussed.

AB  - The UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BRs) comprise core conservation areas supported by a buffer and transition zone of sustainable development. This zoning can help manage urbanisation around conservation areas. Although it is UNESCO policy to measure the number of BRs that have interactions with urban areas, there has been no systematic assessment of urban biospheres since 2008. This research addresses this deficit by measuring the extent of urbanisation of all designated BRs within the European Union (EU). Using the Copernicus Urban Atlas, the proximity of BRs to Functional Urban Areas (FUA) was determined. The results show that 46% (76/167) of BRs are situated within FUAs, including 11% (18/167) entirely within an FUA. The majority (64%) of EU-28 countries have BRs within FUAs. Urban influences on EU-28 BRs are extensive, as 90% are found within 50 km of an FUA. However, integration with urban areas may be lacking as 14% of EU BRs were adjacent to an FUA. Urban pressures are acute for 11% of EU BRs which had multiple FUAs within a 50 km radius. Therefore, urbanisation of BRs is a widespread challenge and recommendations are provided for BRs to function as an information sharing network and develop a new urban strategy.

AB  - The design and optimization of urban form has always been a hot topic in urban planning and development research. Besides, the creation of continuous vitality in urban areas is of critical importance in the development of urbanization. However, due to the lack of data, it is difficult to measure the effects of urban form on neighborhood vibrancy. Additionally, no uniform conclusion has been drawn regarding to what degree urban form can contribute to neighborhood vibrancy. Taking advantage of emerging new data sources, the depth and breadth of related research can now be improved. Therefore, this paper uses high-precision positioning social media check-in data to approximate the vibrancy of 658 neighborhoods, and uses a geographical information system (GIS) to quantitatively measure the urban form indicators in the central area of Chengdu City, China. A quantitative exploration and analysis of the relationships between neighborhood vibrancy and urban form is conducted. The results of three regression models considering different explanatory variables show that socio-economic factors account for approximately 23% of neighborhood vibrancy. In addition, the correlation between the shape characteristics of a neighborhood and the vibrancy is weak. However, when the inner urban form indicators of neighborhoods are introduced into the regression model, the goodness of fit (R-2) is nearly doubled. This finding indicates that strong associations exist between urban form and neighborhood vibrancy. Specifically, building density and functional diversity are positively correlated with neighborhood vibrancy. Unlike existing studies, this study finds that the road network within the neighborhood plays a positive role in the creation of neighborhood vibrancy. However, the impact of a road density indicator is not as powerful as the impacts of building density and functional diversity. This research can help urban designers to better design urban environments.

AB  - Freshwater floodplains are dynamic, diverse ecosystems that represent important transition zones between terrestrial, riparian, subsurface and aquatic habitats. Given their historic importance in human development, floodplains have been exposed to a variety of pressures, which in combination have been instrumental in driving changes within these ecosystems. Here, we present an evidence-based framework to explore direct and indirect effects of pressures and stressors on floodplain ecosystems and test this structure within the urban landscape. Evidence was obtained from peer-reviewed scientific literature, focusing on effects of key pressures and stressors on receptors, including species composition (e.g., species presence-absence, diversity) and ecosystem function (e.g., biomass, decomposition). The strength of direct and indirect effects of individual and multiple stressors on biological receptors was quantified using two separate analyses: an evidence-weighted analysis and a quantitative network meta-analysis using data extracted from 131 studies. Results demonstrate the power of adopting a systematic framework to advance quantitative assessment of floodplain ecosystems affected by multiple stressors. While direct pathways were generally stronger and provided the core network skeleton, there were many more significant indirect pathways indicating evidence gaps in our mechanistic understanding of these processes. Indeed, the importance of indirect pathways (e.g. increase in impervious surface -> increase in the accumulation rate of sediment nutrients) suggests that embracing complexity in network meta-analysis is a necessary step in revealing a more complete snapshot of the network. Results from the weight-of-evidence approach generally mirrored the direct pathway structure and demonstrated the strength of incorporating study quality alongside data sufficiency. Networks illustrated novel disturbance pathways (e.g., decrease in habitat structure -> decrease in structure and function of aquatic and riparian assemblages) that can be used for hypothesis generation for future scientific enquiries. Our results highlight the broader applicability of adopting the proposed framework for assessing complex environments, such as floodplains. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, the number of IoT devices amounts up to billions and from a diversity of applications domains challenging architectural designs in terms of interoperability, scalability, supported services and functionality, etc. We believe that this can be addressed by a transit from current semi-autonomic properties present in IoT systems to full autonomic ones. In this paper we propose new architectural and functional blocks to the IoT model to enable the autonomic behavior. We focus on the Self-Star* autonomic property of self-configuration. This property is key in IoT systems management because of the scale and diversity involved. We propose a self-management algorithm in the IoT domain of urban agriculture based on Utility Theory. Simulation results show that this approach is suitable for such IoT application domain in which low algorithmic complexity is desired given the limitations of low cost and processing capacity.

AB  - The urban heat island effect, where urban areas exhibit higher temperatures than less-developed suburban and natural habitats, occurs in cities across the globe and is well understood from a physical perspective and at broad spatial scales. However, very little is known about how thermal variation caused by urbanization influences the ability of organisms to live in cities. Ectotherms are sensitive to environmental changes that affect thermal conditions, and therefore, increased urban temperatures may pose significant challenges to thermoregulation and alter temperature-dependent activity. To evaluate whether these changes to the thermal environment affect the persistence and dispersal of ectothermic species in urban areas, we studied two species of Anolis lizards (Anolis cristatellus and Anolis sagrei) introduced to Miami-Dade County, FL, USA, where they occur in both urban and natural habitats. We calculated canopy openness and measured operative temperature (T-e), which estimates the distribution of body temperatures in a non-thermoregulating population, in four urban and four natural sites. We also captured lizards throughout the day and recorded their internal body temperature (T-b). We found that urban areas had more open canopies and higher T-e compared to natural habitats. Laboratory trials showed that A. cristatellus preferred lower temperatures than A. sagrei. Urban sites currently occupied by each species appear to lower thermoregulatory costs for both species, but only A. sagreihad field T-b that were more often within their preferred temperature range in urban habitats compared to natural areas. Furthermore, based on available T-e within each species' preferred temperature range, urban sites with only A. sagrei appear less suitable for A. cristatellus, whereas natural sites with only A. cristatellus are less suitable for A. sagrei. These results highlight how the thermal properties of urban areas contribute to patterns of persistence and dispersal, particularly relevant for studying species invasions worldwide.

AB  - Urbanization decreases the abundance of native species, which may enable exotics to experience enemy release in urban areas, enhancing their invasive capacity. The invasive autogamous orchid, Spathoglottis plicata, acquires some biotic resistance in Puerto Rico from a native orchid weevil specialist, Stethobaris polita. The distribution of S. polita along an urbanization gradient may affect the distribution of S. plicata and its future spread. To determine the effect of land cover on both species and the impact of S. polita on the spread of S. plicata, we modeled the distribution of the interaction between the two species and additionally assessed weevil abundance and the damage they do in different land cover types and localities. Land cover was the most important predictor of distribution for both species. S. plicata occurs in forests, pastures, and urban areas; however, S. polita is largely absent from urban areas, including urban forests, and along rivers within wet forests. This distribution likely reflects the dispersal ability of S. plicata, in addition to potential human intervention, and the inability of S. polita to penetrate or become established within the urban matrix. Thus, within the invasive range of S. plicata in Puerto Rico, geographical heterogeneity in acquired interactions is expected to result in higher seed production within areas of enemy release. The orchid is likely to spread more rapidly in urban forests, as well as along forest rivers, where S. polita is sparse.

AB  - Widespread species that exhibit both high gene flow and the capacity to occupy heterogeneous environments make excellent models for examining local selection processes along environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the influence of temperature and landscape variables on genetic connectivity and signatures of local adaptation in Phaulacridium vittatum, a widespread agricultural pest grasshopper, endemic to Australia. With sampling across a 900-km latitudinal gradient, we genotyped 185 P. vittatum from 19 sites at 11,408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using ddRAD sequencing. Despite high gene flow across sites (pairwise F-ST = 0.0003-0.08), landscape genetic resistance modelling identified a positive nonlinear effect of mean annual temperature on genetic connectivity. Urban areas and water bodies had a greater influence on genetic distance among sites than pasture, agricultural areas and forest. Together, F-ST outlier tests and environmental association analysis (EAA) detected 242 unique SNPs under putative selection, with the highest numbers associated with latitude, mean annual temperature and body size. A combination of landscape genetic connectivity analysis together with EAA identified mean annual temperature as a key driver of both neutral gene flow and environmental selection processes. Gene annotation of putatively adaptive SNPs matched with gene functions for olfaction, metabolic detoxification and ultraviolet light shielding. Our results imply that this widespread agricultural pest has the potential to spread and adapt under shifting temperature regimes and land cover change.

AB  - Native bushland fragmented by urbanization often experiences increased cover of flammable weeds, reduced biomass turnover and an absence of fuel management combined with increased ignitions. Depending on species' mobility and dispersal traits, and the extent of burns within urban remnants, such fires may reduce individual survival rates or limit natural recolonization. We monitored the survival of mygalomorph spiders for a year following high-intensity and low-intensity fires in Banksia woodland remnants in urban Perth. Of the 257 burrows found, 115 spiders were confirmed to initially survive after intense wildfire, but none were confirmed alive after 12months. In sharp contrast, only one spider from 103 observed burrows was confirmed dead after a low-intensity prescribed fire. As there were instances of our monitored mygalomorphs relocating a short distance following only low intensity fires, we also tested whether predation rates were higher in burnt than unburnt areas. Higher rates of predation were found in burnt areas, but this was strongly influenced by both site and predator type. We recommend further consideration of low-intensity prescribed fire as well as alternative fuel management approaches in urban remnants to better conserve mygalomorph spider populations and other taxa with limited dispersal and/or mobility capabilities.

AB  - The construction of an ecological security pattern (ESP) is one of the basic methods to protect regional ecological security and enhance people's well-being. In the case of Anhui province, located in the Yangtze River Delta region of China, regional ecological sources were assessed and recognized in terms of ecosystem services, and regional ESP was then constructed based on circuit theory. Current density was applied to analyze the significance of patches and corridors and recognize sticking points, and thereby strategies were introduced to optimize regional ESP. Results of ecosystem services function assessment showed that there were 47 ecological patches, 107 ecological corridors, 16 pinch points, and six sticking points in the ESP of Anhui province. The watershed of the Yangtze and Huai rivers divides the ESP of the northern and southern Anhui, which has huge landscape spatial heterogeneity. Areas with relatively good ecological resources were basically located between Dabie Mountain area in the west and the low hilly area in the south of Anhui, with mostly woodland and farmland as ecological sources. However, cities in the northern Anhui, also in the north of the watershed of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, face severe situations in terms of environmental protection. This study conducted spatial analyses on ESP with different thresholds and proposed to classify different ESPs according to ecological control. This helps to alleviate the contradiction between economic development and environmental protection, and improve the supply capacity of regional ecosystem services, in order to satisfy the regional demand for ecosystem services. Meanwhile, this study offers more methods to construct regional ESP and introduces targeted measures to improve connectivity, which is of practical guidance for the connectivity and optimization of ecological patterns.

AB  - The vineyards are a very important study crop in the Mediterranean landscape used as a model in scenarios of global change due to a strong dependence of their production on the landscape, climate and types of management. In this research we have evaluated the influence of landscape, altitude and type of management on mammals diversity and seed dispersal. Twenty five vineyard farms were sampled (tempranillo variety, 9 in organic and 16 in non-or-ganic management) during 4 months, between April and July in Andalusia, Spain. In each farm, the presence of mammals was estimated by searching for traces (tracks and excrements) in 12 transects of 20m x 12m per farm. The excrements founded were later desegregate to quantify and identify the dispersed seeds present in them. We found 230 excrements that belonged on 10 different mammal species (fox, badger, rabbit, hare, deer, goat, sheep, wild boar, beech marten and micromamiferous) and 4 taxonomic groups (artiodactyls, carnivores, lagomorphs and micromammals). Feces had a total of 258 seeds, including 67 different morphotypes. The results shown that the diversity of mammals (species and groups) are mainly related to the matrix and other characteristics of the landscape surrounding the farm. Likewise, seed dispersal is also influenced by the management (with more morphotypes of seeds found in organic crops), the taxonomic group of the seed disperser mammal, the landscape matrix and other variables related to the landscape as distance to the nearest point of water, or secondary or primary roads, urban settlements or natural areas.

AB  - Urban areas with residential yards (= domestic gardens) provide a diverse environmental mosaic characterized by high plant architectural and species diversity and variation in yard management practices among residents. For small, slow-moving taxa such as land snails, this mosaic provides an unplanned experiment to document dispersal patterns and conditions influencing this pattern. The snail Cornu aspersum is a Mediterranean-native that was likely introduced into a Norman, Oklahoma (USA) yard through the plant trade. Cornu spread across 16 residential yards (and up to 110 m) in a single block over a period of at least 6 years, moving in a diffusive dispersal pattern. Supplemental water (e.g., watered plant beds and ponds) combined with nearby shelters contributed to increased local density but may also result in targeted snail control. Although roads contributed to the species arrival, roads were barriers to short-term snail self-dispersal and the limited road crossing may have been human-mediated (e.g., snails carried on potted plants). Dispersal was limited across non-residential properties with expansive grass lawns and parking lots. Residential areas provide a good model system for examining factors associated with the spread of non-native species, especially for species having low mobility.

AB  - The congestion of urban car traffic creates many problems at once to the residents of metropolises, from emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere to annually increasing mortality in road traffic accidents. Recent achievements in the field of artificial intelligence and the organization of the movement of autonomous vehicles today allow us to create concepts that may become ubiquitous in the near future. In this paper, the authors consider the possibilities for creating an intelligent transport infrastructure within the concept of a smart city using cyber-physical systems. The aspects of information security in the use of cyber-physical systems are considered, approaches to solving problems of intersection management are discussed. Intersections in cities loaded with traffic can be compared with bottlenecks - the trajectory of many vehicles overlap and congestion occurs. To increase the capacity of urban streets, the authors presented a model of the system that regulates the movement of vehicles at the intersection. To assess the feasibility of using the developed model, the authors developed a software simulator of two connected urban intersections. For comparison, a simulator of the intersections, regulated by a traffic lights, was also developed. The results of the experiments allow us to say that the developed model is more efficient than the traffic light in the framework of this study.

AB  - In times of increasing weather extremes and expanding vulnerable cities, a significant risk to civilian security is posed by heavy rainfall induced flash floods. In contrast to river floods, pluvial flash floods can occur anytime, anywhere and vary enormously due to both terrain and climate factors. Current early warning systems (EWS) are based largely on measuring rainfall intensity or monitoring water levels, whereby the real danger due to urban torrential floods is just as insufficiently considered as the vulnerability of the physical infrastructure. For this reason, this article presents a concept for a risk-based EWS as one integral component of a multi-functional pluvial flood information system (MPFIS). Taking both the pluvial flood hazard as well as the damage potential into account, the EWS identifies the urban areas particularly affected by a forecasted heavy rainfall event and issues object-precise warnings in real-time. Further, the MPFIS performs a georeferenced documentation of occurred events as well as a systematic risk analysis, which at the same time forms the foundation of the proposed EWS. Based on a case study in the German city of Aachen and the event of 29 May 2018, the operation principle of the integrated information system is illustrated.

AB  - The groupers abundance was studied in sixteen stations representing four sites along the Gulf of Aqaba. Sixteen species belonging to five genera of groupers were recorded across the four sites. The mean abundance of all groupers species in Ras Mohamed NP and Sharm El Sheikh City were found to be higher than that of Nabq and Abu Galum MRPA. The highest abundance of groupers were recorded in Ras Nasrani (76 SE +/- 2.08) and Ras Um Sid (71 SE +/- 2.0). There was no significant difference of groupers abundance between depths of 5 m and 15m in all of the studied sites. Based on their ecological behavior, groupers were divided into separate groups, and abundance was investigated for each group. Abundance of the cryptic and roving groupers was higher than that of the large mobile groupers, in all of the studied sites. While cryptic and roving grouper included both abundance and rare species, large mobile groupers species were all rare. The pattern of occurrence for the three different groups was repeated in all sites, except for Abu Galum MRPA where no large mobile grouper was recorded, probably due to over fishing. Diversity of groupers in all of the studied sites increased with the increase of abundance.

AB  - Natural habitat fragmentation in and isolation of protected areas (PM) are two ancillary but common threats that may have serious consequences to biodiversity conservation in the long term. They were assessed in four PA networks of diverse legal and managerial regimes across a highly biodiverse country, Spain, between 1987 and 2006, a period of intense development in the country: Nature Reserves (NRs), Nature Parks (NPs), Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs). 'Contagion edge proportion' was used to assess inner PA fragmentation by artificial land uses-land covers (LULCs), whereas two PA isolation indicators were compared: (a) increased proportion of artificial LULCs in the 500 m-buffers surrounding each protected polygon (PP); and (b) shortest distance to the nearest PA in 2006. In those 19 years, fragmentation increased in all PA networks except in Nature Reserves (NRs), which likely reflects high conservation effectiveness of stringent legislation. Isolation by artificial LULCs also increased in that period for all PA categories. NPs were the PA category with the highest values of fragmentation and isolation by 2006. Nevertheless, fragmentation and isolation values were still low on average by 2006 for all PA categories, although fine-scale fragmentation and isolation could not be assessed. Both PA isolation indicators yielded different results and were thus complementary. 'Distance to major cities' was the most strongly correlated variable with both pressures, which suggests that greater attention should be paid to such pressures to peri-urban PM by territorial planners.

AB  - During the expansion of urban areas, small natural reserves have often been left intact within the built environment as central elements of biodiversity conservation, ecological connectivity, landscape sustainability, and quality of life of urban dwellers. Consequently, the surrounding urbanized landscape may impact the environmental conditions of these reserves (e.g., high temperatures, low moisture conditions), resulting in the need for extensive maintenance. This study presents an estimation of the water balance over two years (2017-2018) in three small urban reserves (between 2 and 30 ha) within the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia, for the purpose of understanding tree water use. Measurements of micrometeorological variables, soil moisture content profiles, water-table levels, sap flow velocities, and stem diameter variations were used to quantify the water sources of tree transpiration in these reserves. Results revealed that, despite the urban surroundings and the climate variations, these reserves have enough water to sustain tree transpiration. In two of the three reserves, groundwater was pivotal in sustaining transpiration rates; specifically, groundwater was estimated to contribute about 30-40% of the total transpiration amount during the driest periods of the year. Groundwater also played an essential role during nights with temperatures above 25 degrees C, helping trees to maintain night-time water use from 3 to 16% of the daily water use. In the third reserve, the presence of a shallow layer of heavy clay supplied water to the trees, which were able to maintain relatively constant transpiration rates throughout the year. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the water regime of each urban reserve in order to support government authorities in preserving these ecosystems.

AB  - The beginnings of the Cittaslow movement date back to 1998 Italian towns became a model for other European towns, and subsequently for others, around the world. This is how an international movement came into being, founded on the idea of improvement of the quality of life of residents, savouring "slow", healthy lifestyle, drawing on the tradition and history and respecting the natural and cultural environment of small towns. Green areas play a huge role in creating the image of Cittaslow towns. They constitute the so-called "green urban corridors" or " green spots" and have cultural, educational and social significance, including recreation and spa functions. They are not only a complement to architecture, but can play a superior role in the structure of cities. The aim of the work is to analyze the state of parks, squares and green areas management in the Cittaslow towns in region of Warmia and Mazury (Poland). There are 20 environmentally, spatially, economically and demographically diverse towns in the region of Warmia and Mazury that acceded to the association. The international network includes towns with a population under 50 thousand. An analysis of the source materials involved gathering and interpretation of information obtained from monographic and cartographic documentation, both current and archival, from websites of Cittaslow towns and mentions in the media. Apart from a monographic study, the authors carried out a landscape and spatial analysis, pre-project studies and made original designs for selected urban parks and greens in Cittaslow towns. All the Cittaslow towns in the Province of Warmia and Mazury under analysis have high potential in terms of using greenery areas with the social and cultural function. Parks and squares are perfect places for integration of communities and for conducting educational and cultural activities. However, diversity regarding land development and programme offer is observed (utility programme). In some towns, greenery areas cover only space with planned (not always in accordance with the art of gardening) plant compositions. However, parks and squares should be planned not only with their visual aspect in mind, but emphasis should be placed on their utility side (active use). Therefore, the article points to the directions of development of new places, as well the possibility of adding socio-cultural functions to existing greenery areas.

AB  - Intense transformation and conflicts between different land use types has occurred in the past decades and will still exist in the coming decades in China. Ascertaining the quantity and pattern optimization of urban ecological land is critical to guaranteeing urban ecological security and realizing urban sustainable development. In this study, Nanjing, a very famous city in the Yangtze River Delta in China, was selected as the case study to explore the land use changes from 1995 to 2017 and calculate the suitable amount of ecological land to meet the needs of its socioeconomic development. From 1995 to 2015, the proportion of ecological land in Nanjing dropped from 84.41% to 59.15%. Based on the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM), we designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal quantity and pattern of ecological land in Nanjing. By comparing the current land use status with the model simulation results, we proposed the suitable ecological land area for Nanjing should be no less than 3963km(2), which is 56% of the total area of Nanjing. The land use strategies and the measures to protect ecological land in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other highly urbanized regions in China.

AB  - The shaping of green areas with varying degrees of arrangement and different forms of use, as well as of their structure in the form of a system within cities, are tasks that are aimed at, among other goals, the protection of the environment and nature, the integration of urban structure and the improvement of the quality of life. In modern cities, which develop in a multi-central manner, it is often impossible to develop model systems of green areas featured in literature, such as the belt, wedge, radiant or ring type. Currently these are most often mixed systems, to which terms like open, irregular and distributed are most often referred to. What is important is the continuous layout of areas of greenery, an appropriate access range and a hierarchical structure of use, ranging from the housing estate parks, that are the closest to our homes, to regional parks.
   The article discusses the example of Krakow - a historical city, the second-largest in Poland. Krakow occupies a prominent position among cities that are both beautiful and picturesque, which have outstanding spatial qualities and a genius loci. The placement of the city in the Vistula River Valley, a diverse topographic layout, in addition to varied land cover all constitute its unique natural and landscape values. Conceptual designs and the implementation of plans of the shaping of areas of the greenery of Krakow have been compared with model solutions.
   The contemporary spatial structure of Krakow's areas of greenery has been shaped by natural conditions and the development of its urban structure. A particular role in this process has been played by: the campaign to embellish Krakow, when many streets were given the character of avenues, the founding of urban plantations in the place of former fortifications and the Trzech Wieszczy Avenues upon the embankment of the circumvallation rail and the the Planty Dietla park in place of the river bed of the Old Vistula. A key role was also played by the successive spatial development plans, starting in 1910, as well as concepts of the development of greenery and municipal policies. The most well-known model scheme of a wedge and ring system of areas of Greenery for Krakow was developed by A. Ptaszycka and J. Bogdanowski (the 1950's). It was based on the hydrographic system and the rocade roads of the Krakow Fortress. This concept, ideal in its expression, was not transferred onto spatial development plans, with the following factors being responsible: the territorial expansion of the city, its contemporary multi-centrality and changing geometric shape. In 1996, a greenery system was developed featuring so-called river parks, based on the hydrographic system (wedge model). A conceptual design was developed in 2017, showing the contemporary network of green areas in Krakow with the greatest level of detail. An integrating model was proposed - a mixed network model with legible wedges in the form of river parks and compact afforestation. The author participated in the development of the last two concepts.

AB  - The Western Hercules beetle (Dynastes grantii) is endemic to the highland forest habitats of southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The habitats harbor many endemic species, but are being threatened by rapid climate change and urban development. In this study, the genetic structure of D. grantii populations from southwestern United States was investigated. Specifically, genomic data from double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing libraries were utilized to test whether geographically distant populations from the Mogollon Rim (Arizona [N = 12 individuals] and New Mexico [N = 10 individuals]) are genetically structured. The study also estimated the effective population size of the Mogollon Rim populations based on genetic diversity. The results indicated that the 2 geographic populations from the Mogollon Rim were not genetically structured. A population size reduction was detected since the end of the last glacial period, which coincided with a reduction of forest habitat in the study area. The results implied that the connectivity and the size of highland forest habitats in the Mogollon Rim could have been the major factors shaping the population genetic structure and demographic history of D. grantii. The Western Hercules beetle could be a useful flagship species for local natural history education and to promote the conservation of highland forest habitats.

AB  - Tactical Urbanism is a growing movement across the world in which individuals, communities, and municipalities are improving their cities by using short-term, low-cost, and small-scale interventions and policies to catalyze long term change. The aim of this paper is to test the principles and the approach of tactical urbanism to solve Guangzhou's local public spaces problems by showcasing two tactical urbanism projects which have been completed in the Guangzhou urban context. These two cases reveal the opportunities that bottom-up approaches like tactical urbanism can build a bridge to conjunct with long term planning efforts and complete the top-down mechanisms. In the Zhusigang community case, we examine the spontaneously unplanned practices in the local community, which resemble "Tactical urbanism" principles, and their spatial appropriation and utilization of marginalised community spaces. We assess how and where daily activities are happening and what other amenities could be provide by temporarily introducing these activities into a local gallery space. In the former textile factory case, we present examples that make the case for temporary, flexible and experimental responses to urban vacant land, then conclude by outlining the potential benefits and drawbacks of this temporary use model.
   This paper explores the existing practices of appropriation and the potential of temporary occupation in the city and concludes with thoughts on how tactical urbanism, an international movement, might gain a foothold in the context of local Chinese communities.

AB  - Well-connected urban areas defined by different types of urban flow define the boundaries reflecting the relatedness of places in terms of their functionality. Yet, attempts to define cities and their communities based on aggregated data normally neglect the inherent differences between different groups of people. Based on the disaggregated flow data, this study detects community structures in the London Metropolitan Area perceived by different occupations by using the multi-level modularity optimisation algorithm. The results show the difference between our perceptions of different functional regions across occupations. The higher managerial groups have a more global sense than the lesser managerial occupations who have more segmented and local perceptions regarding their functional regions. This is well illustrated by the shift of the documented modularity scores across groups. Although the transport network and various natural boundaries do play a part in the locational patterns of the derived communities, it is found that the relative self-containment of functional regions is interpreted differently by different occupations. This kind of representation is of great value in advancing our knowledge regarding how different places are perceived by different occupations with all the implications for future commuting that future planning for housing and employment will bring.

AB  - Wildfires occurring near and within cities are a potential threat to the population's life and health and can cause significant economic damage by destroying infrastructure and private property. Due to the relatively small area of these wildlands, the accuracy of fire risk-assessment plays a significant role in fire management. Introducing the experience of real events can improve accuracy. But this approach is limited by a lack of knowledge of pre-fire conditions, mainly vegetation characteristics as related to their definition as a fuel parameter because of their high temporal variation. To solve this problem, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed to reconstruct the spectral characteristics of the vegetation just before the fire with spatial resolution 0.5-2 m from the Landsat image. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the approach has been examined on urban vegetation sites and applied to restore spectral information of the actual vegetation patch before it was burned in 2016 in Haifa, Israel. The results show that the reconstructed RGB image allows for mapping the location of green vegetation with high spatial accuracy. However, spectral data in the visible range have some limitations when it comes to identifying differences between soil and dry plants. The reconstructed image was used to sharp the original data from Landsat. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps were produced from the resulting high-resolution multispectral image. The output maps allow to determine the location of vegetation and estimate the level of its dryness on the urban wildland landscape. The proposed method aims to estimate vegetation dryness and, as a result, identify the fuel characteristics at the time of the fire. It has the potential of using for evaluation and improve the weights of the input parameters for the fire-risk assessment and fire-behavior modeling on a specific area.

AB  - Urbanisation exposes wildlife to new challenging conditions and environmental pressures. Some mammalian species have adapted to these novel environments, but it remains unclear which characteristics allow them to persist. To address this question, we identified 190 mammals regularly recorded in urban settlements worldwide, and used phylogenetic path analysis to test hypotheses regarding which behavioural, ecological and life history traits favour adaptation to urban environments for different mammalian groups. Our results show that all urban mammals produce larger litters; whereas other traits such as body size, behavioural plasticity and diet diversity were important for some but not all taxonomic groups. This variation highlights the idiosyncrasies of the urban adaptation process and likely reflects the diversity of ecological niches and roles mammals can play. Our study contributes towards a better understanding of mammal association to humans, which will ultimately allow the design of wildlife-friendly urban environments and contribute to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - The increasing development of urban infrastructure has led to the significant loss of natural wetlands and their ecosystem services. Many novel urban development projects currently attempt to incorporate environmental sustainability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and community engagement into the intricate challenges we all face in an era of climate change. This paper aims to communicate several key findings on design elements that can be adopted or incorporated in the design of created wetlands as infrastructural elements. Three major design elementsmicrotopography, hydrologic connectivity, and planting diversityare presented, and their relations to restoring ecosystem services of urban wetlands, in particular water and habitat quality, are discussed. These design elements can be easily adopted or incorporated in the planning, designing, and construction stages of urban development. The success of urban infrastructure projects may require both better communication among stakeholders and a great deal of community engagement. The Rain Project, a floating wetland project on an urban college campus, demonstrates the role of interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement as a model for sustainable stormwater management, a critical part of today's urban development. Further efforts should be made to advance the science of designing urban wetlands and its communication to transform cultural attitudes toward sustainable urban development.

AB  - Many areas on the earth are facing the threat of ecological degradation, and unreasonable economic development has further exacerbated environmental problems. Constructing ecological security patterns based on an ecological network is such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability. This paper selected Denko County of Bayannaoer City, Inner Mongolia, which is located in the desert oasis area, as the study area. Ecological sources were identified through ecosystem importance assessment, and interaction force theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources, and thus to identify ecological corridors and to constructing forest-grass ecological network (FG eco-network) of the study area. This paper also set 11 development scenarios to study the impact of different development strategies on the FG ecological network. Moreover, the complex network theory was used to analyze the topology and statistical characteristics of the FG eco-network in 11 development scenarios. The results show that the ecological network in the study area has been gradually destroyed with the increase of the proportion of economic development in the development scenario; the connection between some ecological patches has changed and the connectivity and coreness, PageRank, etc. have gradually decreased. The study found that the network density increases slightly in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, while it gradually decreases in other scenarios with the increase of the proportion of economic development. Moreover, in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, although the destruction occurred at the edge of the desert, the FG eco-network within the sample circle expanded. This represents that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment in this area. Under the existing natural conditions, the study area still has room for economic development, but space is limited. Based on the interaction force theory, this study provides a new approach to identifying the ecological network. Also, the development scenarios set up in this study can provide a reference for sustainable development.

AB  - This paper is based upon results from a doctoral research and expands the analyzing Protected Areas (AP) of the Island of Santa Catarina, in the city of Florianopolis. They have a diversity of landscapes, allowing for a vast array of habitats, but they also have the fragmentation rather than the connection among AP as a limitation, besides having issues related to management. The methodological procedures have been based on the mapping and characterization of the island's AP, with emphasis to the Conservation Units (CU). Maps of land coverage and use have been generated by using LANDSAT satellite images of the years 1986, 1995 e 2010. The analysis of the elements have identified the fragmentation of the habitats, where one can still find environmental corridors and possibilities of connection. As the final result of the research it has been possible to: diagnose the AP; understand that the urban area growth has been insulating the AP; and conclude that the AP have been discussed within territorial and urban planning of the city, but that there has not been integration between environmental management agencies at different levels.

AB  - The two-spot ladybird Adalia bipunctata (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a widely distributed generalist, feeding preferably on aphids. The species inhabits various environments, including anthropogenic landscape, where pollution and microclimate enables to attain very high numbers of favorite prey. Recently, the abundance of the two-spot ladybird has declined, mainly as an after-effect of invasion of the competing species - the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773). High phenotypic polymorph isms made the two-spot ladybird classic model for population genetic studies of Coccinellidea. However, studies investigating diversity of the species at DNA level have Coccinellidae been scarce. In our investigation we used microsatellite markers to characterize genetic diversity in the two-spot ladybird populations from different environments. We made an attempt to amplify 13 loci, identified previously in the genome of the species, however due to lack of amplification, monomorphisms and presence of the null alleles, the final set of six markers useful for analysis on a population level was obtained. Analyzing genotypes of 124 individuals, we confirmed high genetic diversity of the species, suggested previously by studies, applying allozymes and mitochondrial DNA. Also, microsatellites revealed weakly pronounced genetic structure in a large scale (localities separated by a distance of 500 kilometers). However, we found some indications (signs of the Wahlund effect) that gene flow could be disturbed among sites in diverse environments (rural, suburban and urban). Our data suggested that invasion of the harlequin ladybird has not yet affected populations of the two-spot in such extent to alter genetic diversity or genetic structure.

AB  - Coordinating ecosystem service supply and demand equilibrium and utilizing machine learning to dynamically construct an ecological security pattern (ESP) can help better understand the impact of urban development on ecological processes, which can be used as a theoretical reference in coupling economic growth and environmental protection. Here, the ESP of the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration was constructed, which made use of the Bayesian network model to dynamically identify the ecological sources. The ecological corridor and ecological strategy points were identified using the minimum cumulative resistance model and circuit theory. The ESP was constructed by combining seven ecological sources, "two horizontal and three vertical" ecological corridors, and 37 ecological strategy points. Our results found spatial decoupling between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES) and the degradation in areas with high demand for ES. The ecological sources and ecological corridors of the urban agglomeration were mainly situated in forestlands and water areas. The terrestrial ecological corridor was distributed along the outer periphery of the urban agglomeration, while the aquatic ecological corridor ran from north to south throughout the entire region. The ecological strategic points were mainly concentrated along the boundaries of the built-up area and the intersection between construction land and ecological land. Finally, the ecological sources were found primarily on existing ecological protection zones, which supports the usefulness of machine learning in predicting ecological sources and may provide new insights in developing urban ESP.

AB  - Human impact in newly urbanized deserts creates new environments that may favor the establishment/dominance of certain plant species. In this study, we showed how the human activities during desert urbanization do affect distribution, composition and diversity of plant species in a new urban ecosystem. In a field study during 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 growing seasons, we investigated these vegetation criteria in three new habitats created recently due to human manipulations in addition to the old habitat of such area (i.e. the desert). We also compared vegetation criteria comprising the floristic cover, composition and diversity between the desert locations inside and on the outskirts of the city. The detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) successfully separated the different habitats studied. Besides, the floristic composition and diversity were significantly varied amongst these habitats. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed an apparent correlation between floristic composition and soil criteria across the study area. For the desert vegetation, the cover values of both Tamarix nilotica and Zygophyllum coccineum, in addition to the whole diversity indices, were significantly suppressed in the desert fragments inside the newly constructed city in comparison with their cover in the desert adjacent to it. Moreover, the cover of both species was significantly declined in 2018 compared with their cover in 2015. On converse, the covering areas of Phragmites australis and Bassia indica were increased after intensive constructions in 2018. These results suggest that the human activities and, consequently, urbanization may influence plant life in newly urbanized desert ecosystems, leading to dispersal of new species and destruction of plant cover in some parts of the desert. Efforts and conservation strategies should be devoted to save the desert species that are vulnerable to elimination due to expansion of urbanization.

AB  - Gender- and sexually diverse youth are often represented in popular discourses through concepts of movement and mobility. Conceptual stories of LGBTQ youth transitions to adulthood in particular are marked by narratives of movement from regional (rural and/or small towns) to major urban areas. Although not wholly outside lived experience, a cultural myth that portrays the experience of gender- and sexually diverse young people entering into 'adulthood' via such mobility continues to circulate in scholarship, popular media, personal accounts of coming out, support resources and self-help guidance documents. This paper draws on a recent study of gender and sexual diversity, support and belonging to examine instances of LGBTQ youth mobility in relation to participant interviews and focus groups undertaken in an Australian project examining two generations of sexually diverse subjects' views on growing up, support and belonging. Participants differed generationally in how they experienced mobility from regional to urban settings, demonstrating that contemporary real-world accounts of such mobility are complex, nuanced and diverse and that the felt 'expectation' that one should migrate to a city in order to live a full gender- or sexually diverse life has waned among young people in the more recent generation.

AB  - The article analyzes the new model of urban land regularization adopted by brazilian Law 13.465/17, demonstrating the paradigmatic rupture occurred in relation to the previous paradigm enshrined in the City Statute. The passage from a model that prioritized the right to the city and the social function of the property to another that privileges the mere entitlement and the economic function of the land is unveiled from the comparative analysis of several legal devices. The research, carried out using the dialectical method, concludes that Brazil, with such a change in the land legal framework, is part of an international financialization movement of housing, imposing a defeat to the right to the city in the first country of the world that incorporate it in its legal-urban order.

AB  - Context Conservation planning increasingly needs to be effective in areas that are influenced by anthropogenic land uses, yet many planning tools do not give equal consideration to ecological, social, and economic objectives, nor do they enable identification or comparison of tradeoffs among objectives. We explore outcomes and tradeoffs for the proposed expansion of a US wildlife refuge in a region characterized by strong town character and high human population density, development, and property values.
   Objectives Our objectives were to: (1) determine whether acquisition targets could be achieved given competing objectives; (2) evaluate tradeoffs between social, economic, and ecological objectives; and (3) evaluate how landscape development influences tradeoffs.
   Methods We used genetic algorithms to generate and evaluate outcomes for refuge expansion that could systematically navigate multi-objective tradeoffs. Ecological objectives included maximizing total protected habitat, priority habitats, and connectivity between protected properties. Economic and social objectives included minimizing acquisition cost, loss of areas under high development pressure, and town character conflict.
   Results Land acquisition targets could be met, though not without economic and social tradeoffs. Positive outcomes for area protected and connectivity resulted in poor outcomes for the other four objectives. Win-win refuge expansion solutions were available for some objectives, but there were also consistent tradeoff relationships, which were exacerbated in areas with high development pressure.
   Conclusion This multi-objective approach allows decision makers to account for tradeoffs and hard choices between social-ecological objectives. Explicit consideration of multiple, competing objectives and their benefits, losses, and costs increases transparency and improves decision making.

AB  - During the last years Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has evolved as a research focus across Europe. UGI can be understood as a multifunctional network of different urban green spaces and elements contributing to urban benefits. Urban agriculture has gained increasing research interest in this context. While a strong focus has been made on functions and benefits of small scale activities, the question is still open, whether these findings can be up-scaled and transferred to the farmland scale. Furthermore, multifunctionality of urban and pert-urban agriculture is rarely being considered in the landscape context. This research aims to address these gaps and harnesses the question if agricultural landscapes - which in many European metropolitan regions provide significant spatial potential - can contribute to UGI as multifunctional green spaces. This work considers multifunctionality qualitatively based on stakeholder opinion, using a participatory research approach. This study provides new insights in pert-urban farmland potentials for UGI development, resulting into a strategy framework. Furthermore, it reflects on the role of the stakeholder involvement for multifunctionality planning'. It suggests that it helps to define meaningful bundles of intertwined functions that interact on different scales, helping to deal with non-linearity of multiple functions and to better manage them simultaneously.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to develop a method to evaluate and monitor environmental spatial order to delimit problem areas. The method was tested on the carefully chosen suburban areas as natural valuable areas located in suburban and peri-urban areas are particularly prone to intense and chaotic development. The number of methods of spatial order evaluation is scarce. The paper is an attempt to fill this gap. We have used following indicators: afforestation rate, landscape diversity level, density of the total road network, rate of compact development, as well as the building intensity. Indicators used in the method have been chosen based on the literature and modified to adjust it to the available data. Our findings confirm that the method gives reliable results. It can be used to evaluate the efficacy of Local Spatial Development Plans and Environmental Protection Plans. Moreover, we delimited areas in which environmental spatial order could be improved.

AB  - Critical scholarship on gentrification has contributed significantly to bolstering the rights of working-class residents against the forces that price them out of the city. However, working-class residents are not the only ones who suffer from dispossession and displacement with rampant hyper-commodification of urban space. Based on the case of Seoul, I examine how new agents-tenant shopkeepers-emerged at the forefront of challenging gentrification and successfully reframed the problem of gentrification. Within the new frame, the shopkeepers who make their livelihoods by using urban spaces are pitted against the property owners who attempt to profit at the expense of their tenants. Through this case, I ask 'How can radical shifts occur in the ways that the problem of gentrification is constructed?' My answer draws upon the framing theory in the social movement literature which identifies conditions under which a radical departure from institutionalized ways and social norms can transpire even when the radical shift means challenging the entrenched power structure-in my case, the property-ownership-based rights regime. I highlight the importance of further developing a gentrification scholarship on social change that unravels the rise of new locations of resistance, particularly at a time when the advance of gentrification seems inevitable.

AB  - GIS-based siting procedures are progressively used to select protected areas (PAs) on the basis of a variety of attributes clustered in main environmental groups including climate, hydrogeology, vegetation cover and various criteria and sub-criteria showing changes in the landscape. However, the suitability of a selecting procedure may be restrained by the aggregate analyses involving the weight and relative importance of the criteria. Here, we integrate a multi criteria decision analysis methodology with geographic information system for selecting a protected region for the vulnerable Kaiser's mountain newt, Neurergus kaiseri, endemic to southern Iran. The process of decision making for selection a PA for N. kaiseri structured in a two-stage. Mask maps are prepared using nine exclusionary criteria including stream density, high ridge density, areas with unsuitable terrestrial vegetation cover, unacceptable land use, harsh climate, inappropriate distance to cities and industries, main roads, railroad, and dam reservoirs. These exclusionary criteria provided an overlay map representing areas grossly suitable for allocating PAs. The initial site screening followed by a multi criteria decision analysis based on ten non-exclusionary criteria including conservation integrity, number of newt localities, MaxEnt suitability score, distance to nearest neighbor habitat, genetic diversity, spring density, distance to protected area, extent of selected patch areas, villages density and distance to main roads. Giving weight and rate to the non-exclusionary criteria all nominated PAs received a numerical evaluation. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of how ecological considerations can be integrated into campus strategic and statutory spatial planning. A process of developing ecological objectives and guidelines for inclusion in campus strategic and statutory spatial plans is presented.
   Design/methodology/approach This case study introduces a three-phase ecological assessment process developed and applied to the Technion - IIT campus. Ecological considerations are reviewed in multiple campus strategic and spatial plans (primarily in North America and Europe) and in institutional sustainability guidelines; biodiversity and ecosystem service surveys of the campus are conducted and considered with regard to planning; university administrative structures that enable the implementation of ecological planning guidelines are also assessed.
   Findings Ecological considerations (biodiversity conservation, habitat preservation and ecosystem integrity) play a relatively minor role in sustainability planning on university campuses. The concepts of connectivity and compactness are applied broadly, but generally refer to social and educational considerations. Physical planning provides an opportunity for integrating ecological priorities into the university's mission.
   Research limitations/implications Some of the insights may not be generalizable, so it is crucial to continue accumulating similar studies. It is crucial, too, to conduct follow-up research, reporting on the ecological outcomes of plan implementation.
   Practical implications Ecological stewardship is commensurate with the sustainability commitments of universities. Considering their spatial extent and diverse locations, universities can assume an important role in ecological conservation.
   Originality/value Relatively little attention has been given to ecological considerations (biodiversity, ecological integrity and ecosystem services) in campus plans and sustainability documents. This paper suggests how universities can move towards fulfilling a role as ecological stewards through strategic and spatial planning.

AB  - Bacterial communities in human-impacted rivers and streams are exposed to multiple anthropogenic contaminants, which can eventually lead to biodiversity loss and function. The Wonderfonteinspruit catchment area is impacted by operational and abandoned gold mines, farms, and formal and informal settlements. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to characterize bacterial communities in the lower Wonderfonteinspruit and their response to various contaminant sources. The results showed that composition and structure of bacterial communities differed significantly (P<0.05) between less (downstream) and more (upstream) polluted sites. The taxonomic and functional gene dissimilarities significantly correlated with each other, while downstream sites had more distinct functional genes. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria was higher at upstream sites, while Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia were prominent at downstream sites. In addition, upstream sites were rich in genera pathogenic and/or potentially pathogenic to humans. Multivariate and correlation analyses suggest that bacterial diversity was significantly (P<0.05) impacted by pH and heavy metals (cobalt, arsenic, chromium, nickel and uranium). A significant fraction (similar to 14%) of the compositional variation was explained by a combination of anthropogenic inputs, of which mining (similar to 6%) was the main contributor to bacterial community variation. Network analysis indicated that bacterial communities had non-random inter-and intra-phyla associations and that the main taxa showed both positive and negative linkages to environmental parameters. Our results suggest that species sorting, due to environmental parameters, was the main process that structured bacterial communities. Furthermore, upstream sites had higher relative abundances of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation, suggesting stronger removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. This study provides insights into the influences of anthropogenic land use on bacterial community structure and functions in the lower Wonderfonteinspruit.

AB  - Over 60% of the world's reefs experience damage from local activities such as overfishing, coastal development, and watershed pollution. Land-based sources of pollution are a critical threat to coral reefs, and understanding "ridge-to-reef" changes is urgently needed to improve management and coral survival in the Anthropocene. We review existing literature on spatial-ecological connections between land use and coral health, specifically examining vegetative, agricultural, urban, and other land-use types. In general, forested land use is positively related to metrics of coral condition, while anthropogenic land uses like urban development and agriculture drive a decline in coral cover, diversity, colony size, and structural complexity. However, land-use and land-cover impacts vary across time and space, and small portions of the landscape (e.g., discrete segments of unpaved roads, grazed and scalded hillsides) may have an outsized effect on reef pollution, presenting opportunities for targeted conservation. Some coral species show resilience under land-use and land-cover change, and the impact of land use on coral recovery from bleaching remains an active area of research. Finally, a spatial bibliography of existing literature reveals that most ridge-to-reef studies focus on a handful of regional hotspots, surface water, and watershed-scale dynamics; more research is needed to address groundwater connectivity and to compare land-use impacts across multiple regions and scales. Approaches from landscape ecology that assess spatial patterns of, and synergies between, interlocking land cover may assist conservation managers in designing more resilient reefscapes.

AB  - The ignition of fires in urban environments due to seismic shocks is a phenomenon that has been studied for a long time in literature. It is a secondary seismic effect that is analyzed in order to create efficient protective solutions. In this research the occurrence of Fire Following Earthquake (FFE) at urban scale is investigated. A virtual reality-based system for the simulation of fire scenario and emergency response is developed starting from the 3D model of building in an urban area through the use of aVR platform that ensures the interaction between human and the virtual simulation environment. The ignition and the spreading of fire and smoke after a strong ground motion are based on numerical simulation using computation fluid dynamic (CDF) software. The simulation may reproduce realistic fire processes by accounting the wind effect and the smoke movement. A district of an ideal city model, where all buildings and urban features are created on the basis of the city of Turin, is investigated in order to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed system.

AB  - Urban main functional areas are the spatial carriers of urban functions, which cluster important urban resources in specific regions, in order to implement essential urban purpose and core functions. Urban main functional areas have various characteristics such as highly-assembled key elements, significant social and economic benefits, and evident radial driving effect, which generally results in huge resident population and employment, and massive amount of traffic demands. Utilization of public transportation such as rail transit is a significant part of comprehensive transportation planning in urban area.
   In this essay, the analysis is presented about Beijing Center Business District (CBD) in terms of orientation, economic features, planning land, occupation and residence characteristics, and traffic situation. The investigation is provided about the historical changing process and major influence factors of Line CBD planning based on the Beijing rail transit network planning. The relationship between the rail transit and urban functional area development is analyzed. Suggestions for the urban rail transit lines planning in urban functional areas are proposed.

AB  - Aim Despite the common myna's widespread distribution, and the significant impact it has caused in parts of its non-native range, there have been no comprehensive genomic studies of its invasion of any region. We aimed to characterize the common myna invasion of the Australian continent to understand its population genetic landscape, introduction history, dispersal characteristics, and the interconnectedness between different source populations and invasive fronts. Location Common mynas from 26 geographical locations spanning the Australian continent were utilized in this study. Taxon Common myna (Acridotheres tristis). Methods We used a reduced genome representation method (DArTseq) to generate thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 462 common mynas. We then applied population genomic techniques to identify the common myna's population attributes such as gene flow, genetic diversity, and effective dispersal, all of which are critical for understanding geographical range expansion of pest species. Results We found significant genetic structuring across the common myna's Australian distribution, indicating limited levels of effective dispersal amongst the populations founded from historic introductions in the 19th century. The historic introduction points were found to be genetically distinct, such that in the region on the invasion front where admixture did occur, myna populations exhibited higher genetic diversity than in the source populations. Significant isolation by distance was evident amongst populations derived from the same founding population, with genetic diversity decreasing moving away from the point of colonization, and in general, higher levels of gene flow from source to front than vice versa. Main conclusions This study indicates that despite a 150-year colonization history of mynas in Australia, contemporary genetic structure still largely reflects human-mediated dispersal. However, expanding populations are now connecting and the consequent increased genetic diversity may improve evolutionary potential. These results suggest that more management focus should be directed towards the invasion fronts, rather than the large, historic source populations.

AB  - Urban forests are critical for biodiversity conservation and offer a broad range of benefits to society, including provisioning, regulating, and cultural components of ecosystem services. Urban forests warrant more ecological attention in order to ensure the sustainability of these important natural areas, especially as they are often faced with unique challenges arising from habitat isolation, high densities of invasive species, and heat and pollution stress. The present study sought to document gap dynamics and species recruitment in an old-growth urban forest in the Southeast United States in order to address concerns that gaps in the forest are not regenerating. Seeds were collected, and seedlings were tagged and monitored for a year in gaps and paired closed forest plots. Seedlings had higher growth and survival rates in gaps compared to the closed forest. Gap and closed forest seed and seedling communities were similar in species composition, but there were differences in the composition of species in seed and seedling communities, although seedling and adult communities were more similar. Seed and establishment limitation were both detected in our study plots, and the two were negatively related. Overall, our gaps were relatively young and appeared to be benefiting from the active management of invasive species. Urban forest managers face multiple challenges in stewarding their forests, including monitoring the composition of the recruiting communities and carefully studying the impacts of invasive species on forest regeneration.

TI  - Supermanzana in Practice. Ability to Create People Friendly Spaces upon the Example of Selected Barcelona-Based Projects

LA  - English
CP  - 3rd World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering, Architecture, Urban Planning Symposium (WMCAUS)
AB  - This paper is a result of an in situ study carried out in September 2017 in Barcelona. Its objective was to assess the effectiveness of the spatial policy of the city in terms of promoting sustainable mobility, traffic restrictions, increasing the share of public spaces, and improving basic ecological indicators, such as biodiversity, the area of green spaces, or air pollution. The analysis focuses on measures implemented within the scheme of the concept of 'a superblock' (original 'supermanzana') on the example of two selected neighborhoods of Barcelona: Gracia, and a part of El Poblenou, demarcated by the streets: Caner de Badajoz, Caner de Llacuna, Caner de Tanger, Caner de Pallars. Special attention was paid to the ability of the changes implemented to create people friendly spaces, where people wish to stay, and subsequently to their ability to create positive functional and spatial changes, especially on ground floors of buildings. The paper shall give the reader a sense of the exact scope of implemented measures, presented on the example of selected analytical layers, such as transport, public spaces, visual information, street furniture, etc. The study results demonstrate an improvement in terms of the majority of the urban and ecological indicators referred to above; nevertheless, the assessment in terms of the actual increase of the attractiveness of the place and its ability to create people friendly spaces, is not explicit. In El Poblenou in particular one can observe certain weaknesses in this respect, which could be particularly disturbing considering subsequent plans of the authorities of Barcelona to implement the concept of 'a superblock' in other parts of the city within the scheme of the urban grid of Eixample. Doubts are additionally raised by the legibility of the new traffic network in this location, which constitutes an impediment in uninhibited and intuitive moving around for city inhabitants themselves. A similar spectrum of measures does not always bring about the same results. The assessment of the quality of public space cannot be limited to some selected figures, which confirm - as they must - effective implementation of the assumed goals, much to the satisfaction of the authorities who are behind them. Such an assessment carried out independently from other placemaking factors, such as the plot ratio, the diversity of the functional programme, spatial relations in the existing development structure, which should be adjusted to man's scale, or - finally - the quality and character of greenery projects implemented, will never be credible.

AB  - Alternative models exist for the movement of large urban populations following the 15th-century CE abandonment of Angkor, Cambodia. One model emphasizes an urban diaspora following the implosion of state control in the capital related, in part, to hydroclimatic variability. An alternative model suggests a more complex picture and a gradual rather than catastrophic demographic movement. No decisive empirical data exist to distinguish between these two competing models. Here we show that the intensity of land use within the economic and administrative core of the city began to decline more than one century before the Ayutthayan invasion that conventionally marks the end of the Angkor Period. Using paleobotanical and stratigraphic data derived from radiometrically dated sediment cores extracted from the 12th-century walled city of Angkor Thom, we show that indicia for burning, forest disturbance, and soil erosion all decline as early as the first decades of the 14th century CE, and that the moat of Angkor Thom was no longer being maintained by the end of the 14th century. These data indicate a protracted decline in occupation within the economic and administrative core of the city, rather than an abrupt demographic collapse, suggesting the focus of power began to shift to urban centers outside of the capital during the 14th century.

AB  - This study predicts land cover dynamics in Ghara-su Basin, northeastern Iran, using GIS modeling and landscape metrics. Land use/land cover (LULC) mapping for the years 1988, 2002, and 2008 was classified from remotely sensed imagery to monitor and predict future LULC changes. FRAGSTATS was used to quantify landscape structure by a series of landscape indices extracted from LULC data. Principal component analysis was performed on 28 landscape indexes to explore the degree of redundancy. A predicted LULC map for the year 2022 was created based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural network and the past trends of land variations. The predicted model accuracy assessment was accomplished by comparing the actual LULC map of 2008 with a predicted map for the year 2008. Results of change analysis showed a reduction of forest (12% of forest area) and bare land (20% of bare land area). Agricultural land, waterbodies, urban areas, and grassland increased about 8%, 11%, 27%, and 35%, respectively, between 1988 and 2008. Bare land and agricultural land are the main contributors to increased residential zones. Landscape metrics indicate an increase in fragmentation and diversity during the study period. The predicted map for 2022 shows that forest is becoming degraded and residential areas, agricultural lands, and grassland will increase compared with those under the 2008 land cover. The results of this study, where areas prone to change are mapped, are expected to support environmental planning and management initiatives and, in doing so, prevent further negative changes in landscape function and structure.

AB  - Urban soils differ from those in other managed ecosystems in many ways, including their heterogeneity, unique organic matter inputs and exposure to past and present anthropogenic activities. Soil processes in urban systems are influenced by the microbiome, specifically bacterial and fungal communities that are currently recognized as the primary drivers of soil organic matter dynamics. However, our understanding of biotic controls on microbial communities is incomplete, particularly in regard to the roles of invertebrates. We aim to highlight how invertebrates and their interactions with microbial communities may shape ecosystem processes in urban systems. We discuss three primary pathways through which invertebrates are known to influence the soil microbiome: dispersal of microorganisms throughout soils, grazing on microbial biomass, and mixing of organic inputs within soils and subsequently altering microbial resource accessibility. These invertebrate-mediated pathways may be particularly important because of their influence on soil microbiomes of urban systems. We also propose future research directions aimed at quantifying the influence of invertebrates on soil microbial processes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of urban microbiome function. Understanding the impact of invertebrates on the microbiome of urban systems can potentially lead to better management of microbiomes and enhance microbe-driven ecosystem services.

AB  - Context Animal population dynamics are shaped by their movement decisions in response to spatial and temporal resource availability across landscapes. The sporadic availability and diversity of resources can create highly dynamic systems. This is especially true in agro-ecological landscapes where the dynamic interplay of insect movement and heterogeneous landscapes hampers prediction of their spatio-temporal dynamics and population size. Objectives We therefore systematically looked at population-level consequences of different movement strategies in temporally-dynamic resource landscapes for an insect species whose movement strategy is slightly understood: the Queensland Fruit Fly (Bactrocera tryoni) Methods We developed a spatially-explicit model to predict changes in population dynamics and sizes in response to varying resources across a landscape. We simulated the temporal dynamics of fruit trees as the main resource using empirical fruiting dates. Movement strategies were derived from general principles and varied in directedness of movement and movement trigger. Results We showed that temporal continuity in resource availability was the main contributing factor for large and persistent populations. This explicitly included presence of continuous low-density resources such as fruit trees in urban areas. Analysing trapping data from SE Australia supported this finding. We also found strong effects of movement strategies, with directed movement supporting higher population densities. Conclusions These results give insight into structuring processes of spatial population dynamics of Queensland Fruit Fly in realistic and complex food production landscapes, but can also be extended to other systems. Such mechanistic understanding will help to improve forecasting of spatio-temporal hotspots and bottlenecks and will, in the end, enable more targeted population management.

AB  - Climate change and urban growth impact habitats, species, and ecosystem services. To buffer against global change, an established adaptation strategy is designing protected areas to increase representation and complementarity of biodiversity features. Uncertainty regarding the scale and magnitude of landscape change complicates reserve planning and exposes decision makers to the risk of failing to meet conservation goals. Conservation planning tends to treat risk as an absolute measure, ignoring the context of the management problem and risk preferences of stakeholders. Application of risk management theory to conservation emphasizes the diversification of a portfolio of assets, with the goal of reducing the impact of system volatility on investment return. We use principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which quantifies risk as the variance and correlation among assets, to formalize diversification as an explicit strategy for managing risk in climate-driven reserve design. We extend MPT to specify a framework that evaluates multiple conservation objectives, allows decision makers to balance management benefits and risk when preferences are contested or unknown, and includes additional decision options such as parcel divestment when evaluating candidate reserve designs. We apply an efficient search algorithm that optimizes portfolio design for large conservation problems and a game theoretic approach to evaluate portfolio trade-offs that satisfy decision makers with divergent benefit and risk tolerances, or when a single decision maker cannot resolve their own preferences. Evaluating several risk profiles for a case study in South Carolina, our results suggest that a reserve design may be somewhat robust to differences in risk attitude but that budgets will likely be important determinants of conservation planning strategies, particularly when divestment is considered a viable alternative. We identify a possible fiscal threshold where adequate resources allow protecting a sufficiently diverse portfolio of habitats such that the risk of failing to achieve conservation objectives is considerably lower. For a range of sea-level rise projections, conversion of habitat to open water (14-180%) and wetland loss (1-7%) are unable to be compensated under the current protected network. In contrast, optimal reserve design outcomes are predicted to ameliorate expected losses relative to current and future habitat protected under the existing conservation estate.

AB  - Parasites have the capacity to affect animal populations by modifying host survival, and it is increasingly recognized that infectious disease can negatively impact biodiversity. Populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) have declined in many European towns and cities, but the causes of these declines remain unclear. We investigated associations between parasite infection and house sparrow demography across suburban London where sparrow abundance has declined by 71% since 1995. Plasmodium relictum infection was found at higher prevalences (averaging 74%) in suburban London house sparrows than previously recorded in any wild bird population in Northern Europe. Survival rates of juvenile and adult sparrows and population growth rate were negatively related to Plasmodium relictum infection intensity. Other parasites were much less prevalent and exhibited no relationship with sparrow survival and no negative relationship with population growth. Low rates of co-infection suggested sparrows were not immunocompromised. Our findings indicate that P. relictum infection may be influencing house sparrow population dynamics in suburban areas. The demographic sensitivity of the house sparrow to P. relictum infection in London might reflect a recent increase in exposure to this parasite.

AB  - Research Highlights: Forest conservation policies can drive land-use change to other land-use types. In multifunctional landscapes, forest conservation policies will therefore impact on other functions delivered by the landscape. Finding the best pattern of land use requires considering these interactions. Background and Objectives: Population growth continues to drive the development of land for urban purposes. Consequently, there is a loss of other land uses, such as agriculture and forested lands. Efforts to conserve one type of land use will drive more change onto other land uses. Absent effective collaboration among affected communities and relevant institutional agents, unexpected and undesirable land-use change may occur. Materials and Methods: A CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small Scales) model was developed for the Deep Creek watershed, a small sub-basin in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. The valley is experiencing among the most rapid population growth of any region in Canada. Land uses were aggregated into one forested land-use type, one urban land-use type, and three agricultural types. Land-use change was simulated for combinations of two forest conservation policies. Changes are categorized by location, land type, and an existing agricultural land policy. Results: Forest conservation policies drive land conversion onto agricultural land and may increase the loss of low elevation forested land. Model results show where the greatest pressure for removing land from agriculture is likely to occur for each scenario. As an important corridor for species movement, the loss of low elevation forest land may have serious impacts on habitat connectivity. Conclusions: Forest conservation policies that do not account for feedbacks can have unintended consequences, such as increasing conversion pressures on other valued land uses. To avoid surprises, land-use planners and policy makers need to consider these interactions. Models such as CLUE-S can help identify these spatial impacts.

AB  - Brown rats are a prolific synanthropic pest species, but attempts to control their populations have had limited success. Rat population dynamics, dispersal patterns, and resistance to rodenticides are important parameters to consider when planning a control programme. We used population genetics and genotyping to investigate how these parameters vary in contrasting landscapes, namely one urban and two rural municipalities from eastern France. A total of 355 wild brown rats from 5 to 6 sites per municipality were genotyped for 13 microsatellite loci and tested for mutations in the Vkorc1 gene which confers resistance to some rodenticides. Results revealed a strong genetic structure of the sampled rat populations at both regional (between municipalities) and local (between sites within municipalities) levels. A pattern of isolation by distance was detected in the urban habitat and in one of the rural municipalities. GeneClass and DAPC analyses identified 25 (7%) and 36 (10%) migrants, respectively. Migrations occurred mostly between sites within each municipality. We deduced that rat dispersal is driven by both natural small-scale movements of individuals and longer-distance (human-assisted) movements. Mutation Y139F on gene Vkorc1 was significantly more prevalent in rural (frequency 0.26-0.96) than in urban sites (0.00-0.11), likely due to differences in selection pressures. Indeed, pest control is irregular and uncoordinated in rural areas, whereas it is better structured and strategically organised in cities. We conclude that simultaneous pest control actions between nearby farms in rural habitats are highly recommended in order to increase rat control success while limiting the spread of resistance to rodenticides.

AB  - The land value uplift effects of rapid transit infrastructure provide evidence of willingness to pay for more sustainable forms of development and suggest a rationale for land value capture. The present research utilizes spatio-temporal methods in a quasi-experimental research design to examine changes in property values associated with pedestrian accessibility to the West Island Line heavy rail extension in Hong Kong. Several innovations in methods and techniques are proposed that respond to the econometric challenges involved in conducting research in high density, topographically-rich cities. Of these, the paper incorporates landscape topography throughout its estimation process, including the calculation of slope-aware measures of walkable accessibility on a 3D pedestrian network and proposes a new Spherical Distance Weights method for capturing horizontal and vertical spatial association among observations in 3D space. Finally, these weights are combined with measures of temporal distance for a 4D approach that accounts for relations among observations in space and time. Spatio-temporal difference-in-differences results reveal a significant change in the value of pedestrian access to the new transit stations of between 26% and 41% after opening. Interestingly, uplift occurred across both the new stations as well as for properties around the previous terminus, highlighting the network effects associated with changes in accessibility. Beyond demonstrating that rail transit is valued, these findings confirm the assumptions behind the city's Rail + Property value capture approach, suggesting it remains a viable model for sustainable finance and urbanism in other high-density and transit-oriented cities.

AB  - Bonefish (Albula vulpes) is a socioeconomically important species that supports a data-poor recreational fishery in developing countries. Understanding how environmental variables influence its abundance and movement is important for better decision-making. This study used mark-recapture to examine the association between abiotic (temperature, salinity, wind speed, tides moon phase, and sediment coarseness) and biotic (presence of predators and bottom vegetation) variables with bonefish movement and abundance in Corozal-Chetumal bay and the adjacent Caribbean coast of southern Mexico and northern Belize. We used seines to capture bonefish, marked 9657 using dart tags and recaptured 595 fish (6.2% recapture rate) during 16 sample periods between January 2016 and February 2018. Marked bonefish size ranged 19.5-56.4 cm and recaptured 23.9-49.4 cm. Total abundance for each seine sample and distance between mark and recapture locations were used in two separate multiple stepwise regression analyses. Movement was negatively associated with temperature and predator presence, while sediment coarseness and moon phase were positively associated. Temperature increases were associated with short-distance movements. Temperature decreases and high-illumination lunar phases were associated with longer-distance movement and likely related to spawning migrations. Presence of predators, like barracuda, was associated with low bonefish abundances and was likely an adaptive response to form multiple schools of low density by bonefish to avoid predation. These spatiotemporal movement and abundance patterns are recommended to be taken into account in fisheries and protected areas management and to inform the decision-making process in urban and tourism development in coastal habitats.

AB  - To reveal the occurrence and mechanisms for dispersal of antibiotic resistance (AbR) among the microbial assemblages inhabiting impacted coastal environments, we performed a weekly, two-year duration time-series study at two urban beaches between 2014 and 2016. We combined quantitative PCR and multiplex PCR reverse line blot techniques to track patterns in the occurrence of 31 AbR genes, including genes that confer resistance to antibiotics that are critically important antimicrobials for human medicine. Patterns in the abundance of these genes were linked to specific microbial groups and environmental parameters by coupling qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data with network analysis. Up to 100-fold increases in the abundance of several AbR genes, including genes conferring resistance to quinolones, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, tetracycline, vancomycin and carbapenems, occurred following storm-water and modelled wet-weather sewer overflow events. The abundance of AbR genes strongly and significantly correlated with several potentially pathogenic bacterial OTUs regularly associated with wastewater infrastructure, such as Arcobacter, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and Cloacibacterium. These high-resolution observations provide clear links between storm-water discharge and sewer overflow events and the occurrence of AbR in the coastal microbial assemblages inhabiting urban beaches, highlighting a direct mechanism for potentially significant AbR exposure risks to humans.

AB  - An evaluation was conducted on landscape elements (land use, access roads, slopes, and environmental fragility) and trends in the use of soil during the period 2005-2016 in the area proposed for the Biological Corridor Tibas River (CBRT). From these elements and trends, a methodology for the selection of priority sites (SP) was applied for the restoration of plant cover, and a survey to assess the perception and consent of their respective owners was applied. The CBRT has a distribution almost equitable between urban, agricultural and natural use, with an important concentration of forest cover in its high area. However, in 11 years the CBRT has undergone a process of urbanization, up to three times faster than other urban areas in the region, being the agricultural uses the most vulnerable to change. The implementation of the methodology identified 20 priority sites of management; the above-mentioned survey was applied in 10 of them. The 94% of the owners are willing to the restoration, motivated primarily by the conservation of water, biodiversity and landscape.

AB  - Smart city initiatives have emerged to mitigate the negative effects of a very fast growth of urban areas. A number of universities are applying smart city solutions to face similar challenges in their campuses. In this study, we analyze the possibility of using low cost sensors based on detecting wireless signals of light commodity devices to track the movement of the members of the university community. This tracking information will help the university managers to provide the users with smart services. The first insight is that there were not detected barely movements through the campus during late-night/early morning hours (from 0:00H to 6:00H). In turn, the number of human flows sensed in a given direction is similar to the ones in the opposite one. The analysis of the sensed data has shown that the most mobility occurs during the opening and finishing school hours, as expected. Finally, we observed that the sensors are able to detect vehicular mobility.

AB  - This paper explores a general multiple time-scale approach to model reduction in dynamic network-of-network systems, with a specific treatment on multi-city epidemics. Extensive coupling between layers of networks often complicates and obfuscates the interaction dynamics. Through the use of the natural time-scale differences in the system, these dynamics can be individually studied under a separation principle, simplifying analysis. We describe asymptotic stability of the network-of-networks through a composite Lyapunov function, and provide an M-matrix condition which guarantees such stability. Conservative bounds on the time-scale parameters are given quantitatively such that this condition is satisfied. This theory is consequently applied to the study of multi city epidemics, where the interactions within each city may be assumed to behave at their own time-scale, and the movement of population between cities occurs at the slowest time-scale. We show, under certain time-scale conditions, the isolated dynamics of an individual city can approximate that of the full multi-city dynamics in the approach towards the disease-free equilibrium.

AB  - Aim To assess the effectiveness of protected areas in two catchment scales (local and network) in conserving regionally common fluvial fishes using modelled species distributions. Location Conterminous United States. Methods A total of 150 species were selected that were geographically widespread, abundant, non-habitat specialists and native within nine large ecoregions. Species distribution models were developed using boosted regression trees, and modelled distributions were assessed for protection status under two alternatives: lands strictly managed for biodiversity (Highly Restricted Use) and those allowing multiple uses (Multiple Use), with protection target levels (i.e., the amount of protected area required for protection) for local and network catchments being developed from ecoregion-based urban and agricultural land use thresholds from fish responses. Results Overall, less than 2% of fluvial catchments in the conterminous USA are meeting both local and network catchment protection target levels under the Highly Restricted Use alternative, whereas 16% of catchments met protection levels for the Multiple Use alternative, with protection largely concentrated in the western USA. For common native species distributions within ecoregions, only one species had >10% of streams meeting combined local and network catchment protection target levels under the Highly Restricted Use alternative, whereas 50 distributions (similar to 14% of species distribution models) met this level under the Multiple Use alternative. Main conclusions Even for fishes considered widespread and abundant, protection levels are lacking, particularly when considering only lands that are actively managed for biodiversity. Given the increasing intensification of anthropogenic activities and substantial uncertainty associated with climate change, considering the conservation status for all species, including those currently considered common, is warranted.

AB  - Long-distance migration allows many bird species to overcome the severe climatic changes that occur in seasonal environments. Migration is highly demanding, and given its cyclical nature, we currently know that it has substantial effects on the population parameters of migratory birds during both breeding and wintering seasons. However, the potential effects of the presence of migratory birds in their wintering grounds on populations of resident birds have remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose the hypothesis that migratory birds negatively affect the habitat occupancy and population abundance of resident birds because of the arrival of numerous individuals during the most limiting months of the year. Here, we studied different species of migratory and resident birds that coexist during winter in an urban ecological reserve located within Mexico City. We used single-species multiseason occupancy models, two-species occupancy models, and distance sampling techniques to evaluate changes in occupancy and population density of resident bird species during three consecutive winters. We found an aggregation pattern between two resident species (Psaltriparus minimus and Thryomanes bewickii) with three migratory warblers (Cardellina pusilla, Setophaga coronata and Setophaga townsendi). Thus, our results provide evidence of the formation of mixed-species flocks in our study area. We also conclude that resident birds experience different demographic and behavioral processes during winter that not necessarily result from interspecific interactions with migratory birds.

AB  - Protected areas are one of the key tools for conserving biodiversity and recent studies have highlighted the positive impact they can have in avoiding habitat conversion. However, the relationship to management actions on the ground is far less studied and we currently do not know which management actions are the most crucial for success. To investigate this, we studied the effectiveness of the protected area network of Madagascar. We estimated the impact of individual protected areas in avoiding deforestation, accounting for confounding factors (elevation, slope, distance to urban centers and infrastructure, and distance to forest edge). We then investigated whether Protected Area Management Effectiveness scores, and their different facets, explained the variation observed. We found that the majority of the analyzed protected areas in Madagascar do reduce deforestation. Protected areas with higher management scores did not perform better in terms of avoiding deforestation. We discuss potential explanations for these results, and how they might influence the validity of current methods for estimating different facets of protected area effectiveness under different deforestation scenarios.

AB  - Nowadays, the need of "return to the river" is universally recognized The human need for contact with elements of the natural environment is particularly emphasized, in connection with our increasingly processed environment. In a number of publications in the field of architecture and urban planning, the role of these natural areas in shaping coherent, sustainable urban structures is also underlined. The aim of the article is to indicate the potential use of the corridor formed by the river and the areas constituting its neighbourhood for shaping the urban space: in a functional, compositional and ecological sense. As an example, the Vistula River in Cracow was chosen. The research covered areas that are close to the river within the city's administrative boundaries. The Vistula Valley in Krakow creates a special space in which natural and cultural values intermingle. Over the centuries, both the spatial structure of the city and the layout of the water network - resulting from its natural transformations and the use of its elements for economic or defense purposes - have changed. The special cultural value of the Vistula river valley in Krakow is represented by the medieval urban layouts of the Old Town, Kazimierz, and Podgorze, as well as unique historical complexes and buildings. The historic buildings accompanying the river have significant compositional significance, being dominants or observational closures, building and deciding on the unique beauty of this Krakow salon. From the point of view of environmental values in the analyzed area, focus is drawn to the western and eastern zone of the Vistula valley. In the eastern part of the Vistula valley, particular attention should be paid to the occurrence of geothermal water deposits located in the region of Przylasek Rusiecki and Wyciaza in the vicinity of the Vistula river corridor. The analyzed area, due to its natural and cultural value, should play an important role in shaping the spatial structure of Krakow. As a linear area, it can become an important and attractive public space. Due to the extent of the area on which the research was carried out and the complexity of the research problems, some of the issues are only sketched in the article, signaling the values and significance of the studied area, and generally indicating the principles and possibilities of using these values to shape and improve the quality of urban space.

AB  - In order to study airborne bacterial community dynamics over Tokyo, including fine-scale correlations between airborne microorganisms and meteorological conditions, and the influence of local versus long-range transport of microbes, air samples were collected on filters for periods ranging from 48 to 72 h. The diversity of the microbial community was assessed by next generation sequencing. Predicted source regions of airborne particles, from back trajectory analyses, changed abruptly from the Pacific Ocean to the Eurasian Continent in the beginning of October. However, the microbial community composition and the alpha and beta diversities were not affected by this shift in meteorological regime, suggesting that long-range transport from oceanic or continental sources was not the principal determinant controlling the local airborne microbiome. By contrast, we found a significant correlation between the local meteorology, especially relative humidity and wind speed, and both alpha diversity and beta diversity. Among four potential local source categories (soil, bay seawater, river, and pond), bay seawater and soil were identified as constant and predominant sources. Statistical analyses point toward humidity as the most influential meteorological factor, most likely because it is correlated with soil moisture and hence negatively correlated with the dispersal of particles from the land surface. In this study, we have demonstrated the benefits of fine-scale temporal analyses for understanding the sources and relationships with the meteorology of Tokyo's "aerobiome."

AB  - The dispersal of the invasive mosquito Aedes aegypti in urbanized areas has received attention due to the hazard that this species poses to human health. However, we know little about this process at temperate latitudes, especially in recently colonized semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States that differ ecologically from more typical habitats in the tropics. We collected data on Ae. aegypti dispersal through a mark-release-recapture (MRR) study in Central California. We employed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to mark released mosquitoes. We characterized Ae. aegypti dispersal capacity using both traditional measures of central tendency and dispersal kernel theory coupled with space-time models, allowing for effects of environmental factors to provide more reliable dispersal estimates. Dispersal of Ae. aegypti was similar between females and males, and we found the mean distances traveled to be 224-240 m from the release location when estimated by conventional methods. Model-based inference allowed for a more nuanced interpretation, with even greater dispersal distances possible depending on direction and environmental context. Our results showed that experimental conditions, such as spatial arrangement of traps and duration of the recapture period, as well as environmental conditions, such as wind speed and direction, altered the probability of recapturing marked mosquitoes, and therefore the observed dispersal pattern. This represents the first assessment of Ae. aegypti dispersal in the semi-arid southwestern United States, which is unique among published studies in that the period of peak annual Ae. aegypti abundance coincides with cumulative precipitation close to zero. Results show that this species dispersed on average farther than commonly documented for other areas of the world. Our findings provide information for defining spatial control strategies, such as incompatible insect technique, which rely on a clear understanding of dispersal rates among neighboring areas.

AB  - Feng Shui woodlands are naturally or artificially formed green areas in southern China. They are precious for maintaining ecosystem balance in modern semiurban environments. However, they are generally small and geographically isolated from each other, and the status of genetic diversity of the plant species within them has been almost neglected. Therefore, we studied the genetic diversity of the endangered Erythrophleum fordii in eight Feng Shui woodlands (a total of 1,061 individuals) in Guangzhou, a large city in southern China, using microsatellites. For comparison, one population with 33 individuals sampled in a nature reserve was also studied. Although our results indicate that significant demographic declines occurred historically in E. fordii, such declines have not resulted in consistent reductions in genetic variation over generations in Feng Shui populations in the recent past, and the levels of genetic variation in these populations were higher than or comparable to the genetic variation of the population in the nature reserve. In addition, our parentage and paternity analyses indicated widespread and potential long-distance pollen flow within one Feng Shui woodland, indicating the presence of an unbroken pollination network, which would at least partially alleviate the genetic erosion due to habitat fragmentation and the unequal gene contributions of E. fordii parents to their progenies when favorable recruitment habitats are absent under most of the parent trees. Overall, our results suggest that E. fordii in Feng Shui woodlands may not be driven to extinction in the near future. Nevertheless, uncontrolled fast urban development with a lack of awareness of Feng Shui woodlands will cause the local extinction of E. fordii, which has already happened in some Feng Shui woodlands.

AB  - Invasive mammals are a major threat to biodiversity. Understanding how their distributions and abundance could be affected by different temporal and spatial control strategies is fundamental for planning effective management programs. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model to test the impacts of different spatiotemporal management strategies on a pest population. As a case study, we used the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) population in the Cape-to-City treatment area in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. We found striking differences in the effectiveness of different spatial control strategies - a well designed spatial control strategy could be up to twice as cost effective as poorly designed ones. The optimal spatial control strategy may depend on the total control effort. At low control effort, habitat-targeted control was more effective; at high control effort, homogeneously distributed control was more effective. Immigration rather than in situ breeding is likely to initiate the population recovery in treated areas after an initial knockdown. Therefore, increasing the size of treatment areas and maximizing the use of natural barriers to immigration could prolong treatment persistence. Synthesis and applications. We have demonstrated how a spatially explicit, agent-based model can be used to identify key criteria for a control strategy of open pest populations. The integration of available information on pest habitat use, population dynamics and actual levels of control allowed us to assess the deployment of control sites and assisted the choice of spatial control strategies. Important roles for this type of model are to help predict hotspots of mammalian pest activities, to suggest the most effective control strategy and to identify important parameters and data for improving predictions. Ultimately, further integration of spatial and temporal analyses is critical for updating and optimizing management strategies.

AB  - Determining the mechanisms that create and maintain biodiversity is a central question in ecology and evolution. Speciation is the process that creates biodiversity. Speciation is mediated by incompatibilities that lead to reproductive isolation between divergent populations and these incompatibilities can be observed in hybrid zones. Gecko lizards are a speciose clade possessing an impressive diversity of behavioral and morphological traits. In geckos, however, our understanding of the speciation process is negligible. To address this gap, we used genetic sequence data (both mitochondrial and nuclear markers) to revisit a putative hybrid zone between Sphaerodactylus nicholsi and Sphaerodactylus townsendi in Puerto Rico, initially described in 1984. First, we addressed discrepancies in the literature on the validity of both species. Second, we sampled a 10-km-wide transect across the putative hybrid zone and tested explicit predictions about its dynamics using cline models. Third, we investigated potential causes for the hybrid zone using species distribution modeling and simulations; namely, whether unique climatic variables within the hybrid zone might elicit selection for intermediate phenotypes. We find strong support for the species-level status of each species and no evidence of movement, or unique climatic variables near the hybrid zone. We suggest that this narrow hybrid zone is geographically stable and is maintained by a combination of dispersal and selection. Thus, this work has identified an extant model system within geckos that that can be used for future investigations detailing genetic mechanisms of reproductive isolation in an understudied vertebrate group.

AB  - A wounded city can yield both sites of affect and relic-like objects. The vestiges of Plymouth's blitzed past is inscribed within the pattern and patina of place. This inscription can become overlooked with the passage of time and the fast movement of people through cityscape. By slow looking, stretching a glance into an encounter, witness marks have opportunity to communicate and temporally suture the urban landscape.
   In this paper, I unravel the terms 'decoration' and 'ornamentation' through the lens of trauma studies and present occurrences of disrepair as worthy of consideration. I put forward how damage can behave as decoration and why such illustrative terminology is empathetic to the structures decorated by it. Focusing on a selection of ceramics damaged by the aerial bombardment, I explore the ways these artefacts speak to the present through their scars and how they are mimetic of their wounded city. Through a practice-based Ph. D., I employ illustration as a historiographic arts practice and attempt to unlock other ways of knowing which are always already at work within a city's fragments and disregarded sites.

TI  - Social and economic urbanization processes in communes in a metropolitan area
T2  - 4TH WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING-ARCHITECTURE-URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM - WMCAUS
LA  - English
CP  - 4th World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering-Architecture-Urban Planning Symposium ( WMCAUS)
AB  - The article discusses selected social and economic changes taking place in the communes of a metropolitan area following a political transformation period in Poland, Central and Eastern Europe. Dynamic urbanization of communes of Polish metropolitan areas was one of the numerous results of socio-economic transformation of the country after 1989. The process played an important part in shaping both functional-spatial systems and awareness of self-governmental authorities and local communities in terms of the values of development of integrated systems of the technical infrastructure. Rapid changes taking place during the first years of the social and economic transformation caused a few negative functional-spatial phenomena in the communes bordering the central city. The analysis covered processes taking place in the communes that constitute a considerable part of the Poznan Metropolitan Area. Monitoring processes which promote increased electricity demand (of both social and economic nature, including migration and increase in the number of economic operators in years 2000-2018) taking place in areas of the communes within the impact area of the central city may enable self-governments to implement sustainable development rules and facilitate both controlled urbanization of communes of Polish metropolitan areas and correct sustainable development of the technical infrastructure. The example of the analysed selected economic and social issues concerning transformations of communes within the impact zone of the central city shows that the transformation process in the metropolitan areas in Poland after the political change occurs at different levels and to varying degrees. As a result, the new situation rendered it necessary to connect developing economic functions, urban in character, with the traditional functions of agricultural production space. However, expansion of the central city caused a lot of rural communes to lose their primary agricultural character. Combination of housing and economic functions along with traces of agricultural functions, development of technical infrastructure, and transportation network for cars and passengers caused qualitative and quantitative changes in areas of communes adjacent to the central city. The functional-spatial changes and socioeconomic transformation in Poland began a dynamic urbanization process of areas of rural communes bordering the central city. All the processes facilitated synergy in the transformation of communes. A variable pace and scale of the ongoing ecological, economic and social phenomena require constant monitoring both by architects and urban planners, both in practice and theory to examine synergistic processes occurring in contemporary urbanization in the rural areas. Self-governments and local communities, who share responsibility for functional-spatial planning and management of the communes in a metropolitan area, should modify tendencies of sustainable functional-spatial and socio-economic development. The need to design and realize new buildings with the diverse functions in rural communes activates their further development. Finally, this need stimulates synergistic processes occurring in functional-spatial and socioeconomic development in communes of a metropolitan area.

AB  - Wetlands and oceans, forests are the three major ecosystems and it is one of the most important living environment of human being. Wetland change has a great impact on climate change, biodiversity, economic development, etc. It is of great significance for wetland conservation and management to study the change of wetland landscape pattern and the causes of the change. At present, the research on wetland landscape pattern change mainly focuses on the spatial-temporal law and driving force of wetland landscape change, but the relationship between landscape pattern index and driving factor needs to be further studied. In this paper, the Shengjin Lake wetland in Chizhou City, Anhui Province, was selected as the research object. Using the Landsat TM remote sensing data from 1993, 2000, 2008 and 2016, the maximum likelihood classification was used to extract the wetland. The landscape evaluation indexes such as patch density, maximum patch index, incense density evenness index, dominance degree and aggregation degree were selected to study the temporal and spatial changes of wetland area in this area by using landscape pattern index analysis method. The main causes of wetland change were also analyzed. The results show (1) The change of wetland area showed an upward trend from 1993 to 2000. The wetland area decreased continuously in 2000-2008 and 2008-2016, and the decline was smaller in 2008-2016. The wetland landscape area in 2000 was the largest, and the area was 144.973 km(2). (2) From 1993 to 2016, the area of wetland and the largest patch in Shengjin Lake area first increased and then decreased, and the maximum patch index reached 10.55% in 2008. The shape of the patch was complicated, and the degree of human disturbance gradually increased. The landscape dominance of Shengjin Lake wetland is higher, but it shows the trend of decreasing first and then rising. (3) The influence of man-made interference on the area connectivity of the landscape wetland in the Lijin Lake area is weakened firstly, the influence of man-made interference on the shape of the wetland patch is large, and the main cause of the change of the wetland landscape area in the Shengjin Lake area is also the main reason. It is found that the wetland area of Shengjin Lake has been decreasing continuously since 2000, which is mainly influenced by human activities. What needs to be studied is the mechanism of interaction between landscape pattern and man-made disturbance in this area. It provides important basis for protection and management of Shengjin Lake wetland.

AB  - This study carves out a promising theoretical space to investigate how general and specific Internet use may facilitate various returns of social capital by separating the structural embeddedness of social capital from the returns of social capital. Drawing on a randomly sampled survey of adult residents in a major US city, we examine how general Internet use, interacted with network diversity, contributes to various returns of social capital: bonding and bridging, online and offline. We further unpack general Internet use to specific Internet use and explore their relations with the returns of social capital. The results show that general Internet use is positively related to all the online bonding, online bridging, and offline social capital returns, whereas specific Internet use (i.e., informational, participatory, and recreational) is only positively related to online but not offline returns of social capital. Network diversity moderates the relationship between general Internet use and offline returns of social capital.

AB  - The invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, is known to change forest ecosystem communities and functions; however, few have studied the potential for this prolific invader to return after forest restoration. We studied the forest understory, canopy, seed bank, and incoming L. maackii seed rain in a riparian urban forest five to nine years after L. maackii removal and restoration efforts. We found the restored areas maintained a native canopy, but by nine years post-management efforts, L. maackii was becoming more important along multiple transects due to many small individual seedlings. The restored areas had greater herbaceous cover and species richness when compared to the control area (L. maackii-dominated). Lonicera maackii was not common in the seed bank during the study but was more prevalent in the seed rain of the restored forest with a tree canopy than in the restored open field without a tree canopy. While our results support the premise that removing L. maackii returns the community to a more native state, the study also shows that the native state would not last without additional minor intervention. Monitoring beyond ten years post-removal will be key to telling the whole reinvasion story, but management efforts every five to ten years could suffice to keep a restored forest dominated by native species.

AB  - Conflict between increasing residential density and demand for comfortable life in a growing city is inevitable. This occurs not only in urban areas, but also at neighborhood level. These issues are increasingly aggravated by perception towards urban society characters, which are considered individualistic and ignorant to their residential environment. Collective efforts in resolving the issues are deemed as challenging. RW 16 in Baktijaya subdistrict was selected as the research location because it is one of the first public housing projects, which was built around 1980 in the suburban areas of Jakarta. This research begins with two questions: "What is the history of landscape transformation in RW 16 of Baktijaya sub-district?" and "How did the community promote collective actions in addressing the greening problems in their settlement?" Primary data were collected by conducting transect walk and in-depth semi-structured interviews with several key informants. This study found several findings. First, based on historical transect, there has been a significant landscape transformation from 40% of Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) in 1980 to 90% to 100% BCR in 2017, which have reduced open green space in the public housing area. The second finding of this study represents a unique lesson. The citizens have created a new structure, with emphasize on spatial awareness and collective supports that have enabled them to become a community with a robust social capital, that can collectively respond to environmental issues. Collective efforts generate creativity in using space between buildings and streets and turning them into green corridor, which was refreshing the residential nuance. Various green competitions have allowed the community to express and channel their creative ideas. Collective efforts to convert aridity into green corridor in RW 16 of Baktijaya sub-district can be referred to as an interesting solution to resolve greening problems in urban area.

The city of Sao Paulo is one of the five largest cities in the world. However, this megacity has a chronic flood problem that occurs every year, especially during the summer. Structural measures for flood control are extremely expensive and not possible in short term. In this scenario, non-structural measures such as a flood warning system is an alternative solution. This system aims to provide a real-time forecast of floods that may cause impacts in several areas. The accuracy of flooding forecast in real time is extremely important for a good result. Precipitation is the main forcing in this process and has to be estimated properly. Rain gauge networks can represent rainfall locally but has a bad spatial representativeness. Weather radars provide very high spatial resolution but not so good accuracy for rainfall intensity. The integration of radar estimations with rain gauge network is capable to minimize errors of both. The goal of the present work is to evaluate the performance of a methodology to merge weather radar estimates with rain gauge data and it uses as an input in a distributed hydrologic model. For the integration, it was used Sao Paulo weather radar a rain gage network. The hydrological simulations were performed with the distributed model SWMM. The studied area was the Mandaqui Basin, in the city of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have resulted in the dispersal of many species beyond their natural range and there is ongoing concern over their impacts on native ecosystems. However, these interactions are hard to disentangle from the effect of human-driven habitat alterations. Psittacula krameri (Rose-ringed Parakeet) is a recent coloniser in the heavily modified province of Gauteng, South Africa. We analysed this species across the region to assess its colonising status and potential impact to-date. Using presence data from the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2) for the parakeet as well as a selected subgroup of 49 other bird species (potential competitor and control species), occurrence patterns in the province for the period of July 2007-June 2017 were determined. Reporting rates for species in SABAP2 were used as a proxy for relative abundance. While the parakeet's range and abundance increased significantly, only two species showed a significant reporting rate decline in areas of parakeet occurrence. These declines persisted across a wider area where parakeets were not found. Broader-scale Gauteng reporting rate trends, not replicated in the parakeet range, were noted for nine other species, suggesting that the changing avifaunal composition in the anthropogenically transformed Gauteng may instead be driven by habitat change. A large proportion of species can be considered as newcomers to this largely modified ecosystem, and the possibility of vacant niche filling is strong in this case. In the context of novel ecosystems such as urban areas, a terminology based on adaptability rather than nativity status is encouraged.

AB  - Even though the TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) concepts contribute great innovations to our next-generation metropolis, their means and focusing are primarily on the sustainable transportation dimension. It is debatable that the development mode advocated by TOD seems to lack relative considerations of both the ecological and environmental dimensions. Consequently, to achieve a better urban life, our urban planning and design should incorporate the consideration of peripheral areas that have not been further valued in the past, such as ecology diversity, natural energy recycling or reuse, and livable habitat, rather than just focusing on the sustainable transportation dimension of conventional TOD. This study thus explores and summarizes the design criteria of Green TOD through literature review and obtains the evaluation criteria via experts. Furthermore, through the FDT (fuzzy Delphi technique) method, the evaluation criteria from the expert questionnaire are screened. In turn, more important evaluation criteria are obtained objectively. Based on the screening results of FDT, we adopt the HOQ (house of quality) model integrated by FANP (fuzzy analytic network process) and QFD (quality function deployment) to allocate the weighting for each criterion scientifically. Finally, the evaluation results and hybrid decision model provided in this study can be used as an initial reference for improving the planning and design of today's built environment. We believe that these pioneered attempts will help us in attaining our ultimate pursuit of urban sustainability and livability.

AB  - The arrival of migrants on Italian coasts following the so-called Arab Spring in 2011 has led to a multiplication of housing struggles. These struggles are widespread across the country and focus on the occupation of abandoned buildings and their transformation into collective housing spaces to provide an alternative to the formal reception system. This article will focus on the housing struggles in Rome, as the place with the highest number of occupations and the longest tradition of campaigns for the right to housing of migrants in the country. These struggles are the outcome of the encounter of recently arrived migrants with local solidarity movements and build on existing occupation movements and housing struggles. The article explores how the mobilizations over the right to housing intersect with issues such as the social appropriation of urban commons, the regeneration from below of unused areas, freedom of movement, and the contestation of Italian government policies on the relocation of migrants and refugees. The paper argues that housing struggles not only appropriate and regenerate urban commons, but also challenge the reception governance of migration and the policies of border control.

AB  - For over 20 years J K Gibson-Graham and the Community Economies Collective have endeavoured to reveal the diversity of economic practice already operative in our so-called capitalist world. The aim of this paper is to further this ambition by illuminating an occlusion in Gibson-Graham's own political vision. It argues that diversity, in Gibson-Graham's thought, is primarily conceptualised as something produced. Drawing upon the work of George Bataille, this paper conceptualises the economy as a superlative and prodigal system of energy exchange that, by definition, is over-productive and wasteful. In this framing, diversity is not the result of positive relations but emerges from the prolific nature of the general economy. The idea is developed through a discussion of the Detroit urban farming movement. Specifically it argues that the inefficient, redundant and wasteful nature of urban farming is an appropriation of potentialities resident within the general economy.

AB  - Corruption is a social plague: gains accrue to small groups, while its costs are borne by everyone. Significant variation in its level between and within countries suggests a relationship between social structure and the prevalence of corruption, yet, large-scale empirical studies thereof have been missing due to lack of data. In this paper, we relate the structural characteristics of social capital of settlements with corruption in their local governments. Using datasets from Hungary, we quantify corruption risk by suppressed competition and lack of transparency in the settlement's awarded public contracts. We characterize social capital using social network data from a popular online platform. Controlling for social, economic and political factors, we find that settlements with fragmented social networks, indicating an excess of bonding social capital has higher corruption risk, and settlements with more diverse external connectivity, suggesting a surplus of bridging social capital is less exposed to corruption. We interpret fragmentation as fostering in-group favouritism and conformity, which increase corruption, while diversity facilitates impartiality in public life and stifles corruption.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the shape of edge networks by adding various technologies to support a wide range of services from interactive and high-bit-rate to battery-operated, long-range and low-bit-rate services. While the diversity of heterogeneous technologies can be exploited to increase network resilience, a proper model is required to understand, design, and analyse the relationship between these technologies and the overall smart environment. In this paper, we propose a formal multidimensional multilayer model to describe the Internet and IoT topology from functional, geographic, and technology-level perspectives. This model is intended to capture the complexity of the smart-home and smart-city environments attached to the Internet through diverse access technologies including emerging 5G mobile networks. We analyse the resilience of diverse network technologies for smart homes using our technology interdependence graph.

AB  - The impact of climate change on conservation planning is affected by the availability of data (especially in data-sparse countries) and socioeconomic impacts. We build models using MaxEnt for Egyptian medicinal plants as a model system, projecting them to different future times under two IPCC 4th assessment emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. We compare the effect of two indices of socioeconomic activity [Human Influence Index (HII) and human population density/km(2)] as cost layers in spatial prioritization for conservation using zonation. We assess the efficacy of Egypt's network of Protected Areas (PAs) by comparing the predicted conservation value inside and outside each PA under the various scenarios. The results show that there are many locations in Egypt (the main cities, agricultural land, coastal areas) that are highly ranked for conservation before human socioeconomic impacts are included. The HII had a stronger impact than using human population density. The PA value excess (inside-outside) varied significantly with the type of cost and dispersal, but not with climate-change scenario or Zonation settings. We conclude that human socioeconomic impacts add new scope and insights for future conservation; and conservation planning without consideration of such impacts cannot be complete.

AB  - This article addresses the ways in which Nicosia has been affected by division due to the ethno-political conflict and the gentrification efforts that have attended attempts to reunite the city. It examines two spaces of civic action in particular that have involved reconstruction and rehabilitation of two areas in the capital's UN-controlled Buffer Zone: one by a peace and reconciliation initiative and another by the local variant of the global Occupy movement. In doing so, it addresses the question of how conflict politics becomes imbricated in the politics of urban development. The article examines the role of organic intellectuals in the making of war heritage and the transformation of post-conflict landscapes amid processes of gentrification. In the cases we are examining, we want to trace the processes of creating landscapes that memorialise not only ethnic conflict but the multiple political conflicts that unfold in time and space.

AB  - Despite increased attention to the problem of alien amphibian invasions, systematic assessments of the actual invasion status and potential, required to estimate possible environmental and economic impacts of introduced species, are often missing. A prime example is Johnstone's Whistling Frog (Eleutherodactylus johnstonei), a Caribbean native that now occurs widely throughout the South American mainland, including Colombia. We conducted the first systematic and comprehensive countrywide assessment of the introduction status of the species in Colombia, combining both intensive field surveys, as well as a first population genetic analysis. The species was strictly confined to urban habitats with specific environmental conditions (plant nurseries and private gardens) and did not show any signs of dispersal into the extra-urban matrix. Genetic data support previously hypothesised independent introduction events in the Andes and along the Caribbean Coast and shed light on potential dispersal pathways. The results of this study challenge both the active spread, as well as the broad environmental tolerance hypothesis previously suggested, to explain the observed range extension. A critical reassessment of the categorisation of the species as highly invasive under IUCN-ISSG standards is required.

AB  - Simple Summary Several bird species like common ravens, carrion crows, hooded crows, and rooks are held responsible for damage to agricultural land and crops. Especially in urbanized areas, they are increasing in abundance and are considered nuisance animals. We estimated the population size of carrion crows over the course of one year in relation to waste and non-waste sites in the federal state Vorarlberg, Austria. The current study showed that several human-related food resources influence the abundance of crows. More crows were observed in survey areas of biogas production and green-waste sites compared to reference sites 3 km distant from waste sites. Continuous hunting activities over the past two decades have not reduced population size. We suggest that the sustainable long-term stabilization and reduction of generalist corvid species populations can only be achieved if anthropogenic food resources are limited.
   Abstract In cities and densely populated areas, several corvid species are considered nuisance animals. In Austria, particularly carrion (Corvus corone) and hooded crows (C. cornix) are regarded as pests by the general public that frequently cause damage to crops, feed on human waste, and thus spread trash. We conducted a detailed one-year field survey to estimate the abundance of carrion crows in relation to potential anthropogenic food sources and reference sites in the Austrian Rhine valley. Our results demonstrated that the number and proximity of waste management facilities, animal feeding areas, and agricultural areas, and the productive capacity of agricultural areas, predominantly influenced habitat choice and abundance of carrion crows. In the current study, the probability of observing more than two carrion crows at a survey site decreased with increasing human population density. Moreover, the abundance of crows increased despite a continuous increase in crow hunting kills registered during the past 25 years. Our study suggests a regionally comprehensive waste management plan could serve as a promising strategy to manage nuisance birds. A reduction in anthropogenic food supply through improved waste management practices is required for long-term, sustainable management to limit the abundance of crow populations in and close to urban environments.

AB  - We generated genome sequences from 218 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone (SLE) during 2014-2015 to complement available datasets, particularly by including cases from a period of low sequence coverage during peak transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) in the highly-affected Western Area division of SLE. The combined dataset was utilized to produce phylogenetic and phylodynamic inferences, to study sink-source dynamics and virus dispersal from highly-populated transmission hotspots. We identified four districts in SLE where EBOV was introduced and transmission occurred without onward exportation to other districts. We also identified six districts that substantially contributed to the dispersal of the virus and prolonged the EVD outbreak: five of these served as major hubs, with lots of movement in and out, and one acted primarily as a source, exporting the virus to other areas of the country. Positive correlations between case numbers, inter-district transition events, and district population sizes reaffirm that population size was a driver of EBOV transmission dynamics in SLE. The data presented here confirm the role of urban hubs in virus dispersal and of a delayed laboratory response in the expansion and perpetuation of the EVD outbreak in SLE.

AB  - Experimentation has become an increasingly dominant and celebrated practice in urban governance. Used by planners and policy-makers seeking to manage and organize a positive transition to a 'better' world, experiments are generally seen as desirable and even necessary to achieve this goal. The quintessentially political nature of this approach to urban change, however, remains insufficiently addressed in planning and policy literature. This paper argues that experimental agency entails a set of political biases and normative assumptions that deserve to be problematized. Critically building on the analytical insights of evolutionary theory, we develop a critique of experimental action, arguing that experiments express a 'politics of niches' which occur across three processes: the creation, selection and retention of emergent practices within established institutional orders. Using empirical evidence from contemporary practices in Amsterdam, we sketch four trajectories of niches: death, marginalization, assimilation and transformation. We conclude by reflecting on the political implications of experimentation for urban theory and practice.

AB  - Here we characterize genetic patterns across the range of House Sparrows in Kenya using six microsatellite markers. We screened House Sparrows from two remote locations in northern Kenya, Marsabit (n = 24) and Wajir (n = 27), which are separated from other colonized areas in Kenya by minimally developed, arid habitat, and then compared these birds with House Sparrows in 10 more central and longer established Kenyan cities (n = 233) in this range. House Sparrows from Marsabit and Wajir originated from a separate source, probably Somalia and/or Ethiopia, from other Kenyan House Sparrows, probably Mombasa. Furthermore, the genetic characteristics of northern and southern populations indicate that they have not yet mixed, supporting a hypothesis that the large, minimally (human) developed, arid landscape spanning nearly all of northern Kenya, including the 100 000 km(2) Chalbi Desert, is a barrier to dispersal for House Sparrows.

AB  - Background and aims: The drainage system in the Alto Valle of Rio Negro (Argentina), is integrated by a network of drains, and was designed to collect excess irrigation water from agricultural establishments. This artificial aquatic ecosystem allows the development of vegetal herbaceous species. The progress of urbanization towards agricultural lands increased the use of drains, due the discharge of industrial and urban effluents. The increase in non-agricultural effluents contaminate these environments producing changes in biota abundance and diversity. This work aims to propose the syntaxonomic categories of vegetation associated to the drainage system and determine the relevance of vegetation as a biological indicator in environmental impact studies.
   M&M: Floristic censuses obtained in previous vegetation studies were used and complemented with new surveys carried out during the period 2018-2019. Census were carried out with the phytosociological school of Zurich Montpellier methodology.
   Results: The syntaxa found are described, according to the final phytosociological table interpretation. Its floristic, structural, syntaxonomic aspects and its potential as contamination bioindicator are discussed.
   Conclusions: Twenty-eight syntaxonomical categories were established: three classes, five orders, five alliances, two sub-alliances and thirteen associations for the Alto Valle drainage system, organized according to three growth habits: floating, submerged and emerging aquatics. 80% of the associations have eutrophication bioindicator potential in the Alto Valle of Rio Negro drainage system.

AB  - Aim Long-distance Palaearctic migrant birds are declining at a faster rate than short-distance migrant or resident species. This is often attributed to changes on their non-breeding grounds and along their migratory routes. The European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) is a scarce migrant in southern Africa that is declining globally. This study assessed the distribution and abundance of honey buzzards in southern Africa over the past four decades and compared it to trends in the East African population to examine possible drivers of population expansion in southern Africa. Location Southern and East Africa. Methods European honey buzzard reporting data were collected from a variety of sources including citizen science databases (1983-2017). In addition, records of all other southern African vagrants (including ten other regularly occurring species) were gathered to account for changes in birdwatching effort in the subregion. To assess the effect of forest loss on honey buzzard abundance, rolling correlations were performed using forest cover in East Africa and number of honey buzzard records in both subregions. Results European honey buzzard records in southern Africa have increased over five times more than other regularly occurring vagrant species and almost 40 times more than honey buzzard in Tanzania, where the population has remained stable. Loss of forested area in East Africa was correlated with an increase in European honey buzzard records in southern Africa. Main conclusions We suggest that the European honey buzzard shift in wintering range may be driven by a decline in suitable habitat further north in Africa amongst other possible reasons. This effect may have been amplified by an increase in appropriate habitat across southern Africa brought about by anthropogenic changes to vegetation such as increased tree cover in urban areas. This study further highlights the importance of using African distributional data banks to understand the effects of global change on Palaearctic migrant bird species.

AB  - Introduction. The attractiveness of the city as a place to live and fulfill needs becomes one of the determining factors for the intensification of territorial mobility among young people. The image of the city and the image of the "future" are closely related and interdependent in consciousness of young people. Megalopolis as a high-resource territory is a special space for the implementation of students' life plans. Hence, it is important to pay special attention to students as a potential driver for the development of the territory (city, region, country), creating an attractive urban environment.
   Aim. Taking into account the results of a sociological study, the aims of the publication were the following: to analyse the attractiveness of the city, to characterise its place in the life planning of students and to determine the role in territorial movements.
   Methodology and research methods. The empirical basis of the study was a semi-standardised questionnaire for students of 3-4 courses at 9 universities in Ekaterinburg (n = 200), and in-depth interviews with students representing different types of orientations to territorial mobility (n = 8). Collected data were processed by means of a method of thematic networks.
   Results and scientific novelty. According to respondents, the factors, which provide comfort of life in the city, are considered; competitive advantages and shortcomings of the environment of the megalopolis are characterised; it is shown how its specific characteristics are reflected in vital plans of students. Two idealised ideas of the city as the place for life are allocated: 1) a "comfortable" city for everyday practices and open for innovations and creativity; 2) an "instrumental" city as the platform for career development and material welfare, which can be emotionally unattractive, but functionally effective. The factor constraining territorial mobility is the reproduction of social connections and relations in the current residence area; students view the movement as a type of risky behaviour. However, 42% of respondents include in their life plans a move to another city, located both in Russia and abroad. In the motivational structure of territorial mobility, the leading positions are occupied by the desire for independence, the idealised image of the city planned for life, and the discrepancy between the conditions of a particular city and the actual needs of the young generation. Hence, the strategic direction of planning and designing urban space is the increase in the socio-cultural, economic, and environmental sustainability of the territory. Administrative structures as the agents, initiating, introducing and regulating the complex strategy of increase in attractiveness of the territory, need to consider not only the territorial capital, which the megalopolis has, but also typical needs and interests of the target social groups, especially those related to the creative class.
   Practical significance. The presented materials and the authors' conclusions can be used to determine the priority directions of the development of urban environment and intra-urban youth policy and to develop programmes for forming students' competencies related to life planning and territorial mobility.

AB  - The establishment by Schade of the first course of Urbanism at the School of Architecture of the University of Chile in 1928, whose program is unknown, motivated this approach to its possible contents and emphasis. The objective of this study is to support the current assumption about the contents of Schade's course, as well as to support an extension of the hypothesis about them. It is argued that the formation of Schade in Chile in the first decade of the 20th century, added to the contributions of the Chilean pre-urbanists, would have allowed him to insert himself positively in the European environment between 1911 and 1914, realizing an improvement in architecture and the science of construction, and participating in the intellectual effervescence generated after the recent creation of the term "Urbanism" in England (1910), the "French Society of Urbanist Architects" (1911), and the first "Urbanism Course" in Vienna (1911). To this experience, upon his return to Chile, progress was made in terms of urban legislation, the initiative to carry out an improvement in Urbanism teaching at the Postgraduate level, and the contributions to knowledge about infrastructures for hygiene in architecture and cities. Things that triggered the will of Schade to establish a course on Urban Planning at the Undergraduate level at the University of Chile. This research starts seeking the background in the formation of Schade in Chile, in the movement for the modernization of education in the country, and in the contributions of pre-urbanists, all of which would have influenced their interest Initial in urban problems; then the research is focused in the Parisian context of his stay in Europe, when, in addition, he met some of the most developed European cities, and certain social movements, and novel approaches for the benefit of urban quality of life. Finally, we tried to place Schade in the Chilean reality between 1914, when he returned to the country, and 1931, when he finished his teaching work. It concludes about the opportunity of the creation of the Schade course in 1928, and about the diversity of contents and emphasis that his teaching in Urban Planning may have had, beyond the background disseminated so far.

AB  - In the era of big data, rich information about the movement behaviors of residents can be easily obtained. The movement patterns of residents can be mined from these data, which is essential for researching the correlation among zones in cities, thereby shedding light upon the understanding of the travel needs of residents. Many clustering algorithms are proposed to mine meaningful movement patterns between zones from the massive amount of origin-destination flows. However, most existing flow clustering flow, but ignore the time attributes, precluding the identification of when the movement pattern occurs and how long it lasts. Nevertheless, for most existing algorithms that separately consider time attributes and cluster time and space, large amounts of redundant calculations result in high time complexity. Furthermore, only a few studies have considered flow clustering; most of people-related flows in the city are restricted by the road network, thereby causing the analyzed movement pattern between zones to not be consistent with reality. To address these problems, the present paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal similarity measure algorithm for flows. The algorithm uses flows as basic units, considers the spatiotemporal attributes, and introduces the road network constraints to make the results further realistic, in a bid to mine network-constrained movement patterns featured by spatiotemporal characteristics. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conduct experiments using artificial and real-world datasets of commuting data in Shanghai. Experiment results show that the algorithm can quickly and effectively mine movement patterns between zones with spatiotemporal attributes.

AB  - Urban microclimate patterns can play a great role for the allocation and management of cooling and heating energy sources, urban design and architecture, and urban heat island control. Therefore, the present study intends to investigate the variability of spatial and temporal entropy of the Effective Temperature index (ET) for the two basic periods (1971-2010) and the future (2011-2050) in Tehran to determine how the variability degree of the entropy values of the abovementioned bioclimatic would be, based on global warming and future climate change. ArcGIS software and geostatistical methods were used to show the Spatial and Temporal variations of the microclimate pattern in Tehran. However, due to global warming the temperature difference between the different areas of the study has declined, which is believed to reduce the abnormalities and more orderly between the data spatially and over time. It is observed that the lowest values of the Shannon entropy occurred in the last two decades, from 2030 to 2040, and the other in 2040-2050. Because, based on global warming, dominant areas have increased temperature, and the difference in temperature is reduced daily and the temperature difference between the zones of different areas is lower. The results of this study show a decrease in the coefficient of the Shannon entropy of effective temperature for future decades in Tehran. This can be due to the reduction of temperature differences between different regions. However, based on the urban-climate perspective, there is no positive view of this process. Because reducing the urban temperature difference means reducing the local pressure difference as well as reducing local winds. This is a factor that can effective, though limited, in the movement of stagnant urban air and reduction of thermal budget and thermal stress of the city.

AB  - The street has a long and distinguished pedigree in criminology as a site of human sociability, transgression and spontaneity. Recent scholarship in legal studies has, however, explored the role that non-human actors play in the normative ordering of urban life. These interventions suggest the need for criminologists of the street to take seriously not only the experiential foreground of crime but also its background. In this article, we seek to bring these traditions into dialogue through engagement with the concept of 'atmosphere' - a place-based mood or spatialised feeling that blends human and non-human elements, and has the capacity to act in a quasi-agentic manner. Drawing on an experiment in 'atmospheric methods' conducted during Hong Kong's pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, in which some of the city's central streets were occupied for 79 days, we seek to demonstrate that the analytics of 'atmosphere' offers a unique conceptual approach to urban life and street crime in the contemporary age.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity among African Americans is higher than among other racial/ethnic groups. African American churches hold a central role in promoting health in the community; yet, church-based interventions have had limited impact on obesity. While recent studies have described the influence of social networks on health behaviors, obesity interventions informed by social network analysis have been limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 281 African American men and women from three churches in northeast urban cities in the USA. Data were collected on sociodemographic and clinical factors and anthropometrics. Using a social network survey applying a name generator, we computed network level metrics. Exponential random graph models (ERGM) were performed to examine whether each structural property found in the empirical (observed) networks occurred more frequently than expected by chance by comparing the empirical networks to the randomly simulated networks. Overall, church friendship networks were sparse (low density). We also found that while friendship ties were more reciprocated between dyads in church networks, and there were more tendencies for clustering of friendships (significant positive transitive closure) than in random networks, other characteristics such as expansiveness (number of actors with a great number of friends) did not differ from what would be expected by chance in random networks. These data suggest that interventions with African American churches should not assume a unitary network through which a single intervention should be used.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have emerged as a global health concern. A large volume of work has already been devoted to ARGs in aquatic ecosystems. However, ARG dispersal patterns in air remain to be largely unknown despite of its greater role in transmission. This work aims to investigate time-resolved airborne spread of ARGs and their corresponding subtype bacterial carriers in highly polluted air. Time-resolved air samples (20m(3) each with three samples) were collected using a high volume sampler (1m(3)/min) every 4 h continuously (both day and night) during low (14-93 mu g/m(3)) and high PM2.5 (36-205 mu g/m(3)) pollution times (over 6 days with a total of 69 air samples) in Beijing. All air samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequence analysis for 39 ARG subtypes. Pure culturable bacterial isolates from Beijing and Shijiazhuang were Sanger sequenced for species identification and also subjected to high throughput ARG subtype detection. ARG and its subtype relative abundances in the air were observed to differ greatly (up to 3 folds for abundance) both day and night, and the blaTEM gene was found to lead the ARG abundance. For an early morning time, the multi-drug resistant NDM-1 gene was detected up to 30% of total ARG abundance in highly polluted air. Identified as a major NDM-1 and vanB gene carrier, Bacillus halotolerans were also shown to disseminate more ARG subtypes. On another front, tnpA and intI1 were shown to vary greatly in abundance, while the sul3 gene was found widespread among the culturable Bacillus isolates in the air. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed different gene co-occurrence networks for different PM2.5 pollution episodes, e.g., tnpA and intI1 for gene transfer and integration, respectively, were found more abundant for the high PM2.5 pollution episode. This study highlights a serious yet previously unidentified public health threat from time-resolved airborne spread of ARGs. Further work is urgently warranted to track the sources of ARGs for their optimized control during high PM2.5 pollution episodes.

AB  - We approach Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central, encountered in 2 days in November 2014 as an exemplar of literacy as placemaking. As a contemporary city-based resistance movement, the creation and subsequent resemiotisation of literacy artefacts were an important element of spatialised practice in asserting a new and dynamic sense of citizenship. In their collaborative design, shared commitment to certain values and expressions of political resistance, these occupation sites may be read as an instantiation of Goodsell's concept of public space. The initial research site of engagement gave rise to a dataset of photographs that the authors examined together as discourses in place, informed by cultural knowledge of Hong Kong. Selecting two photographs, we broaden out beyond the linguistic features of texts to consider processes of creative semiotic remediation. We suggest that in such placemaking activities, the Umbrella Movement activists embodied Giroux's concept of literacy as emancipatory practice. Finally, we make suggestions as to how this study might be connected to a critical pedagogy of place.

AB  - Land subsidence and soil crack has become a global problem and cases of subsidence have been identified in many places around the world. The studied area is clayey plain lands, located in the east of the city of Yazd. In this area, two types of soil crack are created, such as longitudinal and polygonal. To show the land micro movements, as a result of soil diversity after surface wetting and drying intervals, this experiment was done. Direct surveying, soil mechanical and crystal-chemical measurements were essential method of the research. The results showed that all index points were moved in different directions to about 2.3cm during 11months. The geochemical and crystal-chemical processes as neoformation of duripan features from amorphous silica in subsurface, where is petrocalsic horizon, have created permanent cracks. The soils according to Soil Taxonomy are Vertisols, and because of aridic soil moisture regime, petrocalcic horizon and duripan have been classified in Leptic Calcitorrerts subgroups. The gilgai formation is the result of soil moisturing and drying alternation in wet and dry months. Because of unstable land in this area, avoiding urban and rural developments is recommended.

AB  - The "open ocean" has become a highly contested space as coastal populations and maritime uses soared in abundance and intensity over the last decades. Changing marine utilization patterns represent a considerable challenge to society and governments. Maritime spatial planning has emerged as one tool to manage conflicts between users and achieve societal goals for the use of marine space; however, single-sector management approaches are too often still the norm. The last decades have seen the rise of a new ocean use concept: the joint "multi-use" of ocean space. This paper aims to explain and refine the concept of ocean multi-use of space by reviewing the development and state of the art of multi-use in Europe and presenting a clear definition and a comprehensive typology for existing multi-use combinations. It builds on the connectivity of uses and users in spatial, temporal, provisional, and functional dimensions as the underlying key characteristic of multi-use dimensions. Combinations of these dimensions yield four distinct types of multi-use with little overlap between them. The diversity of types demonstrates that there is no one-size-fits-all management approach, but rather that adaptive management plans are needed, focusing on achieving the highest societal benefit while minimizing conflicts. This work will help to sharpen, refine and advance the public and academic discourse over marine spatial planning by offering a common framework to planners, researchers and users alike, when discussing multi-use and its management implications.

AB  - While extensive green roofs (EGRs) are seeing increasing use around the world, the construction and maintenance "one size fits all" EGR solutions is under scrutiny. Apart from the search for local and adapted plant species that could complement or replace the widely used Sedum vegetation, practical problems such as weeds and gaps in the vegetation also still occur. Both weeds and gaps have been shown to impact EGR ecosystem service provisioning and preferences but have only received limited scientific attention. We therefore performed an in depth analysis of vegetation and local and regional environmental data gathered on 129 EGRs in Northern Belgium with a focus on understanding weeds and gaps. We found that gaps in the vegetation form a considerable issue on the studied EGRs, while weed cover is often relatively limited. Furthermore, we find that spontaneously colonizing plant cover is heavily impacted by substrate productivity and roof exposition, but is also influenced by planted species cover and the proximity of potential source habitats. For tree species cover, dispersal limitation plays an even more important role, while annual species are found to thrive on exposed roofs with a low planted functional diversity. Gap cover is found to decrease over age, and reduces with increasing substrate productivity. Finally, we provide design, construction and maintenance recommendations to prevent these problems based on our results and also discuss whether these issues should be considered a failure of EGRs as a system or as an opportunity for improved green roof functioning or the development of more 'natural' EGRs.

AB  - Observations and Axial analysis models are combined into Space Syntax to study the corresponding relationship between a street network and how temporary urban interventions in a traditional shopping street in Little India, Kuala Lumpur, may affect public life. Little India was chosen as the case study because of its historical and cultural significance. The study aims to explore the most important temporary urban interventions - activity-based interventions in traditional shopping street through the spatial logic of street network. Static snapshots and people-following were conducted in Little India, to observe activity and movement during a whole day on a weekday and a weekend day. Two (2) parameters in Space Syntax were chosen including global integration and local integration to measure its urban interventions, activities, and movement among visitors in traditional shopping streets. The result indicates that there is a certain correlation among these parameters with the following spatial configurative analyses; all lines analyses and segment based angular analyses. It finds significant relationships between global integration and local integration, and the activity pattern. It is proposed in this paper that streets with a high degree of integration and adjacent to main streets; Jalan Tun Sambanthan is a key factor for carrying forward temporary urban interventions in Little India. More attention should be paid to the street network to preserve diversity, make the streets active, and importantly to improve public life.

AB  - Machine (deep) learning-enabled accurate traffic modeling and prediction is an indispensable part for future big data-driven intelligent cellular networks, since it can help autonomic network control and management as well as service provisioning. Along this line, this paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture, namely Spatial-Temporal Cross-domain neural Network (STCNet), to effectively capture the complex patterns hidden in cellular data. By adopting a convolutional long short-term memory network as its subcomponent, STCNet has a strong ability in modeling spatial-temporal dependencies. Besides, three kinds of cross-domain datasets are actively collected and modeled by STCNet to capture the external factors that affect traffic generation. As diversity and similarity coexist among cellular traffic from different city functional zones, a clustering algorithm is put forward to segment city areas into different groups, and consequently, a successive inter-cluster transfer learning strategy is designed to enhance knowledge reuse. In addition, the knowledge transferring among different kinds of cellular traffic is also explored with the proposed STCNet model. The effectiveness of STCNet is validated through real-world cellular traffic datasets using three kinds of evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that STCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the transfer learning based on STCNet brings about 4%similar to 13% extra performance improvements.

AB  - The pollution of toxic and carcinogenic chromium slags of the chromate industry has been a public concern and industrial symbiosis is proved to be feasible and efficient in recycling chromium slags. How to appraise and improve sustainability of chromate industrial symbiosis networks is still an open problem where functional and structural performance are key approaches to solve. This paper aims to explore chromium and carbon metabolic behavior of a chromate industrial symbiosis network with ecological network analysis at infra-firm level. Results show that industrial symbiosis reduces chromium slags emissions and improves resource utilization efficiency. Influenced by flow type and quantity, the chromium metabolism realizes mutualism but the carbon metabolism fails due to intense competition for carbon resource among the recycling processes (the aluminum hydroxide, sodium sulfide and alloy steel processes). The sodium dichromate process is the largest controller on the chromium and carbon metabolism and the sodium sulfide and alloy steel processes both rely on carbon resource support of the sodium dichromate process even to 100% which may explain the intense competition. Under disharmonious connection pattern of metabolic processes, structural defects both occur to the chromium and carbon metabolism. Even though, the chromium metabolism is closed to the stable condition while the carbon metabolism still requires more network efficiency. Overall, the combination of chromium and carbon metabolism provide more details in exploring metabolic behavior of the chromate industrial symbiosis network. The applied method may be helpful to refine management and optimization in developing industrial symbiosis.

AB  - The city of Salvador has undergone a hasty population growth over the last five decades, from a mere 250,000 inhabitants in 1950 to ca. 2.9 million in 2017. This surge in population has resulted in a series of environmental issues directly connected with the reduction of the vegetation cover. Landslides and floods are among the most striking of such issues because they have put at risk, successively over the years, the lives and assets of hundreds of people, very in particular of those in less privileged circumstances. In view of this vulnerability framework and recognising the role that green areas play in the urban fabric, this work sought to determine the correlation between remnant vegetation cover and recorded occurrences of mass movements and floods. Particular consideration was given to the socioeconomic profile of the population segments most affected by these occurrences, assessed in terms of Municipal Human Development Index (M-HDI). We conclude that municipal government negligence in the control of the occupation and use of the land has been responsible for the emergence of hundreds of areas at risk, those where most mass movement and flood occurrences have taken place, which largely correspond with the neighbourhoods with the lowest rates of human development. In contrast, both the number of occurrences and their impact are smaller or non-existent in the northern part of the municipal territory, where the largest forest remnants are located, as well as in the most affluent neighbourhoods, where the ecological infrastructure has been replaced with costly public works.

AB  - BACKGROUND The monk parakeet Myiopsitta monachus (Boddaert), native to South America, is an invasive species in several European countries, causing crop damage and potential negative impacts on wildlife. Only Spain and Great Britain have regulations to control monk parakeets, thus fast growth and spread of populations are likely to occur on a wide scale. The aims of this research are to update information on the distribution and population size of monk parakeets in Europe, assess whether differences in population growth or spread rate exist between populations, and provide recommendations to decision-makers. RESULTS Our study estimates that there are 23 758 monk parakeets in the wild, across 179 municipalities in eight European Union (EU) countries; 84% of these municipalities hold between 1 and 100 monk parakeets. All countries with a representative historical record are experiencing exponential growth of monk parakeets. Mediterranean countries are experiencing higher exponential growth, spread rate and faster colonization of new municipalities than Atlantic countries. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that EU Mediterranean countries consider declaration of the monk parakeet as invasive alien species of regional concern, and develop coordinated efforts to monitor and manage the species, taking advantage of the low population sizes in most municipalities.

AB  - Urbanisation is an important factor driving species and biodiversity decline. Although habitat alterations can be detrimental for species, studies have shown that many diurnal primates are able to adapt to novel environments. Little is known about the ability of nocturnal primates to survive within an urban environment. To increase our understanding on this topic, we present ad libitum observations on group movement and sociality from urban and rural populations of the African lesser bushbaby (Galago moholi) in South Africa from 2014-2018. Our data show considerable changes in the social dynamics within urban bushbaby populations. In contrast to rural individuals, which spent the majority of their activity period solitarily or in pairs, urban individuals displayed a larger degree of sociality throughout their active period, forming groups of up to ten individuals. Furthermore, urban individuals spent less time moving around, while increasing social (communication/pair-grooming), foraging and feeding behaviour. Urban individuals fed on a range of different anthropogenic and natural food sources (insects/treegum/nectar) compared to their rural counterparts. In summary, urban bushbabies showed a large degree of behavioural plasticity, with changes in social dynamics and structure frequently observed. Such alterations in sociality, along with the ability to utilise different feeding resources, may explain the ability of the species to survive within a highly altered environment.

AB  - Land is a topic of increasing importance in cities in developing countries. In Algeria, the issue of land is also complex and delicate. Furthermore, problems related to land are more acute when it concerns informal (or illegal) settlements. Since 1945, a rural-urban migration movement in Souk Ahras has resulted in the emergence of informal settlements that had developed on the agricultural land situated on the outskirts of the colonial urban centre. In general, under a formal pattern of urban development, access to land titles precedes the act of building and occupation. In the case of informal settlements, the acquisition of landownership ultimately occurs, after the occupation of land, through regularisation procedures. This article focuses on the experience of land tenure regularisation carried out in two informal settlements, namely Lalaouia and Mesguiche, in the city of Souk Ahras, Algeria. The article seeks to identify elements that have contributed to the greater or lesser success of land regularisation. The main finding of this research is that the regularisation of land tenure in Lalaouia and Mesguiche reflects the general tendency of the Algerian government toward informal settlements that is based essentially on the recognition of these informal settlements. Thus, a land tenure regularisation strategy is implemented. It consists of a combination of physical upgrading programmes that have been ongoing since the mid-1970s, on the one hand, and land-titling measures supported by a set of legal texts to handle the issue of informal tenure, on the other. It is found that the regularisation of the informal settlements relies on an accurate land-information system. The approach adopted within the selected informal settlements can be assessed as positive, since it enabled a relative tenure security, the stability of residents, and the improvement of life standards. Nevertheless, these technical and legal tools are applied separately, instead of a unified approach of regularisation. Besides the fact that the regularisation process is often tedious and time consuming, the article also highlights the main challenges and obstacles that impede the regularisation process: historical complexity of land status, and lack of human, technical and financial resources. These issues are exacerbated by social conflicts that are often associated with heritage.

AB  - Accurate information on the number and distribution of pedestrians in space and time helps urban planners maintain current city infrastructure and design better public spaces for local residents and visitors. Previous studies have demonstrated that using webcams together with crowdsourcing platforms to locate pedestrians in the captured images is a promising technique for analyzing pedestrian activity. However, it is challenging to efficiently transform the time series of pedestrian locations in the images to information suitable for geospatial analytics, as well as visualize data in a meaningful way to inform urban design or decision making. In this study, we propose to use a space-time cube (STC) representation of pedestrian data to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of pedestrians in public spaces. We take advantage of AMOS (The Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes), a large database of images captured by thousands of publicly available, outdoor webcams. We developed a method to obtain georeferenced spatio-temporal data from webcams and to transform them into high-resolution continuous representation of pedestrian densities by combining bivariate kernel density estimation with trivariate, spatio-temporal spline interpolation. We demonstrate our method on two case studies analyzing pedestrian activity of two city plazas. The first case study explores daily and weekly spatio-temporal patterns of pedestrian activity while the second one highlights the differences in pattern before and after plaza's redevelopment. While STC has already been used to visualize urban dynamics, this is the first study analyzing the evolution of pedestrian density based on crowdsourced time series of pedestrian occurrences captured by webcam images.

AB  - Despite decades of education reform, the US school curricula remain virtually unchanged. Multi-billion dollar initiatives such as No Child Left Behind, Common Core State Standards, Race to the Top, and Every Student Succeeds Act have not resulted in significant academic gains or curricula change. The exclusion of diversity and multiculturalism in US classrooms and textbooks underserves all students and inaccurately perpetuates a hegemonic narrative. This omission particularly disserves minority students, whose only exposure to Black history is slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. Thus, this qualitative case study examines a high-performing school, Harriet Tubman Academy (pseudonym) - HTA, that utilizes critical multiculturalism and anti-racism education. The findings reveal greater academic achievement, and the students explain that they had a greater understanding and appreciation for multicultural education because of their experiences at HTA. The findings of the study have great implications for urban school reform.

AB  - Friendship formation is of central importance to online social network sites and to society, but can suffer from significant and unequal frictions. In this study, we demonstrate that social networks and policy makers may use an IT-facilitated intervention-displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual hometown, interest, education, work, city)-to encourage friendship formation, especially among people who are different from each other. Displaying TIC may update an individual's belief about the shared similarity with another and reduce information friction that may be hard to overcome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social network, we design and implement a randomized field experiment, which randomly varies the prominence of different types of things in common information when a user (viewer) is browsing a non-friend's profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed structural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate the role of individuals' preference for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We find that displaying TIC to viewers may significantly increase their probability of sending a friend request and forming a friendship, and is especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. Such findings suggest that information intervention is a very effective and zero-cost approach to encourage the formation of weak ties, and also provide the first experimental evidence on the crucial role of individuals' preference (versus structural embeddedness) in network formation. We further demonstrate that displaying TIC could improve friendship formation for a wide range of viewers with different demographics and friendship status, and is more effective when the TIC information is more surprising to the viewer. Our study offers actionable insights to social networks and policy makers on the design of information intervention to encourage friendship formation and improve the diversity of the friendship, at both an aggregate and an individual level.

AB  - While much has been said about the historicity of the Kashmir conflict or about how individuals and communities have resisted occupation and demanded the right to self-determination, much less has been said about nature of everyday life under these conditions. This article offers a glimpse of life in the working-class neighbourhood of Maisuma, located in the central area of the city of Srinagar, and its engagement with the political movement for azadi (freedom). I argue that a feature of 'double interminability' characterises life in Maisuma-the impossibility of emergence from the interminable violence that carries on simultaneously with the call of labouring for azadi.

AB  - Fire is an important environmental disturbance in Mediterranean-climate regions; however, its intensity and frequency are predicted to increase under climate change scenarios with unknown implications for ecosystems in these regions. Temporary wetlands, with their periodic wet and dry phases, are considered one of the most productive systems in the world and their invertebrate communities form a crucial diet component for higher trophic levels. The effect of fire on the hatching success of invertebrate propagules from temporary wetlands in the Cape Flats Sand Fynbos (Cape Town, South Africa) was investigated. Homogenised soil samples from these wetlands were either experimentally subjected to vegetation fires (treatment samples) or were left as is (control samples). The results revealed that fire had a significant negative impact on invertebrate hatching success, as revealed by analyses of the different diversity measures (e.g. taxon richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness) and community composition. Proper management of fire, especially in the Mediterranean-climate regions, which replicates the natural fire intervals typical of the area (10-15 years) and avoids unregulated or accidental fires, is essential to ensuring future protection of these critical biodiversity hotspots created by the temporary wetlands.

LA  - English
CP  - 7th International Conference on Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering (ICEGE)
AB  - In past earthquake disasters, due to the occurrence of many people trapped under collapsed buildings, rapid rescue activities were needed in the emergency response period. In the event of the Southern Tokyo Inland Earthquake, it is assumed that up to 72,000 people are expected to be trapped under collapsed buildings, and rescue activities in the affected areas will be required as soon as possible. This study aims at contributing to the advance planning for rescue activities after earthquake occurrence for people trapped under collapsed buildings in Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture, in the event of the Southern Tokyo Inland Earthquake by performing a rescue simulation that considers the functional obstacles of the transport network after the earthquake. From the results of this study, we consider the effect of functional obstacles of the transport network on lifesaving activities and the strategy of traffic regulation on emergency transportation roads.

AB  - In recent decades, many countries have experienced changes in internal migration patterns. In many places, affluent populations have returned to the cities, while middle-class populations, mainly families with children, have moved to peripheral areas. This study examines the extent to which these trends have occurred in Israel. The findings show that in Israel, middle-class families have moved into less affluent municipalities than those they came from, thereby increasing the socioeconomic level of those municipalities. The study analyzes these findings, their ramifications for the new and veteran residents, and the role of planning authorities in their creation and continuation.

AB  - In this paper, I analysed the neoliberal and socio-spatial transformations occurring in Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish city of Turkey. Rather than discussing the involvement of various national and international actors in those transformation processes, I tried to focus on the attitudes of the local social and political dynamics that create strong discursive counter-arguments against these processes. The study aims to demonstrate that dissident libertarian and egalitarian local groups can also become the supporters of and the actors in the neoliberal space strategies. In this regard, I examined the transformation of space in Diyarbakir considering the tense and opposed relationship between neoliberal strategies and the local political formations mobilized by the demands for collective identity. Data acquired from the field study on the local governance experience in Diyarbakir demonstrate that populist calls based on cultural existence became the focal point of local government. The slogan of "Our city is our identity!" functions as a meta-narrative that articulates the different class identities into neoliberal urban reality and becomes a discursive centre which normalizes the exclusive occupations over space.

AB  - Purpose The purposes of this study is to explore and describe the main campus urban design principles, to investigate and examine the degree of Hashemite University's (HU's) student satisfaction with the urban design of their campus, to examine the relationships between the degree of HU student satisfaction and age, gender, educational pursuits and academic year, to define and assess student needs through HU's campus design and to examine and investigate the relationships/interrelationships between all the campus urban design principles. Design/methodology/approach This research used a variety of methods: A face-to-face questionnaire (n = 1,443), HU students' community board design for urban spaces, HU master plan analysis and focus group discussions (three researchers and 30 architectural students). This research used the descriptive statistics and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson r) to analyze the data. Findings This research found that the majority of HU students were dissatisfied with the design of their outside spaces with regard to the effectiveness of space, availability of services, viability and vitality, public realm design, the density of activities, design character, walkability, diversity of existing services, richness, continuity and enclosure design. In contrast, they were satisfied with the accessibility and connectivity between spaces, availability of safe and welcoming spaces, mental map elements design and urban structure. Statistically, this research found that there were no significant relationships between the students' satisfaction level and their age, gender, educational pursuits, education specialty and education level. Moreover, the correlation results revealed that the relationships/interrelationships between all the campus urban design principles have strong/very strong positive linear associations and significant relationships (r > 89). Practical implications - This research recommended that the urban designer and architects should adopt the bottom-up approach when they are designing and planning the campus. They should apply all the above urban design principles to achieve the flexible and dynamic campus urban design and the students' needs. Well-designed campus creates multi-functional places for students' activities, encourages them for socialization and enhances their academic performance and experience, increases their feeling of belonging, enhances the sense of well-being and supports outside learning activities and experiences. The objectives for the campus urban design should promote high standards and qualities of open spaces, create a sense of places, serve students' needs, provide effective design for socialization, provide maximum flexible design to allow for future campus growth and create a safe and healthy environment to express the quality of university's life. Finally, the students should participate actively in the developing design of their campus activity. Originality/value To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, this research is essential for future HU campus design. In addition to defining and describing all the campus urban design principles, this research provides HU decision-makers with an informed, holistic view of their students' satisfaction levels, needs and requirements within their urban campus design to develop the HU campus design. Moreover, this research provides a new vision for the future in the form of data and guidelines for a new campus design.
   The findings are intended to provide useful information to university managers, leaders, policymakers and urban designers who implement strategies to improve the quality of campus urban design. This research opens the door for new research by duplicating the same research contents and methodologies on another campus design within different regions and cultures to fully develop a universal guideline for campus urban design.

AB  - Plastic pollution of South Africa's marine environment is widespread, yet limited research exists on the distribution, accumulation and transport of plastic debris around South Africa. In this paper, numerical modelling is used to provide a first approximation of the pathways and accumulation of marine micro-plastics around South Africa. To account for a range of plastic classes, particles with two different densities are considered. Low-density (LD) particles represent low- and high-density polyethylene while high-density (HD) particles are representative of Polyethylene terephthalate and Polyvinyl chloride. While the majority of micro-plastic particles that enter the ocean from the five major coastal urban-industrialised centers beach along the coastline of South Africa, a third is exported to the open ocean. LD and HD particles are primarily exported to the South Atlantic and South Indian Ocean, respectively. Particles that beach along South Africa's coastline tend to accumulate in close proximity to the coastal urban-industrialised centers.

AB  - Overtourism is a contemporary phenomenon, rapidly evolving and underlined by what is evidently excessive visitation to tourist destinations. This is obvious in the seemingly uncontrolled and unplanned occurrence of urban overtourism in popular destinations and arguably a consequence of unregulated capital accumulation and growth strategies heavily associated with selling cities as tourism commodities. The vested interests of social movements has converged into growing protests against overtourism and associated degrowth campaigns have emerged out of this activism that calls for alternative governance and management measures that eschew touristic monoculture and simplistic economic growth-oriented models. Accordingly, we explore the evolution of the tourism degrowth discourse among social movement activists in Barcelona, and in particular, where this is related to claims associated with overtourism and the extent to which this might be influencing a paradigm shift from 'tourism growth' to 'tourism degrowth'. Methodologically, we draw from an overarching framework that leverages long-term ethnographic research in Barcelona. Here, we employ in-depth semi-structured interviews, participant observations, informal conversations and retrospective evaluation of field diary entries.

AB  - Improved nature provision in urban environments offers great potential for achieving both biodiversity conservation and public health objectives. Yet there are few experimental studies that address links between specific natural environments and physiological and/or psychological changes that could contribute to the health and wellbeing co-benefits of urban nature. In addition, relative to green space, the salutogenic impact of aquatic environments are understudied. Here, we present a feasibility study examining the use of low-cost wearable technology to quantify the psychophysiological effects of short-term exposure to urban wetlands. The study took place at the WWT London Wetland Centre, which is characterized by its contrasting biodiverse wetland habitat and surrounding urban setting. Thirty-six healthy participants experienced counterbalanced exposures to an indoor space, a wetland, an urban site. We continuously recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data and real-time physiological stress responses; with additional monitoring of post-exposure self-reported mood states. We found a significant effect of site on mean resting heart rate (HR), with increased HR in the urban setting, although this was only observed in participants with pre-existing high stress. We found no significant differences in other measures of physiological stress responses (heart rate variability and electrodermal activity). The EEG data showed modulation of high beta band activity only in the wetland setting, potentially related to changes in attention. However, the EEG findings were confounded by low quality signals and artifacts caused by movement and environmental interference. Assessments of self-reported mood states demonstrated an increase in positive feelings in the wetland setting. A pronounced decrease in negative feelings in the wetland setting was observed in stressed individuals only. Our results suggest that pre-existing stress levels may be an important modulator of the salutogenic effect of blue-green space. We provide partial support for the hypothesis that exposure to blue-green space promotes stress recovery and for the use of low-cost psychophysiological measurements to quantify the potential stress-reducing effects of blue-green space exposure in urban dwellers. Further technological refinement is required for this approach to become a viable tool to support evidence-based decision-making for public health and green/blue space provision.

AB  - The research and development of technology for maintaining an information networks, which are an important lifeline in the event of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, is indispensable in large metropolitan areas. One of the characteristics of urban disasters is the occurrence of evacuees who form large crowds due to population congestion. Under such circumstances, delay-tolerant networking, which has conventionally been considered an effective means of communication at times of disaster, does not always work sufficiently. We propose a routing method that reduces the number of message transfers significantly compared to the conventional methods by focusing on the movement characteristics of the pedestrians. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by computer simulation.

AB  - Post-dispersal seed predation by slugs is increasingly being acknowledged as a potentially important contribution to this ecosystem function. However, specific drivers of predation rates in different landscape contexts are still unknown. We assessed the role of slugs as facultative seed predators along an urban-rural gradient and identified scale-dependent anthropogenic drivers that might affect either slugs or their function as seed predators.
   We used a combination of seed cafeterias and pitfall traps in grassy areas of eleven schoolyards and five field margins surrounded by different land-use types to assess slug activity density and seed predation rates and quantified urbanization, habitat heterogeneity and microhabitat structure.
   We show that slugs are important seed predators regardless of anthropogenic land use. Their activity density was a significant predictor for seed predation but increases in woody vegetation and bare soil also increased seed predation. This indicates that the magnitude of seed predation might also be affected by slug foraging activity and feeding behaviour, which might be influenced by habitat features such as the availability of vegetation and bare soil. Our results suggest that not only assessing the activity density (as proxy for relative abundance) of seed predators but also identifying effects on their feeding patterns and behaviour might increase our mechanistic understanding of relationships between land-use changes and seed predation and their impact on cultivated and wild plant species.

AB  - Central to appropriate wildlife management is an effective monitoring program. Monitoring wildlife in urban environments offers unique challenges in the form of barriers, prohibited access and crime. It also, however, provides a unique opportunity to enlist residential communities in collecting data on distribution of a number of species. Opportunistic sightings data has its flaws, including the lack of data on species absences, and unequal sampling effort. Yet these data may still provide reliable information on the distribution of species and complement localized, hypothesis driven research. Where possible opportunistic sightings data should be validated against traditional methods to determine their value for long term monitoring programmes. We use Maxent to model citizen-reported sightings to determine whether sightings of Cape clawless otters (Aonyx capensis) can complement standardized river occupancy surveys to monitor an elusive, widely distributed species living within a fragmented urban/natural matrix. The drivers of otter presence and the predicted distribution of otters modelled from citizen sightings mirrored that provided by previously published results based on occupancy models in the same system, and highlighted further areas of suitable otter habitat and routes for dispersal. Involving citizens in the monitoring of the urban otter population complemented standardized occupancy surveys and provided additional benefits. In addition to alleviating the pressure on local authorities to allocate resources to routine monitoring, citizen involvement provides an opportunity to gather supplementary data on behaviour and/or threats to the species; shed light on the potential dispersal routes, and promote awareness and encourage coexistence with urban adapted wildlife.

AB  - The house, considered as a set of rooms, opens up the possibility of defining its habitation based on how those rooms are joined and knotted together. The way of knotting has not remained stable over time, nor has the mode of habitation. The first great European house, the Roman domus, knotted those rooms in unbroken continuity, open to the sky in the middle. This continuity made the house an unchangeable domestic abode, that united men with the gods in a way that was considered eternal. After two world wars, the eternal European city no longer existed, and a triumphant America transformed the domestic Roman knot into a juxtaposition of rooms that Louis Kahn moved closer to the ground in the Adler House. The house became a fragmented continuity of rooms whose route becomes an Eden for domestic appliances and its occupants. And then, at the beginning of this millennium, contemporary Eastern architecture introduced a new knot by contiguity that Ryue Nishizawa carried out in the Moriyama House. Occupying this abode results in flow between the rooms, adding movement as a new room. The house, as a consequence, is transformed into a place of immediacy of rooms and nature, opening the household's calendar to cyclical time, in tune with that nature. The goal of this domestic story, which jumps from Europe to America and ends in Asia, will be to identify the different ways of inhabiting and with them to define the different cities that emerge from these three ways of domestic knotting.

AB  - The epidemic in South Africa is characterized by high genetic diversity driven by multiple independent introductions. The bulk of these introductions occurred between 1985-2000 during which time HIV prevalence increased exponentially. Epidemic growth has stabilized in recent years with the implementation of several interventions. Here we identified distinct HIV clades from a large sequence dataset of southern African HIV sequences (n = 15,332). Each clade was characterized using phylodynamic and phylogeographic methods to infer their growth through time and space. The estimated date of origin for the 18 clades that were found, fell between 1979-1992 with strong growth during the 1990's. Phylogeographic reconstruction revealed wide dispersal of clades throughout the country with the city of Johannesburg as the focal point of viral dispersal. We found clear signs of decreasing growth rate in four of the clades since the advent of interventions, while other clades have continued to growth and expand. Our results demonstrate that interventions do not affect the HIV epidemic universally with major difference between different clades over time and space. Here we demonstrate the utility and flexibility of molecular epidemiological methods and demonstrate how they can potentially be a powerful tool in HIV epidemic monitoring in South Africa.

AB  - Urban grasslands often exist as fragmented patches with varying threat levels. These patches are generally inappropriately managed due to limited data on their responses to disturbance and seed bank regenerative potential. This study compared seed banks between non-naturally disturbed and undisturbed patches of South African subtropical grasslands in an urban environment. Standing vegetation was characterised via year-round quadrat and monthly transect sampling. The seed banks were sampled after the two main dispersal periods and assessed for species composition and density. The seed bank species (24) represented a subset (9%) of the standing vegetation, with forbs being the most speciose life form and grasses the most abundant. Disturbance had a moderate impact on seed bank density but significantly affected species composition and ordering. Clustering and ordination analyses separated seed banks based on disturbance history. However, seed banks in disturbed patches maintained the general character of the grassland type. Diagnostic, rare and threatened taxa were absent from seed banks, irrespective of disturbance history. Consequently, restoration will possibly require seed enrichment and species reintroduction rather than exploitation of natural seed banks. Identifying disturbance-sensitive species through seed bank surveys can inform grassland conservation and restoration strategies.

AB  - This paper presents global research trends involving highly cited articles on ecosystem services from 1981 to 2017 based on a bibliometric analysis of such articles from the SCI-E and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The analysis revealed that there were 132 highly cited articles, most of which were published between 2005 and 2014. Based on author keywords, the term ecosystem services was strongly linked to biodiversity. The top three journals in terms of total number of highly cited articles published were Ecological Economics, PNAS, and Ecological Indicators. Despite ranking sixth overall, Science ranked first in both impact factor and total citations per article. The US, UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden were the top five most productive and cooperative countries in the world based on total number of highly cited articles and co-authorship network, respectively. The US was highly connected to Canada, the Netherlands, China and the UK. Stockholm University and Stanford University were the most productive institutions in Europe and North America, respectively. Stanford University is associated with many scholars in the field of ecosystem services research because of the InVEST model. Robert Costanza was the most prolific and highly cited author, the latter being largely due to the first valuation of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, he and his co-authors published in 1997 in Nature. Terrestrial, urban, and forest ecosystems were the top types of ecosystems assessed. Regulating and provisioning services were the major ecosystem services studied. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were the main research focus. Most of these highly cited studies on ecosystem services are done on areas geographically located in North America and Europe.

AB  - Ocean pollution is a global issue; yet limited quantitative data on microplastic concentrations are available for the South African coastal shelf. Estuarine outlets within industrial areas that are found along the coastline serve as conduits for plastics and other pollutants to the ocean. This study investigated coastal plastic concentrations around KwaZulu-Natal. Forty-three manta trawl samples were collected and analysed over a period of one year. An average of 4.01 +/- 3.28 plastic particles/100 m(2) was found in surface trawls. Plastic concentrations in winter were significantly higher than those in summer (5.54 +/- 3.26 and 2.96 +/- 2.94 particles/100 m(2) respectively). The highest concentrations of plastics were found south of the city of Durban, with the highest concentration at Isipingo winter with 12.2 particles/100 m(2). Among the summer samples, the highest concentration of particles was off Amanzimtoti (9.54 particles/100 m(2)). The main plastic forms were fragments, films and fibres that were commonly white, clear, opaque, blue and black in colour. High plastic concentrations in the Durban area and sites close-by were expected due to the high levels of urbanization in the area, however, the difference in concentrations found between winter and summer was not expected and may have been due to the prevailing wind and/or current conditions on the sampling date.

AB  - Understanding changes in subdaily rainfall extremes is critical to urban planners for building more sustainable and resilient cities. In this study, the hourly precipitation data in 1971-2016 from 61 rain gauges are combined with historical land-use change data to investigate changes in extreme hourly precipitation (EXHP) in the Pearl River delta (PRD) region of South China. Also, 120 extreme rainfall events (EXREs) during 2011-16 are analyzed using observations collected at densely distributed automatic weather stations and radar network. Statistically significant increase of hourly precipitation intensity leads to higher annual amounts of both total and extreme precipitation over the PRD urban cluster in the rapid urbanization period (about 1994-2016) than during the preurbanization era (1971 to about 1993), suggesting a possible link between the enhanced rainfall and the rapid urbanization. Those urbanization-related positive trends are closely related to more frequent occurrence of abrupt rainfall events with short duration (<= 6 h) than the continuous or growing rainfall events with longer duration. The 120 EXREs in 2011-16 are categorized into six types according to the originating location and movement of the extreme-rain-producing storms. Despite the wide range of synoptic backgrounds and seasons, rainfall intensification by the strong urban heat island (UHI) effect is a clear signal in all the six types, especially over the inland urban cluster with prominent UHIs. The UHI thermal perturbation probably plays an important role in the convective initiation and intensification of the locally developed extreme-rain-producing storms during the daytime.

AB  - From November 2018, for several months, French politics and media were dominated by the so-called "gilets jaunes" [yellow vest] movement. Initially aimed at protesting against the rise in fuel prices, this social movement developed through roadblocks, the permanent occupation of roundabouts, and weekly demonstrations in major French cities. Through its atypical features, the gilets jaunes movement prompts us to further investigate the sociology of politicization, social movements, and how people "learn" activism. The aim of this debate is to bring together researchers (Z. Bendali, R. Challier, M. Della Sudda, and O. Fillieule) who have conducted field surveys on the actions and organization of the movement. The data gathered help us to understand the practical ways in which collective action and politicization are learned in and through participation in the gilets jaunes movement.

AB  - Originating in the UK in 2006, the Transition movement is oriented to local grassroots citizen-led efforts that prepare for and support a societal energy transition to a low-carbon future in response to climate change, peak oil, ecological degradation, and economic instability. Overlapping significantly with relocalization, degrowth/slow growth, local food, and related movements, and based on permaculture principles and a distributed network model, it embraces the opportunity to turn crisis into an opportunity to build more resilient, convivial, and vibrant local communities, declaring that if it's not fun, it's not sustainable. The Transition approach has spread rapidly around the world, including initiatives in over 100 communities and cities in Canada. This paper reports on the methods and results of a Canadian community-based research study aimed at understanding how and where the movement has taken root across the country, what Transition practice looks like, challenges and opportunities encountered, and lessons learned that could be applied within the movement and by others interested in the role of citizen-led initiatives for sustainability transition. Utilising a practice theory lens, drawing on an extensive web-scan of the movement's online presence, a survey and interviews with initiative (co)founders, an e-survey of Transition members/participants, regional structured story-dialogue workshops, and key informant interviews, and informed by input from a Movement Advisory Group, we describe the research process and explore what success and impact mean to those most active in the movement.

AB  - The benefits that urban green resources bring to humanity have received increasing attention, with the evidence from recent studies into public service provision specifically regarding access to green space being rather mixed. Despite a growing literature base, there is no consensus among scholars on how to measure green space access properly. The traditional GIS-based approach is criticized for inappropriately specifying geographic units and threshold distances, and for ignoring people's self-movement. This research proposes a novel approach, emphasizing the actual park users' activities, both spatially and temporally. We took advantage of the large dataset available from mobile phones to analyze billions of anonymized data samples in order to characterize the behavioral patterns of millions of people who accessed green space in an experimental procedure. We chose Shanghai as the case study because residential segregation had occurred expected to be accompanied by issues of environmental justice. The results found that social equity could be achieved, even where territorial inequity was manifest in a high-population-density context that is undergoing rapid urban growth and transition. Shanghai's vulnerable groups are not found to be unequally treated at present, but there are warning signs that market mechanisms may worsen the uneven development. Therefore, the local municipalities are required to rethink how to provide green infrastructure to different social groups, responding to the inequality and uneven development that capital can bring.

TI  - From Nationalist Rescue to Internationalist Cannibalism The Alternative Carnivalesque, Brass, and the Revival of Street Carnival in Rio de Janeiro
T2  - LUSO-BRAZILIAN REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - In Rio de Janeiro, the emergent street carnival revival of the past twenty years has come to rival in importance the city's "traditional" carnival of the samba school parades. This article explores the diverse repertoire choices of Rio's alternative brass band movement, which originated in the street carnival revival. I show how the movement, drawing on what I call the alternative carnivalesque, has transformed from a dominant preoccupation with cultural nationalism to embracing a belief that carnival should be a spontaneous space "to play anything," including a wide diversity of international genres. I explore how musicians have drawn on Brazilian tropes and ideologies from the past century regarding international engagements, such as "rescue" and "cannibalism." With this example, I argue for local and historicized theorizing of musical circulation rather than relying on generic theories that miss what is important to musicians in their local context.

AB  - Background: Literature has highlighted sex-based differences in the natural course of stroke and in response to treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Objectives: We aimed to compare the management and outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) among women and men on a French registry based on a federated network of emergency physicians and neurologists. Method: We included 2,790 patients received tPA between 2010 and 2016 from the stroke centers in the RESUVal area. We provided age-adjusted analysis and multivariate models for determining the role of sex in the outcome measures. Results: After age-adjustment, women presented more moderate to severe stroke at admission with more proximal occlusions. Among tPA eligible patients, the therapeutic strategy and in-hospital hemorrhagic complications were proportionally identical whatever the sex. The total ischemic time from onset symptom to thrombolysis did not differ from women to men. Age-adjusted 3-month mortality did not differ between women and men, and the determinants of mortality were age (relative risk [RR] 1.56 [1.37-1.78], p < 0.0001), proximal occlusion (RR 2.5 [1.88-3.33], p < 0.0001), and at least one complication (RR 2.43 [1.89-3.13], p < 0.0001). The determinants of poor functional outcome at 3 months were the sex (RR 1.22 [1.01-1.48] for women, p = 0.0385) and the occurrence of onset symptom in rural landscape (RR 1.26 [1.03-1.55], p = 0.0219) compared to urban landscape. Conclusions: We provided an exhaustive overview and real-life professional practices conditions in thrombolyzed AIS. Despite a later prehospital management in neurovascular units and more severe strokes at admission, women and men had both similar outcomes at hospital discharge and in 3-month survival, but women were associated to worst functional outcome at 3 months.

AB  - Inter- and transdisciplinarity are increasingly relevant concepts and research practices within academia. Although there is a consensus about the need to apply these practices, there is no agreement over definitions. Building on the outcomes of the first year of the COST Action TD1408 Interdisciplinarity in research programming and funding cycles (INTREPID), this paper describes the similarities and differences between interpretations of inter- and transdisciplinarity. Drawing on literature review and empirical results from participatory workshops involving INTREPID Network members from 27 different countries, the paper shows that diverse definitions of inter-and transdisciplinarity coexist within scientific literature and are reproduced by researchers and practitioners within the network. The recognition of this diversity did not hinder the definition of basic requirements for inter- and transdisciplinarity. We present five basic units considered as building blocks for this type of research. These building blocks are: (1) creation of collective glossaries, (2) definition of boundary objects, (3) use of combined problem- and solution-oriented approaches, (4) inclusion of a facilitator of inter-and transdisciplinary research within the team and (5) promotion of reflexivity by accompanying research. These were considered five basic units for effective inter- and transdisciplinary research although the 4th building block was also considered as matrix that holds all the others together.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are an increasingly important health concern, which pose great challenges for safe and sustainable control and eradication. This reality calls for management approaches that consider multiple aspects of the transmission cycle from a landscape and vector ecology perspective, to socio-economic elements that may increase exposure. This study seeks to better understand these pathways using dengue fever in the San Juan Bay Estuary (SJBE), Puerto Rico. Dengue is transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a species that thrives in cities. Here we ask which elements within the urban landscape could be managed to help prevent dengue outbreaks. We studied the potential of coastal wetlands in the SJBE to buffer vector proliferation, hypothesizing that wetland ecosystem services lead to lower dengue occurrence. We test this hypothesis using census-block level dengue data from 2010-13, including the largest epidemic in Puerto Rican history. Our analytical model includes socio-economic factors and environmental controls that may also affect dengue dynamics. Results from beta-binomial regressions and model averaging indicated that dengue occurrence was lower in neighborhoods with higher wetland cover even after controlling for population density and other socio-economic aspects. Our models suggest that heat hazard mitigation is partly responsible for the association between wetlands and dengue.

AB  - The clausiliid Carinigera buresi has a distribution that, considering its low vagility, is enigmatically disjunct. Carinigera buresi pharsalica occurs in Thessaly in central Greece, over 200 km outside the main range of C. buresi in NE Greece - SW Bulgaria. This range disjunction has led to the hypothesis that in antiquity the ancestors of C. buresi pharsalica were transported by the marble trade from NE Greece to Thessaly. To explore this hypothesis, we included samples from the NE Greek island of Thasos (the only area within the range of C. buresi from which marble was widely transported in antiquity) in a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of C. buresi. Maximum likelihood (GARLI) and time-calibrated Bayesian (BEAST) analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) from samples collected throughout the range of C. buresi indicate that the ancestral C. buresi pharsalica COI lineage reached Thessaly not from Thasos, but from the NE Greek mainland. This happened between 1,740 and 83,000 yr BP according to the BEAST analyses. Although this time interval does not entirely pre-date the earliest phase of marble transport in the region, we consider this mode of dispersal unlikely for two reasons: (1) our data show that C. buresi pharsalica must be older than estimated on the basis of geological calibration points; (2) our findings indicate that the dispersal event that brought C. buresi pharsalica to Thessaly did not follow ancient marble transport routes. We suggest dispersal via floating objects or aerial dispersal by birds as alternative hypotheses to dispersal by the historic marble trade. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic analyses also showed the COI haplotype of C. buresi from the city of Kavala to be nested among COI haplotypes from northern Thasos. This suggests possible human-aided dispersal of C. buresi from Thasos to Kavala.

AB  - Human activity is rapidly increasing the radiance and geographic extent of artificial light at night (ALAN) leading to alterations in the development, behavior, and physiological state of many organisms. A limited number of community-scale studies investigating the effects of ALAN have allowed for spatial aggregation through positive phototaxis, the commonly observed phenomenon of arthropod movement toward light. We performed an open field study (without restricted arthropod access) to determine the effects of ALAN on local arthropod community composition, plant traits, and local herbivory and predation rates. We found strong positive phototaxis in 10 orders of arthropods, with increased (159% higher) overall arthropod abundance under ALAN compared to unlit controls. The arthropod community under ALAN was more diverse and contained a higher proportion of predaceous arthropods (15% vs 8%). Predation of immobilized flies occurred 3.6 times faster under ALAN; this effect was not observed during the day. Contrary to expectations, we also observed a 6% increase in herbivory under ALAN. Our results highlight the importance of open experimental field studies in determining community-level effects of ALAN.

AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito [Aedes albopictus (Skuse)] is an invasive species of public health importance that is currently expanding its range in the Northeast United States. Effective Ae. albopictus control depends on a thorough understanding of factors influencing their abundance, spatial distribution, and habitat preference. We conducted a series of container surveys for Ae. albopictus larvae/pupae over 2 yr across nine sites in neighborhoods along its invasive range in southern New York. Selected sites represented a gradient of percent impervious surface and median household income. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) Ae. albopictus larval/pupal abundance increases and spatial distribution becomes less clustered as site-level median income decreases and percent impervious surface increases because of increased larval habitat quality and availability; and 2) container-level characteristics are predictive of Ae. albopictus larval/pupal infestation across a range of sites. In 2016, neither median household income nor impervious surface predicted Ae. albopictus abundance. In 2017, sites with greater impervious surface were more heavily infested by some measures. In both years, Ae. albopictus larval/pupal spatial distribution as measured by K-function was more clustered in with greater median household income. Most container characteristics were either not predictive of Ae. albopictus or varied between years. Based on the variability of predictive container characteristics, we conclude that identification of key containers is not useful in this region. However, Ae. albopictus can be nonhomogenously distributed or abundant based on income level and impervious surface. Improved control of immatures should consider these regional predictors of Ae. albopictus populations.

AB  - 1. Myrmica rubra (European fire ant) has invaded northern latitude coastal areas in North America. This macroscale distribution suggests that M. rubra is moisture- and temperature-limited, but the distribution of the invaded range may reflect the legacy of original introduction locations preserved by limited dispersal. 2. This study examined a two-decade population change in M. rubra (1994-2015) and the microscale abiotic (moisture and temperature), biotic (plants), anthropogenic (pesticide) and physiological (thermal tolerance) limits on the invasion at the Tifft Nature Preserve in Buffalo, NY (U.S.A.). Changes in the abundance of native ants and other invertebrates were also examined. 3. Despite localised declines with pesticide treatments, overall M. rubra forager abundance increased 27% between 1994 and 2015. Abundance increased the most in the warmest areas (native ants were unaffected by temperature), but M. rubra colony locations were strongly linked to higher soil moisture and lower soil temperature. Myrmica rubra ants also exhibited relatively low thermal tolerances consistent with high-latitude and high-elevation ants. 4. Where local M. rubra populations increased the most, native ant species decreased, and where local M. rubra populations declined, native ant species increased. Some arthropod species had lower abundance with M. rubra presence, but the impacts were less striking. 5. Myrmica rubra population growth was promoted at the microhabitat scale where relatively higher temperatures prompted foraging, and relatively lower temperatures and high moisture supported nesting. These results suggest that macroscale M. rubra invaded-range distributions in northern climates near coastal areas are replicated at the microscale where the ant prefers cooler, moister microsites.

AB  - Based on an ethnography of a countercultural street market (Tianguis cultural del Chopo), this paper explores how networked and reticular forms of political engagement sedimented since the market began to occupy the street some forty years ago. How to understand the effects of cultural practices on the relationship to space, the longue duree of territorial constructions and the construction of political subjectivity? How did this countercultural space-time appear in Mexico City and what does it mean for our understanding of the political in a city where popular culture plays an important political role? These are the questions that guide this paper. Data was collected through an ethnographic approach (participant observations, life story interviews, participatory oral history).
   We first explain why we have chosen to focus on popular culture in order to study politics. Secondly, through a historical and ethnographic description of the Chopo since 1982, we analyse the relationship between lifestyle changes between 1982 and 2019 and the transformation of modalities of engagement. In conclusion, we propose some theoretical reflections on political action and the relationship to space, time and rationalities in an urban world. Indeed, the Chopo brings together individuals connected to a flow of information, through the temporary occupation of urban space. Weekly co-presence in the street is fundamental to this network, especially for its experiential and affective aspects. This is precisely what generates political subjectivity.
   While the effects of this type of political engagement are difficult to measure in the sense that no clear demands are made on the government, it is with a more ethnographic sensitivity that we can analyze lifestyle transformations engendered by these transgressive cultural practices. If we measure politics by the institutional distribution of power and resources, the temporary occupation of the street every Saturday could not be called politics. If, on the other hand, our measurement of politics focuses on transformations in subjectivities and ways of living, the Chopo has palpable effects, especially in terms of empowerment and the ability to express difference.

AB  - With today's high motorisation levels and limited street capacity, drivers suffer from traffic overload leading. Urban congestion is renewable in time and occurs mainly on signalised intersections. Real-time traffic management lacks practical methods of prediction and mitigation of the effects of congestion thanks to information from traffic detectors. The paper presents the concept of a criterion of reliability and functional availability (R & AV) for use in traffic management. It is presented on the basis of empirical research into traffic performance and surveys on a congested signalised lane. A definition of the critical length of the remaining queue is introduced, which enables the calculation of durations of congestion and determination of a practical indicator of functional availability. The critical values of the traffic performance measure presented in the paper address primarily road manager's needs, but may also reflect drivers' needs, or result from traffic restrictions in certain urban areas.

AB  - Wildlife can respond to urbanization positively (synanthropic) or negatively (misanthropic), and for some species, this is a nonlinear process, whereby low levels of urbanization elicit a positive response, but this response becomes negative at high levels of urbanization. We applied concepts from foraging theory to predict positive and negative behavioral responses of coyotes (Canis latrans) along an urbanization gradient in the Chicago metropolitan area, USA. We estimated home range size and complexity, and metrics of 3 movement behaviors (encamped, foraging, and traveling) using Hidden Markov movement models. We found coyotes exhibited negative behavioral responses to highly urbanized landscapes: coyotes viewed the landscape as lower quality, riskier, and more fragmented (home range size and complexity, and time spent encamped increased). Conversely, we found evidence of both positive and negative responses to suburban landscapes: coyotes not only viewed the landscape as higher quality than natural fragments and equally risky, but also viewed it as fragmented (home range size decreased, time spent encamped did not change, and home range complexity increased). Although the spatial and behavioral responses of coyotes to urbanization became increasingly negative as urbanization increased, coyotes were still able to occupy highly urbanized landscapes. Our study demonstrates how wildlife behavioral responses can be dependent on the degree of urbanization and represents one of the first descriptions of apex predator space use and movement in a highly urbanized landscape.
   As urbanization increases globally, wildlife must respond. We applied concepts from foraging behavior to determine how coyote movement behavior varies across a gradient of urbanization. In suburban landscapes, coyotes responded positively by requiring less space to live. In highly urbanized landscapes, coyotes responded negatively by requiring more space and spending more time not moving. Despite these challenges, coyotes can thrive in highly urbanized landscapes, such as downtown Chicago, USA.

AB  - The urbanization in Campinas, Sao Paulo state, and the surrounding region had occurred in a fast and intensive way, causing big changes in the landscape and resulting in an expressive devastation of the forest areas and its natural vegetation cover. This circumstance had given rise to the forest fragmentation process. Therefore, mapping these fragments and evaluating them according to some environmental indicators is very important because it allows to evaluate the basin conditions and to identify the priority areas for the implementation of recovery and management actions. Thus, this work presents a classification of the forest fragments identified in 'Ribeirao Anhumas' watershed, Campinas, SP state, using as indicators the following landscape metrics: size, nuclear area and circularity index. Therefore, a Group Analysis was carried out using the statistical software XSTAT, as a way to identify the similarities between the fragments, considering the aforementioned indicators, and grouping them into classes. A correlation between them has also been developed in order to identify possible relationships of interdependence. It was found that this river basin is highly urbanized, where there are fewer fragments with smaller sizes and in most cases isolated. Although the fragments were generally classified as good, there is a considerable aggravating factor for the environmental quality of these fragments: the nuclear area index was quite low, about 25%, this implies that much of the area covered by fragments is subject to edge effects. Furthermore, through the cluster analyses the fragments had been grouped into three classes, where the size had been one of the most determinant factor. It was also identified the sub-basin of the low course as the less urbanized region, with larger fragments and greater potential for the implementation of management and recovery actions on the forest fragments, such as ecological corridors.

AB  - Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660ha) in the agreste of Paraiba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified.

AB  - Social capital includes access to resources based on social networks, similar to how economic capital is access to fiscal resources. We explore ethnic social capital as a variant of social capital that includes the social resources that are available to a person as a result of being a member of an ethnic and cultural network. This study identifies the way that ethnic social capital is important for understanding the resilience of ethnic minority youth in the context of inequality including living in impoverished and high-crime neighborhoods. This study examines social capital in 239 males and females aged 14 to 22 years from a racially and ethnically diverse urban community with neighborhoods impacted by high levels of crime in the northeast United States. Compared with results from a racially homogeneous (non-Hispanic White) population living in an urban area of the Midwest, the diverse sample demonstrated different aspects of social capital that are highly correlated with the cultural value of collectivism. Specifically, the diverse sample showed significantly higher participation in their community and reaching out to support others. The sample in the Midwest, demonstrated greater feelings of safety in the community, greater satisfaction with their position in life, and greater ability to ask others for help. Both samples showed an equal level of tolerance for diversity. Results are discussed in terms of examining the cultural manifestations of ethnic social capital and resilience with ethnic minority populations.

AB  - The Asian long-horned beetle (ALB), a Cerambycidae, is an urban tree pest native to East Asia accidentally introduced to other continents via solid wood packing material. It was first detected in Europe in 2001, and since then infestations have been found in ten European countries. Using a 485-bp-long fragment of the mitochondrial barcode gene (COI), we studied the genetic diversity and structure of ALB populations in both native and invaded ranges, with a specific focus on Europe. Three main haplotypes were found across the native and invaded distribution of ALB. The native area in Asia was the most diverse with 23 haplotypes, but a low genetic structure was observed. Our results revealed up to nine distinct haplotypes that was diverged by no more than six mutational steps in European populations collected from 2001 to 2016. Nevertheless, the genetic structure was characterized by one widespread dominant haplotype in Europe. The overall complex genetic structure observed in Europe suggested a convoluted invasion scenario. Indeed, invasion history may include several introduction events as well as secondary dispersal.

AB  - In today's increasingly interconnected world, outbreaks of disease or contamination can spread widely and cause considerable impact on public health. Proactively assessing the ability to identify the source of an outbreak in a networked system is a critical step in aiding emergency and operational preparedness management prior to a crisis situation. While many methods have been developed to identify the source of an outbreak once it has occurred, limited research has been devoted to developing measures to assess the overall ability of a network structure to support accurate source identification, which we call traceability. Furthermore, while significant work has focused on understanding the role of network structure on propagation dynamics, its impact on traceability has yet remained unstudied. Here, we introduce a novel, comprehensive measure of network traceability, which calculates the information-theoretic entropy of the posterior probability distribution over feasible sources resulting from inferring the source location. By capturing information about the full posterior probability distribution, this measure presents an improvement over the binary logical outcome of the prediction accuracy metric generally applied to assess source identification method performance. Using food supply chain networks as an example, we use this measure to provide the first study systematically evaluating the role of network structural parameters on traceability, comparing both synthetic networks generated to exhibit a range of structural features known to be relevant to contamination propagation and real networks representing the Chinese pork supply chain across various cities. This analysis yields insights about the relationship between traceability and network structure, some counter-intuitive, and more generally, illustrates how this measure can be used in emergency and operational preparedness to proactively assess network traceability and recommend strategies for its improvement.

AB  - Contemporary functional linkages and their relationships with the underlying settlement structure have been widely explored within polycentric urban configurations, but little attention has been paid to their adjacent rural regions. This paper examines the spatial patterns of commuting versus business travel in rural metro-adjacent regions to explain their reconfigured urban structures. These travel patterns are compared by considering workers' education levels and occupations to investigate how rural metro-adjacent regions offer different opportunities for highly and non-highly skilled workers. Based on two surveys conducted by the authors in 2012, this work focuses on Castilla-La Mancha (CLM, Spain), a rural region under the influence of Madrid. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of considering different functional linkages when explaining the underlying urban network. In particular, the results reinforce the idea of consolidating the polycentric spatial organization of urban centers in CLM, although this concentration is greater for commuting travel purposes and for highly skilled professionals. Conversely, the openness of CLM to other Spanish regions (including the adjacent metropolitan region) is greater for business travel than for commuting. The results also illustrate that the level of engagement, both in commuting and in business travel, increases with education. Finally, the results show that business travel occurs over longer distances than commuting does for all workers residing in rural metro-adjacent regions, regardless of education.

AB  - With the increasing demand for the urban traffic simulation, the mesoscopic model takes center stage with its advantage that can simulate a large network with less computational cost and gets the information of individual vehicles. This study proposes a mesoscopic traffic simulation model called Agent-based Mesoscopic Cell Transmission Model (AMCTM). It models both longitudinal and lateral movement of vehicles. The longitudinal movement is based on the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) and implements the traffic signal by adjusting the amount of flow between cells according to the signal. The lateral movement includes mandatory lane-change to allow the vehicle to follow the specified route and the optional lane-change to reduce the travel time. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct the experiment with a test network including signalized intersection. The result of the experiment shows that the AMCTM performs well several phenomena occur in the urban network. This study is expected to contribute to the performance evaluation of the newly developed traffic-related technologies such as autonomous vehicles and V2X communication-based control systems.

AB  - In the 1990s the idea that proximity to trade routes was the main driving force of the process of urbanization of early medieval Rus' again became dominant in Russia. But speaking of "trade," as applied to the Viking Age, it is easy to fall into modernization. There was no "free trade" then. In order not to be sold into slavery, the merchant had to be protected by a society with authority in international affairs. It is from this perspective that one should consider the evidence of craft and trade preserved in the layers of early urban settlements. The combination of administrative-organizational and trade-craft factors in their functional spectrum is a key problem to be developed. An important aspect of the problem of urbanization is the study of the socio-cultural and economic base on which cities grew. The process of formation of Slavic central places in the Northwest Russia, which began in the 7th - 8th centuries, was interrupted during the Viking Age. The first "proto-cities" usually appeared in new places. Even where the continuity between the "hillfort" and the "city" was really revealed, the guarantee of this was either a socio-political cataclysm, or the inclusion of this item in the zone of new influence. In itself, the development of local centers can't be identified with urbanization. The latter meant a radical change in the structure of archaic East European societies. The beginning of movement along the military trade routes, the arrival of Arab silver to the north opened up unprecedented prospects for the implementation of the tributes and products of trade exchange collected in the north. It was then that the first "proto-cities" emerged. The materials of the earliest Ladoga indicate that the beginning of the mass marketing of craft products to the rural population occurred already at the late 8th - early 9th centuries. For example, the production of glass according to the Eastern recipe was established there for the subsequent production of beads, which were the currency in the purchase of furs. This meant that by the end of the 8th century a fairly stable supply of the necessary components of the technological process from the Middle East was established. This did not testify to individual "trade", but to the purposeful exploitation of the adjacent territories. One can interpret such kind of central places as administrative and organizational centers of a new type. They should not be confused with either "cities" or "rural places": this is a special phenomenon in the social culture of Early Middle Ages. Its appearance was impossible without breaking the previous hierarchy of values, authorities, sacred ties. So one shouldn't be surprised that "smooth continuity" of old and new centers is not observed. Not tribes and ethnic composition but, first of all, social roles were changed (although an influx of paramilitary contingent from the north actually took place). Proto-cities became the epicenters of the formation of new elite and new, Old Rus' cultural traditions, which then quickly spread to the rural area.

AB  - The struggle for affordable housing reflects the widespread structural tensions that exist between property markets and the provision of housing. Recent years have seen frequent protests that have highlighted problems in the Irish housing sector, along with the emergence of various housing movements, especially in Dublin, where the lack of affordable housing is severe. This paper argues that these campaigns have contributed to the increased public debate on commodified housing models, signalling a strong demand for a coherent and inclusive national housing policy in Ireland. In particular, I examine the activities of the Home Sweet Home movement (HSH), a collective organization of housing activists that occupied the Apollo House building in Dublin's inner city in 2016-2017. This movement challenged private housing market solutions and the central role played by financialisation in economic and social life. Whilst considering that Ireland is suffering a housing crisis which cannot be easily solved, this paper combines a critical analysis of housing movements that resist neoliberal housing models, the HSH action in this context, and the challenges involved in changing the government's approach to housing.

T2  - IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA  - English
AB  - Autonomous vehicles operating in urban environments need to deal with an abundance of other dynamic objects, such as pedestrians and vehicles. This requires the development of predictive models that capture the complexity and long-term patterns of motion in the environment. We approach this problem by modeling movement directions of a typical object in the environment over time. We propose a method to build a continuous map to capture spatiotemporal movements. At a given coordinate in space and time, our method provides a multi-modal probability density function over the possible directions an object can move in. We achieve this by projecting data into a high-dimensional feature space using sparse approximate kernels, and passing the high-dimensional features through a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. A mixture density network (MDN) with von Mises distributions is then trained on the hidden representations of the LSTM. Once trained, the outputs of the MDN can be used to construct the probability distribution over movement directions. The model is continuous in both spatial and temporal domains, as we can query the change of directional uncertainty at arbitrary resolution in space and time. We conduct experiments on three simulated and three real-world benchmark datasets with pedestrians and vehicles, and demonstrate that both the continuous nature and the addition of temporal patterns improves performance.

AB  - Context Free-roaming domestic cats are a widespread invasive species, occurring throughout the globe in urban and rural environments alike. However, robust estimates of cat occupancy and abundance, especially in rural, agricultural landscapes, are largely unknown.
   Aims To estimate cat occupancy and abundance within forested habitat in a fragmented agricultural region of Indiana, USA.
   Methods Free-roaming cats in 55 forest patches were captured from 2004 to 2010 to assess the effects of landscape attributes on cat occupancy probabilities. During 2009-10 abundance of cats in each habitat patch was estimated based on natural markings of captured individuals.
   Key results Across the entire study (2004-10) cats in 50 of the 55 patches were detected, but detections varied temporally and spatially. Average occupancy probability was estimated at = 0.773 (s.e. = 0.109), and detection probability was estimated as P = 0.204 (s.e. = 0.012). Distance to human structures and forest patch isolation both were found to negatively influence cat occupancy. In total, 57 individual cats were captured in 2009 and 55 in 2010, when unique individuals were distinguished. Across all forest patches, average cat abundance was n = 1.08 in 2009 and n = 0.91 in 2010, ranging from 0 to 7 among sampled patches.
   Conclusions Overall, the distribution of free-roaming cats across a rural agricultural landscape varied temporally and was associated with proximity to human structures and the proximity of other forest habitat. Similarly, abundance was found to vary spatially and temporally.
   Implications The findings suggest free-roaming cats are widespread throughout agricultural ecosystems, but their distribution is dynamic and non-random. Additionally, the potential for cats to impact native fauna inhabiting remnant forest patches is high in fragmented agricultural ecosystems due to the concentration of native species utilising these patches. Further research is needed to determine the effects free-roaming cats are having on native species in human-dominated, rural ecosystems, and what conservation measures might be implemented to best mitigate any impacts.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, being the principal vector of dengue (DENV1 to 4), chikungunya and Zika viruses, is considered as one of the most important mosquito vectors. In Brazil, despite regular vector control programs, Ae. aegypti still persists with high urban density in all the states. This study aimed to estimate the intra and inter population genetic diversity and genetic structure among 15 Brazilian populations of Ae. aegypti based on 12 microsatellite loci. A total of 510 specimens were analyzed comprising eight locations from northern (Itacoatiara, Manaus, Novo Airao, Boa Vista, Rio Branco, Porto Velho, Guajara-Mirim and Macapa), three from southeastern (Aracatuba, Sao Jose de Rio Preto and Taubate), one from southern (Foz do Iguacu), one from central west (Cuiaba) and two from northeastern (Campina Grande and Teresina) regions of Brazil. Genetic distances (pairwise values of F-ST and Nm) and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were statistically significant, independent of geographic distances among the sites analyzed, indicating that them are under a complex dynamic process that influence the levels of gene flow within and among regions of the country. Bayesian analysis in STRUCTURE revealed the existence of two major genetic clusters, as well as there was genetic substructure within them; these results were confirmed by AMOVA, BAPS and DAPC analyses. This differentiation is the cumulative result of several factors combined as events of multiple introduction, passive dispersal, environmental and climatic conditions, use of insecticides, cycles of extinction and re-colonization followed by microevolutionary processes throughout the country. Isolation by distance also contributed to this differentiation, especially among geographically closer localities. These genetic differences may affect its vector competence to transmit dengue, chikungunya, Zika and the response to vector control programs.

AB  - Transport planning, in theory, is underpinned by rational analysis of the benefits of proposed developments. However, project outcomes do not always follow the results of that analysis and uncertainty is evident during the decision making processes. This research has devised and demonstrated a method to analyse that uncertainty, focussing on the early stages of the project lifecycle.
   Stakeholders were interviewed to elicit their opinions about a normative scenario and these interviews coded using qualitative data analysis techniques. The emerging variables were analysed, using a structural dynamic model, based in complexity theory, which develops measures of connectivity to classify variables by their roles in inception and uncertainty in the project.
   The case study was based on a disused railway with contradictory views on the benefits of reopening it. In the normative scenario, the rail service is re-instated in conjunction with a new sustainable urban development. The findings from this case study were that executive leadership and collaboration between Local Authorities were the most influential determinants for progress, and that the prime causes of uncertainty were the extant economic and planning policies. During the course of the project, structural governance developments have occurred in the UK that have endorsed these findings.

AB  - One of North America's major avian migratory pathways occurs along a large anthropogenically modified coastal region of southeastern Virginia, USA. Because hundreds of avian species migrate along the east coast of North America, understanding factors affecting birds and their health is of ecological and conservation interest. Within southeastern Virginia, 14 tick species have been documented, all of which may serve as vectors of vertebrate pathogens. We tested 5 hypotheses to understand how varying levels of urbanization within an urban matrix of a coastal region affected avian parasitism rates. We sampled resident and migratory birds for ticks across an urbanization gradient at 5 permanent and 6 ad hoc sites from August 2012 to August 2014 and determined parasitism rates at the landscape and site scales. At the landscape scale, the proportion of birds parasitized by ticks was reduced at more urbanized sites. Urbanized sites were largely associated with higher water and impervious surfaces in the surrounding area, which may have prevented dispersal of ticks or hosts to isolated urban locations, and lower tree cover, which likely reduced tick survival because of decreased leaf litter. At the site scale, properties associated with being on or near the ground (i.e., foraging guild and age) were the best predictors of tick parasitism. These findings demonstrate that the effects of urbanization are neither uniform nor straightforward. In addition to affecting avian species composition, anthropogenic changes to the landscape are affecting the relationship between avian hosts and their parasites, a finding that has important implications for avian conservation efforts and management practices.

AB  - Aerial roots have evolved in plants from diverse ecosystems, many facing specific environmental challenges associated with their natural or agricultural setting. In coastal species exposed to wind and waves, including mangroves, soft anoxic substrates have resulted in highly developed aerial root systems. In the rainforest, aerial roots of hemi-epiphytic figs enable life to begin higher in the canopy while climbing plants, such as ivy and Monsteras, depend on structurally very different aerial roots to climb vertical substrates. Maize, globally one of the three most important cereals, develops aerial roots presumably reducing lodging in high winds. In each of these cases, the dominant hypothesized role for aerial roots is to provide support and enabling greater heights to be reached. But do aerial roots of these plant groups also contribute to resource uptake and movement? This article explores the current knowledge of aerial root physiology and structure from each of these interesting and challenging environmental conditions and discusses how understanding these adaptations and niche requirements has value for improving crops, protecting our coastlines, improving our urban green spaces, and managing biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Throughout human history, gardens comprised many purposes. With the evolution of society, there were villages, towns and cities organized according to geographical, economic, social and cultural characteristics of each epoch. Throughout the history of mankind, the "green" element has always been present. Gardens accompanied this development depending on the theories in vogue and had several purposes: they were sacred spaces, leisure spaces or spaces of healing; they were architectural elements in the characterization of outdoor spaces; they were areas of experimentation and research. After the Industrial Revolution, urban areas have expanded dramatically, occupying large amounts of rural soil replacing natural vegetation with the modernist urban structure. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, the acquired garden concept had been challenged, stretching, instead, over a horizontal surface in the form of green roofs which characterized many of the modernist buildings. In fact, from the modernist movement on, horizontal covers, that lead to various experiments in the context of green roofs and garden which may be used and enjoyed by its inhabitants or covered and accessible only for maintenance purposes, have appeared. Through the end of the 20th century and early 21st century, the horizontal roof was then an experimental ground on which architecture could respond to a new challenge: the green facades or vertical gardens. In this way, the built environment can be the support for a new concept of green structure and urban or rural "green", i.e., a vertical garden: a green facade. This new "green skin" of the building can regulate the temperature and air quality as well as control the amount of light inside the building or be an aesthetic element of the architectural coating. New architectural elements are created through which adverse environmental conditions are mitigated, either on new construction or on architectural rehabilitation.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance and its environmental component are gaining more attention as part of combating the growing healthcare crisis. The One Health framework, promulgated by many global health agencies, recognizes that antimicrobial resistance is a truly inter-domain problem in which human health, animal agriculture, and the environment are the core and interrelated components. This prospectus presents the status and issues relevant to the environmental component of antibiotic resistance, namely, the needs for advancing surveillance methodology: the environmental reservoirs and sources of resistance, namely, urban wastewater treatment plants, aquaculture production systems, soil receiving manure and biosolid, and the atmosphere which includes longer range dispersal. Recently, much work has been done describing antibiotic resistance genes in various environments; now quantitative, mechanistic, and hypothesis-driven studies are needed to identify practices that reduce real risks and maintain the effectiveness of our current antibiotics as long as possible. Advanced deployable detection methods for antibiotic resistance in diverse environmental samples are needed in order to provide the surveillance information to identify risks and define barriers that can reduce risks. Also needed are practices that reduce antibiotic use and thereby reduce selection for resistance, as well as practices that limit the dispersal of or destroy antibiotic-resistant bacteria or their resistance genes that are feasible for these varied environmental domains.

AB  - Goals: This study focuses on assessing disaster risks in a typical inmegacity in Latin America. The baseline focuses on the logistics characteristics of the last mile, the vulnerability of buildings and the mobility of pedestrians.
   Design / Methodology / Approach: A risk assessment procedure is developed using logistic metrics through a methodology that captures the most relevant urban information within a square kilometer, and two complementary methods that provide support to obtain metrics associated with the occurrence of disasters.
   Results: The results show that the majority of blocks in the analyzed area have levels of precautionary risk due to their high level of store density, structure's vulnerability, pedestrian movement and freight flow.
   Limitations of the research: The main limitations for the data collection were the insecurity, the level of informality and the chaos presented in the studied area.
   Practical implications: The main findings allow decision makers to know the most vulnerable areas of the place and, thus, propose recommendations for public policies based on urban knowledge. In addition, the proposed method can be taken as a reference to be applied to other zones of similar characteristics.
   Originality / Value: This research develops a methodology that evaluates the risks and mitigates the impact on a specific unstudied commercial area, combining three existing methodologies to correctly asses risk on certain zones. This work is an extension of the work of Huivin et al. (2020); the added value is that it provides deeper literature reviewing that help decision-makers and researchers to know the actual state of the art.

AB  - Feminist debates in the context of an active women's/feminist movement found their way into the Greek academy in the second half of the 1970s, initially in history. Urban studies and geography were 'late-comers' in these debates which took place in different disciplinary environments where geography courses were taught. The article presents a personal account in and through the development of feminist approaches in urban geography, drawing from my teaching and research experience since 1982 in a department of urban and regional planning. This experience has been accumulated as a hard exercise in navigating through the denial and reluctant consent of various levels of administration, students' changing acceptance, some women's valuable active support, in the university and beyond, and other colleagues' opposition or indifference. In this process, recent and longer-term developments have contributed to form a (continuously negotiated and contested) space for feminism, for tolerance, diversity and difference, in which a 'we' has been tortuously formed which speaks across worlds, participates in a plurality of communities, communicates in more than one languages and in a plurality of voices between 'local' and 'international'.

AB  - Although physiological changes are the most evident indicators of skin aging by alteration of the skin's structure and function, we question whether skin aging is also affected by the structure and assembly process of the skin microbiome. We analysed the skin microbiomes of 73 healthy Chinese women in two age groups (25-35 years old and 56-63 years old) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; the overall microbiome structure was significantly different between the two age groups. An analysis using ecological theory to evaluate the process of microbial community assembly processes revealed that the microbiomes of the older group were formed under a greater influence of the niche-based process, with the network of microbes being more collapsed than that of the younger group. Inferred metagenomic functional pathways associated with replication and repair were relatively more predominant in the younger group whereas, among the various metabolism-related pathways, those associated with biodegradation were more predominant in the older group. Interestingly, we found two segregated sub-typing patterns in the younger group which were also observed in the skin microbiomes of young Chinese women living in four other cities in China. The results of our study highlights candidate microbes and functional pathways that are important for future research into preventing skin aging and which could lead to a comprehensive understanding of age-related skin microbiome characteristics.

AB  - Railway networks contribute to the direct mortality of wildlife through collisions with trains, which can threaten vulnerable wildlife populations even in protected areas, including grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada. Mitigation to reduce bear-train collisions requires information about how grizzly bears use the railway spatially and temporally and how particular types of use might increase collision vulnerability. We used data from 27 grizzly bears fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars between 2000 and 2016 to relate railway use by bears via resource selection functions to variables that described land cover, human use, and topography. We used the same suite of explanatory variables to distinguish pairs of 4 types of steps, in which 3 successive GPS points (with 2-hr fix rates) included >= 1 within 30 m of the rail (hereafter on) and 2 others that defined locations where bears effectively entered the railway (first fix off rail, next 2 on), crossed it (only the middle fix on the rail), continued along the railway (all 3 fixes on), or exited the railway corridor (first 2 on, last off). We compared both sites of higher use and each of these 4 step types to the relative frequency of bear-train collisions, predicting a positive correlation for continue step types. Relative to available locations, bears were more likely to use the railway close to railroad sidings (sections of twinned track where trains sometimes stop), at intermediate distances from human-use features (e.g., town sites, highways, trails), in areas with lower values of the compound topographic index (a proxy for wetness; within 500 m), and within 90 m of rugged terrain. Seasonally, bears made greater use of the railway in spring and fall. Among 1,515 sequences of 3 steps, crossing locations comprised >50% and were most distinct from continue locations (about 20%), which occurred in areas with more rugged terrain (within 300 m), closer to railway sidings, in spring and fall, and with steps that were 60% shorter. Contrary to our prediction, past reports of bear-train collisions were negatively correlated with continue locations and unrelated to overall use or any other movement type. Our results suggest that railway use by bears increased where it provided increased forage or easier travel, particularly in spring and fall, but more work will be needed to determine the mechanistic basis of bear-train collisions. Meanwhile, mitigation efforts such as habitat alteration or warning systems might target locations where past strikes are concentrated for grizzly bears or other sensitive populations.

AB  - Objective: Transport-related cycling can contribute to employee's increased physical activities in their daily lives, with potential health and environmental benefits. Still, a theoretical understanding of the links between the perceptions of physical environment and transport-related cycling through social cognitive theories is unclear. In addition, there is a lack of understanding on the moderating effects of the perceived physical environment on social cognitive pathways when predicting transport-related cycling. The purpose of this study was to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework to determine (a) whether TPB mediates the effects between the perceived physical environment and transport-related cycling and (b) whether the perceived physical environment moderates TPB-cycling relations.
   Methods: Using a prospective design, Chinese employees (N = 193) self-reported their perceived physical environment of their workplace neighborhood (i.e., residential density, land-use diversity, land-use accessibility, street connectivity, infrastructures, aesthetics, traffic-related safety, and crime-related safety), attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavior control (PBC), intention, and duration and frequency of transport-related cycling in the last week. One month later, self-reported cycling for transport was again collected from a subset sample of employees (N = 98). Mediation and moderation structural equation models linking perceived physical environment, TPB constructs, and transport-related cycling were tested.
   Results: The effects from residential density to attitudes and subjective norm, from land-use diversity and street connectivity to subjective norm and PBC, and from aesthetics and crime-related safety to attitudes, were found significant and positive. Attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC predicted intention, in which intention further predicted employee's future transport-related cycling one month later. Importantly, attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC mediated the relations from land-use diversity and street connectivity to intention, while intention mediated the effect from PBC to employee's future transportrelated cycling. Past behavior showed significant effects on attitudes, subjective norm, PBC, intention, and employee's future transport-related cycling. The effect from past behavior to intention was mediated by the social cognitive variables of attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC. However, no moderating effects of perceived physical environments on the TPB-cycling relations were found, except the moderating effect of crime-related safety on the path from PBC to cycling.
   Conclusion: Current results indicate that Chinese employee's transport-related cycling are a function of environmental (i.e., perceived physical environmental attributes) and social cognitive (i.e., attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention) factors. Findings of the current study can inform the development of multi-component behavioral change interventions targeting the improvement of transport-related cycling for employees.

AB  - The process of invasion, naturalization, dispersion and invasive activity of non-native woody species in 5 regional floras, 5 urban floras and over 30 floras of the protected areas is discussed. It has been established that 182 non-native species out of 95 genera and 45 families are currently at different naturalization stages in the spontaneous flora of Ukraine. In terms of life-forms, they may be divided as follows: trees - 41%, shrubs - 35%, trees/shrubs - 15%, lianas - 9%. Most species spread both via seed dispersal and the vegetative way -56%, using only seed dispersal - 42%, only the vegetative way -2%. According to the preliminary rating of species-wise invasive activity, 71 species (40%) have naturalized completely, among them 20 invasive species, including 12 transformer species, 29 potentially invasive species, and 22 naturalized species which demonstrate no invasive tendencies. The initial stages of invasion of 111 species are as follows: introduction - 9%, survival - 36%, adaptation of the reproductive sphere - 28%, establishment, formative of local populations - 27%. In terms of dispersion, non-naturalized species are divided as follows: rare - 45%, local - 16%, sporadic - 6%, unique - 12%, spreading under control beyond collections and expositions in botanical gardens and arboretums - 21%. Twelve transformer species, the greatest threat to local diversity, are Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Amorpha fruticosa, Bupleurum fruticosum, Elaeagnus angustifolia, E. rhamnoides, Fraxinus ornus, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, P. vitacea, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rhamnus alaternus, Salix x blanda and 8 invasive proper species: Berberis aquifolia, Colutea orientalis, Daphne laureola, Prunus cerasifera, P. serotina, Quercus ilex, Viburnum tinus, Vitis vinifera. The list of alien species, most widespread in 50 regions of Europe, includes Robinia pseudoacacia (42 regions), Ailanthus altissima (40), Acer negundo (38), Prunus cerasus (34), Quercus rubra (34), Rosa rugosa (34), Prunus domestica (31). The mitigation of the impacts of these species on local biodiversity is possible via the restoration of local native plant communities, land use organization, strict selection of introduced species prior to the introduction, culture of planting management, preventive measures and extending awareness and sharing of information about plant invasions. Therefore, Ukraine's spontaneous flora is notable for the active process of naturalization of non-native woody species with considerable involvement of invasive alien species. This is the first and preliminary evaluation of the invasive activity of woody species in Ukraine's flora. The manifestations of the global tendency of increased involvement and invasive activity of alien woody species in domestic flora have been confirmed. These conclusions are also relevant for elaborating the system of preventive, containing and mitigating measures regarding plant invasions in Ukraine.

AB  - Increased urbanization causes traffic and parking issues especially in metropolitan cities like Karachi, London, Shanghai, etc. To accommodate parking issues for the vehicles mainly in urban areas (excavated) underground parking areas under or nearby high rise buildings are preferred. As a result of excavation, ground movements occur that have major impact on structures, buildings and utilities. The past research usually oversimplified surface structure as an equivalent elastic beam, which is unable to represent the behavior of a framed building realistically. In this study, the detrimental effects (i. e. crack pattern) on a two floor RCC framed building founded on piles due to an adjacent excavation-induced ground movement are investigated. Elasto-plastic coupled-consolidation analysis was adopted. The hypoplastic constitutive model was used to capture soil behavior. It is an advanced model which is able to capture the soil unique features which are non-linear behavior, stiffness degradation (with stress, strain & path dependent), and stressstrain dependent soil dilatancy. The concrete damaged plasticity (CDP) model was used to capture the cracking behavior in the concrete beams, columns and piles. It was revealed that the induced slope and tilting are not equal. Consequently, the frame was distorted. As a result, tension cracks were induced at the inner side of the column.

AB  - Ecological land with considerable ecological value can be regarded as an important indicator in guaranteeing ecosystem function and sustainable development. Generally, the urbanization process has been considered to be the primary factor affecting ecological land use. However, the influence of agricultural development, particularly in a typical farming area, has rarely been studied. In this paper, we present a method to assess the ecological risk of ecological land (ELER) in a black soil area in northeastern China. Furthermore, the underlying factors were detected using the geographically weighted regression model, which took into account conditions of natural elements, the urbanization process, and grain production conditions. The results indicate that ecological land experienced remarkable changes with an evident loss and decline from 1996-2015. The ELER progressively increased in the concentrated farming area and the western agro-pastoral ecotone, and the ecological land in the eastern forest area was always at a high risk level. According to the regression coefficients, the relationships between influence factors and ELER could be better explained by the variables of elevation, slope, proportion of rural residential area, and ratio of cultivated land area to residential area. To summarize, agricultural occupation and urban expansion were verified as the two main causes of ecological land loss, as well as elevated risks. In light of the current situation, measures such as policy adjustment and ecological restoration should be taken to avoid risk and optimize land use.

AB  - We are currently facing myriad socio-ecological crises, from global climate change to resource depletion to the loss of dozens of species every day. Despite a longstanding and impassioned environmental movement, these problems persist and are worsening. The extent and degree of human-induced change on the planet is significant enough to have placed us in a new geological age: the Anthropocene. Three perspectives are engaged as a way to understand this new era and address our fractured human-nature relationship: (1) political ecology, (2) the ecological humanities, and (3) the informal economy. An exploration of intersecting themes leads to the start of a new theoretical contribution, which manifests at the convergence of theories: a "whole-of-community" approach. This whole-of-community approach is one that is concerned with both inter-human and interspecies relationships to move us towards communities that are place-based, integrated, participatory, and grounded in eco-social justice and equity. Pollinating bees are used as an illustrative example of how to achieve this vision. Bees can be both a bridge and gateway. As a bridge, they can provide a way of (re)connecting human and nonhuman nature and as a gateway, they can guide humans to a deeper understanding and connection with urban natures. Reconciling humans with the rest of the biotic community through place-based initiatives is possible by fundamentally and radically expanding our current framing of the concept of community.

AB  - Road alleys are multifunctional features in open landscapes that serve as ecological corridors connecting habitats, and play an important role in sustaining ecological stability. However, multiple road authorities claim that tree-lined routes pose a threat to traffic safety and should therefore be removed. This aspect of safety seems crucial to authorities, significantly overwhelming the benefits of road alleys. Problems with the vitality of the trees (which are mainly mature and aging) deliver arguments for cutting them down. The aim of this paper is to examine the environmental and natural value of road alleys based on a 14 km long section of the Gamerki-Jonkowo Road in the Province of Warmia (Northeast Poland). Further, we aim to verify the degree of hazard posed by trees to be felled for safety reasons. An examination framework with six components was developed for the research. This framework includes a tree risk assessment and vitality evaluation, pulling tests, an examination of the protected hermit beetle and lichen species, and an examination of bat fauna. The results revealed that no trees were in the resignation phase and confirmed that the alley is a unique natural habitat with protected species of lichen, a few bats, and valuable insect species, among others the hermit beetle (Osmoderma barnabita). Therefore, the alley cannot be perceived only as a component of the road infrastructure. The maintenance of the trees seems to be essential when taking into account the environmental stability of the region.

AB  - Foxes and cats are the most abundant medium-sized urban carnivores. To date, however, there has been a lack of effort to synthesize data on the spatial and trophic resources used by these two carnivores, despite the importance of this information for assessing their similarity and roles in urban food webs. In this paper, we first synthesize all available information on the trophic patterns and home-range size of these two predators based on a total of 91 studies. Second, we conduct statistical analyses to test the influence of environmental and biological variables such as regional differences, habitat characteristics, age, and sexual status on their home-range size and diet patterns within urban habitats, and then evaluate the methods used to investigate these components. Our findings highlight the lack of studies that simultaneously monitor the diet and home-range size of both predators within urban habitats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare fox and cat home-range size and diet. Foxes exhibited larger ranges than cats, while intact cats showed larger home ranges than desexed cats. Diet diversity obtained for both predators confirmed their trophic plasticity within urban habitats. Both predators consumed fewer mammals and invertebrates in highly disturbed habitats compared to medium ones. We also found that the procedure of data acquisition significantly influenced fox and cat home-range sizes. In terms of diet, the type of recovered samples had a significant effect on the diet composition of both predators. To improve our understanding of the relative impact of these two urban carnivores on urban wildlife, we recommend simultaneously studying both species in future studies. Moreover, methodological standards for both diet and home-range size studies are needed to allow comparisons.

AB  - Our present-day society is increasingly standardised and wasteful of resources and is witnessing a disturbing loss of biodiversity. In reaction to this, more and more concerned citizens are trying to reduce their environmental footprint by concrete action. One of the most fundamental of these actions lies in a return to healthy and tasty food, locally sourced. The search for old and local varieties of fruits and vegetables corresponds with this movement and with the desire to maintain the biodiversity of cultivated plants. But, at the same time, this tendency throws doubt on the qualities of the varieties that succeeded the old ones, and even on the notion that plant varieties can indeed be improved. This doubt is widespread and concerns many sorts of fruits and vegetables, without distinction, and ignores the fact that progress has been made for more of these varieties than the consumer suspects. In order to understand the role that these old varieties can play, it is necessary to give a brief account of their history, their decline and their return to favour. The renewal of interest in old varieties of fruits and vegetables has been encouraged by several factors, including governmental intervention, notably the creation of new categories in the French catalogue of varieties in 2008 and 2009 and the creation, in 2016, of a national coordination for plant genetic resources. Between public policies and the aspirations of citizens, the mobilisation of local actors and scientists must be consolidated on the basis of programmes currently underway in in several regions. The best place where awareness raising can be implemented are the vegetable gardens and orchards. New enthusiasm for gardening and for cooking encourages the uses of old varieties in recipes which must be created or rewritten according to contemporary needs.

AB  - The conducted researches have the purpose to develop the optimum approach which allows us to correctly estimate the hydrogeological conditions of buiding sites. The general patterns of formation, distribution and movement of groundwater within the sections of the planned and existing buildings and adjacent territories for Kyiv as an example were studied. For the study area and similar sites with complex hydrogeological conditions, which are caused by the alternation in section and in terms of layers of unsteady thickness with different filtration coefficients, it is more appropriate to use the method of mathematical modeling of geofiltration for predictive calculations. Since there is no detailed hydrogeological map of the site, it is advisable to build a natural hydrogeological model on the basis of engineering and geological survey data (groundwater levels data) for different periods reproducted by GIS.
   The obtained results make it possible to justify the mathematical model and to perform predictive modeling with sufficient accuracy for technogenically disturbed territories. The application of mathematical modeling allows avoiding unnecessary rough schematization of natural hydrogeological conditions, taking into account the complexity and diversity of boundary groundflow conditions, and thus give more realistic assessment of engineering measures impact on hydrogeological conditions of the territory.
   In order to take into account the patterns of formation, distribution and movement of groundwater for territories with dense urban development it is advisable, according to the authors, to simulate processes geofiltration according to the scheme given in this article. At the same time, the creation of scientifically sound mathematical and cartographic space-time natural hydrogeological model of the territory is the defining moment for further modeling. Application of Darcy Flow module of ArcGIS software enables to detect and specificate groundwater flow recharge and discharge conditions. This makes it possible, on the one hand, to avoid unnecessary schematization of natural hydrogeological conditions, and on the other hand, to take into account the complexity and diversity of groundflow boundary conditions, to give a more realistic assessment of possible engineering measures impact on the hydrogeological conditions of the territory during the construction.

AB  - This article analyzes the occupation of Joana D'Arc, the basis of Unemployed Workers Movement (MTD, in Portuguese) in Campinas/SP, between 2013 and 2018. Observations and interviews were carried out, from the perspective of Political Process Theory (TPP), which provides important conceptual tools to think about political mobilization. According to this perspective, the coordination among the activists is crucial to produce a collective actor - the collective agents are formed in solidary interaction during the own process. In this sense, we hypothesize that the MTD gained strength as a collective actor from the various conflicts with public agencies. The field research allowed to analyze the relations of the actors more closely, collaborating to the conclusion that the movement establishes several tensions with the public organs. Thus, the movement brings a new perspective on the housing issue and the right to decent housing in Campinas.

AB  - The Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong in 2014, which was the city's largest scale civil disobedience movement, was first initiated by two university professors and a Baptist Reverend. They advocated the use of non-violent civil disobedience to fight for universal suffrage and genuine election of the Chief Executive in Hong Kong. Though the Umbrella Movement did not end up in successfully changing the electoral system of Hong Kong, its impact on students, academics and the civil society was far beyond the few months of occupation. At the same time, activist scholars had to pay the price for their political activism outside the academia. This paper reflects on the experience of activist scholars in the Umbrella Movement, evaluates their roles in pursuing social change, the challenges they faced, and their impact on students, the academia, and the civil society.

AB  - In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena and geographical expansion, there is a pressing need for a more effective environment logging for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM.

AB  - This research was carried out in Caceres - Mato Grosso, on the Paraguay River, upper Pantanal - Brazil, and its objective was to analyze the changes of coverage with the advance of land use and occupation along the period from 1980 to 2013. Thus, images LANDSAT were georeferenced, classified and processed, while the thematic class, quantified and edited. In addition to the cabinet procedures, fieldwork was carried out, which allowed the identification of the main ways of using the banks and channels of the river system. The research showed that the main economic activity developed is cattle ranching with gradual values over the years - the same more than doubled from 1984 to 2003. The results evidenced important transformations in the landscape with significant suppressions of the vegetal cover, that is, in the period analyzed, in more than 50% of the area there was some kind of transformation - deforestation or conversion of uses (pasture areas for urban expansion). Concerning to the edges' channel, engineering repairs were the main alternatives adopted to contain the erosive processes, especially in the urban perimeter and in concave sections, parallel to BR-070.

AB  - The phenomenon characterised by faster growth of the side of trees exposed to sunlight relative to the opposite side is termed plant phototropism. Vertical trunks of silicified wood occur in situ in the Hongliuxia area of Yumen City in north-western Gansu Province, China. A few trunks in the area exhibit well-preserved growth rings. Two petrified stumps reveal positive phototropism values of 279 degrees-293 degrees in the northwest direction. Living plants in Yumen City, Lanzhou City of Gansu Province and Beijing City showed positive phototropism values of 210 degrees-255 degrees +/- 5 degrees in the south-west direction. The evidence from wood phototropism supports clockwise rotation of the North China Block from previous palaeomagnetic studies since the Early Cretaceous. The petrified wood stumps in the Hongliuxia area of Yumen City are associated with 109 Ma strata corresponding to the main stage of the Yanshanian movement.

AB  - This paper analyses the urban design processes of the square "Praca do Comercio", in Lisbon. It comprises two distinct moments in its history. The first moment is about the period in the aftermath of the 1755 earthquake. The second analysis moment is about the late XX, and the early XXI century. It confronts a methodological analysis of the iconography and cartography of those periods, with the current local observations and their spatial visual assessment. The paper has three parts. First, it presents the six proposals submitted for "Praca do Comercio" in the second half of the XVIII century. Another sets of four-period maps are also shown as these maps include also the medieval city designs. This reveals the continuity of the different projects' ideas for the "Praca do Comercio". The second part deals with the placement of the D. Jose I (1714-1777) equestrian statue. This section discusses the placement of the statue as part of an overall plan where the "Praca do Comercio" acts as a stage for the D. Jose I statue. The ideology of public praise towards the reigning king is evident in this tie-in between the square and the statue. At last, the square's different functions and uses during the late XX and the early XXI century are presented. For that, two recent projects are analysed. The first developed between 1992 and 2000 and the second from 2010. The analysis of the square designs reveals the existence of a strong connection with the past. The projects recover the medieval square design, both the opening towards the Tagus River and its design, regardless of the different proposals advances and retreats in relation to its form, notable buildings, and dimensions. Public art acts in an unabridged whole with the urban design. This is near to the notion of urban composition, in that the monument transcends the idea of a sculptural object and becomes the entire urban set. This understanding is in contrary to the notion of public art as a decorative element apposed on pre-existing spaces. The urban composition is also in contrary to the idea of public space as an outdoor gallery where the art pieces are independent units without any coherent dialog with the public space. The 1992 and 2010 plans, although formally and materially different, present the concomitant ideas. Both present ideas for the occupation of the lateral arcades of the square as the touristic and living areas. The current project (2010 drawing), much criticized by architects in the media, abandoned the ideas of the previous plan (1992). These included a road tunnel and an underground car park. The 2010 project includes some movement architectural barriers. It also presents a new design for the pavement based on a diagonal grid that leads to a novel reading of the square. These projects, proposed in the XVIII-XXI centuries, show how to interpret the memories, the symbolism and the uses of the "Praca do Comercio". The recent projects are dissonant about the image of the square, but nonetheless, all projects respect the attributes of its genesis.

AB  - Increased globalization has accelerated the movement of species around the world. Many of these nonnative species have the potential to profoundly alter ecosystems. The mechanisms underpinning this impact are often poorly understood, and traits are often overlooked when trying to understand and predict the impacts of species invasions on communities. We conducted an observational field experiment in Canada's first National Urban Park, where we collected trait data for seven different functional traits (height, stem width, specific leaf area, leaf percent nitrogen, and leaf percent carbon) across an abundance gradient of the invasive Vincetoxicum rossicum in open meadow and understory habitats. We assessed invasion impacts on communities, and associated mechanisms, by examining three complementary functional trait measures: community-weighted mean, range of trait values, and species' distances to the invader in trait space. We found that V. rossicum invasion significantly altered the functional structure of herbaceous plant communities. In both habitats V. rossicum changed the community-weighted means, causing invaded communities to become increasingly similar in their functional structure. In addition, V. rossicum also reduced the trait ranges for a majority of traits indicating that species are being deterministically excluded in invaded communities. Further, we observed different trends in the meadow and understory habitats: In the understory, resident species that were more similar to V. rossicum in multivariate trait space were excluded more, however this was not the case in the meadow habitat. This suggests that V. rossicum alters communities uniquely in each habitat, in part by creating a filter in which only certain resident species are able to persist. This filtering process causes a nonrandom reduction in species' abundances, which in turn would be expected to alter how the invaded ecosystems function. Using trait-based frameworks leads to better understanding and prediction of invasion impacts. This novel framework can also be used in restoration practices to understand how invasion impacts communities and to reassemble communities after invasive species management.

AB  - Heterogeneity-diversity relationship (HDR) is commonly shown to be positive in accordance with classic niche processes. However, recent soil-based studies have often found neutral and even negative HDRs. Some of the suggested reasons for this discrepancy include the lack of resemblance between manipulated substrate and natural settings, the treated areas not being large enough to contain species' root span, and finally limited-sized plots may not sustain focal species' populations over time. Vegetated green roofs are a growing phenomenon in many cities that could be an ideal testing ground for this problem. Recent studies have focused on the ability of these roofs to sustain stable and diverse plant communities and substrate heterogeneity that would increase niches on the roof has been proposed as a method to attain this goal. We constructed an experimental design using green roof experimental modules (4 m(2)) where we manipulated mineral and organic substrate component heterogeneity in different subplots (0.25 m(2)) within the experimental module while maintaining the total sum of mineral and organic components. A local annual plant community was seeded in the modules and monitored over three growing seasons. We found that plant diversity and biomass were not affected by experimentally created substrate heterogeneity. In addition, we found that different treatments, as well as specific subplot substrates, had an effect on plant community assemblages during the first year but not during the second and third years. Substrate heterogeneity levels were mostly unchanged over time. The inability to retain plant community composition over the years despite the maintenance of substrate differences supports the hypothesis that maintenance of diversity is constrained at these spatial scales by unfavorable dispersal and increased stochastic events as opposed to predictions of classic niche processes.

AB  - The wood-feeding subterranean termite, Globitermes sulphureus Haviland (Blattodea: Termitidae) is an important decomposer and a secondary pest in agricultural areas such as oil palm and coconut plantation. Little is known with respect to the role of G. sulphureus in ecology, biology, dispersal range, and its control measures. Adding to these, knowledge concerning the colony of G. sulphureus in the urban is considered limited since attention is intensely given to the native G. sulphureus colony in the forested settings. In this study, samples of G. sulphureus were collected from 10 grounded populations and another 10 native populations throughout the Northern part of Malaysia. 30 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed and characterized from transcriptome dataset of urban-originating G. sulphureus enriched for di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeat motifs. Thirty primer pairs were successfully amplified DNA fragments from 600 isolates of G. sulphureus, revealing an overall of 180 alleles. The number of alleles per locus identified ranged from 3 to 9. Among sequences containing microsatellites, dinucleotides repeats were the most abundant (44.57%), followed by trinucleotides repeats (41.99%), tetranucleotides repeats (11.18%), pentanucleotides repeats (1.84%), and hexanucleotides repeats (0.42%). This is the first report of microsatellite polymorphisms in G. sulphureus. The microsatellite primers developed in this current work may facilitate in population genetic study of this termite species.

AB  - Climate change increases the risks of heat stress, especially in urban areas where urban heat islands can develop. This literature review aims to describe how severe heat can occur and be identified in urban indoor environments, and what actions can be taken on the local scale. There is a connection between the outdoor and the indoor climate in buildings without air conditioning, but the pathways leading to the development of severe heat levels indoors are complex. These depend, for example, on the type of building, window placement, the residential area's thermal outdoor conditions, and the residents' influence and behavior. This review shows that only few studies have focused on the thermal environment indoors during heat waves, despite the fact that people commonly spend most of their time indoors and are likely to experience increased heat stress indoors in the future. Among reviewed studies, it was found that the indoor temperature can reach levels 50% higher in degrees C than the outdoor temperature, which highlights the importance of assessment and remediation of heat indoors. Further, most Heat-Health Warning Systems (HHWS) are based on the outdoor climate only, which can lead to a misleading interpretation of the health effects and associated solutions. In order to identify severe heat, six factors need to be taken into account, including air temperature, heat radiation, humidity, and air movement as well as the physical activity and the clothes worn by the individual. Heat stress can be identified using a heat index that includes these six factors. This paper presents some examples of practical and easy to use heat indices that are relevant for indoor environments as well as models that can be applied in indoor environments at the city level. However, existing indexes are developed for healthy workers and do not account for vulnerable groups, different uses, and daily variations. As a result, this paper highlights the need for the development of a heat index or the adjustment of current thresholds to apply specifically to indoor environments, its different uses, and vulnerable groups. There are several actions that can be taken to reduce heat indoors and thus improve the health and well-being of the population in urban areas. Examples of effective measures to reduce heat stress indoors include the use of shading devices such as blinds and vegetation as well as personal cooling techniques such as the use of fans and cooling vests. Additionally, the integration of innovative Phase Change Materials (PCM) into facades, roofs, floors, and windows can be a promising alternative once no negative health and environmental effects of PCM can be ensured.

AB  - The landscape complexes state assessment, including natural and anthropogenically transformed ecosystems, is the basis for the organization of rational nature management and biological diversity conservation. A significant amount of remote sensing data already accumulated and constantly replenished can become the basis for a large-scale spatial and temporal analysis of the local ecosystems. However, the necessary condition for that, in our opinion, is the use of regionally verified ground survey data along with remote sensing data. Such ground survey data may be represented by regional reference plots of ecosystems having different states (natural, disturbed, converted, and regenerated). As the characteristics associated with species composition and vegetation condition become more detailed, the importance of ground-based measurement increases. On the example of the forest-steppe and steppe areas of Middle Povolzhye (Samara region) as an ecotone with a mosaic combination of preserved natural ecosystems, agroecosystems, urban areas, spontaneously recovering ecosystems, we can demonstrate the importance of regional reference plots network for ground support of remote sensing data processing. In this paper, we discuss some methods of combining regional reference plots with remote sensing data during the ecosystem analysis. These methods are the result of the joint investigations of two research groups of ecologists and remote sensing data processing specialists.

AB  - Despite the diversity of China's financial system and the reforms that have already occurred, the system is heavily bank-dominated, and the Big Four extend almost half of all loans in China. These banks often extend loans to state-owned enterprises and in recent years have had the largest proportion of nonperforming loans (NPLs). These large, state-owned banks have been shown to be less efficient than other types of banks (such as joint-stock or city-owned banks) in China. Although interest rate liberalization has marked a major step toward financial marketization, implicit government guarantees, inaccurate credit ratings, and segmented markets have prevented the free movement of interest rates in unleashing market forces. It is argued that deteriorating economic indicators forces the government to focus on ensuring sufficient liquidity in the economy. Hitting China's ever-present growth target appears to be a priority that supersedes reform objectives in the financial sector.

AB  - Antisocial behavior (AB), including violence, criminality, and substance abuse, is often linked to deficits in emotion processing, reward-related learning, and inhibitory control, as well as their associated neural networks. To better understand these deficits, the structural connections between brain regions implicated in AB can be examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which assesses white matter microstructure. Prior studies have identified differences in white matter microstructure of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), primarily within offender samples. However, few studies have looked beyond the UF or determined whether these relationships are present dimensionally across the range of AB and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. In the current study, we examined associations between AB and white matter microstructure from major fiber tracts, including the UF. Further, we explored whether these associations were specific to individuals high on CU traits. Within a relatively large community sample of young adult men from low-income, urban families (N = 178), we found no direct relations between dimensional, self-report measures of either AB or CU traits and white matter microstructure. However, we found significant associations between AB and white matter microstructure of several tracts only for those with high co-occurring levels of CU traits. In general, these associations did not differ according to race, socioeconomic status, or comorbid psychiatric symptoms. The current results suggest a unique neural profile of severe AB in combination with CU traits, characterized by widespread differences in white matter microstructure, which differs from either AB or CU traits in isolation and is not specific to hypothesized tracts (i.e., the UF).

AB  - Both invasive species and their biological control agents face barriers to expansion, which provide opportunities to limit invasions or may enable target invasive species to exist in enemy-free space. A better understanding of the various barriers to the spread of insects introduced to control invasive plants will allow for more targeted release programs and potentially shorter lag times from introduction to management. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, two seed eating beetles (Exapion fuscirostre and Bruchidius villosus) have been introduced to control the invasive plant Cytisus scoparius. These biological controls are predicted to be effective only at high rates of seed destruction, so any factors that limit their colonization or population sizes may allow C. scoparius populations to grow, leading to ecological and economic harm. In this study, we investigate relative impacts of biological control agents in relation to two barriers to insect movement: urbanization and elevation. We find that the impacts of B. villosus are not different between urban and rural sites, but that relative impacts of both biological control agents decrease with increasing elevation, a pattern consistent across 2years of measurements. Cytisus scoparius populations experience substantial seed destruction in urban settings, strongly suggesting successful population control. The low seed destruction at high elevation sites could indicate that biological control agents are ineffective there, and that C. scoparius may exist in enemy-reduced space.

AB  - Within a context dominated by the seemingly paradoxical juxtaposition of gentrification and abandonment in New York City during the early 1980s, Peter Marcuse developed an influential typology of displacement that can be conceptualized as a movement from the most readily observable forms of "last-resident" displacement to increasingly less measurable forms of "exclusionary displacement" and "displacement pressure." While the typology depends heavily on the explanatory frame of demographic transition and the movement out of space, Marcuse also included the possibility of a contradictory form of "chain displacement" that often occurs in non- and/or pregentrification spaces without demographic change. Using geocoded data from 16 years of eviction records in Dane County Wisconsin, this research not only demonstrates the existence of chain displacement within specific neighborhoods, but also exposes sites of "multiple eviction" that combine with forms of disadvantage and relative demographic "stability" rather than patterns more characteristic of gentrification processes.

AB  - Due to geotechnical uncertainties, existing underground infrastructure, the construction of deep-pit foundations in dense urban areas is particularly challenging as there is a propensity for building and structural settlement to occur. Recognizing the need to proactively manage safety risks during construction, a new risk analysis approach that combines complex networks and association rules mining (ARM) is proposed. An improved Apriori algorithm is developed to unearth abnormal monitoring types. Then, complex network theory is introduced to examine the characteristics of the coupled relationships existing between different types of abnormal monitoring types. This research identifies and examines complex network measures to understand the topology of settlement networks. It is revealed that settlement networks confirm to both scale-free and small-word properties indicating that risks are not random events. This new approach of combining ARM with complex network is applied to examine deep foundation pits that are constructed for a subway project in Wuhan, China. It is demonstrated that proposed approach can successfully reveal the association rules between safety risk monitoring types and the coupling of risks. Preventative actions can therefore be undertaken in advance to mitigate against potential risks that are identified from the abnormal monitoring combinations.

AB  - The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, an oligophagous borer that specifically attacks the Arecaceae family, poses a serious threat to commercial and ornamental palms. Originally from tropical Asia, the RPW has spread to Africa and Europe, reaching the Mediterranean region 30 year ago. Characterizing its spread is a key aspect of effectively managing its geographical expansion. Using georeferenced RPW occurrence data from 2012 to 2013 in Israel, we sought to better understand its spatial spread. Our objectives were to: (1) describe the spatiotemporal distribution of RPW in three regions (northern, western and southern) that were thought to constitute a risk to the vast date palm plantations across the Beit She'an Valley (BSH), (2) quantify the dynamics of spread; and (3) initially characterize the influence of host species on RPW dispersal. We found that the spatiotemporal distribution of RPW significantly differed between regions. The weevils' geographical occupancy areas increased by 853% and 571% in the northern and western regions, respectively, while no increase was observed in the southern region. In the northern and western regions, RPW spread toward BSH date palm plantations and an initial analysis has shown that host area and RPW captures were significantly correlated. Based on our analysis, we propose the following hypotheses: (1) Ornamental and particularly Canary palms are highly favorable hosts for population establishment and dispersal in comparison with date palm plantations; (2) thus, the RPW spread from urban areas toward date palm plantations in BSH is attributed to the density and distribution of these hosts.

AB  - Various complexities are involved in allocating and managing road and kerbside space in cities to adequately meet demands. This paper primarily draws from experiences faced in Sydney CBD to provide space for freight while the city is simultaneously undertaking major transport infrastructure projects and managing unprecedented levels of private sector development. A direct impact of this combined activity has been a managed reduction in kerbside capacity with significant impacts to loading zones for freight and servicing. All this is also occurring when last mile logistics activity is increasing substantially primarily as a result of eCommerce activity.
   While accommodating business growth with reduced kerbside capacity, the approaches taken to manage freight over the last three years have resulted in some intrinsic successes for transport network demands. Some of this owes to policies and infrastructure plans established long before the last few years while some is down to ongoing current work and perseverance. For all aspects of the transport network management, a primary goal throughout this ongoing transformation is keeping Sydney CBD successful and vibrant for business. This considers the movement of people and goods, including the people moving the goods.
   This paper examines how space for freight is being provided and managed throughout this transformation period from the perspective of a network manager. It examines how space is used, how this changes in the face of capacity and social challenges and, the outcomes realised to date. The paper highlights the alternatives to regular kerbside parking and also considers challenges the future could bring. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vector control is still our primary intervention for both prevention and mitigation of epidemics of many vector-borne diseases. Efficiently targeting control measures is important since control can involve substantial economic costs. Targeting is not always straightforward, as transmission of vector-borne diseases is affected by various types of host movement. Here we assess how taking daily commuting patterns into consideration can help improve vector control efforts. We examine three tropical urban centers (San Juan, Recife, and Jakarta) that have recently been exposed to Zika and/or dengue infections and consider whether the distribution of human populations and resulting commuting flows affects the optimal scale at which control interventions should be implemented. We developed a stochastic, spatial model and investigated four control scenarios. The scenarios differed in the spatial extent of their implementation and were: 1) a response at the level of an individual neighborhood; 2) a response targeted at a neighborhood in which infected humans were detected and the one with which it was most strongly connected by human movement; 3) a limited area-wide response where all neighborhoods within a certain radius of the focal area were included; and 4) a collective response where all participating neighborhoods implemented control. The relative effectiveness of the scenarios varied only slightly between different settings, with the number of infections averted over time increasing with the scale of implementation. This difference depended on the efficacy of control at the neighborhood level. At low levels of efficacy, the scenarios mirrored each other in infections averted. At high levels of efficacy, impact increased with the scale of the intervention. As a result, the choice between scenarios will not only be a function of the amount of effort decision-makers are willing to invest, but largely epend on the overall effectiveness of vector control approaches.
   Author summary Control and prevention of Aedes-transmitted viruses, such as dengue, chikungunya, or Zika relies heavily on vector control approaches. Given the effort and cost involved in implementation of vector control, targeting of control measures is highly desirable. However, it is unclear to what extent the effectiveness of highly focal and reactive control measures depends on the commuting and movement patterns of humans. To investigate this question, we developed a model and four control scenarios that ranged from highly focal to area-wide larval control. The distribution of humans and their commuting patterns were modelled after three major tropical urban centers, San Juan, Recife, and Jakarta. We show that as implementation is applied across a wider area, a greater number of infections is averted. Critically, this only occurs if the efficacy of control at the neighborhood level is sufficiently high. A consistent outcome across the three settings was that the focal strategy was most likely to provide the best outcome at lower levels of effort, and when the efficacy of control was low. These outcomes suggest that optimal control strategies will likely have to be tailored to individual settings by decision makers and would benefit from localized cost-effectiveness modelling studies.

AB  - Urbanization of coasts creates stresses on adjacent marine communities, but the full impact is seldom known owing to scarce historical records. Paleoecological analysis of sediment cores can be a powerful means of reconstructing baseline benthic communities, but is particularly challenging for continental shelves where dead-shell assemblages are prone to greater time-averaging than in natural sediment sinks such as deltas, coastal bays, and estuaries. We compared temporal changes in the composition of bivalve shell assemblages collected from box cores on the Palos Verdes (southern California, USA) shelf to a 40 yr time series of annually collected living benthic assemblages in the same area in order to calibrate bivalve core assemblages to known changes in community composition during wastewater remediation. Older (pre-1970) core assemblages were then used to reveal the nature of bivalve communities from the early 20th century and the extent to which present-day communities match, i.e. have recovered to, early urban baselines. Deep bioturbation and only moderate sedimentation rates (0.2 cm yr(-1)) damp the magnitude and rapidity of changes in core assemblage composition. Despite the geological complexity, bivalve core assemblages (1) detect known late 20th century dynamics in broad outline, (2) reveal the undocumented rise of chemosymbiont-bearing bivalves during the early 20th century, and (3) establish that the present-day community is largely but not fully recovered to its pre-effluent, early urban (1900-1930) baseline. Thus, cores capture the nature, timing, and duration of macrobenthic response to 20th century wastewater, validating this approach for shelf settings with scarce or no historical data.

AB  - Giving land managers the ability to predict invasion patterns can provide planning tools for acquisition and management of protected areas. We compared the effects of roads and streams, two substantial pathways for delivery of invasive plant propagules and sources of disturbance that may facilitate invasions, on the abundance of non-native invasive plants in 27 protected areas in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. As an extension of our road analysis, we also evaluated specific road type as a predictor of protected area invadedness. We found that road and stream predictors did not improve on a model that included only other covariates (e.g., distance to an urban area, average canopy cover, average slope, edge-to-interior ratio, percent agricultural land, and percent developed land). In this model, only percent agricultural land was marginally significant in predicting parcel invadedness. However, we found that four-wheel drive (4WD) roads did predict protected area invadedness well relative to other road types (primary, secondary, and local) and better than a covariates-only model. The role of 4WD road density in predicting protected area invadedness may be explained by their relation to recreation, the unmaintained nature of 4WD roads, or the accumulation of mud and plant materials on 4WD vehicles. Although we found overall streams and roads in general to be poor predictors of invadedness of protected areas by invasive plants, we do propose that our finding of a relationship between plant invasions and density of 4WD roads merits further investigation in the future.

AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are currently under threat, particularly in developing countries. In Mexico, intensive land use and inadequate monitoring policies have resulted in the severe degradation of the country's freshwater ecosystems. This study assesses how the macroinvertebrate communities in the Pesqueria River, located in Northeastern Mexico, are affected by riparian land use, in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators to evaluate the macroinvertebrate integrity of the Pesqueria River. First, we characterized the land use cover in the riparian channel. Second, we sampled 16 sites for benthic macroinvertebrates along the main channel during the wet and dry seasons. Third, we evaluated the influence of the riparian channel land use on the macroinvertebrate community using 42 different biological metrics. The land use characterization depicted a riparian channel mainly influenced by agricultural and urban land use. Eighty-one invertebrate taxa were identified during the study. Permutational analysis of the variance analysis confirmed significant differences across the different land use classes and the macroinvertebrate community composition while no differences were found between seasons. The indicator species analysis revealed 31 representative taxa for natural land use, 1 for urban, and 4 for agricultural land use. Our modelling analysis showed that 28 of the 42 biological metrics tested responded significantly to land use disturbances, confirming the impact of land use changes on the Pesqueria River's macroinvertebrate communities and suggesting that these metrics may have a use as bioindicators. Finally, this study may provide significant biological information for further studies in similar conditions.

AB  - The connotation of 'industry connection, green sustainability, supply chain integration, and occupational accommodation' put forward higher requirements for planning and construction of logistics features small towns in the new era. Compare the example of logistics park or logistics agglomeration area which based on the single function with logistics, the small towns also increase the functions of urban transportation system and residential living (include leisure and entertainment areas). According to the relevant requirement of 'pushing reduce logistics cost and improve efficiency' which is issued by Ministry of Transportation and National Development and Reform Commission, as well as, the public pay more attention to green environment protection, the layout of logistics functional area can help to achieve the dual goals of logistics costs and green environmental protection. Based on the existing academic research, at the beginning, the article consider the transportation system, residential community, upstream industry cluster, and other factors to have effect on the layout of logistics function. Using it as the analysis and construct comprehensive relationship network which combined the virtual function unit and physical function unit. Next, modify the artificial layout adjustment method in SLP as well as, make the minimum of logistics cost and environment pollution as the comprehensive goals. Lead into the solution of genetic algorithm to optimize and reasonable layout scheme. Last, application of those theories to a logistics small town to analyses the functional area layout and proof the scientific nature of this method is verified.

AB  - Like any constructed ecosystem, the vegetation of extensive green roofs (EGRs) will change over time. Although this may influence the desired function and performance, little work has examined the floristic dynamism of EGRs over the long-term. Variations in species composition may be associated with original species (persistent or lost), colonisers (gained), or the effects of spatial heterogeneity. This paper reports on floristic variation of two unmanaged German EGRs twenty years after installation. To evaluate floristic change, the analyses focused on functional composition and plant strategies sensu Grime's CSR theory, referring to the basic adaptive strategies of competition, stress-tolerance and ruderality, and their derivatives. With reference to original documentation, less than half the original species persisted. In spite of the losses, both roofs had entire cover, or nearly so, thanks to colonising species. The generalist strategy (CSR strategists) was the most important functional trait in the observed vegetation, followed by stress-tolerance and then by variations in stress-tolerant ruderality. The functional composition of colonising species was chiefly ruderals, followed by stress tolerators and generalists. The drivers behind these changes relate to the pressures of stress, disturbance and competition, as well as spatial heterogeneity and strategies for dispersal and regeneration, seedbank and propagule sources. This study suggests that long-term floristic diversity may be facilitated by ensuring a diversity of traits and species from the start, by providing spatial heterogeneity, and by considering the mechanisms that support persistence and those which determine colonisation.

AB  - The tropical, macro-tidal estuary of Darwin Harbour is in near-pristine condition and supports a rich biodiversity. However, urban and industrial development pressures are increasing in many parts of the catchment. This challenges us to improve our understanding of how the harbour's ecosystem responds to environmental threats andhowbest to optimise future development while preserving valuable ecosystem services. Here, we synthesise our current knowledge of several environmental aspects of the harbour and its catchment.
   The intertidal zone and its abundant mangrove forests account for a major proportion of primary productivity in Darwin Harbour. These areas also play a key role in preserving water quality by intercepting catchment-derived pollutants and they substantially influence the movement of sediment through the estuary. Darwin Harbour mangroves generally remain in healthy condition with extensive areas of highly biodiverse habitats near urban and industrial developments.
   The future health of Darwin Harbour depends substantially on the protection of the mangrove estate against further pressures from coastal land clearing, catchment derived pollutants and accelerated sedimentation from runoff and dredging. Rapid sea level rise (currently approximate to 8 mm/year) is a further significant threat to the stratified floristic assemblages and specialised invertebrate fauna typical of Darwin Harbour mangrove forests. These threats require development of new sensitive harbour-wide monitoring techniques to provide early warning of the excess accumulation of stressors and disruption to ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Twenty surface soil samples (0-10 cm) and shoots of a perennial shrub Zygophyllum coccineum L. were collected around a cement factory on the western coast of Saudi Arabia, in order to assess concentrations of some heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). The most noticeable among all heavy metals was Pb that showed an average concentration of 460.15 +/- 86.60 mu g g(-1) followed by Cr (138.67 +/- 30.89 mu g g(-1)), Zn (54.41 +/- 43.79 mu g g(-1)), Ni (41.22 +/- 12.60 mu g g(-1)) and Cu (33.48 +/- 12.52 mu g g(-1)). Based on biological concentration factor analysis, Z. coccineum can be considered as an accumulator only for zinc (BCF > 1). Estimation of various ecological contamination factors revealed the significant impact of Pb in the environmental pollution in the region. It is also understood that the primary contribution to the ecological risk index (RI) mainly originated from various anthropogenic influences such as industrialization and urbanization. The different statistical analysis further revealed the potential effect of soil characteristics on the occurrence and dispersal of heavy metals in the study area.

AB  - Landscape features often shape patterns of gene flow and genetic differentiation in plant species. Populations that are small and isolated enough also become subject to genetic drift. We examined patterns of gene flow and differentiation among 12 floodplain populations of the selfing annual jewelweed (Impatiens capensis Meerb.) nested within four river systems and two major watersheds in Wisconsin, USA. Floodplain forests and marshes provide a model system for assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation within agricultural/urban landscapes and for testing whether rivers act to genetically connect dispersed populations. We generated a panel of 12,856 single nucleotide polymorphisms and assessed genetic diversity, differentiation, gene flow, and drift. Clustering methods revealed strong population genetic structure with limited admixture and highly differentiated populations (mean multilocus F-ST = 0.32, F-ST' = 0.33). No signals of isolation by geographic distance or environment emerged, but alleles may flow along rivers given that genetic differentiation increased with river distance. Differentiation also increased in populations with fewer private alleles (R-2 = 0.51) and higher local inbreeding (R-2 = 0.22). Populations varied greatly in levels of local inbreeding (F-IS = 0.2-0.9) and F-IS increased in more isolated populations. These results suggest that genetic drift dominates other forces in structuring these Impatiens populations. In rapidly changing environments, species must migrate or genetically adapt. Habitat fragmentation limits both processes, potentially compromising the ability of species to persist in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Cardamine occulta Hornem. (Brassicaceae), an East Asian weedy bittercress, have introduced globally in recent years. First record of this neophyte species in European Russia was made in 2003. According to current data C. occulta was found in nine regions: Leningrad Oblast, Moscow Oblast, Saratov Oblast, Vologda Oblast, Yaroslavl Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, the Udmurt Republic, the city of Moscow and the city of Saint Petersburg. All known populations of C. occulta occupied predominantly man-made habitats. Currently, the species is considered to be a casual or naturalized alien plant. Uncontrollable transfer of the weed along with ornamental plants might lead to its successful spread across the European Russia. Distribution history of the species, as well as a potential for further spread in European Russia are briefly discussed. The main diagnostic morphological features are presented in comparison with those for allied C. hirsuta L. and C. flexuosa With.

AB  - Peak fitting (PF) and partial least squares (PLS) regression have been independently developed for estimation of functional groups (FGs) from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of ambient aerosol collected on Teflon filters. PF is a model that quantifies the functional group composition of the ambient samples by fitting individual Gaussian line shapes to the aerosol spectra. PLS is a data-driven, statistical model calibrated to laboratory standards of relevant compounds and then extrapolated to ambient spectra. In this work, we compare the FG quantification using the most widely used implementations of PF and PLS, including their model parameters, and also perform a comparison when the underlying laboratory standards and spectral processing are harmonized. We evaluate the quantification of organic FGs (alcohol COH, carboxylic COOH, alkane CH, carbonyl CO) and ammonium, using external measurements (organic carbon (OC) measured by thermal optical reflectance (TOR) and ammonium by balance of sulfate and nitrate measured by ion chromatography). We evaluate our predictions using 794 samples collected in the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network (USA) in 2011 and 238 laboratory standards from Ruthenburg et al. (2014) (available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.12.034). Each model shows different biases. Overall, estimates of OC by FTIR show high correlation with TOR OC. However, PLS applied to unprocessed (raw spectra) appears to underpredict oxygenated functional groups in rural samples, while other models appear to underestimate aliphatic CH bonds and OC in urban samples. It is possible to adjust model parameters (absorption coefficients for PF and number of latent variables for PLS) within limits consistent with calibration data to reduce these biases, but this analysis reveals that further progress in parameter selection is required. In addition, we find that the influence of scattering and anomalous transmittance of infrared in coarse particle samples can lead to predictions of OC by FTIR which are inconsistent with TOR OC. We also find through several means that most of the quantified carbonyl is likely associated with carboxylic groups rather than ketones or esters. In evaluating state-of-the-art methods for FG abundance by FTIR, we suggest directions for future research.

AB  - Three-dimensional and virtual technologies develop rapidly, tools such as animation of virtual characters, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and computer-generated imagery occupy important spaces in different areas. However, new innovations and technological developments give rise to new challenges for artists and researchers. Several research work have dedicated their efforts to the development of virtual cities, methods to optimize time and information processing during crowd simulation, integration of virtual reality in crowd simulation, among other important milestones. However, the necessary attention has not been paid to the naturalness of the movement that virtual characters perform within these scenes, creating an obstacle to the sensation of the user's presence in this type of virtual environments. Moreover, crowd simulation investigations have been generated on flat ideal terrain, which differs from the reality of different cities that are composed of irregular terrain. Consequently, the use of standard walking animations lead to discrepancies with the real behavior of a human. This paper discusses the use of procedural animation to create realistic movements of a virtual character that can be applied in the different areas of research mentioned, therefore the character within the simulation is able to modify its standard movement without generating new animations and thus optimizing production resources.

AB  - The article seeks to identify the dominant discursive content emitted by the brazilian printed media about the social movement for urban housing, starting from the tragedy of the case of the collapse of the Wilton Paes de Almeida building in May 2018. This is a qualitative-quantitative research that uses the technique of content analysis, through the selection of journalistic and editorial articles of the best-selling brazilian print newspapers (digital version), in the period from May 2 to 31, 2018. The most recent survey of the Circulation Verifier Institute (IVC), an organ of the National Association of Newspapers (ANJ), was adopted as the methodological criterion for selection of newspapers. The method of data analysis (keywords) collected quantitative data records through the software Search my files and later qualitative analysis of the set of records found. There was a clear tendency for the press to use words that express an ideology and a discursive content that represents prejudice, stigmatization, and imputation of criminal conduct to the social movement for urban housing. Moreover, this research is relevant for evidencing a media paradigm that strengthens a perception about access to the right to housing disconnected from what is predicted in the national legal-normative order.

AB  - This article examines the discriminatory discursive strategies adopted in the online interactions between different power groups from Mainland China and Hong Kong in their response to two YouTube videos about the Hong Kong Umbrella, or Occupy Central, Movement. A corpus of 4329 comments made by 2157 posters from Mainland China and Hong Kong was coded regarding commenters' place of residence and their perceptions of the Umbrella Movement and then tagged based on Flowerdew et al.'s previous taxonomy of discriminatory discursive strategies. The results show that a wide range of discriminatory discursive strategies, used by two power groups from Hong Kong and one from the Mainland, were found in the majority of the comments, including four sub-strategies not identified by Flowerdew et al. While studies to date on the Umbrella Movement have mainly focused on Hong Kong data, our study contributes to the literature by adding the perspective from Mainland China. The findings of this study provide insights into the increasing social and political tensions between Hong Kong and its mother country as well as the current situation in the divided city.

AB  - Slope instability is present in mountainous regions, and disorderly growth in urban susceptible areas, coupled with lack of land use planning, has increased the occurrence of these types of disasters in urban areas. The climatic study is necessary for the monitoring and prevention of mass movements, since they are triggered by events of extreme and / or long duration precipitation. A database is an important tool in the contribution of these studies and in risk management.

AB  - Festivals are an increasingly more popular form of contemporary cultural activism. Countering prejudice through arts, using culture as a tool of communication, and creating an opportunity for marginalised groups to participate in public life, they represent a specific and novel means of civic activism. In this paper, I introduce a case study of the multicultural festival [fjuzn], aiming to enhance the public visibility of 'new minorities' and bring attention to the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city of Bratislava, Slovakia. Building on a festival ethnography and drawing on the perspective of boundary work [Jaworsky, B. Nadya. 2016. The Boundaries of Belonging: Online Work of Immigration-related Social Movement Organizations. Palgrave Macmillan], I show how the festival organisers work towards crossing and blurring symbolic boundaries in society. I offer a close interpretive reading of their attempts at capturing public places and cultivating a diverse language-scape, while showing how they simultaneously maintain, solidify, or even inscribe new boundaries. I conclude by raising critical points about the potential of activist cultural festivals to shift symbolic boundaries in the long run and serve as tools of social inclusion.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a growing global problem. Activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been proposed as a hotspot for ARGs. However, few studies have been conducted to uncover the temporal dynamics of the resistome of AS in WWTPs by long-term longitudinal sampling. In this study, we quantified ARGs and identified their host microbiome in a Hong Kong WWTP in 97 monthly AS samples spanning 9 years. Throughout this analysis, we demonstrated that both the abundance and structures of the resistome changed significantly every two to three years, implying that there was a successive selection of resistomes in the AS system over the study period. The detection of genes of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are emerging major threats to public health in the AS samples, including mcr, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-related genes, highlight the role of WWTPs as reservoirs of ARGs. In addition, the core resistome (abundant and persistent genes) in AS were found to overlap with those in other ecosystems such as urban sewage, livestock feces, and fishpond sediments, revealing the broad dissemination of ARGs in WWTPs and other environments. Annual variation of resistomes were explained via structural equation modeling (SEM), which deciphered the structural linkages of determining factors such as the operational parameters, microbial community composition and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically, potentially relevant antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) were explored and discussed based on assembly-based analyses and network correlations. Moreover, consistent with the clear relationship between resistomes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), it was found that there was a relatively high potential for gene exchange in AS in comparison with soil genomes, which could be explained by the engineering features of WWTPs. Based on these findings, longitudinal monitoring of WWTPs is warranted for risk assessment to reveal emerging ARGs, resistome evolution, correlations with ARBs, and the potential for spread in downstream environments and concomitant exposure risks for humans.

AB  - A diversity of cross-sectoral, multi-scalar networks are emerging to connect place-based food governance initiatives, such as food policy councils and partnerships, aimed to foster sustainable food security. Yet little research has explored how local food policy groups (LFPGs) are (horizontally) connecting to share knowledge and resources, or interacting (vertically) with other scales of food governance. To address this gap, we examine the trans-local dimension of food policy networks-and its potential to facilitate transformative food system reform. We build on alternative food network, social network, and assemblage thinking to develop an analytical framework that unveils the mobile, unstable, and relational processes and spatialities of LFPGs and the networks which connect them. Through an action-research project comprising a comparative analysis of the Food Policy Networks project in the US and Sustainable Food Cities Network in the UK, we explore how LFPGs connect across different scales and emerge as social-spatial assemblages of food system knowledge, practices, and infrastructure. The findings suggest that conceptualizing these entities as dynamic and place-contingent enables evaluations of their relations and effects to account for features that (could) make them more interconnected, resilient, and transformative, but may also limit their ability to address structurally entrenched food system challenges.

AB  - Land degradation by salinization and sodification changes soil function, destroys soil health, and promotes bioaccumulation of heavy metals in plants, but little is known about their fundamental mechanisms in shaping microbial communities and regulating microbial interactions. In this study, we explored the impact of saline-alkaline (SA) stress on soil bacterial and fungal community structures in different Cd-contaminated soils of Dezhou, Baoding, Xinxiang, Beijing and Shenyang cities from the North China Plain, China. Increased soil salinity and alkalinity enhanced Cd availability, indicated by significant increases in available Cd2+ in soil solution of 34.1%-49.7%, soil extractable Cd of 32.0-51.6% and wheat root Cd concentration of 24.5%-40.2%, as well as decreased activities of antioxidative enzymes of wheat root when compared with CK (no extra neutral or alkaline salts added). Soil bacteria were more active in response to the SA stress than fungi, as the significant structural reorganization of soil bacterial microbiota rather than fungal microbiota between SA and CK treatments was illustrated by principal component analysis. Adding neutral and alkaline salts enriched oligotrophic and haloalkaliphilic taxa in the Sphingobacteriaceae, Cellvibrionaceae, and Caulobacteraceae bacterial families, but decreased some Acidobacteria such as subgroup 6_norank, which was a sensitive biomarker that responded only to Cd contamination in CK-treated soils. Conversely, fungi were more sensitive to soil differences than bacteria: the composition of the fungal community was significantly different among different soil types. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) analysis further indicated that the microbial community structure and network interactions were altered to strengthen the adaptability of microorganisms to SA stress; the changes in structure and network interactions were proposed to contribute to competitive interactions. Most of the keystone genera identified in SA-treated soils, such as Blastococcus, Gemmatimonas, RB41, or Candida, had relatively low abundances (<1%), indicating their disproportionate ecological roles in triggering resistance or tolerance to SA stress and Cd toxicity.

AB  - The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Plutellidae: Yponomeutoidea) is the most destructive pest in Brassicaceae crops worldwide. This paper describes the status of P. xylostella and its natural enemies in a wide area around Cordoba city in the central region of Argentina. Samples were collected from fifteen horticultural plots near Cordoba City. In each plot, larvae and pupae were obtained from 10 cabbage plants during the spring of 2016 and 2017. Immature specimens were kept until an adult DBM or a parasitoid emerged. Maximum density of immature individuals per plant occurred at different moments in each sampling site, indicating local effects and dynamics of the pest. Higher densities of immature P. xylostella were observed in sites in the north-east horticultural zone of Cordoba city, where most of the farms are located. The percentage of total parasitism also varied between sites and between years but, in general, higher percentages of parasitism were observed at the end of the sampling season. Five parasitoid species were identified: Siphona sp. (Diptera: Tachinidae), Diadegma leontiniae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Apanteles piceotrichosus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Oomyzus sokolowskii (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and the hyperparasitoid Conura pseudofulvovariegata (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae). Parasitoids behaved in a similar way to P. xylostella. Densities and dynamics were particular to each sampling site. Implications for management are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary: The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is an invasive species, unique in the parrot family for its ability to build large nest structures. This species became globally distributed, promoted in part due to the pet trade market, and now is considered a pest because of the economic losses they produce. During the reproductive seasons of 2017 and 2018, we registered interactions between invasive monk parakeets and resident bird species in Santiago, Chile. We observed positive and negative interactions, and herein, we describe parakeets' nest occupancy by nine bird species, two invasive and seven native. For this reason, the monk parakeet should be considered an ecosystem engineer, a species that is creating available breeding space of potential use for other species. Our results contribute to an assessment of implications of this ecological invasion of local urban wildlife, and raise concern on other impacts, such as disease transmission, as a consequence of these interactions.
   Abstract: The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is considered to be one of the most invasive bird species because its unique ability among parrots to build their own communal nests. Currently, they are considered an invasive species in 19 countries and a pest-even in their native distribution-because of economic losses derived from their impacts. During the reproductive seasons of 2017 and 2018, we registered interactions between invasive monk parakeets and resident bird species in Santiago, Chile. We observed agonistic and affiliative interactions, and further, we described monk parakeets' nest occupancy by nine bird species, two invasive and seven native. For this reason, we consider that the monk parakeet is an allogenic ecosystem engineer with the potential to shape distribution and richness of sympatric species in urban environments. Our results contribute to an assessment of the implications of the monk parakeet's ecological invasion to other synanthropic species, and raise concern of other potential impacts, such as pathogen transmission derived from these interactions.

There is no commonly-held consensus on the quantification methods for the dynamic interplay between spatial geometry, urban movement, and face-to-face encounters. Using anonymized social media check-in records from Shanghai, China, this study proposes pipelines for quantifying physical face-to-face encounter potential patterns through public space networks between local and non-local residents sensed by social media over time from space to space, in which social difference, cognitive cost, and time remoteness are integrated as the physical co-presence intensity index. This illustrates the spatiotemporally different ways in which the built environment binds various groups of space users configurationally via urban streets. The variation in face-to-face interaction patterns captures the fine-resolution patterns of urban flows and a new definition of street hierarchy, illustrating how urban public space systems deliver physical meeting opportunities and shape the spatial rhythms of human behavior from the public to the private. The shifting encounter potentials through streets are recognized as reflections of urban centrality structures with social interactions that are spatiotemporally varying, projected in the configurations of urban forms and functions. The results indicate that the occurrence probability of face-to-face encounters is more geometrically scaled than predicted based on the co-location probability of two people using metric distance alone. By adding temporal and social dimensions to urban morphology studies, and the field of space syntax research in particular, we suggest a new approach of analyzing the temporal urban centrality structures of the physical interaction potentials based on trajectory data, which is sensitive to the transformation of the spatial grid. It sheds light on how to adopt urban design as a social instrument to facilitate the dynamically changing social interaction potential in the new data environment, thereby enhancing spatial functionality and the social well-being.

AB  - The construction of high-speed roads is inseparably connected with the process of development of regions and countries. In Poland, in the years 2011-2016, many sections of motorways and expressways were opened for use, and the network of high-speed roads became two times larger. The aim of the research was to identify changes in land use associated with the construction of the motorway. Two questions were asked: to what extent does the construction of the motorway result in abandoning the cultivation of land on isolated plots, and whether an increased development of built-up areas can be observed in the vicinity of motorway junctions. The analysis of land cover changes was based on orthophotomaps and aerial photographs from three points in time. By interpreting changes in SHDI, it was possible to identify where the major land cover changes occur. The construction of a motorway results mainly in the decline of forests and agricultural land in the immediate vicinity of such a road. However, such an investment is not a direct factor leading to the abandoning of cultivation of land on isolated plots. In the neighbourhood of motorway junctions, built-up areas development, mainly for non-residential purposes, may be observed.

AB  - Why does territory matter to social movements and what does it allow them to achieve? Despite the ever-apparent centrality of territory-the appropriation and control of space through forms of power-to social movements worldwide (e.g., protest camps, land occupations, indigenous activism, squatting, neighborhood organizing), there has been a surprising lack of attention to this question by Anglophone geographers. This article develops Brazilian geographer Fernandes's notion of "socioterritorial movements" as an analytical category for social movements that have as their central objective the appropriation of space in pursuit of their political project. It does so by contrasting the concept of socioterritorial movement to those of social movement and sociospatial movement and proposing four axes of analysis for socioterritorial movements. First, territory is mobilized as the central strategy for realizing a movement's aims. Second, territory informs the identity of socioterritorial movements, generating new political subjectivities. Third, territory is a site of political socialization that produces new encounters and values. Fourth, through processes of territorialization, deterritorialization, and reterritorialization, socioterritorial movements create new institutions. These axes are further elaborated through the comparative analysis of two case studies: the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, a large peasant movement in Brazil, and the Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Organization, an urban social movement from northwest Argentina. Comparison is deployed as an expansive mode of analysis to open up the concept of socioterritorial movement and indicate potential lines of enquiry for further study.

AB  - The tiny house movement is an emerging trend towards building very small houses. It originated in the United States of America in the late 1990s, largely in response to housing affordability issues and a desire to live more sustainably. It is increasingly popular in Australia yet remains a niche market largely due to non-recognition within planning schemes and inconsistent local laws. Nonetheless, tiny houses could address some pressing urban housing problems, such as housing affordability and energy inefficiencies of poorly designed, large suburban houses. This paper reports on the development of the Tiny House Planning Resource for Australia, 2017, a collaborative report aimed at assisting planners, policy makers and the wider community to better understand the emerging tiny house movement and the model's potential to contribute to greater choice in housing supply and diversity. It uses a case study focussing on South East Queensland (SEQ) to explore councils' appetite and readiness regarding some tiny house options. It concludes tiny houses have significant potential to be a catalyst for infill development in the 'missing middle', either as tiny house villages, or by altering land use planning frameworks to allow both homeowners and tenants to situate well designed tiny houses on suburban lots.

AB  - A growing number of large culverts in the national transportation network are in poor condition. Often, aging infrastructures carry heavy traffic through urban corridors. Either after failure or for replacement, reconstruction must occur rapidly to minimize service disruption. In some cases, new materials are used and uncommon construction practice is followed. The I-88 culvert crossing of Carrs Creek in Sidney, New York completely collapsed during record flooding. Rapid construction using expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam blocks as lightweight fill enabled partial reopening of I-88 in less than 3 months of closure. Shortly after reopening of the roadway, rapid and continuing settlements became evident. The roadway was again rebuilt using lightweight aggregates as structural fill above the culvert following complete removal of the geofoam blocks. This investigation of the rapid construction failure reexamines the findings and recommendations of a prior study of the failure. Alternative conclusions and suggestions for improving rapid construction practice with geofoam are presented utilizing the I-88 failure as an example in retrospect.

AB  - Southern European countries rely largely on fire suppression and ignition prevention to manage a growing wildfire problem. We explored a more wholistic, long-term approach based on priority maps for the implementation of diverse management options aimed at creating fire resilient landscapes, restoring cultural fire regimes, facilitating safe and efficient fire response, and creating fire-adapted communities. To illustrate this new comprehensive strategy for fire-prone Mediterranean areas, we developed and implemented the framework in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). We first used advanced simulation modeling methods to assess various wildfire exposure metrics across spatially changing fire-regime conditions, and these outputs were then combined with land use maps and historical fire occurrence data to prioritize different fuel and fire management options at the municipality level. Priority sites for fuel management programs concentrated in the central and northeastern high-hazard forestlands. The suitable areas for reintroducing fires in natural ecosystems located in scattered municipalities with ample lightning ignitions and minimal human presence. Priority areas for ignition prevention programs were mapped to populated coastal municipalities and main transportation corridors. Landscapes where fire suppression is the principal long-term strategy concentrated in agricultural plains with a high density of ignitions. Localized programs to build defensible space and improve self-protection on communities could be emphasized in the coastal wildland-urban interface and inner intermix areas from Barcelona and Gerona. We discuss how the results of this study can facilitate collaborative landscape planning and identify the constraints that prevent a longer term and more effective solution to better coexist with fire in southern European regions.

AB  - Nestedness refers to a species distribution pattern whereby species found in species-poor sites represent a subset of those in species-rich sites. Nestedness is presumed to be primarily a result of selective extinction of species and thus is important for determining mechanisms of species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the effects of forest fragment attributes and species' life-history traits on nestedness patterns of terrestrial mammals in an urban-forest mosaic in EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. A presence/absence matrix of mammals (16 species) in forest fragments (28 fragments) was compiled based on the mammalian survey conducted using remote-triggered camera traps. The mammalian assemblage in the study area displayed significant nestedness. The nested ranking of forest fragments was strongly correlated with fragment area and proximity index but not with shape index and foliage height diversity. The best model based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC(c)) showed that among species' life-history traits, body mass, trophic level, niche breadth and sociality were the most suited as predictors of extinction vulnerability. In particular, niche breadth was strongly associated with extinction vulnerability. Thus, the ability to persist in forest fragments of various sizes as well as the ability to move to fragments with different degrees of isolation shape fragment dynamics in this landscape. Furthermore, species with broad resource requirements are more likely to persist with further habitat disturbance. Overall, this study showed the importance of integrating forest fragment attributes and ecological traits of species in nestedness analyses for determining species in most need of conservation action which is important for preventing further loss of species.

To this end, we will also mobilize the notion of conditions of production, brought by Pecheux in his book AAD-69, which is essential for thinking about the questions posed here. When we think today about how the author was already addressing questions that involved digital discourse, we believe that looking at such questions, in an attempt to create new analytical devices that help in understanding the advances achieved in the area.

AB  - Mangroves play an essential ecological role in the maintenance of the coastal zone and are extremely important for the socioeconomics of coastal communities. However, mangrove ecosystems are impacted by a range of anthropogenic pressures, and the loss of this habitat can be attributed primarily to the human occupation of the coastal zone. In the present study, we analyzed the spatial patterns of land use in the mangrove of the Brazilian Amazon coast, and evaluated the anthropogenic drivers of this impact, using a remote sensing approach. We mapped the road network using RapidEye images, and human settlements using global data. The results of these analyses indicate that the Brazilian Amazon coast has a low population density and low rates of anthropogenic impact in most of the coastal microregions investigated, factors that contribute to the maintenance and conservation of the region's mangrove. The study also revealed that the paved road network is one of the principal drivers of land use in the mangrove, whereas other factors, such as population density, urban centers, and the number of settlements are much less important. While the region has 2024 km of paved highways, unpaved roads (17,496 km) facilitate access to the mangrove, with approximately 90% of anthropogenic impact being recorded within a 3 km radius of these roads. While the network of paved highways is relatively reduced in extension, preventive measures are urgently required to impede any major shift in the current scenario, caused by the expansion of major development programs. The results of the study indicate that biophysical, economic, and political factors may also contribute to the reduction, stability, and development of one of the world's largest areas of mangrove forest.

AB  - Many coastal embayments in the Laurentian Great Lakes have been subjected to extensive human physical modification and pollution that has led to the loss of freshwater biodiversity. For example, Hamilton Harbour is a large coastal embayment situated at the western end of Lake Ontario, with a long history of industrial and urban development that has resulted in the loss and degradation of aquatic habitat and the extirpation of several fish species. To restore the fish community in Hamilton Harbour, several attempts have been made to increase apex predator biodiversity by reintroducing native walleye (Sander vitreus). To assess how reintroduced (i.e., stocked) walleye use Hamilton Harbour, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize the residency of individuals within the boundaries of the harbour as well as their seasonal space use, with a focused interest on the spring spawning period. During the 1 yr tracking period tagged walleye spent an average of 357 days (range 135-365 days) within the harbour. Most individuals (12/15) remained within the harbour during the entire spring spawning period, and over half of the tagged fish departed (n = 7) at the end of summer and beginning of fall. Core use areas appeared to gradually shift more easterly as the seasons progressed from winter to summer. Results from this study indicate that stocked fish are resident within Hamilton Harbour for most of the year, including the reproductive period, which suggests that stocking efforts to re-establish walleye populations may be an effective restoration strategy if recruitment is successful.

AB  - Problems of the stationary traffic are solved today by almost every larger town. Most of the towns suffer from an insufficient number of parking spots in the street network. It is at the same time very complicated and economically demanding to create new parking areas, so the towns try to use the existing parking areas as efficiently as possible. The objective is thus to apply systems and technologies for efficient use of existing parking spaces, and also to monitor parking occupancy, distribute information to drivers, and apply various payment systems (parking meters, SMS payments an mobile applications) in order to facilitate the collection of payments from drivers. Within Smart City applications, it is necessary to consider not only parking aspects but also organisational aspects. Installation of Smart parking components is senseless, unless these components are accepted by user/driver and unless continuous traffic surveys are performed oriented in parking checks in the town.
   This article monitors the course and results of an extensive traffic survey oriented mainly in respecting the parking rules. In the centre of Uherske Hradiste, there are many specific parking spaces, 3 major paid parking zones, designated spaces at selected institutions, designated spaces for time-limited free parking, etc. The article describes in details the experience from the traffic survey oriented in respecting the parking rules in the town and subsequently proposed measures and suggestions how to make the existing state in the town more efficient with respect to the Smart City concept.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the drivers in shaping the occurrence and distribution of total viruses and picoplankton in tropical freshwater ecosystems. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the concentrations of total viruses, picoheterotrophs, picophytoplankton, and picocyanobacteria. Three land use patterns (urban-, agriculture- and parkland-dominated) were evaluated using ArcGIS. Significant correlations were observed between water-borne microbial targets and water quality parameters (0.175 <= vertical bar r vertical bar <= 0.441), nutrients (0.250 <= r <= 0.570) and land use factors (0.200 <= vertical bar r vertical bar <= 0.460). In particular, the concentrations of total viruses and picoheterotrophic cells were higher in catchments whereas the abundances of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria were higher in reservoirs. Total viruses and picoplankton had higher concentrations in urban- and agriculture-dominated areas, probably due to anthropogenic inputs and agricultural inputs, respectively. Although surface water is a complex matrix influenced by niche based (i.e., physicochemical properties, nutrients, land use impact etc.) and neutral-based factors (i.e., ecological drift, dispersal and species), land use patterns could help to elucidate the occurrence and distribution of the total microbial community at the macroscopic level. Meanwhile, inter-correlations among viruses, picoplankton and picoheterotrophs (0.715 <= r <= 0.990) also substantiates their mutual interactions in influencing the microbial community. Furthermore, the relationships between total microbial cells and bacterial and viral indicators were also investigated. Concentrations of total viruses, picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were positively correlated with bacterial indicators (0.427 <= r <= 0.590) and viral indicators (0.201 <= r <= 0.563). These results indicated that faecal and viral contamination could contribute to the numbers of total viruses and bacteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A large Mw 7.5 earthquake occurred at 18.03 on 28 September 2018 in the Donggala-Palu area of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, which triggered a tsunami, liquefaction, and landslides. A 160-km rupture zone was formed on the surface along the NS to NNW-SSE trending Palu-Koro fault (PKF) system through three regencies: Donggala, Palu, and Sigi. Obvious surface ruptures associated with the earthquake were not observed in the epicentral area. Surface ruptures with a small displacement of both sinistral and westerly downward slip components appear south of the epicentral area in the Donggala area. The event induced widespread subsidence of the Donggala coastal area on the west side of the rupture zone. Passing across the Palu bay, the rupture cuts through the urban area of Palu city and extends across alluvial fans along the western side of the Palu basin showing large displacements with a predominant sinistral slip up to 4.2 m and subordinate easterly downward slip components. Approximately 5 m of anomalously high vertical displacement with 3 m of horizontal displacement occurs in an extensional bend in the southern area of the Palu basin. In the Sigi valley, the rupture zone follows the previously known PKF trace showing predominant sinistral and subordinate easterly downward slip, of which displacement is 0.9 m sinistral and 0.5 m easterly downward at the site 60 km south of Palu city and gradually smaller toward the south. These distributions of rupture zones and displacements suggest that rupture of the 2018 earthquake unilaterally propagated southwards and resulted in the movement of the eastern side of the fault towards the NNW.

AB  - inVIVO Planetary Health (inVIVO) is a progressive scientific movement providing evidence, advocacy, and inspiration to align the interests and vitality of people, place, and planet. Our goal is to transform personal and planetary health through awareness, attitudes, and actions, and a deeper understanding of how all systems are interconnected and interdependent. Here, we present the abstracts and proceedings of our 8th annual conference, held in Detroit, Michigan in May 2019, themed "From Challenges, to Opportunities". Our far-ranging discussions addressed the complex interdependent ecological challenges of advancing global urbanization, including the biopsychosocial interactions in our living environment on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, together with the wider community and societal factors that govern these. We had a strong solutions focus, with diverse strategies spanning from urban-greening and renewal, nature-relatedness, nutritional ecology, planetary diets, and microbiome rewilding, through to initiatives for promoting resilience, positive emotional assets, traditional cultural narratives, creativity, art projects for personal and community health, and exploring ways of positively shifting mindsets and value systems. Our cross-sectoral agenda underscored the importance and global impact of local initiatives everywhere by contributing to new normative values as part of a global interconnected grass-roots movement for planetary health.

AB  - Matrona basilaris Selys, 1853 is a damselfly distributed mainly in mainland China. A total of 423 individuals from 48 populations covering almost the entire range were sampled to explore the genetic diversity, phylogeographic structure, and demographic dynamics of the species using sequences of three mitochondrial genes (COI, COII, and ND1) and a nuclear (ITS1 + 5.8 S + ITS2) gene. Phylogenetic tree, median-joining network, and BAPS analyses indicated a four-group division of the entire population, and the divergence event was estimated to have occurred in the middle Pleistocene. The diverse terrain of mainland China as well as past climatic oscillations were assumed to have shaped the current phylogeographic pattern of M. basilaris. Multiple lines of evidence supported population expansion in Group 1 and Group 2 but not in Group 3 or Group 4. The expansion times corresponded to the transition phase from the LIG (similar to 0.14-0.12 Mya) to the LGM (similar to 0.021-0.018 Mya). The pre-LGM expansion model reflected a different pattern affecting the historical dynamics of the population of East Asian species caused by Pleistocene climatic changes. Interestingly, Group 2 exhibited a disjunctive distribution pattern. The possible reasons were introgression caused by female-biased dispersal or human phoresy during construction of the Forbidden City during the Ming Dynasty of China.

AB  - After the completion of the underground utility tunnel, it has significant external benefits, which will effectively improve the current appearance of the urban environment such as 'road zipper' and 'sky spider mesh'. With the promotion of the PPP model, the construction of the underground utility tunnel has surged. However, during the development process, the difficulty of pipeline companies in paying for the utility tunnel has occurred, which led to the operation of some underground utility tunnel, which caused the capital to be idle. How to mobilise the enthusiasm of pipeline companies and pay fees in the utility tunnel, it becomes the key to the sustainable development of underground utility tunnel. Based on the theory of planned behaviour, this paper introduces the value perception, system perception and consequence perception to expand, and establishes the research framework of the formation mechanism of pipeline companies willingness to pay, and uses the structural equation model to conduct empirical research. The empirical results show that behavioural attitude, value perception, consequence perception, institutional perception, perceptual behaviour control and subjective norms directly affect behavioural intentions directly, but their forces are weakened in turn. Behavioural attitudes have significant mediating effects on three new variables. The conclusion intended to provide theoretical support for the pricing of PPP mode underground utility tunnel. By improving the construction of the pipeline network, this paper improves and protects the regional environment, and continuously optimises the urban ecological environment.

AB  - The aim of the research was to assess the possibility to use deciduous tree bark in the biomonitoring of urban areas. The tree bark taken from various deciduous tree species growing in the Opole Province (south-western Poland) was used for the research. The bark was collected from tree trunks in the period of June 2-26, 2017. Concentrations of the heavy metals were determined in the barks by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). On the basis of the research, it was determined that type of tree, distance from pollution source, elevation off the ground and the side of trunk from which bark was sampled all influence the research results. A comparison of the values of coefficient of variation CV demonstrated that the bark Quercus robur and Betula pendula is more heterogeneous, e.g. for Fe CVQuercus robur is 48.0 % and CVBetula pendula = 42.3 %, compared to Fagus sylvatica (CVFe = 22.6%). In order to limit the influence of environmental factors (e.g. air movement caused by vehicles and pedestrians) on the samples pollution level with analytes, it seems that the optimum level for collecting the samples is 1.5-2.0 m. It was demonstrated that deciduous tree bark can be used as bioindicator in assessing the pollution of atmospheric aerosol by heavy metals, due to its occurrence in urban areas. However, it is important to validate all stages of the analysis procedure that uses deciduous tree bark.

AB  - The public spaces in Iran's built environment were gendered sites of domination and subordination, yet also terrains of resistance and emancipation. Tracing the massive western-oriented project of modernization of public spaces issued by the Shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi (1925-1941), this article contextualizes the gendered language used to advance modernization, and examines examples of women's experiences in major cities including Tehran, Shiraz, Qazvin, Rasht, and Bushehr. During this period, modern architecture and planning movements in Iran mainly followed the discourse instigated by CIAM [International Congresses of Modern Architecture]. Urban street plans with an orthogonal network of roads, streets, and wide boulevards were favored over the vernacular system of narrow, twisting, partly-roofed alleys, based on pedestrian movements. The modern movement also attempted to desegregate and "democratize" public spaces through gender desegregation, arguing that streets needed to be aesthetically-pleasing spaces where both men and women could walk and socialize in mixed-sex gatherings, a phenomenon that was not common in public spaces in the history of Iran. It should be noted that in 1936, Reza Shah promulgated a ban on the use of the chador (the traditional Iranian veil) in public places, in favor of Western women's fashion, i.e., European hats, coats, and gloves. Due to this ban, some women, particularly those from conservative, religious, lower-class backgrounds, resisted using public spaces and streets. In older neighborhoods, where houses were attached to each other, these women used the rooftops as gathering spaces and as a form of pedestrian pathway. Others, mainly elite, urban, upper-class women, accepted and appreciated the desegregated spatial practices, using them to free themselves from social and cultural taboos. Building on postcolonial and transnational feminist theories, including those of Chandra Talpade Mohanty (1984) and Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan (1994), which critique modernity and modernization and emphasize the diversity of women's experiences and the importance of contextualizing them, this article addresses how, in a political climate of enormous contradictions, architectures were (re)configured and (re)appropriated as physical tools of resistance against the coloniality of modernization of the built environment and state power for one group of women, yet simultaneously, were (re)envisioned as an apparatus of confrontation with cultural traditionalism and patriarchal ideologies for another group of women.

AB  - This essay discusses methods of pedagogy and educational philosophy stirred up by the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement/Occupy-Hong Kong Movement at the end of 2014. It situates these events as a way to envision a new type of public university. To this end, the essay proposes a model of wandering scholarship,' in which educators and activists walk through urban environments and use dialogic esthetics to reclaim them as Commons.' Wandering means a multisensory exploration and learning based on the historical concept of psychogeography,' a drifting through sites and interpellation of their embedded ideologies. As opposed to traditions of introspective wandering, this kind of dialogic wandering' is done within groups and encourages people to talk to fellow-walkers or random bystanders. As will be shown, these modes of wandering while addressing publics were pioneered in the 1960s student movements and also adopted in a unique manner by the young activists of the Umbrella Movement. Dialogic wandering leads to affective languages and embodied learning as opposed to modes of analytical reasoning and logic within higher education. To further study the impact of this aspect of social movements within a university curriculum, it will be shown by means of example how students can meaningfully adopt dialogic wandering to survey people's affect and ideological positioning within environments.

AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) alters the dynamics of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services, which are essential to the maintenance of life and human well-being. Human settlement in developing countries generally occurs in a disorderly and unplanned manner, leading to environmental degradation. In Northeast Brazil, water is a scarce resource and urbanization tends to occur along the water network and increase pressure on the quality and availability of this resource. This paper analyzes LULC changes in 1989, 2007 and 2014 and the associated impacts on the provision of ecosystem services in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (Paraiba, Brazil). LULC changes were identified and quantified using remote sensing techniques and geographic information system. Ecosystem services value (ESV) were estimated using average monetary value available in the literature using the benefit transfer method. In 1989 the estimated total ESV was US$ 7.18 million, reducing to US$ 3.73 million in 2007 and US$ 2.72 million in 2014. There was a 115% increase of built area between 1989 and 2014 that resulted inreduction of ecosystem services of 62% between 1989 and 2014. The decline in ESV reflects the negative impact of the urbanization process on the provision of ecosystem services, especially those offered by vegetation. The arboreal vegetation was the most valuable LULC class in the study area, and the one that showed the greatest reduction in area. Planning, creating and maintaining green areas is critical to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on the provision of ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper reports on a recent landslide event, which occurred in Yanyuan County at Xichang City, Sichuan Province, China, on 19 July 2018. Due to the continuous and heavy rainfall between 8 July 2018 and 18 July 2018, approximately 18 million m(3) of soil detached from an ancient landslide and buried 65 buildings, the entire sliding process lasted for severalminutes. Here, based on field investigations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography, we describe the characteristics and failure mechanism of this landslide. The results showed that the landslide was triggered by the continuous and heavy rainfall. Additionally, during the first post-failure stage, the motion of this landslide involved typical successive movement, and over time, the style of movement progressively turned flow-like, which can be classified as debris slide by using the 1978 Varnes classification scheme. The landslide event described here is an outstanding case for landslide studies. In particular, this landslide represents a good illustration of the transform mechanism of landslide movement from sliding to flow-like.

AB  - The Lower Rhine Embayment and adjacent areas are characterised by neotectonic deformation resulting in differential crustal movement. Slip rates along the fault systems are very low (< 0.1 mm/a). Significant earthquakes are known to have occurred in the past but the faulting behaviour is not adequately known which hampers the risks assessment. We analysed the archaeological record of the largest Roman aqueduct north of the Alps. This so called Eifel Aqueduct is 95.4 km long, has its source in the Eifel mountains and supplied the ancient city of Cologne with calcareous fresh water. The aqueduct crosses major faults of the Lower Rhine Embayment perpendicular. Analyses of the aqueduct ' s gradient gives weak evidence for creep along the Kirspenich Fault resulting in differential movement of hanging and foot wall in the order of a few centimetres. Vertical offsets of 15 and 35 cm are documented exactly where the aqueduct crosses the Holzheim Fault system close to the city of Mechernich. Here, also structural damage of the aqueduct is recorded and archaeological evidence exists for repair works on the aqueduct. We interpret these observations as well as the construction of a 4 km long deviation as necessary measures to keep the aqueduct operational after earthquake damage. The timing of the event falls within the period of aqueduct operation which is reconstructed to be between 80 +/- 10 and 270 +/- 10 CE. Supporting evidence for earthquake activity within this period is seen in the roof collapse of the nearby Kakus cave.

AB  - Retracing introduction routes is crucial for understanding the evolutionary processes involved in an invasion, as well as for highlighting the invasion history of a species at the global scale. The Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a xylophagous pest native to Asia and invasive in North America and Europe. It is responsible for severe losses of urban trees, in both its native and invaded ranges. Based on historical and genetic data, several hypotheses have been formulated concerning its invasion history, including the possibility of multiple introductions from the native zone and secondary dispersal within the invaded areas, but none have been formally tested. In this study, we characterized the genetic structure of ALB in both its native and invaded ranges using microsatellites. In order to test different invasion scenarios, we used an approximate Bayesian "random forest" algorithm together with traditional population genetics approaches. The strong population differentiation observed in the native area was not geographically structured, suggesting complex migration events that were probably human-mediated. Both native and invasive populations had low genetic diversity, but this characteristic did not prevent the success of the ALB invasions. Our results highlight the complexity of invasion pathways for insect pests. Specifically, our findings indicate that invasive species might be repeatedly introduced from their native range, and they emphasize the importance of multiple, human-mediated introductions in successful invasions. Finally, our results demonstrate that invasive species can spread across continents following a bridgehead path, in which an invasive population may have acted as a source for another invasion.

AB  - Constant changes in natural environments impose challenges to wild animal populations, especially those that depend on social life. We gathered data on the activity budget and social interactions of a capuchin monkey (Sapajus sp.) group of 17 individuals confined to an urban green area receiving human food supplementation. We observed the capuchins between 7: 00 am and 5: 00 pm, three days a month, between January 2012 and June 2013 (total of 530 hours of direct observations). We collected 15,208 behavioral records through instantaneous scan sampling and 2,538 events of social interaction in an adapted version of the "all occurrences" method. Activity budget of capuchins was dominated by traveling (42%) and foraging (38%), followed by feeding (10%), social interactions (5%), resting (4%), and others (2%). Except for feeding, the time spent on other activities varied across sex-age classes. Social interactions of capuchins were dominated by affiliative interactions (80%), mainly social play, followed by agonistic (11%) and cooperative (10%) interactions. Sexual interactions were rare (0.4%) and often involved juveniles (45% of the events). Juveniles performed most of the social interactions, followed by the alpha male, and were the main receptors of grooming, food sharing, and agonism. On the other hand, they were the main group involved in allocarrying of infants. Grooming between females and from them to alpha male was infrequent. However, grooming of the alpha male towards the adult females was frequent. We interpreted the deviations in the activity budget and social interactions of the urban capuchins as effects of human food supplementation and restriction on dispersal, illustrating the behavioral ability of capuchin monkeys to adjust their activity in human-altered environments.

KW  - SYSTEM
KW  - GPS
AB  - Despite the importance of predicting evacuation mobility dynamics after large scale disasters for effective first response and disaster relief, our general understanding of evacuation behavior remains limited because of the lack of empirical evidence on the evacuation movement of individuals across multiple disaster instances. Here we investigate the GPS trajectories of a total of more than 1 million anonymized mobile phone users whose positions were tracked for a period of 2 months before and after four of the major earthquakes that occurred in Japan. Through a cross comparative analysis between the four disaster instances, we find that in contrast to the assumed complexity of evacuation decision making mechanisms in crisis situations, an individual's evacuation probability is strongly dependent on the seismic intensity that they experience. In fact, we show that the evacuation probabilities in all earthquakes collapse into a similar pattern, with a critical threshold at around seismic intensity 5.5. This indicates that despite the diversity in the earthquakes profiles and urban characteristics, evacuation behavior is similarly dependent on seismic intensity. Moreover, we found that probability density functions of the distances that individuals evacuate are not dependent on seismic intensities that individuals experience. These insights from empirical analysis on evacuation from multiple earthquake instances using large scale mobility data contributes to a deeper understanding of how people react to earthquakes, and can potentially assist decision makers to simulate and predict the number of evacuees in urban areas with little computational time and cost. This can be achieved by utilizing only the information on population density distribution and seismic intensity distribution, which can be observed instantaneously after the shock.

AB  - Identifying group movement patterns of crowds and understanding group behaviors are valuable for urban planners, especially when the groups are special such as tourist groups. In this paper, we present a framework to discover tourist groups and investigate the tourist behaviors using mobile phone call detail records (CDRs). Unlike GPS data, CDRs are relatively poor in spatial resolution with low sampling rates, which makes it a big challenge to identify group members from thousands of tourists. Moreover, since touristic trips are not on a regular basis, no historical data of the specific group can be used to reduce the uncertainty of trajectories. To address such challenges, we propose a method called group movement pattern mining based on similarity (GMPMS) to discover tourist groups. To avoid large amounts of trajectory similarity measurements, snapshots of the trajectories are firstly generated to extract candidate groups containing co-occurring tourists. Then, considering that different groups may follow the same itineraries, additional traveling behavioral features are defined to identify the group members. Finally, with Hainan province as an example, we provide a number of interesting insights of travel behaviors of group tours as well as individual tours, which will be helpful for tourism planning and management.

AB  - This paper describes a method of mapping riparian vegetation in semi-arid to arid environments using the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The method successfully identified a range of riparian community types across the entire state of Nevada, USA, which spans 7 degrees of latitude and almost 4000 m of elevation. The landscape was stratified into units of similar elevation and solar exposure, and riparian areas were identified as having anomalously high NDVI within a local neighborhood. Thousands of calibration points were used in a simplex optimization to select the spatial neighborhood, the elevation and insolation strata, the minimum NDVI to be considered as potentially riparian, the number of standard deviations from the mean for an anomaly to be classified as riparian, and a limit on upslope position. Mapping of subpixel riparian corridors was improved by applying a directional high-pass filter to the NDVI data. Irrigated areas in agricultural and urban areas were removed based on land ownership maps and manual editing. The final map was tested with 400 independent test points: producer's accuracy was 84.6% and user's accuracy was 93.5%. This method should be broadly useful for mapping riparian features across large and complex regions with arid to semi-arid environments.

AB  - Insecticides such as pyrethroids and fipronil are used in large amounts in both agricultural and urban settings and have the potential to elicit toxicity to nontarget aquatic organisms. In California, like in many other regions of the world, urban centers are located along the coast, and it is documented that urban-use insecticides enter the marine environment, where little is known about their occurrence and consequences. In this study, we measured the spatial distribution of pyrethroids and fipronil (and its metabolites) on the Palos Verdes Shelf off the coast of Los Angeles. Total pyrethroid levels ranged from nd to 170 mu g/kg (dry weight), and fipronil sulfide levels ranged from 1.8 to 5.6 mu g/kg. Two pyrethroids were traced to wastewater effluent discharge, while two others and fipronil sulfide were traced to to surface runoff. Toxicity units (TUs) were estimated for benthic invertebrates, which ranged from no toxicity (nt) to 146 for total pyrethroids, and 0.09 to 1.6 and 4.2 to 75 for fipronil sulfide, depending on the indicator species. Therefore, near-shore deposition of urban use insecticides due to wastewater discharge and surface runoff poses a significant risk to marine benthic invertebrates and highlights the importance of monitoring near-shore ocean environments and developing mitigation strategies to reduce seaward movement.

AB  - Species distribution models can be used to direct early detection of invasive species, if they include proxies for invasion pathways. Due to the dynamic nature of invasion, these models violate assumptions of stationarity across space and time. To compensate for issues of stationarity, we iteratively update regionalized species distribution models annually for European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) to target early detection surveys for the USDA APHIS gypsy moth program. We defined regions based on the distances from the invasion spread front where shifts in variable importance occurred and included models for the non-quarantine portion of the state of Maine, a short-range region, an intermediate region, and a long-range region. We considered variables that represented potential gypsy moth movement pathways within each region, including transportation networks, recreational activities, urban characteristics, and household movement data originating from gypsy moth infested areas (U.S. Postal Service address forwarding data). We updated the models annually, linked the models to an early detection survey design, and validated the models for the following year using predicted risk at new positive detection locations. Human-assisted pathways data, such as address forwarding, became increasingly important predictors of gypsy moth detection in the intermediate-range geographic model as more predictor data accumulated over time (relative importance = 5.9%, 17.36%, and 35.76% for 2015, 2016, and 2018, respectively). Receiver operating curves showed increasing performance for iterative annual models (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.63, 0.76, and 0.84 for 2014, 2015, and 2016 models, respectively), and boxplots of predicted risk each year showed increasing accuracy and precision of following year positive detection locations. The inclusion of human-assisted pathway predictors combined with the strategy of iterative modeling brings significant advantages to targeting early detection of invasive species. We present the first published example of iterative species distribution modeling for invasive species in an operational context.

AB  - While demographic and social determinants of sexual harassment have been intensively and extensively investigated, attention to the role of the spatial configuration of the built environment remains limited.With a special focus on the Greater Cairo region, this study examines the occurrence of improper touching in public streets through a comprehensive review of the literature, space syntax analysis, band analysis and field survey. The results show that incidents' locations are associated with spatially accessible street segments and that men dominate public spaces of the Cairo central business district (CBD), especially after dark. Busy routes have a dual effect: they give some sense of safety as a result of informal surveillance, people being 'eyes on the street', but may assist potential harassers to perpetrate, hide and escape swiftly. Unsafe space usually lacks a balanced and 'civilised co-presence' among inhabitants and strangers where strangers outnumber local residents. Accordingly, understanding human movement patterns and the spatial context of the most vulnerable types of urban spaces are an invaluable step to design out sexual harassment.

AB  - Development of reduction policies for products risking the health or the environment usually begins with the question of whether the most promising entry point is reducing production, distribution or consumption. We aim to answer this crucial question for bushmeat, a wildlife product whose unsustainable harvest threatens biodiversity and food security. We collected one of the largest data sets available on bushmeat commodity chains by interviewing 348 hunters, 202 bushmeat traders, 190 restaurant owners, and 985 consumers in 47 urban and rural settlements around Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We examined 1) structural traits by network analyses and 2) disentangled the underlying economic, cultural, and nutritional motives for bushmeat utilization at the level of production (hunters), distribution (bushmeat traders), and consumption (households). We found that while economic drivers determined hunting, trading was associated with economic and cultural drivers and consumption was purely influenced by cultural habits. Bushmeat traders were promising candidates for effective regulation interventions, but held a small market share and the risk of displacement to other trading channels remains. Since cultural motives for consumption provide a key opportunity for large-scale behavioral changes, we propose consumers as the most effective point of entry for interventions. However, any such consumer level intervention should be supported by programs providing the remaining commodity chain actors with alternative livelihoods. Generally, interventions into the complex social-ecological system of wildlife commodity chains must consider interdependencies and require multi-actor approaches and monitoring to avoid displacement and diffusion effects and to guarantee a socially and ecologically sustainable change.

AB  - Collective-action problems affect the structure of stakeholder networks differently in policy settings (Berardo and Scholz 2010). However, interactions in policy settings do not usually occur in an institutional vacuum; instead, they are guided and constrained by agreed-on rules. Therefore, to better understand behavior in these settings, it is important to understand the parameters that guide and constrain it. Combining arguments from game theory and social network analysis, this paper focuses on how the nature of collective-action problems affect the design of formal institutional arrangements. The cases are two institutional arrangements for the provision of high-quality drinking water, in New York City and in Boston. The design of these arrangements is measured through Networks of Prescribed Interactions (NPIs), capturing patterns of interactions mandated by formal rules. NPI structures in each case are then compared analyzing their structural measures and applying exponential random graph models (ERGMs). By comparing these NPIs, the paper assesses the effects of collective-action problems on the design of formal institutional arrangements. Results show that cooperation problems are associated with designs prescribing redundant interactions that create a balanced distribution of responsibilities among the key actors to the agreement.

AB  - Feature extraction is widely considered one of the most critical components to classification performance in computer vision. In the past, human-designed features, such as the histogram of oriented gradients, were used for extracting statistically rich features. Recently, there has been a movement away from human-designed features to machine-learned features. Herein, we propose a novel genetic programming (GP) approach, coined GOOFeD, to automatically generate discriminative-rich features for image classification. This is achieved by greatly advancing GP in three ways: (1) promoting population diversity and redundancy removal, (2) introducing a unique adaptive mutation approach, and (3) controlling tree bloat through a new crossover technique. These improvements also lead to a population size required for learning that is smaller than that commonly used in the literature. To assess performance, GOOFeD is tested on the MIT urban and nature scene data set and a real-world buried explosive hazard data set. Experiments verify that, in terms of classification accuracy, GOOFeD outperforms many of the state-of-the-art human-designed features and feature learning techniques.

AB  - This research proposes a flood area estimation method in urban areas using personal location data. Many studies have investigated the estimation of flood levels; however, the majority of these previous works are based on the flood monitoring data. The main cause of flood disaster death is drowning due to evacuation delay in the area where observation equipment is not installed, so it is difficult to estimate flood occurrence by the previous method based only on monitoring data. In this research, we propose an estimation method that does not rely on monitoring data and instead estimates flood areas using GPS data collected from smartphones owned by the affected people. This method detects anomaly areas to analyze temporal and spatial changes of an area where a personal movement during a flooding event differs from that during regular times from personal location data. For anomaly detection, we use a dynamic time warping method with fixed window size and inequality metrics to estimate the area where an anomaly event occurred in 2 km grids. We applied this method to Kurashiki city, Okayama Prefecture, where there 52 people died during a flood that occurred in Japan in 2018. Our method found that, at the flooding time, the anomaly occurrence was estimated correctly in the area where inundation actually occurred.

AB  - Concrete-lined streams are one of the most extreme forms of river regulation. This study investigated an urban stream network with concrete-lined (C) and earthen (E) sections. The C sections were positioned downstream of the E sections. This abrupt change of stream type due to concrete lining was compared with the predictions of river continuum concept and process domain concept. River continuum concepts predictions on the macroinvertebrate functional feeding group fractions against stream order and energy sources showed disagreements in this study. Furthermore, other than abundance of pollution intolerant species variation, most of the species responses did not support the process domain concept predictions. Correlations between explanatory variables (stream hydraulics or water quality) and response variables (macroinvertebrate composition and vegetation) observed to be dependent on stream lining and seasons. Stream discharge showed positive correlations with the pollution representative species in both section types but was more obvious in C sections. Water budget estimations showed that wastewater accounted for at least 5% of stream discharge of the C sections in the dry season. pH was the most important and significant water quality parameter of the C sections. Against expectations, nitrogen species and soluble reactive phosphorus did not have a major impact on species variables. Hydraulic variables that represented stream heterogeneity were more useful in explaining species variables of the E sections. Similar explanatory powers by the hydraulics and water quality variables of the C sections demonstrated the importance and interdependency of stream hydraulics and water quality in rehabilitating of this unique ecosystem.

AB  - This article has for objective to problematize the history of the social movement Chiquinha Gonzaga, an urban occupation that is located in the central area of Rio de Janeiro. The history of this Occupation was defined by the speech of one of its organizers, and it revealed the complex nature of the process of the occupants' awareness. The language of the speech revealed political practice that distinguished the subjects among the ones that had and the ones that had not critical conscience as a requirement of the political action.

AB  - Internal migration, the movement of people between localities and regions within a country, has resulted in a significant redistribution of national populations. Past cross-national studies have been impeded by a lack of data and comparable metrics upon which to base comparisons. This paper examines internal migration in 30 Asian countries utilising a global dataset and a novel suite of measures devised in the IMAGE project. Three aspects of internal migration are explored: overall intensity, age patterns, and spatial impacts. Comparisons reveal that internal migration intensities, while on average lower than in other regions, are highly variable across countries. Migration peaks at earlier ages and is concentrated into a narrower age band than in other parts of the world. Analysis of spatial impacts highlights the contribution of migration to urbanisation, but a comparison of current trends against lifetime migration data also reveals the impact of historical events and government policies on national migration systems. Wide variation in key dimensions of migration among Asian countries reflects a diversity in national circumstances. The way forward lies in further in-depth country studies building on the common analytic framework articulated in this study.

AB  - ContextSubtropical forests have and will continue to face tremendous pressure from various disturbances, which have the potential to alter forest composition, structure, and function. Forest dynamics relate to spatial patterns, ecological processes, and their interactions. However, integrating forest ecosystems and land systems has seldom been attempted in southern China.ObjectivesWe explore the spatiotemporal response and trajectories of forest dynamics at different scales under climate change, harvesting, and land-use disturbances in the near future.MethodsWe simulated forest landscape dynamics by integrating a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II), an ecosystem model (PnET-II), and a land change model (CA-Markov) for 2010 to 2050. We identified changes in forest composition, aboveground biomass, and landscape patterns under individual and integrated scenarios, including a control scenario, climate change, harvesting, and land-use change for tree species, ecoregions, and forest types.ResultsFor forest composition, the forest area continued to increase, and coniferous forests increased approximately 3.7 times that of broad-leaved forests. Harvesting reduced aboveground biomass, with a reduction of 30.3% in comparison to the control scenario. The integrated disturbances showed a greater impact on the forest landscape. Landscape fragmentation increased, showing that the patch density increased by 52.3% (control scenario), 46.2% (climate change), 118.4% (harvest), 55.0% (land use change) and 139.5% (integrated scenarios), respectively.ConclusionsOur results suggest that climate change will contribute to forest growth, especially for coniferous forests. Harvesting will reduce forest area and aboveground biomass. The interaction between human activities and climate change contributes to diminished forest expansion and increased landscape fragmentation.

AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an agricultural and urban pest that has become widely established as an invasive species of major concern in the USA and throughout Europe. The insect forms large aggregations before entering diapause, and it is often these aggregations that are found by biosecurity officials conducting inspections of internationally shipped freight. Here, we aimed to gain insights into the potential volatile emissions, mobility, and mortality rates of the insects after undergoing a ship voyage across the equator (i.e. from northern hemisphere winter to southern hemisphere summer). Experiments were performed to simulate the effects on aggregations of diapausing H. halys of two variables associated with trans-Pacific voyages, i.e. ship and container movement and temperature changes within containers. Thus, H. halys aggregations were exposed to simulated shipping movement, using a 6-axis VS-6577G-B Denso robot arm, and emission of defence volatiles was measured repeatedly during the voyage. We also simulated temperature changes as they occur during a 26-day voyage from Baltimore, northeast USA, to Auckland, New Zealand, and assessed the effects on the mortality and mobility of the bugs. Aggregations that experienced movement were not found to be any more likely to release volatiles than stationary aggregations and neither did the movement affect bug mobility. Temperature changes had a significant effect on mobility. However, towards the end of the temperature simulation, most H. halys had died, probably from a lack of food and moisture. These findings are highly relevant for border biosecurity risk assessment and pathway risk management.

AB  - Eradication of invasive alien species is a form of pest control linked to biodiversity conservation, which usually involves animal killing. Squirrels are prominent among invasive alien species in Italy, with four species introduced. Three of them are included within the list of alien species of European concern, and their eradication and control is recommended. However, their local control is not an easy task, being often hindered by the general public. We propose a socio-ecological approach to evaluate the feasibility of eradicating Siberian chipmunks Eutamias sibiricus populations in Italy. We performed a structured questionnaire to assess the social perception of invasive Siberian chipmunks in urban parks, and to identify groups of visitors who might oppose eradication. We also carried out geographic profiling to test for the spatial expansion of chipmunk populations. Overall, park visitors regarded chipmunks positively and appreciated to see them, but human-chipmunk interactions were still rare. We did not identify any group of visitors with a strong attachment to chipmunks, who might oppose future control programs. Geographic profiling showed that chipmunks in Valeggio sul Mincio are starting to expand outside of their introduction site. Data from questionnaires show that chipmunks eradication, coupled with adequate communication initiatives, might be feasible. Moreover, geographic profiling indicates that time for a rapid removal is running out. Socio-ecological approaches, combining the analysis of structured questionnaires administered to stakeholders and statistical modeling of pest observations, could be a valuable tool to decide the feasibility and the urgency of invasive alien species control.

AB  - In this commentary, the author first seeks to counterbalance the current focus on the cost of cultural value mismatch by calling attention to ample evidence in the literature that value mismatch can produce cultural adaptation and resilience in the long run, besides promoting cultural innovations and individual creativity. Second, we propose three factors that differentiate the benefits from the costs of cultural value mismatch. Personal orientation towards integrating heritage and host culture, accurate perception of cultural value differences, and supportive multicultural environments are associated with benefits. In contrast, dichotomous orientation towards one or the other culture, exaggeration of value differences between heritage and host culture, and assimilationist social environments are associated with costs. Third, our analysis of the decoupling between cultural values and ecological niches in the special issue led to observation of bidirectionality in cultural value mismatch: Whereas most articles in the Special Issue focus on the cross-cultural value mismatch that occurs when people move from a more rural, low-resource, less technological ecology into a more urban, high-resource, more technological ecology, we were able to document the effects of value mismatch when movement occurs in the opposite direction.

AB  - Urban landscapes can present ecological challenges for wildlife species, yet many species survive, and even thrive, near dense human populations. Coyotes (Canis latrans), for example, have expanded their geographic range across North America and, as a result of their adaptability and behavioral flexibility, are now a common occupant of many urban areas in the United States. We investigated the spatial ecology of 27 coyotes fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry collars radio-collared in the Cuyahoga Valley, Ohio. Our objectives were to quantify coyote space use, evaluate resource selection, and investigate coyote movement and activity patterns. To measure space use, we estimated home range (95%) and core area (50%) size of coyotes using the adaptive local convex hull (a-LoCoH) method. We found the mean (+/- SE) home range size of resident coyotes (4.7 +/- 1.8 km(2)) was significantly smaller than ranges of transient coyotes (67.7 +/- 89.6 km(2)). Similarly, mean (+/- SE) core area size of resident coyotes (0.9 +/- 0.6 km(2)) was significantly smaller than core areas of transient coyotes (11.9 +/- 16.7 km(2)). Home range and core area size of both resident and transient coyotes did not vary by sex, age, or season. For all coyotes, use of natural land cover was significantly greater than use of altered and developed land. When coyotes were using altered and developed land, GPS fixes were most common at night. Coyote movement patterns differed with respect to status, time period, and season; peaking during nighttime hours. A better understanding of coyote space use and movement within anthropogenic landscapes aids management of people, parks, and wildlife by providing the data necessary for research-based management decisions.

AB  - Water insecurity in developing country contexts has frequently led individuals and entire communities to shift their consumptive patterns towards bottled water. Bottled water is sometimes touted as a mechanism to enact the human right to water through distribution across drought-stricken or infrastructure-compromised communities. However, the global bottled water industry is a multi-billion dollar major business. How did we reach a point where the commodification of a human right became not only commonly accepted but even promoted? In this paper, I argue that a discussion of the politics of bottled water necessitates a re-theorization of what constitutes the political and how politics affects policy decisions regarding the governance of bottled water. In this article I examine bottled water as a political phenomenon that occurs not in a vacuum but in a poorly regulated context. I explore the role of weakened regulatory regimes and regulatory capture in the emergence, consolidation and, ultimately, supremacy of bottled water over network-distributed, delivered-by-a-public utility tap water. My argument uses a combined framework that interweaves notions of the political, ideas on regulatory capture, the concept of the public, branding, and regulation theory to retheorize how we conceptualize the politics of bottled water.

AB  - The pollination of 20 common terrestrial orchids was studied in a 60-ha urban banksia and eucalypt dominated woodland in Western Australia. Five years of data (24,000 flowers, 6800 plants) measured fruit set relative to floral areas, capsule volumes, climate, phenology, pollination mechanisms, disturbance tolerance and demography. Pollination varied from 0-95% of flowers, floral displays from 90-3300 mm(2) and capsules from 15-1300 mm(3) per spike. Pollination traits strongly influenced outcomes, with self-pollination highest (59-95%), followed by sexually deceptive autumn or winter-flowering (18-39%), visual deception (0-48%) and sexually deceptive spring-flowering (13-16%). Pollination was limited by drought in autumn or spring and cool winter temperatures. Some orchids were resilient to drought and one formed seed after the leaves withered. Plant density had the greatest impact on fruit set for orchids forming large groups, especially for sexually deceptive pollination. Consequently, small group average (SGA) pollination was up to 4x greater than overall averages and peak seed production occurred in the best locations for genetic exchange and dispersal. SGA rates and seedpod volumes were strongly linked to clonality, but not to demographic trends. Resource competition limited flowering at higher plant densities and competition within spikes resulted in smaller, later-forming seedpods. Pollination data from co-occurring common orchids identified five evolutionary trade-offs linked to pollination, provided baseline data for rare species and revealed impacts of changing climate.

AB  - Since Independence, Muslim politics in India has mainly been framed through the idiom of identity. While political engagements calling for democratization and increased participation in public life have occasionally occurred, scholarly interest in the ongoing shifts in Muslim political demands is recent and new. Simultaneously, the emerging literature on the politics of patronage and post-patronage networks in democracies of the Global South present anthropologists with new tools for studying the changing contours of the political mobilization of the urban poor. Using ethnographic narratives collected during fieldwork in Park Circus-one of Kolkata's many Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods-which remains stigmatized and socially and spatially set apart, this article highlights the emerging modes of political engagement among poor and lower middle-class Muslims. I carefully document their efforts to negotiate a perceived 'better' life within a fast-changing neoliberal urban landscape that is prejudiced against them. For many ordinary Muslims, this has involved a movement away from the traditional elite-led politics of identity towards more plebeian forms of assertion and activism aimed at eking out a respectable living by working through extant structures of the local administration and networks of power in the neighbourhood.

AB  - This article analysis the socio-political form of the migrant squats, and the socio-spatial interactions they foster and generate. Drawing on empirical research, it focuses on the Athenian context where, since September 2015, political groups belonging to the anti-authoritarian and Left-libertarian movement, occupied some empty buildings to host migrants in transit through the country. From a political perspective, the squats are interpreted here as strategies of struggle to gain access to the space of the city and they also constitute instances of migrant activism and resistance to the European border regime. Moreover, migrant occupations represent practices and sites for contesting citizenship, intended as a category of political status; as such, they exceed the limits of this category and move beyond the boundaries of the nation-state, originating practices of citizenship 'from below', while at the same time they produce subjectivities that choose to 'opt out' of citizenship as a legal status. This article is situated within the contextualisation of space and autonomy. Migrant squats are looked at from the angle of the 'gaze of autonomy', since they are aimed both at contesting citizenship as an exclusionary feature, and at revindicating the activists' (both migrants and non) presence in the space of city.

AB  - To address the call for developing passive climate resilience strategies, the project examines the influence and effectiveness of utilising vertical greening for reducing space-conditioning loads of urban buildings and surrounding microclimates. By examining this focus, the project aims to improve the design of urban built environments that would in turn lead to health and wellbeing enhancements of their growing populations. The purpose of this paper is to present preliminary findings from a monitoring campaign carried out at an indoor atrium case study in Cambridge, UK. Key parameters monitored included soil, surface, and air temperature; relative humidity; and surface air movement. Results obtained show relatively lower air temperature and higher relative humidity levels proximate to the living wall. Wintertime monitoring has also indicated a surface flow pattern that demonstrates the presence of a modest downdraught effect. Although these modifications are modest in magnitude, they could still offer significant localised thermal comfort benefit to building occupants, as well as potential for contributing to a reduced space-conditioning load.

AB  - The Hindustan citrus mite, Schizotetranychus hindustanicus Hirst (Acari: Tetranychidae), is a quarantine pest present in the state of Roraima, Brazil. This mite, which was described in India in 1924, was reported in 2002 in Venezuela and spread to Roraima, where it was reported in 2008, and to Colombia, where it was reported in 2010. Its possible spread to other regions of Brazil is a threat to Brazilian citriculture. This study reports the current distribution of S. hindustanicus and potential predators of this pest and other mites associated with citrus in Roraima. A survey was conducted in August and September 2015 in the 15 municipalities of the state. In each municipality, orchards and citrus plants in backyards and public areas along highways and in urban areas were sampled. Samples of leaves and fruits were collected to identify the mite and its natural enemies. Schizotetranychus hindustanicus was found in all 15 municipalities in the state of Roraima. In total, 308 associated mites were found, with S. hindustanicus being the most abundant phytophagous mite, followed by Brevipalpus yothersi Baker. Amblyseius aerialis (Muma) was the most abundant predator, followed by Iphiseiodes zuluagai Denmark and Muma and Euseius concordis (Chant). The broad dispersal of S. hindustanicus in Roraima increases the risks of this pest reaching the main citrus-producing regions in Brazil.

AB  - Research on enacted stigma, or stigma- and bias-based victimization, including bullying and harassment, among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth often focuses on one context (e.g., school) or one form (e.g., bullying or microaggressions), which limits our understanding of these experiences. We conducted qualitative go-along interviews with 66 LGBTQ adolescents (14-19 years) in urban, suburban, town, and rural locations in the United States and Canada identified through purposive and snowball sampling. Forty-six participants (70%) described at least one instance of enacted stigma. Three primary themes emerged: (1) enacted stigma occurred in many contexts; (2) enacted stigma restricted movement; and (3) second-hand accounts of enacted stigma shaped perceptions of safety. Efforts to improve well-being among LGBTQ youth must address the diverse forms and contexts of enacted stigma that youth experience, which limit freedom of movement and potential access to opportunities that encourage positive youth development. School nurses can play a critical role in reducing enacted stigma in schools and in collaboration with community partners.

AB  - Foodborne illness is a difficult public health burden to measure, with accurate incidence data usually evading disease surveillance systems. Yet, the global scope of foodborne disease and its impacts on socioeconomic development make it an important health risk to address, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In Vietnam, rapid development has seen large-scale commercial operations rise to coexist amongst traditional value chains in the food landscape, most of which operates outside of a domestic food safety network. Rapid socioeconomic development has also seen an increase in meat consumption, with pork being the most consumed meat product nationally. Expanding pork value chains, and the increasing diversity of actors within them, facilitates the growth and propagation of hazards which are passed onto Vietnamese consumers. In order to guide illness prevention and governance efforts, this review was conducted to examine health risks associated with pork consumption in Vietnam. Synthesis of the available literature provided evidence that Salmonella spp. bacteria are a major cause of foodborne illness from Vietnamese pork products. However, contaminants of global concern, including Salmonella spp. and Trichinella spiralis, occur alongside those considered neglected tropical diseases, such as Taenia solium. Infections and complications associated with ingestion of Streptococcus suis bacteria are also an issue, with Streptococcus suis infections usually limited to occupational infections amongst meat handlers in modernised value chains. A risk factor underscoring transmission of Trichinella spiralis, Taenia solium, and Streptococcus suis in Vietnam that emerges from the literature is the consumption of dishes containing raw or undercooked pork. Available data indicates that infections associated with raw pork consumption disproportionately affect men and people in regional mountainous areas of northwest Vietnam, where many of Vietnam's ethnic minority communities reside. In addition, epidemiological data from recorded disease outbreaks that result from raw pork consumption demonstrate that these outbreaks usually follow major sociocultural events such as weddings, funerals, and Lunar New Year celebrations. Potential health impacts resulting from residues of antibiotics and heavy metals are also cause for concern, though the direct links between chemical contaminants in food and the development of disease are difficult to conclusively deduce.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have recently emerged as globally important infections. This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the occurrence of CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks throughout the major international seaport city of Barranquilla, Colombia in 2014 and 2016 and the potential for clustering. Incidence data were fitted using multiple Bayesian Poisson models based on multiple explanatory variables as potential risk factors identified from other studies and options for random effects. A best fit model was used to analyse their case incidence risks and identify any risk factors during their epidemics. Neighbourhoods in the northern region were hotspots for both CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks. Additional hotspots occurred in the southwestern and some eastern/southeastern areas during their outbreaks containing part of, or immediately adjacent to, the major circular city road with its import/export cargo warehouses and harbour area. Multivariate conditional autoregressive models strongly identified higher socioeconomic strata and living in a neighbourhood near a major road as risk factors for ZIKV case incidences. These findings will help to appropriately focus vector control efforts but also challenge the belief that these infections are driven by social vulnerability and merit further study both in Barranquilla and throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions.

AB  - Habitats for pond-breeding salamanders are declining as a result of land development and management abandonment. In that context, a pond-breeding salamander Hynohius tokyoensis has recently been known to breed in small streams. However, little is known about the ecology of pond-breeding salamander larvae, such as food, in small streams. Here, to gain insight into foraging ecology of Hynobius tokyoensis larvae in small steams, we investigated the potential prey items in nine small streams running through secondary forests in Hachiouji City, Tokyo, Japan. In addition, we hypothesized that H. tokyoensis larvae preferentially predate active prey invertebrates over less-active prey because they are generalist, sit-and-wait predators. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally examined predation frequencies by H. tokyoensis larvae on the two major arthropod species (isopods and Plecoptera larvae) and activity (i.e., movement frequencies and distances) of the potential prey. As a result, isopods (Asellus hilgendorfii) and Plecoptera (Nemouridae larvae) are the two dominant aquatic invertebrates in small streams inhabited by H. tokyoensis, larval salamanders consumed more isopods than Plecoptera larvae and isopods are more active than Plecoptera larvae. Taken together, we concluded that isopods should be the main prey for salamander larvae inhabiting small streams due to their high abundance and conspicuous activities.

AB  - Across the globe, communities are facing unprecedented environmental challenges in many cases because of climate change. The increase in urbanization, the movement of people from rural communities relocating into urban areas, the issue of population density, and a rise in extreme weather are all contributing to these challenges. Although natural and manmade disasters have always existed, the increase in urbanization as a result of the movement of people into urban areas, the resulting increase in population density, and a rise in frequency of extreme weather events are factors that contribute to these challenges. There is a growing field of evidence that individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted by disasters due to factors such as exposure to the elements, lack of resources and services, as well as disenfranchisement, and stigma associated with homelessness, all while experiencing greater occurrences of environmental injustice. The shrinking support for funding such services, increasing income inequality between classes, and cultural justifications for criminalizing poverty and homelessness contribute to our collective understanding of disaster vulnerability when experiencing homelessness. Given that there are distinct needs for individuals experiencing homelessness when affected by disasters, this article proposes recommendations for improving policy, research, and services to address these disparities. Trends in income inequality and homelessness have serious implications for planning and response, and recovery from natural or manmade disasters. As such, there is a need to periodically review progress, identify current gaps and unmet needs, and identify opportunities for improvement.

AB  - The availability of quantitative long term datasets on the phytobenthic assemblages of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (southern Italy, Mediterranean Sea), a lagoon like semi-enclosed coastal basin included in the Italian LTER network, enabled careful analysis of changes occurring in the structure of the community over about thirty years. The total number of taxa differed over the years. Thirteen non-indigenous species in total were found, their number varied over the years, reaching its highest value in 2017. The dominant taxa differed over the years. The number of species in each taxonomic division also varied. In addition to the centuries-old exploitation of its biotic resources, mainly molluscs, the basin has been subject for a long time to a range of anthropogenic driving forces linked to urbanisation, shipbuilding, agriculture and military activities, which have caused chemical and biological pollution, eutrophication and habitat destruction. It may therefore be assumed that these changes were closely related to human activities. Indeed, it was observed that the reduction of only one of these forces, i.e. urban sewage discharge, triggered the recovery of phytobenthos. Therefore, it may be assumed that if the anthropogenic pressure on the Mar Piccolo was eased, it could once again become the paradisiacal place it was held to be in ancient times.

AB  - Between July and August 2018, two outbreaks of infectious laryngotracheitis caused the death of over 116,000 commercial poultry (layers and broilers) near the city of Windhoek, Namibia. A third outbreak occurred in September 2018 in the north of the country approximately 800 km from the original outbreaks. Sample collection and molecular epidemiological analyses revealed that the outbreaks were most likely caused by poor vaccination practices leading to the reversion to virulence of an ILT vaccine strain. The analyses also indicate that inaccurate declarations were made by one of the farms involved and that illegal movement of animals most likely occurred.

AB  - In this study, we employed multitemporal InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) (MT-InSAR) to detect spatial and temporal ground deformations over the whole Tianjin region in the North China Plain area. Twenty-five ascending Sentinel-1A terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes covering this area, acquired from 9 January 2016 to 8 June 2017, were processed using InSAR time series analysis. The deformation results derived from Sentinel-1A MT-InSAR were validated with continuously operating reference stations (CORS) at four sites and four stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC). The overall results show good agreement, demonstrating the suitability of applying Doris with Sentinel-1A data to high-resolution monitoring of surface deformation. Significant deformation variations have been observed in different parts of Tianjin. These gradually increased from the central part of the metropolitan area to the nearby suburbs. The deformation rate of the main urban area is well-balanced and it is also relatively linear, with uplifting rates ranging from 0 to 20 mm/yr. However, due to the diversity of the geological conditions and anthropogenic activities, remarkable signs of subsidence were found in several parts of Tianjin. In particular, the south-western part of Wuqing District and western part of Beichen District showed subsidence rates of up to -136 mm/yr. We also found that, in addition to groundwater over-exploitation and lithological characteristics, additional factors also influence ground subsidence, including dynamic loads (e.g., railways), static loads (e.g., urban construction), and groundwater recharging.

AB  - Against the backdrop of the destruction of Iraqi heritage over the past quarter of a century, this article critically reviews key aspects of the current state of Iraq's cultural heritage, including damage to heritage buildings caused by Daesh in Iraq's second largest city, Mosul. We bring together Iraqi and non-Iraqi expertise in heritage, archaeology, and human rights law to frame our approach, building on the movement to link cultural diversity, heritage, and cultural rights. We emphasise the need for planning to enhance protection of Iraq's heritage, in particular through the preparation of inventories, the provision of resources for heritage education in schools and the development of Iraq's museum sector. Iraq's presence on the UNESCO World Heritage Lists needs to be enhanced, and the issues of illicit site looting and traffic in looted antiquities must be addressed within international contexts. Iraq's future accession as State Party to the 1999 Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention is a priority in achieving these goals. The paper stresses the need for co-creation of heritage knowledge and a gender-sensitive human rights approach for the future of Iraq's globally significant cultural heritage.

AB  - Since chikungunya virus emerged in the Caribbean region in late 2013, approximate to 45 countries have experienced chikungunya outbreaks. We described and quantified the spatial and temporal events after the introduction and propagation of chikungunya into an immunologically naive population from the urban north-central region of Venezuela during 2014. The epidemic curve (n = 810 cases) unraveled within 5 months with a basic reproductive number of 3.7 and a radial spread traveled distance of 9.4 km at a mean velocity of 82.9 m/day. The highest disease diffusion speed occurred during the first 90 days, and space and space-time modeling suggest the epidemic followed a particular geographic pathway with spatiotemporal aggregation. The directionality and heterogeneity of transmission during the first introduction of chikungunya indicated existence of areas of diffusion and elevated risk for disease and highlight the importance of epidemic preparedness. This information will help in managing future threats of new or reemerging arboviruses.

AB  - A better understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution of landslides in urban zones is a key factor in assessing the risk of future slides within these areas. The El Biar landslide, located around the center of Algiers city, is one of the most important landslides in the region. It occurs mostly within a high strategic zone between schools, embassies and security buildings, thus causing a real risk for the population since it covers an area of 40 ha. The detection of various landslide-breaking surfaces leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of ground movement. In this work, we have combined two methods in order to provide strong evidence of its spatiotemporal evolution. The first method is based on field investigations to map old scarps related to the activity of the landslide. To better constrain our field investigations, most recent field observations were complemented by a second geophysical method using ground-penetrating radar with two different antennae which propagate under the two frequencies of 30 MHz and 100 MHz. As a result, we have reviewed this sliding area in detail and presented a new map of the whole affected zone. We have also delimited the affected zone by drawing a new map of the landslide. Combining field observations and the geophysical survey, we have highlighted the main discontinuity surfaces that lead us to suggest plausible realistic scenarios concerning the landslide's evolution.

AB  - Isolated patches resulting from habitat fragmentation can be surrounded by matrices with different permeabilities that can restrict dispersal and affect space use patterns. In this study, we examined the consequences of being isolated by matrices with different permeabilities on the space use patterns of the stone marten (Martes foina). We radio-tracked 41 martens at two study sites: a highly isolated site (HIS) in villages inside Biaowiea Primeval Forest and a low-isolated site (LIS) in villages within a heterogenous landscape comprising a mosaic of agriculture and forest patches. Observations since 1991 documented the population as having a high proportion of males, which significantly declined after 2011. At both sites, stone martens used larger home ranges in spring-summer than in autumn-winter, and males had two to five times larger home ranges than females. Martens adopted two strategies of home range usestationary or roaming. Roamer individuals only occurred at the HIS, had a 7-fold larger home range size, and moved farther between independent locations than stationary individuals. Roamers often switched between strategies and were in worse condition than stationary martens. Stationary martens used some of the smallest home ranges in Europe, with sizes similar to martens living in cities, while roamers had some of the largest, similar to stone martens inhabiting forests. Seasonal home ranges of stationary individuals did not differ between the study sites, but at the HIS, fidelity to home ranges was lower. Analyses of genetic relationship between individuals showed that dispersal distances from natal areas were shorter at the HIS. The study showed that stone martens exhibit great plasticity in space use.

AB  - The North American citrus flatid planthopper, Metcalfa pruinosa (Say) (Hemiptera Flatidae), introduced in Europe in the late seventies, has become a major pest of a wide range of plant taxa in many countries throughout the continent. In Italy, the early recognition of this rapidly spreading species resulted in the introduction of Neodryinus typhlocybae (Hymenoptera Dryinidae), an already known natural enemy of M. pruinosa in North America, and was followed by intentional release programmes in several additional countries within southern Europe. However, the features of dispersal and the impact of the parasitoid species on the populations of the pest have been studied only in a few cases. There is a lack of information on the occurrence and biology of N. typhlocybae in other regions of the continent, including Hungary, where N. typhlocybae was first recorded only in 2014. The results of this study, carried out in Hungary between 2015-2018, revealed that although there had been no official release programmes for N. typhlocybae it became widely distributed. The rate of parasitism ranged between 0.66% (in Martonvasar, 2016) and 29.65% (in Kaposvar, 2018). The species was found to develop through one or two generations a year, with a major proportion of the studied populations being bivoltine. These findings suggest N. typhlocybae could provide effective and environmentally sound control of M. pruinosa in urban habitats. Furthermore, N. typhlocybae is reported here for the first time from Slovakia, indicating the natural range expansion of the parasitoid in Central Europe. A hyperparasitoid species, Cheiloneurus boldyrevi (Hymenoptera Encyrtidae) is first recorded from Hungary.

AB  - BackgroundCache Valley virus (CVV; Bunyavirales, Peribunyaviridae) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus endemic in North America. Although severe diseases are mainly observed in pregnant ruminants, CVV has also been recognized as a zoonotic pathogen that can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. Human exposures to CVV and its related subtypes occur frequently under different ecological conditions in the New World; however, neurotropic disease is rarely reported. High prevalence rates of neutralizing antibodies have been detected among residents in several Latin American cities. However, zoophilic mosquito species involved in the enzootic transmission are unlikely to be responsible for the transmission leading to human exposures to CVV. Mechanisms that lead to frequent human exposures to CVV remain largely unknown. In this study, competence of two anthropophilic mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti, for CVV was determined using per os infection to determine if these species could play a role in the transmission of CVV in the domestic and peridomestic settings of urban and suburban areas.ResultsAedes albopictus were highly susceptible to CVV whereas infection of Ae. aegypti occurred at a significantly lower frequency. Whilst the dissemination rates of CVV were comparable in the two species, the relatively long period to attain maximal infectious titer in Ae. aegypti demonstrated a significant difference in the replication kinetics of CVV in these species. Detection of viral RNA in saliva suggests that both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti are competent vectors for CVV under laboratory conditions.ConclusionsDifferential susceptibility to CVV was observed in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, reflecting their relatively different capacities for vectoring CVV in nature. The high susceptibility of Ae. albopictus to CVV observed in this study suggests its potential role as an efficient vector for CVV. Complemented by the reports of multiple CVV isolates derived from Ae. albopictus, our finding provides the basis for how the dispersal of Ae. albopictus across the New World may have a significant impact on the transmission and ecology of CVV.

TI  - "The Banks are Our Stages": Flo6x8 and Flamenco Performance as Protest in Southern Spain
T2  - POPULAR MUSIC AND SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - In May 2011, a widespread protest movement known as 15M emerged in Spain, emphasizing the sustained and purposeful occupation of public spaces. Based in Seville, the performance collective Flo6x8 protests financial and political malfeasance in Spain by converting corporate banks into flamenco performance and recording spaces. This article explores how Flo6x8 generates new physical and conceptual spaces for political expression and protest in Spain's 15M Movement through their pioneering use of digital media, flash mobs, and flamenco performance. Flo6x8 temporarily converts spaces of the opposition into oppositional spaces and channels public outrage into powerful and irreverent productions. The group appropriates enduring symbols and associations of flamenco, including poverty and alienation, while simultaneously challenging notions of where and when performances of flamenco should happen. Drawing from literature in performance studies, theory of social movements, critical urban theory, and ethnographies of precarity and austerity in southern Europe, this article considers how visual, corporeal, and spatial elements are critical factors that shape the meanings of flamenco performance and protest in twenty-first-century Spain.

AB  - The subject of this paper is one of the strategic initiatives of the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia and Dabrowa Basin, usually referred to in Poland as the Silesian Metropolis, which began its activity on January 1, 2018. The Silesian Metropolis lies within one of the largest urban areas in the European Union. The process of building a strong metropolitan center is a long-term process and will cover all areas of social and economic life, including space for the creation, development and further functioning of the start-up community with the support of the launched network of accelerators for start-ups. Accelerators help nascent firms, and particularly high-tech start-ups succeed in the early stages of development by providing services such as office spaces, mentoring, networking and a variety of educational programs. Accelerators are quite a new phenomenon; therefore, little research has done on accelerators. The purpose of this study is to contribute into explain the diversity found among accelerator. On the basis of conceptual reflection, it is shown that the configurational approach can be use in this case in particular, and in research on accelerators in general. In this paper, we have shown that research on accelerators can benefit from the input of configurational approach. To do so, we have given details of how the three main concepts of ideal type, "fit" and equifinality - developed from this approach - play a part in explaining the existence of several categories of accelerators. The main benefits from the conceptual framework lie in its highlighting of five coherent functional-structure pairings to which accelerators can be assimilated.

AB  - In the past 15 years, we have witnessed an upsurge of collaborative spaces providing an arena for individual and collective creativity, (co)creating craft-based products, urban manufacturing, and experimentation with business or creative ideas using innovative technologies such as 3D printing or CNC milling machines. The discourses on spaces such as coworking, hacker- or makerspaces, accelerators, Fab Labs, and open workshops promise new communities, more innovation, and a transformation of work. This has called for interdisciplinary scholarly attention, primarily from organization and management studies, sociology, and entrepreneurship studies. However, little attention has so far been paid to this development from the perspective of geography. This paper employs Open Creative Labs as an umbrella term for the diversity of spaces and aims at, first, providing an overview of recent interdisciplinary perspectives on the functions of labs in coordinating creativity and entrepreneurship, as well as the motivations of users to utilize these spaces for their projects, and, second, offers an approach to a multiscalar spatial conceptualizations of labs. The paper concludes by exploring policy implications that may benefit from an economic-geography perspective.

AB  - The Guttural Toad, Sclerophrys gutturalis, has three established invaded regions: on Mauritius and Reunion islands, and in Constantia, a peri-urban area of Cape Town, South Africa. The native range of this toad covers much of central and southern Africa. Here we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to sample across the range of the natural distribution (from Ethiopia to South Africa) and compare ND2 and 16S sequences to those from animals sampled from each of the three invaded regions. We show that all individuals in invaded regions refer to the same mtDNA clade, which is naturally distributed in north-eastern South Africa, but not from adjoining Mozambique or southernmost Eastern Cape areas. Our findings corroborate previous reports of deliberate introductions from South Africa to Mauritius, and from Mauritius to Reunion. Similarly, our results suggest a single accidental translocation within South Africa from the northeast to Constantia. Our findings highlight the combination of anthropophilic behavior, and extreme long-distance dispersal occurring with accidental translocation for this species. We caution that accidental pathways are likely to continue into the future, with increasing numbers of invasive populations of this species.

AB  - Invasive predators have caused widespread loss of biodiversity in island ecosystems, yet certain species are able to tolerate the presence of generalist invaders. For example, the invasive brown treesnake (BTS; Boiga irregularis) ca used the extirpation of 10 of 12 native forest bird species on the island of Guam, but a remnant population of the Micronesian Starling (Aplonis opaca), or Sall, has managed to persist on a military installation in northern Guam. Understanding how Micronesian Starlings are coping with the presence of BTS can inform conservation efforts for island bird populations facing invasive predators and provide insight into strategies for expanding the starling population. We monitored the survival, movements, and habitat use of 43 radio-tagged starling fledglings during this vulnerable life-history stage. Invasive predators accounted for 75% of fledgling mortality (56% from BTS; 19% from feral cats) and contributed to one of the lowest post-fledging survival rates (38% through day 21 post-fledging) recorded for passerine birds. Predation by BTS persisted at elevated rates following natal dispersal, further reducing cumulative survival to 26% through 53 days post-fledging. Nest location was an important predictor of survival:fledglings from nest boxes closer to the forest edge were more likely to use forest habitat at younger ages and more likely to be depredated by BTS. Overall, our findings indicate that BTS continue to severely impact Guam's starling population, even more so than invasive predators affect native birds in other island systems. We recommend deploying nest boxes fartherfrom the forest to improve fledgling survival and implementing urban predator control to promote growth of the Micronesian Starling population on Guam and facilitate future reintroduction of other species.

AB  - Hiptage is an Asia-endemic genus of Malpighiaceae currently placed in the tetrapteroid Glade, representing one of the seven inter-continent dispersions from New to Old World. A molecular phylogeny based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was recovered for the first time for the genus. Our results showed that the most recent common ancestor of Hiptage probably originated in the South Indo-China Peninsula and diversified in this region. Based on phylogenetic evidence and relevant morphological traits, we propose a new species; Hiptage incurvatum is characterised by mericarps with arcuate anterior lateral wings, two large glands on the dorsal sepals, and small glands on the remaining sepals. The new species is from Mt. Cangshan, Dali City (25 degrees 35'N, 100 degrees 02'E) in North Yunnan, Southwest China and is notable for its occurrence at high altitude, 1400 m (the highest distribution currently known for the genus). The implications of this unusual species for the dispersal and evolution of the genus are discussed.

Guanajuato is a state situated in the center west of Mexico, characterized by a strong catholic conservatism, in which protestant groups have had to adapt their evangelizing ways.
   Such is the case of Methodist women, who carry out a "leadership in movement", since, regardless of the place they occupy in the ecclesiastic hierarchy, they transcend the norms and the religious discourse on what the feminine "should be", establishing evangelization strategies linked to the management of their emotions, through which they show the inequalities that they experience, both inside and outside their church.
   Spatial mobility was important in order to understand their participation, so it was necessary to resort to a methodology that would allow me to account for the scope of the female Methodist activity, such as multisited ethnography. This enabled different dimensions of observation, adding to the analysis a macro and micro vision of the Methodist women's leadership in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico.

AB  - Rural education first emerged in 1960 as a state strategy to contain rural exodus to the periphery of the big cities, but, at same time, also answered the demands of the Rural Workers Movement, who sought to ensure that regional and cultural singularities were contemplated. Attending to that propositions, was created in 1965 the State Field College, that caters for elementary and high school students, located in a district of Medianeira, in the west of Parana, scenario of this study. Based on an analysis of the Pedagogical Political Project, the objective as to approach the orientations directed to the Field Education - respect to the field diversity in its social, cultural, environmental, political, economic, gender, generational and race and ethnicity aspects - arguing in favor of the activities focused to the multiliteracy, in a perspective of the discursive genres, with possibility to attend to these orientations. As a result, we realize that developing activities based on multiliteracies with students from the Field Education becomes essential for the universal knowledge to be expanded, but also the local knowledge, contributing to democratization, the access, the permanence and the conclusion of the educational process of these students. We concluded that through multiliterated activities, we can help our students make deeper critical reflections, taking advantages of practices situated in language, while moving between the most diverse social spheres, with the purpose of becoming autonomous in the construction of knowledge.

AB  - The African Middle Stone Age (MSA, typical range similar to 320-30 ka) has been the subject of intense research interest in recent decades as a culture-chronological Unit associated with the emergence and dispersal of our species. Recent results of this work have shown that sites designated as "MSA" contain common approaches to lithic reduction, but that within this rubric, there is much diversity in overall assemblage characteristics and the timing of their appearance across the continent. As researchers recover more data from more sites, especially from undersampled geographic regions, this more complex picture of the MSA reveals technological and other behavioral diversity in early modern human populations that may inform about the ultimate success of our species. Here we add to this growing database by describing the environmental context and characteristics of two concentrations of stone artifacts from the late MSA (similar to 43-21 ka) open-air locality of Chaminade-I (CHA-I), near the town of Karonga in northern Malawi. The CHA-I lithic artifacts show a flexible approach to stone tool production and use that is common to assemblages in Karonga but distinctive from MSA sites reported elsewhere. Radial and minimally reduced cores typify an unelaborated lithic assemblage, in which raw material choice is driven by toolstone clast size and shape rather than preferential use or treatment of specific materials, as found in MSA assemblages in the East African Rift, South Africa, and the North African coast. Lithic reduction at CHA-I took place within a woody, riparian context embedded within a more open woodland landscape. Most artifacts occurred in near-channel sandy deposits dated to similar to 41 ka, and were buried under alluvial fan deposits that began aggrading by at least similar to 21 ka and continued beyond similar to 5.5 ka within a grassy, open landscape. The site's late MSA age and lack of elaboration in lithic technology challenges straightforward ideas of increasing complexity in human technological behavior over time and provides important insight into the diversity of MSA technologies and the environmental conditions in which they existed.

CP  - IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (IEEE-ITSC)
AB  - We propose an approach to classify possible interaction types between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians based on the idea of resource competition in shared spaces. Autonomous vehicles are more challenged in urban traffic scenarios as lots of uncertainties influence the current world model. Urban environments impose very little constraints on the motion of pedestrians. This creates the demand for an approach to determine intentions for each pedestrian as far ahead as possible and to react to changes early. A motion model based on goal-driven pedestrian movement shows a set of most likely planned trajectories. These are analyzed for overlapping occupation times in road segments, thus interactions with the vehicle. The output is an early estimation which suggests most probable interaction types and places. From this estimation, current trajectory of the pedestrian is used to refine the prediction of the most probable intention of interaction place and type. In the end the algorithm combines topological and behavioral input to infer and validate long term intention of interaction type before being able to actually infer the interaction from current dynamics.
   In terms of a proof-of-concept, the applicability of the approach is validated on real world scenarios from the Cityscapes data set.

TI  - Identifying the Indoor Space Characteristics of an Urban Railway Station Based on Pedestrian Trajectory Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA  - English
AB  - Stations are being converted into various living spaces that can be used for public transportation, work, commerce, and leisure. To satisfy the various requirements and expectations for functional extension, it is necessary to investigate and understand the phenomena caused by users. A methodology to cluster the characteristics of pedestrian space of a railway station through the pedestrian trajectory data collected from an actual operating station is proposed in this paper. Then the spatial usability of the movement and stay of pedestrians were defined through the results of the clustering. The procedure to cluster the indoor space characteristics of an urban railway station in this study consists of four steps: data collection, feature vector extraction, K-means clustering, and cluster characteristics analysis. A case study was conducted for the Samseong station. The results of the proposed spatial clustering analysis showed that there are several types of spaces depending on the space occupancy characteristics of pedestrians. The proposed methodology could be applied to indoor space diagnosis from the perspective of station monitoring and management. In addition, the station operator could respond flexibly to unexpected events by monitoring the indoor spaces according to whether the flow is normal or suggestive of an emergency.

AB  - Using the example of Mykolaiv region the authors highlight the features of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1921 at the regional level. A comparative-historical method made it possible to compare the events of the Ukrainian Revolution at the national and regional levels; chronological method helped to establish difference between dating of the events in Kyiv and Mykolaiv; logical method provided an opportunity to combine and summarize historical facts which had already revealed earlier, and identify the features of the revolutionary events in Mykolaiv region. The scientific novelty of this study is that for the first time the specificity of the events of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1921 on the territory of the Mykolaiv region was discovered on the basis of unpublished sources and available historiographic basis. The main revolutionary events in the Mykolaiv region occurred in the context of state-building processes in Ukraine (periods of the Central Rada, P.Skoropadskyi and the Directory). At the local level, often these periods do not coincide chronologically with the general periodization of the history of the Ukrainian Revolution. For example, in Mykolaiv region the period of the Central Rada began later, namely after the October 1917 coup in Petrograd; the Directory period ended much sooner, after the second seizure of power by the Bolsheviks. A strong signal to the Ukrainian Central Rada was taken by the Mykolaiv Region after the Bolshevik coup in Petrograd. The recognition of the Ukrainian Central Rada in the region was due to the persistence of the Mykolaiv Council of United Ukrainian Organizations. The Central Rada did not have a clearly defined regional policy. This resulted in the loss of its credibility among peasants and townspeople. In the Mykolaiv area the Central Rada made mistakes in the land policy and did not take into account the powerful city factor - workers of the Mykolaiv shipyards. The peasants and the townspeople did not solve their major problems. This led to uprisings both in the city and in the countryside. The belated attention of the Central Rada to the events in Mykolaiv had no positive consequences. Instead, the local Bolsheviks, who at the beginning of the revolution were in fact a marginal political group, strengthened and gained influence among the proletarians and peasants of Mykolaiv region. Trying to correct the errors of the Central Rada the government of P.Skoropadskyi paid considerable attention to the Mykolaiv shipyards, achieved the return of Ukraine's fleet and shipyards. However, due to the German policy towards the shipyards and encroachment on unfinished warships, as well as the short term of power, it also failed to achieve significant results in this sphere. With it, in the period of P.Skoropadskyi the confrontation deepened between peasants and large landowners, which resulted in anti-hetman movement and uprisings. In the city, Ukrainian organizations under the Hetmanate did not have a significant impact on the population and official authorities because of ignoring them by German command and appointing former Russian generals to senior positions. The three-month period of the Directory is characterized by the chaotic power and events in which the presence of the Entente troops and the change of political views of Ataman N.Hryhoriev - from pro-Ukrainian to Bolshevik ones - played an important role. It was Hryhoriev's actions that led to the final loss of influence of the Mykolaiv Council of United Ukrainian Organizations on official authorities.
   Although First Winter Campaign of the Army of UPR covered a large part of the territory of Mykolaiv region and became a heroic page in the history of the Ukrainian Army, it had no natural connection with the processes taking place in Mykolaiv region. Instead, the peasant rebel movement played an important role and continued even after the major revolutionary events had ended.

AB  - Complaints on occupational diseases experienced by many workers. one of the causes of this complaint is the lack of good work position of a worker, an unfavorable work position and carried out for a long period of time will have a painful effect on the muscles. Driver is a job that requires a person to sit for a long time in the same position. this causes some workers to feel pain at some point on their body, such as the back and legs. driver's work area which is very limited to do the movement also makes the driver unable to stretch when in the car. This research will identify the level of ergonomic risk from the position of the driver of public transport in the city of Makassar using Nordic Body Map dan RULA method. This study involved 21 randomly selected drivers. The identification results using the Nordic body map method showed that the driver feels pain in some limbs such as the back, waist, hips buttock and legs. while the identification results using the RULA indicate that the current driving position has a very high ergonomic risk and must be change as soon as possible to avoid further injury in the future.

AB  - Purpose The retail property market is constantly adopting to the continuous demand of retailers and their consumers. This paper aims to investigate retail property market dynamics through spatial accessibility measures of the City of York street network. It explores how spatial accessibility metrics (SAM) explain retail market dynamics (RMD) through changes in the city's retail rental values and stock. Design/methodology/approach Valuation office agency (VOA) data sets (aspatial) and ordnance survey map (spatial) data form the empirical foundation for this investigation. Changes in rental value and retail stock between 2010 and 2017 VOA data sets represent the RMD variables. While, the configured street network measures of Space Syntax, namely, global integration, local integration, global choice and normalised angular choice form the SAM variables. The relationship between these variables is analysed through geo-visualisation and statistical testing using GIS and SPSS tools. Findings The study reveals that there has been an overall negative changes of 15 and 22% in rental value and retail stock, respectively, even though some locations within the sampled city (York, North Yorkshire, England) indicated positive changes. The study further indicated that changes in retail rental value and stock have occurred within locations with good accessibility index. It also verifies that there are spatial and statistical relationship between variables and 22% of RMD variability was jointly accounted for by SAM. Originality/value This research is first to investigates changes in retail property market variables through spatial accessibility measures of space syntax. It contributes to the burgeoning research field of real estate and Space Syntax.

AB  - Few studies have examined the role of space in social movements. The existing studies have primarily emphasized the physical nature of space (e.g., space as distance) and overlooked other attributes of space, such as space as the materialization of power relations and space as lived experience. In this article, we explore the role of space in social movements based on a case study of the Occupy Central in Hong Kong in 2014. During the protest, the organizers occupied and reconfigured the campuses and mobilized the participants both through and in space. We find that the campus space helped stimulate the feelings and emotions of the students and increased their enthusiasm to participate in the demonstration. The participants were then sent from the campuses (mobilization spaces) to the demonstration spaces where they occupied and transformed the urban public spaces into private spaces, thus leading to contention over and of space with the state powers. Our findings reveal that the campus space is an important resource that organizers can use for mobilization. We also find that the special features of a campus, including aggregation, networks, isolation, and homogeneity, can facilitate the formation of social movements. We argue that the three attributes of space interact with one another in facilitating the social movement. Thus, our findings suggest that space acts as not only the vessel of struggle but also a useful tool and a target of struggle.

AB  - Background Human mobility plays a central role in shaping pathogen transmission by generating spatial and/or individual variability in potential pathogen-transmitting contacts. Recent research has shown that symptomatic infection can influence human mobility and pathogen transmission dynamics. Better understanding the complex relationship between symptom severity, infectiousness, and human mobility requires quantification of movement patterns throughout infectiousness. For dengue virus (DENV), human infectiousness peaks 0-2 days after symptom onset, making it paramount to understand human movement patterns from the beginning of illness. Methodology and principal findings Through community-based febrile surveillance and RT-PCR assays, we identified a cohort of DENV+ residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru (n = 63). Using retrospective interviews, we measured the movements of these individuals when healthy and during each day of symptomatic illness. The most dramatic changes in mobility occurred during the first three days after symptom onset; individuals visited significantly fewer locations (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.017) and spent significantly more time at home (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.005), compared to when healthy. By 7-9 days after symptom onset, mobility measures had returned to healthy levels. Throughout an individual's symptomatic period, the day of illness and their subjective sense of well-being were the most significant predictors for the number of locations and houses they visited.
   Author summary Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. Due to the limited mobility of the mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus, human mobility can be a key to both understanding an individual's exposure to the virus and explaining the spread of dengue throughout a population. Accurate disease models should include human mobility; however, changes in human movement patterns due to the presence of symptoms need to be taken into account. We quantified the impact of symptom presence on human mobility throughout the infectious period by analyzing a dataset on the daily movements of dengue virus infected individuals. Accounting for these changing patterns of mobility will improve understanding of the complex relationship between symptom severity, human movement, and dengue virus transmission. Furthermore, dengue transmission models that incorporate symptom-driven mobility changes can be used to evaluate scenarios and strategies for disease prevention.

AB  - This study aimed to quantify the morphological variations of the tropical mesotidal barrier-spit systems (MBs) in Northeast Brazil to understand their evolution. Therefore, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images were used to construct two multitemporal analyses: one in 4-year intervals (low frequency) and another in 1-year intervals (high frequency). The results revealed that the coastal dynamic was so intense that only high-frequency analysis could represent its evolutionary behavior. Low-frequency analysis, on the other hand, could lead to the misinterpretation of the data. Despite the strong coastal dynamic, there was a long-term equilibrium in the areas occupied by the MBs. Furthermore, regarding evolutionary behavior, there were two different types of MBs: migrant and stationary. Migrant MB movement resulted from the joint actions of the meteo-oceanographic forcings that generally push the whole barrier westward, conserving its shape. The migration rate can reach 100 m per year. This process represents the visible and massive movement of sediment along the shore. The changes observed in most MBs, whether migrant or stationary, reflect their ephemeral nature and must serve as a warning for human interventions.

AB  - This article describes the expression of historical consciousness (Santos-Granero 2004) of the Kukama people, of Tupi-Guarani origin, which occupies the Amazonian floodplain. In its conceptual point of view, we find the existence of several categories of agents (Latour 2007), among them, "spirit-people", "animal-people", "plant-people", "fish-people" and "bird-people "that display intrinsic relationships (Tello Imaina 2016) and shape the territory based on mythemes (Levi-Strauss 1968) and landscape and material presences. Following this perspective, it is possible to notice a Kukama Amazonian cosmopolitics, related to the formation of its territory and the pattern of distribution of human and non-human agents in a "time without time" (Tello Imaina 2018) that orders social life and interactions with the environment of the tropical lowlands. To this end, we conducted an ethnographic work in the native community of Dos de Mayo, located in the Maranon river basin (Loreto, Peru), where we interviewed leaders, fishermen and the elderly; together with the inhabitants, we mapped places of sighting of the cosmological world and finding of archaeological artifacts; and we contrasted the testimonies with the opinions of wise Kukama from the city of Nauta. We found that the different versions follow the same pattern, describing a historical socio-spatial dynamics of affinities that forms a network of enchanted places that trace the Maranon-Ucayali fluvial axis, around the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve. This knowledge of the environment, related to the archaeological and linguistic knowledge about the Tupi trunk, opens space for a deeper anthropological debate about networks of sociability and forms of interaction between agents and their environment, both social and natural, in the Amazon. Thus, we seek to fill theoretical gaps in previous ethnographic research on the subject.

AB  - The stretch of eastern Salento coastline between Casalabate and the Cesine area, in the province of Lecce (Apulia, Italy), is characterized for over 35 km by sandy beaches of limited extension bordered laterally by small rock promontories and inland by a system of dunes, extensively eroded by sea waves and anthropogenic actions. These dune systems separated the beach environment from extensive wetlands that occupied more or less narrow morphological depressions. These wetlands are sites of geological interest both in the planning tools of the City of Lecce and in the register of the Geosites operated by the Apulia Region: they are precious witnesses of the natural coastal landscape that characterized the eastern sector of Salento until 1960. These areas also allow us to observe those phenomena no longer visible nowadays in the swamp areas totally occupied by inhabited centers: in particular, sinkhole processes may occur, causing damage to the houses and to the road network. Numerous cases have affected in particular the village of Casalabate, but also other sites as Torre Rinalda and Spiaggiabella. To these phenomena, floods have to be added, which determine a high hydraulic and geomorphological hazard in the area. Recognition of the wetlands as a significant geological heritage in the Apulian coastline should proceed through the understanding of the phenomena at the origin of the swamp areas. Awareness of the geological processes involved, and of the likely geological hazards as well, should include the use of didactic panels explaining the phenomena to landowners and inhabitants. Furthermore, such an approach could provide useful insights to the local administrators, aimed at developing and putting into practice the measures necessary for risk mitigation.

AB  - Mindfulness is increasingly lauded as a mark of well-being around the world, but less often is its opposite, mindlessness, articulated in discussions of mental health. In Thailand, where people follow the kinds of Theravada forms of Buddhism that have inspired today's global mindfulness movement, "mindlessness" is understood as a culturally salient mark of distress. In this article I address what mindlessness looks like for people in and around the Northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, where mindlessness can be thought of as ephemeral and passing as a fleeting forgetfulness that necessitates re-reading a page in a book, or as long lasting and powerful as a destabilizing condition to be treated in the in-patient ward of a psychiatric hospital. I emphasize local meanings and contexts of mindlessness, and their entanglement with broader discourses in the mindfulness movement, in order to point to mindlessness as a type of local and potentially international idiom of distress. I do this to argue for both the continued importance of cultural concepts of distress in our psychiatric nosology, and for further study into the slippages that can occur when local idioms like mindfulness go global.

AB  - With the human society transfers from scattered pieces to a society as a whole and the advent of the aviation era, the occurrence of infectious diseases and their diffusion have led to international health security issues. As the world's largest and irrevocable annual transnational religious movement, the Hajj and its connection with health security concerns have caught attention since the ancient times, because a huge population from all over the world gathers in the holy city of Mecca, which has tropical arid climate. Currently, the international community and international organizations are implementing multilevel governance with respect to the health security issues of the Hajj. Relevant agencies include the World Health Organization and its regional branches, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (ICRC), the Ministry of Hajj as well as the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, and the public health sectors/agencies in various countries that are involved with Hajj activities. The international community has successfully held the Hajj events, even when facing the challenges brought by some viral respiratory diseases such as SARS and MERS. The Hajj has become a rare opportunity for all stakeholders to improve their capabilities in international health security governance.

AB  - Using the particle flow code (PFC), this work analyses the kinetic features of a landslide which occurred on May 5, 2018 in Mabian, Leshan City, Sichuan Province, China. The analysis is based on geological field investigations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The micro-strength parameters corresponding to the macroscopic characteristics of landslide rock materials are inverted by the method of the support vector machine (SVM) and PFC coupling. Coupled with digital elevation model (DEM), a PFC3D numerical model of this landslide is constructed, and the slope failure process is simulated. In the kinetic analysis, the landslide velocity, displacement, and energy features are taken into account. The results show that the initial stage of a landslide begins with the acceleration of the overall movement, followed by the debris flow deceleration movement. Its total movement duration is about 32 s, of which the main sliding time is about 16 s. The maximum velocity of the landslide mass is 10.2 m/s, and the maximum displacement is 120 m. The kinetic energy of the landslide dominates in the acceleration stage, and the collision and friction energy dissipation dominate in the deceleration phase. The simulation results are in good agreement with the real landslide characteristics and the video interpretation of the landslide motion process. This work could provide a new way to study related landslides as well as a theoretical reference for the quantitative risk assessment and disaster prevention and mitigation of landslides in the area.

AB  - Context. The use of camera traps in ecological research has grown exponentially over the past decade, but questions remain about the effect of camera-trap settings on ecological inference. The delay-period setting controls the amount of time that a camera trap is idle between motion-activated triggers. Longer delay periods may potentially extend battery life, reduce data-storage requirements, and shorten data-analysis time. However, they might result in lost data (i.e. missed wildlife detections), which could bias ecological inference and compromise research objectives.
   Aims. We aimed to examine the effect of the delay period on (1) the number of camera-trap triggers, (2) detection and site-occupancy probabilities for eight mammalian species that varied in size, movement rate and commonness and (3) parameter estimates of habitat-based covariates from the occupancy models for these species.
   Methods. We deployed 104 camera traps for 4 months throughout an extensive urban park system in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, using a spatially random design. Using the resultant data, we simulated delay periods ranging from 10 s to 60 min. For each of these delay periods and for each of our eight focal species, we calculated the number of camera-trap triggers and the parameter estimates of hierarchical Bayesian occupancy models.
   Key results. A simulated increase in the delay period from 10 s to 10 min decreased the number of triggers by 79.6%, and decreased detection probability and occupancy probability across all species by 1.6% and 4.4% respectively. Further increases in the delay period (i.e. from 10 to 60 min) resulted in modest additional reductions in the number of triggers and detection and occupancy probabilities. Variation in the delay period had negligible effects on the qualitative interpretations of habitat-based occupancy models for all eight species.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that delay-period settings ranging from 5 to 10 min can drastically reduce data-storage needs and analysis time without compromising inference resulting from occupancy modelling for a diversity of mammalian species.
   Implications. Broadly, we provide guidance on designing camera-trap studies that optimally trade-off research effort and potential bias, thereby increasing the utility of camera traps as ecological research tools.

AB  - The ancient Mediterranean port city of Ashkelon, identified as "Philistine"during the Iron Age, underwent a marked cultural change between the Late Bronze and the early Iron Age. It has been long debated whether this change was driven by a substantial movement of people, possibly linked to a larger migration of the so-called "Sea Peoples." Here, we report genome-wide data of 10 Bronze and Iron Age individuals from Ashkelon. We find that the early Iron Age population was genetically distinct due to a European-related admixture. This genetic signal is no longer detectible in the later Iron Age population. Our results support that a migration event occurred during the Bronze to Iron Age transition in Ashkelon but did not leave a long-lasting genetic signature.

AB  - In recent years, cycling has become increasingly popular globally, which takes up little space and leads to nearly no environmental damage. Bicycles permit daily commuters to travel in an efficient manner through frequent traffic congestion. Mixed traffic conditions and a complex physical environment pose difficulties to a bicyclist's activities and safety, especially when the bicyclist is engaged in more risky cycling maneuvers. To gain a better understanding of the risks inherent in various cycling maneuvers and assist in road safety assessments, an efficient system for identifying cycling maneuvers is needed. This paper proposes a new set of definitions of cycling maneuvers specific to Chinese bicyclists. The cycling maneuvers were categorized into passing, avoiding, carriageway-occupied, sidewalk-occupied, and regular riding maneuvers. In addition, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was developed to classify these five cycling maneuvers. Field data from a video survey in the urban area of Xi' an, China (998 records) was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The data includes human-related features, road-related features, and traffic-related features (for example, the gender of the bicyclist, cycling speed, vehicle-bicycle separation, bicycle-sidewalk separation, the width of the bicycle path, and traffic volume). A promising CNN model was identified by optimizing the model configuration and adjusting the model parameters. Five prevailing methods including multi-Logit, artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting decision tree, were selected to conduct comparison analysis with the proposed CNN model. It is found that the proposed CNN model exhibited superior performance in cycling maneuver classification task.

AB  - The article examines the impact of traffic conditions on truck drivers. To assess driver's state the galvanic skin response (GSR) method and the electrocardiogram method (ECG), based on heart rate variability assessment, are used. Obtained results show that the degree of danger in a real driving situation can be estimated through changing driver's functional state as responding reaction on variations of limits characteristics of driver's state. GSR response occurs instantly when the driver is exposed to the following factors (events): driving in congested traffic; inhibition of the car moving ahead; change of lane of the leading moving car; lane change and the choice of the movement direction by the driver; car parking along the road; density of traffic flow, pedestrian appearance while driving; maneuvering at crossroads, etc. The cardiac rhythm also shows a change from the above-listed factors which is manifested in a heart rate shift from the initial values before starting the trip by the driver. The proposed method can be used to compile safe traffic routing in urban freight transportation conditions including human factors. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Throughout the process of transformation since 1999 known as the Bolivarian Revolution, harsh class and food system contradictions have unfolded in Venezuela, pitting against one another the forces of the pervasive consumer culture favoring imported foods, the input-intensive Green Revolution agricultural model that represents a state-led push toward food self-sufficiency, and an emerging agroecological paradigm pushed forward by grassroots movements who have seized political openings through the largely supportive policy environment. The Bolivarian University of Venezuela, itself a product of the revolutionary process, founded the Program Degree in Agroecology (PDA) in 2004 to expand agroecological practices and knowledge, based on alternative pedagogical approaches. Over the next decade, over a thousand PDA graduates have come to occupy institutional spaces and productive projects in urban and rural areas, contributing to vertical and horizontal agroecological scaling. PDA graduates and educators play a key role in the growing movement of urban agriculture that confronts the economic crisis. The PDA has created key mediators in the form of human talent for territorializing agroecology and institutionalizing pro-peasant policy in Venezuela. As a political outlier, Venezuela is an important case for studying the strategies for territorializing what we refer to as socially committed, situated agroecology.

AB  - In urban areas traffic-calming strategies and pedestrian friendly measures are often adopted to reduce the adverse impacts of motor vehicles on vulnerable users. This study surveyed 24 raised pedestrian crossings (RPCs) to examine their geometrical and functional characteristics. Geometric characteristics, location, administrative and effective vehicle speed, and the whole-body vibration acceleration induced to vehicle occupants while they are passing over, were considered. In addition to the analysis of the field data, geometrical and functional criteria to design RPCs were carried out. Particularly, two design approaches have been considered. In the first one, RPC provides a designated route across a carriageway raised to the same level, or close to the same level, as the sidewalks that provide access to the pedestrian crossing. In such condition, an RPC is not a traffic-calming device and its design should satisfy geometrical and comfort criteria for designing roads. The results from the surveys demonstrated that less than 10% of RPCs guarantee ride comfort. According to the second design approach, an RPC acts both as a marked pedestrian feature and as a traffic-calming device (i.e., it is trapezoidal in shape with sharp edges). The analysis of the vertical accelerations on vehicle occupants reveal that more than 90% of the surveyed RPCs comply with geometrical and dynamic criteria for speed tables. Extreme variations concerning the observed geometrical characteristics of RPCs and the modelled dynamic performances have been observed: It results in noneffective treatments. Therefore, the results of this study would contribute to providing geometric best practices for overcoming the regulation gap in this subject, and designing RPCs according to international standards.

AB  - Background There is paucity of data on Bristol stool form (BSF) in healthy South Indian residents. Aim To determine the BSF types and associated factors in an urban bowel health noncomplainant population. Methods This cross-sectional study, performed using a self-administered questionnaire among adult Chennai residents, compared BSF types by gender for various factors (age, occupation, bowel frequency, and defecation-related abdominal pain). BSF types 1/2 and 6/7 were grouped as hard and loose stools, respectively. The statistical tests used were proportion test, chi(2), and Kruskal-Wallis tests (P < 0.05 deemed significant). Results The study cohort of 1402 subjects included 748 (53.3%) men and a third each of professionals, semiprofessionals, and "non-office goers" (homemakers, retirees, students, and unemployed). A total of 97% had daily bowel movement, and 8.5% reported defecation associated abdominal pain. The BSF types in decreasing prevalence were: Type 3 (35.6%), Type 4 (32.5%), Types 1 or 2 (20.5%), Type 5 (6.9%), and Types 6 or 7 (4.5%). On gender comparison, significantly more men passed hard (P = 0.03) or loose stools (P = 0.001), while more women passed Type 3 (P = 0.0002). Loose stools in men were associated with abdominal pain (P = 0.0035). Women passing hard or loose stool types were slightly older (median age in 30s vs. 20s in Types 3-5) and had reduced stool frequency (P = 0.026: hard; P = 0.006: loose). Conclusions This South Indian noncomplainant cohort's most common stool types were BSF Types 3 and 4, with few gender variations in extreme stool types.

AB  - Topographical factors such as slope aspect and position play a significant role in plant survival and community arrangement. Euphorbia clivicola is a rare and critically endangered plant species in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. This species tend to grow on northern slopes that are usually earmarked for urban development within its distribution area. The aim of this research was to assess the significance of slope on population structure. The occupied habitat was stratified into three positions: top slope, middle slope and bottom slope. Population structure and density of the plants were documented. Euphorbia clivicola plants gradually decreased in canopy size as the slope gradient decrease (from top to bottom). Thus the significance of slope on population structure is that; slope influences propagule dispersal and ultimately population structure through surface water runoff. Density was inversely proportional to canopy size, which suggests that colonisation of sites by E. clivicola is influenced by slope gradient. Conservators should discourage development on the northern aspects of habitats occupied by E. clivicola, as it will negatively affect the relief site of the population.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the labor incorporation of Peruvian migrants in the city of Cordoba, Argentina, in the period 2001-2010. Methods: We use descriptive statistical analysis in the first step and analysis of multiple correspondences in the second step (MCA), both in comparative perspective with the native population. Results: men increase participation in the industry, both natives and migrants. However, the magnitude is greater for Peruvian men. For native women, the change in the occupational structure is small. For women born in Peru the movement towards the industry sector is also appreciated. However, the most remarkable feature for this group is the scattering of the most frequent category: domestic work, in a process that goes in the direction of diversifying the spectrum of occupations. Conclusions: in relation to Peruvian migrants, gender cleavage presents stability as a mechanism that explains differential incorporation, where women persist in specific occupations in the period considered. This supports the hypothesis of a segmented incorporation for women. However, there is also a variation, since although the most frequent category is domestic work in both census periods, the lower proportion of them employed there in 2010 indicates that other occupations acquire relevance. In the case of men, the main feature is the transfer to industry.

AB  - We review the systematics of the species of Gastrotheca (Anura: Hemiphractidae) in the highlands of the southern Ecuadorian Andes. We analyzed phylogenetic, morphological, ecological, and acoustic data from populations in the region. We provide an updated phylogenetic hypothesis inferred from a database that contains 42 species of Gastrotheca, and sequences from mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and ND1) and nuclear (POMC and RAG-1) genes. We describe four new endemic biphasic species for Ecuador (Gastrotheca cuencana, G. elicioi, G. turnerorum, and G. yacuri). In addition, we redefine G. lojana, recently resurrected from the synonymy of G. monticola, and redescribe G. litonedis. Furthermore, we describe the tadpoles and ontogenetic color changes in six species (G. cuencana, G. elicioi, G. litonedis, G. lojana, G. pseustes, and G. turnerorum). Also, we describe the calls of seven species (G. cuencana, G. elicioi, G. litonedis, G. lojana, G. pseustes, G. testudinea, and G. yacuri). The phylogenetic relationships estimated here are congruent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses for the group, except for the placement of G. galeata, G. plumbea, G. orophylax, G. nicefori, and G. griswoldi. Because most sister species in Gastrotheca are allopatric, the evolutionarly scenarios that likely have intervened in shaping the diversity are the uplift of the Andes and the formation of cross-Andean river valleys, which probably promoted conditions that acted as dispersal barriers that led to speciation. Many species of Gastrotheca (44%) are highly threatened. Most monophasic species have not been seen since the late 1980s, whereas the highland biphasic species have survived the catastrophic events that led to the disappearance of many other sympatric anurans. Research and conservation actions are urgently needed for all surviving species treated herein, five of which are either Critically Endangered or Endangered because of their restricted distributions (10-1600 km(2)), habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, and pathogens. Two of the new species, G. cuencana, and G. elicioi, mostly are known from the cities of Cuenca and Loja, respectively, where urbanization threatens their survival. In order to call attention to conservation issues, we name one new species to refer to the Yacuri National Park, and the other three in honor of the people from Cuenca, the Turner family, and Elicio E. Tapia, whose actions are helping to halt amphibian extinctions.

AB  - Starting in mid-November 2018 and lasting well into 2019, people mobilised throughout France in what has been entitled by some the gilets jaunes movement. Drawn initially from mainly rural and semi-urban areas the protesters used a mixture of traditional and innovative action repertoires such as rallies, demonstrations, the occupation of public and private spaces, or on-line activism. With support for the protesters overwhelmingly positive, public authorities struggled to contain them despite deploying law-enforcement personnel on a massive scale, withdrawing some controversial policies, or initiating new social, economic and fiscal policy measures. In reviewing and analysing the events? key phases and aspects, this article points to a theoretical perplexity?the gilets jaunes mobilised without institutional and third-party support?and draws attention to the ways that current research tools can help scholars to assess this puzzle.

AB  - Wastewater treatment infrastructure is lacking in many developing countries, often resulting in high loads of contaminants discharged to urban rivers. In these countries, targeted pollution mitigation requires an understanding of where, how and when contaminants enter water bodies. Here we report on contamination of the Ciliwung River, a dynamic, tropical system flowing through the Jakarta metropolitan area (Indonesia). We measured a set of isotopic, chemical and microbial tracers in representative water and contamination sources, as well as longitudinally within the river, to assess the spatial and temporal variations in contaminant levels in and pathways to the river. In the dry season, we observed a tight coupling between locally recharged groundwater sources and the river, whereas in the wet season, one single water source originating from the fractured headwaters predominantly contributed to river flow. Yet, the flushing of upstream waters in the wet season did not always lead to the dilution of contaminants downstream. We delineated several contamination hotspots along the river, particularly active during the wet season due to higher hydrological connectivity between sources and the river. These hotspots may originate from septic tank leakage, as supported by metal ratios and dominant microbial communities, although we could not rule out other potential sources such as urban runoff or sediment resuspension. Bayesian source tracking on the whole microbial community proved useful in outlining processes that conventional tracers did not capture, such as the occurrence of a localised domestic contamination in the upper catchment, and the inflow of agricultural runoff all along the river profile during the wet season. Our study emphasises the role of rivers as biogeochemical reactors that constantly process and transform contaminants and microbial communities. We also demonstrate the value of using isotopic, chemical and microbial tools together to trace the movement of water and contaminants through urban rivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work, through a particular text by Federica Montseny, tackles with the unknown issue of the reception of Antiquity by the anarchist movement. Federica Montseny, a significant Spanish author, wrote an article in 1926, the heyday of libertarian ideology in Spain, about the city of Emporion which she published in the compelling magazine La Revista Blanca. The paper disserts on and contextualises the diverse dimensions of the text by Montseny: the literary legacy projected on the poetic evocation of the ruins, the scope of the new historical and archaeological data provided by the coetaneous excavations, her philhellenic idealization derived from the identity reinforcement occurring at the time in Catalonia, the spreading of an antichristian message resulted from the confrontation by Montseny of the different periods of the archaeological site. Thus, this paper explores several of the issues, connections and features of the complex relationship between Anarchism and Ancient World.

AB  - In the city of Magelang, Indonesia, the distribution of Dengue Haemorhagic Fever (DHF) cases tend to be clustered, ever changing along with human urbanization from 2014 to 2017. Although DHF cases have been less reported in the city of Magelang for the past 5 years, vector control measures by using insecticide space spraying, particularly permethrin, have been continuously performed. Current study aimed to detect kdr mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance in Ae. aegypti and to study possible association between insecticide resistance and DHF case distribution related to human urbanization. The study was a cross sectional study conducted in 3 sub-districts in the city of Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. Eggs of Ae. aegypti collected from 195 sample households were reared and were tested for resistance to pyrethroids by using PCR. Primers AaSCF1 and AaSCR4, and primers AaSCF7 and AaSCR7 were used in detecting presence of mutation in VGSC IIS6 and IIIS6 gene, respectively. Fragments of amplified DNA were sequenced and were analyzed. Spatio-temporal using Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) was performed to obtain mapping of DHF case distribution trends. The total number of DHF case was 380 cases, with the most cases (158) occurred in 2015 and the least cases (66) reported in 2017. DHF case distribution was grouped into several clusters. SDE calculation demonstrated movement of DHF case in the direction to principal arterial road, suggesting link to urbanization. Gene sequencing demonstrated VGSC IIS6 gene mutation (S989P and V1016G) in Ae. aegypti collected from study areas, indicating resistance to permethrin. VGSC IIIS6 gene mutation was not found. Current study concluded that multiple kdr mutations associated with resistance to pyrethroid was detected in Ae. aegypti, and that human urbanization may have a role in the development of such resistance.

AB  - This work aims at showing the fundamental role that the integration of geomatic techniques and a specific multidisciplinary approach could have in the study, conservation and valorization of ancient buildings, by presenting some results of a research conducted in Pompeii, one of the most important city of the ancient world. The research, which is part of a wider project headed by the University of Padova (MACH -Multidisciplinary methodological Approaches to the knowledge, conservation and valorization of Cultural Heritage), aims at studying the Sarno Baths, an architectural complex located in the south-western part of Pompeii (Rego VIII, Insula 2, house numbers from 17 to 21). The complex is composed by a set of buildings, the main of which is made of five floors. It leans against the southern rocky front of the city and has a facade which is about 15 m high and 40 m wide. Different research units of the University of Padua were involved in the project and different aspects were dealt with: survey and structural analysis, archaeological excavations, architectural analysis, study of frescoes and building materials. The Archaeological Superintendence of Pompeii has supervised all the phases of the project and has provided part of the data.
   As regard the architectural survey, after the verification of the existing 3D data acquired from the Superintendence, it has proved necessary to execute a new laser scanning survey of the facade, because of lack of data in some areas (due to the presence of vegetation) and to create a reference topographic network. A set of related spatial data and ortho-images were produced for the architectural and archaeological studies. Moreover, a photogrammetric survey, with both classical and Structure from Motion approach, were performed. The obtained data contributed to an improvement of the available information about the building, in terms of completeness, and helped the archaeologists to study and to better understand its building features, constructive phases and its architectural transformations that occurred before and after 79 CE.

AB  - Geophysical methods have been proven to be very effective in landslide characterization. The present paper focuses on the study of land instabilities, which are affecting Tamantout Village, South of Jijel. The site is composed by marl overcoming from unstable overlying Numidian nappes, a major source of a huge spreading of debris covering slopes with inclination of 35 degrees. This study aims are to characterize the internal structure and the hydrological conditions of the moving masses, identifying the soil movement nature and geological and geotechnical factors governing the movement. For these, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Shallow Seismic Refraction (SSR) methods were applied. Indeed, the results were correlated with the available geological and geotechnical data that, in turn, showed a perfect correlation with landslide structures. Occupying 450 (m) of the central part of the profile, the landslide was oriented NE-SW, represented by resistivity ranging between 1 and 10 (Omega.m) and seismic velocity between 1720 and 2235 (m/s). Numidian formation is composed of clays of 15 (m) thickness, covered by a thin layer of slope screes characterized by higher resistivity ranging from 40 to 300 (Omega.m) and a high seismic velocity oscillating between 2485 and 3120 (m/s). It represents the geotechnical bedrock with hard schistose with a depth varying from 7 to 15 which has sound appearance and well indicated lithology through boreholes and geotechnical tests. The geophysical study confirmed the existence of fracture plans associated with intraformational water flows. Reinforcement methods adapted to landslides were proposed in order to secure traffic on the one hand and surrounding land on the other hand, in addition to guaranteeing the socio-economic development in these isolated areas of Jijel province.

AB  - This article uses Woods' (2005) term 'politics of the rural' as a lens to trace connections between 'Brexit' and countryside protests that erupted in the late 1990s following the disruption of a century old political settlement for governing rural areas. Historically, the intertwining of rurality, hierarchy and empire in national identity has shielded rural elite interests and the power structures that uphold them from progressive political developments in urban areas. The article highlights how a new political party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), was able to occupy a space opened by Countryside Alliance and subsequently vacated by a modernising Conservative Party, to build a movement shaped by a similar type of settler populism. How these broader dynamics interacted with local contexts to structure perceptions and experiences underpinning support for Brexit calls for more contextualised, region-specific research. 'Politics of the rural' provides one lens among others to bring to these analyses.

KW  - Hellenistic Period
KW  - Macedonian Occupation
KW  - Material Remains of Cult Practice
AB  - From a political point of view, 3rd century BCE Athens represents a shattered unity. Parts of the Athenian countryside and even the city itself were occupied by foreign troops. This loss of control affected the city's political, economic, social, cultural, and religious life. Since Cleisthenic times, relations between political units and religious communities had become institutionalised through specific cults. Other cult places of relevance to the larger community and therefore with a catchment area that exceeded a deme, e.g. Eleusis, were also affected, as they lay within the occupied territories. This partial inaccessibility of the countryside risked the disruption of religious duties. The project "Cult and Crisis: The Sacred Landscape of Attica and its Correlation to Political Topography" aims to identify potentially affected cult places with no limitations regarding their possible catchment area by analysing their placement in relation to foreign military bases. Alterations in cult practice can plausibly be detected in changes ranging from cessation to the rerouting of ritual movement or the establishment of substitute cult places. As these "solutions" rarely feature in written sources, our GIS-based approach will focus on material remains from sanctuaries. Although an object's use for ritual practice cannot be deduced with certainty, the distribution of finds certainly attests to human activity. This contribution presents a trial of this approach, taking the Sounion area as its case study.

AB  - By accounting for both the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES), it is possible to identify where ES are not able to satisfy human needs. In addition, human demands for natural resources continue to grow rapidly, risking the short supply of ES. Consequently, understanding the balance between ES supply and demand can facilitate sustainable spatial planning and enhance the quality of life. The ES framework followed in this study allowed us to identify spatial similarities and mismatches between the biophysical capacity of ecosystems to provide benefits and societal needs. Specifically, this study revealed the spatial mismatches between the supply and demand of three ES (food provision, climate regulation, and recreation), through identifying zones where excess supply and demand occur on the Ionian Islands (Western Greece). ES supply was quantified from biophysical indicators, while ES demand was estimated through economic valuation. Due to the complexity of ES and the different type of values (direct and indirect use values), a combination of two valuation methods, namely the market prices and the benefit transfer method, was employed to map ES demand. To reveal the spatial relationship between the supply of services and societal demand, a supply-demand ratio was used. The results showed that cropland and urban areas presented high demand for all three ES, due to the high presence of the human population, along with tourism activities. In comparison, more than 50% of the Ionian Islands are characterized by natural forests and olive orchards, leading large areas to be dominated by excess ES supply or by similar amounts of both ES supply and demand. The hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) that was used, delineated zones with high connectivity, which could facilitate the prioritization of conservation areas. For areas where an unsustainable regime exists, we suggested how to maintain or shift current spatial policies to improve the decision-making process. In conclusion, the framework used identified compact ES zones in which diverse landscapes of the Ionian Islands allowed the existence of a balanced situation, signifying that human's demands for ES were for the most part fulfilled.

AB  - Starting from a long-term ethnographic study (2014-2017) on Imider's "on the road of 96" movement, this article questions the processes of politicization of marginalized communities. Located in southeastern Morocco, Imider is a small rural town in the vicinity of the largest silver deposit in Africa. Exploited by the Managem group, a subsidiary of the royal holding, the mining industry has faced a strong challenge from local communities since its installation in the 1970s. In particular, since 2011, residents have organized themselves around a movement: the movement "on the road of 96", claiming the right to water and more generally a fair distribution of wealth. Activists of Imider occupied "Mont Alebban", during the last nine years, and sabotaged the main water pump supplying the mine. Starting from an empirical study of the ways in which the "on the road of 96" movement has managed to impose itself in the public space and more broadly in the political field, the objective of this article is to inscribe the mobilizations of marginalized communities in a more global political analysis. The article aims to show how the study of the politics of and in the margins can help us understand more boarder processes of change and socio-political transformation in Morocco since 2011.

AB  - The aim of this theoretical research is to analyze the state of retail distribution nowadays, reviewing the dynamics of action that contribute to the move from a linear to an incipient circular retail model. The framework is based on the Retail Wheel Spins Theory and the Retail Life Cycle (RLC), with an extra review of Bauman's liquid metaphor. We consider two questions. Firstly, are offline retailers ready to disappear as online commerce and digital marketing aggressively break into the retail industry? Secondly, could commercial spaces (in the fifth stage in the evolution of retail and territory) be in the decline stage in the RLC in the near future or can a circular connection take place? Thus, a desk research methodology based on secondary documentary material and sources issued leads to an interpretive analysis that reveals ten trends (e.g., solid retail vs. liquid retail; glocal retail; food sovereignty) and a wide diversity of changes that could involve offline stores recovering territory and entering a circular phase. Our findings suggest that digitalized physical stores are flourishing and our reflections augur changes in pace and the closure of the linear business cycle to recover territory, the city, its local market, and its symbolism, as well as a liquid business steeped in omnichannel formats developing an incipient circular movement. Conclusions indicate that it is possible to perceive a timid change back to territory and retail spaces which, along with phygitalization, will coexist with the digital world.

AB  - There has been a recent increase in new records of insects from the subtropical parts of South Africa that have expanded their historical ranges to now include the biologically and climatically atypical southwestern Cape region at the tip of the African continent. Suggested mechanisms include climate change, provision of previously absent nutriments and direct transport of individuals via human activities. Here we summarise previous reports of fruit chafer beetles (Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae: Cetoniini) invading the southwestern Cape region, provide additional data on their distributions and provide data for additional taxa that have now also been newly recorded in the region. The newly reported species Pachnoda sinuata sinuata probably naturally occurs in the region but has gone unnoticed due to specialised habitat requirements and morphological similarity to a widespread generalist. Some taxa are very recent arrivals while others have been known from the region for a long time, but all are experiencing noticeable population increases in urban and agricultural areas. We propose that these species likely dispersed from their native ranges to the southwestern Cape via direct transport of colonised nursery stock and their recent increases in population size are consistent with what is expected when founder populations overcome barriers to reproduction. All of the new arrivals are well-adapted to transformed landscapes in the subtropics and do not occupy natural vegetation in the newly invaded ranges, strengthening the hypothesis that pre-adaptation to human settlements aid biological invasions of otherwise unsuitable bioregions in South Africa. As many additional species are pre-adapted to transformed biotopes in subtropical areas, one would expect that additional species will colonise the southwestern Cape in the future with unknown economic, ecological and evolutionary consequences.

AB  - Tree harvest and climate change can interact to have synergistic effects on tree species distribution changes. However, few studies have investigated the interactive effects of tree harvest and climate change on tree species distributions. We assessed the interactive effects of tree harvest and climate change on the distribution of 29 dominant tree species at 270 m resolution in the southern United States, while accounting for species demography, competition, urban growth and natural fire. We simulated tree species distribution changes to year 2100 using a coupled forest dynamic model (LANDIS PRO), ecosystem process model (LINKAGES) and urban growth model (SLEUTH). The distributions of 20 tree species contracted and nine species expanded within the region under climate change by end of 21st century. Distribution changes for all tree species were very slow and lagged behind the changes in potential distributions that were in equilibrium with new climatic conditions. Tree harvest and climate change interacted to affect species occurrences and colonization but not extinction. Occurrence and colonization were mainly affected by tree harvest and its interaction with climate change while extinctions were mainly affected by tree harvest and climate change. Synthesis and applications. Interactive effects of climate and tree harvest acted in the same direction as climate change effects on species occurrences, thereby accelerating climate change induced contraction or expansion of distributions. The overall interactive effects on species colonization were negative, specifically with positive interactive effects at leading edges of species ranges and negative interactive effects at trailing edges. Tree harvest generally did not interact with climate change to greatly facilitate or ameliorate species extinction. Our modelling results highlight the importance of considering disturbances and species demography (e.g. post-harvest regeneration dynamics) when predicting changes in tree distributions.

AB  - Background: Anthropogenic light is known or suspected to exert profound effects on many taxa, including birds. Documentation of bird aggregation around artificial light at night, as well as observations of bird reactions to strobe lights and lasers, suggests that light may both attract and repel birds, although this assumption has yet to be tested. These effects may cause immediate changes to bird movement, habitat selection and settlement, and ultimately alter bird distribution at large spatial scales. Global increases in the extent of anthropogenic light contribute to interest by wildlife managers and the public in managing light to reduce harm to birds, but there are no evidence syntheses of the multiple ways light affects birds to guide this effort. Existing reviews usually emphasize either bird aggregation or deterrence and do so for a specific context, such as aggregation at communication towers and deterrence from airports. We outline a protocol for a systematic map that collects and organizes evidence from the many contexts in which anthropogenic light is reported to affect bird movement, habitat selection, or distribution. Our map will provide an objective synthesis of the evidence that identifies subtopics that may support systematic review and knowledge gaps that could direct future research questions. These products will substantially advance an understanding of both patterns and processes associated with the responses of birds to anthropogenic light.
   Methods: The protocol describes the steps taken to ensure the search for evidence is comprehensive, transparent and replicable. We will find relevant studies in the grey and peer-reviewed literature using publication databases, Google Scholar, stakeholder suggestions, and organizational websites. We will select studies for inclusion in the map by identification of relevant: (i) population including any species of bird; (ii) intervention or exposure to anthropogenic light; and (iii) outcomes including changes in bird movement, habitat occupancy, population density, or distribution. We will extract and organize metadata into a systematic map that can support subsequent search by interested individuals. The quantity of evidence on particular topics will be characterized through heat maps and narrative syntheses, but subsequent work will be needed to evaluate evidence validity.

AB  - The study will embrace the concept of Capitalocene (J. Moore, 2015), to encompass not only the question of overexploitation of the physical world, but also the existence of power structures and groups that mark the historical and cultural construction responsible for overcoming the limits of the planet. The environmental crisis, led by climate change and the loss of biodiversity along with the end of fossil fuels, are the greatest challenges of our time. It is a crisis of our livelihoods, as well as our culture, worldview and the construction of knowledge. It requires the attention of all disciplines, sectors and agents, including the humanities, and specifically, art. This article focuses on studying one of the most recent artistic manifestations -transitional art- born in the United Kingdom (Neal, 2015) and related to the Transition Town Movement (TTM). Through a case study in Spain and the United Kingdom we seek to identify what type of art corresponds to the challenges of the Capitalocene, to later verify what characteristics of transitional art are appropriate to our time and finally to know if transitional art can respond to this global challenge.

AB  - El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras rank among the top 10 countries experiencing violence in the world, despite not being at war. Although there is abundant literature on generalized violence in this northern triangle of Central America as a driver of out-migration to the United States, very little is known about the perspectives and experiences of youth who do not migrate. This study aimed to elicit the emic perspectives of youth residing in the region on how the day-to-day generalized violence produces a pervasive threat to the overall health and human security of youth as well as the key protective factors and resiliencies at work. We conducted two separate waves of qualitative research in 2015 and 2018 over a 6-month period, which included 60 in-depth interviews and six focus groups among Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Honduran youth living in urban areas. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed two meta-themes: (1) Lack of health,' defined as not experiencing peace within the family, the community, and the country' and (2) Resilience.' Thematic clusters that reflect the first meta-theme are: (1) violence as a common occurrence; (2) living in fear and insecurity; (3) victimization; and (4) lack of state protection and services. Thematic clusters for the second meta-theme are: (1) a positive future outlook and a commitment to education; (2) transnational and local family network support; and (3) engagement in community-based youth groups. To interpret the findings, we adopt the Latin American Social Medicine and Collective Health (LASM-CH) approach that prioritizes perspectives from the region. Generalized violence is conceptualized as a systemic phenomenon that is generated and reproduced through the complex interactions of structural inequities and unequal power relations. The findings of this study provide new insights into the implementation of a different approach to address the generalized violence, insights that may guide multi-sectoral health policies and interventions both in the region and transnationally.

AB  - The recent wave of occupations has had a transformative effect on radical politics, but, to date, many have been restricted in their social and spatial expansion. Reflecting on these challenges, this article examines workplace occupation in the coordinadoras interfabriles in Argentina (1975-6) and the cordones industriales in Chile (1972-3) to understand how they overcame barriers to such expansion. Starting from debates in critical geography and social movement studies on space and occupations, I unpack the possibilities for popular power that emerged in this period by using approaches from critical labour studies and autonomist Marxism. First, I outline the generative role of the workplace in producing these possibilities in a context of wider social change. Second, I demonstrate how the capacity for expansion lay in the simultaneous capacity to disrupt and reconstruct social relations derived from solidarities that exceeded the existing physical space of occupation.

AB  - This paper investigates the residual nutrient load from a combined sewer system along the shore of a deep Italian lake, to provide data that can help explaining the contribution of combined sewers to lakes eutrophication. To this purpose, a stochastic methodology is applied to the analysis of the combined sewer overflows and pollutants, that provides reliable estimates, with related uncertainties, of the storage capacity to be supplied in order to mitigate the impact on the quality of receiving waters. The sewer is modeled by SWMM and two terminal combined sewer weirs are modeled in detail and instrumented for calibration purposes. A year-long campaign was accomplished, allowing to study the occurrence and relevance of the first flush. The calibrated model of the sewer network was used to extrapolate the results to a 10-years period, thus providing a statistically reliable estimate of the residual load delivered from this watershed to the lake. A conservative evaluation shows that up to 22% of phosphorus and up to 41% of nitrogen delivered to the sewer are still discharged into the environment. However, the results also show that in this case a relatively small capture volume would obtain a target pollution reduction, thus providing insights on the feasibility of this structural practice in similar watersheds along the shore of endangered lakes.

AB  - This study is an assessment of flash flood risk in the downstream part of an intermittent stream which lost its natural bed due to intense human interventions, with the example of Hastane Brook in the province of Kirsehir (Turkey). The effects of flooding events with high, medium, and low probability of occurrence are investigated on a street-by-street basis with a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model constructed in HEC-RAS 5.0 software. Due to the lack of records of past flood events required for model calibration, it is aimed to utilise high-quality data as much as possible in model development. Therefore, to more accurately simulate the movement of water and thereby to advise adequate measures for reducing the most likely flood effects, the required high-resolution terrain and land use data are produced by processing the aerial images acquired by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights over the flood risk zone. The estimation of flood hydrographs is only based on the synthetic unit hydrograph methods due to the absence of representative stream gauging stations inside or near the region. The resultant flood hazard maps are cautionary in terms of demonstrating the effects of possible floods that are unexpected to come from such an intermittent stream basin.

AB  - The Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu (Cusco, Peru) is one of the most important archaeological monuments in Peru and worldwide. Machu Picchu is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site and at risk from climatic change. However, the seismic centennial history of Peru reports large earthquakes generated both along the subduction zone (Mw8) and on active crustal faults along the Andean Cordillera (Mw7). It is therefore important to know if Machu Picchu is located in an area of seismic hazard and then to take measures to mitigate potential seismic hazards. Due to the short historical earthquake catalogue (< 500 years) and the absence of significant recent instrumental seismicity in the site's vicinity (radius of < 30 km), our knowledge about the seismic hazard in Machu Picchu is limited. The earthquakes of 1650 and 1950 affected Cusco city and surrounding areas, but without damage descriptions in Machu Picchu (80 km away) (Silgado Ferro 1978). In this study, we make the first attempt to use the analysis of earthquake archaeological effects (EAEs) and their differentiation from the effects generated by slope movements (creep) to investigate the past occurrence of strong earthquakes at the site. The application of geological structural analysis to the deformations observed in Machu Picchu shows two directions of the mean ground movement: N020 degrees E and N110 degrees E. Two earthquakes that affected Machu Picchu during its construction generated these directions. This kind of data should be used in the future to protect this important archaeological site.

AB  - Natal habitat preference induction (NHPI) occurs when characteristics of the natal habitat influence the future habitat selection of an animal. However, the influence of NHPI after the dispersal phase has received remarkably little attention. We tested whether exposure to humans in the natal habitat helps understand why some adult wolves Canis lupus may approach human settlements more than other conspecifics, a question of both ecological and management interest. We quantified habitat selection patterns within home ranges using resource selection functions and GPS data from 21 wolf pairs in Scandinavia. We identified the natal territory of each wolf with genetic parental assignment, and we used human-related characteristics within the natal territory to estimate the degree of anthropogenic influence in the early life of each wolf. When the female of the adult wolf pair was born in an area with a high degree of anthropogenic influence, the wolf pair tended to select areas further away from humans, compared to wolf pairs from natal territories with a low degree of anthropogenic influence. Yet the pattern was statistically weak, we suggest that our methodological approach can be useful in other systems to better understand NHPI and to inform management about human-wildlife interactions.

AB  - The way in which flocks are organized affects the ability of birds to perceive the landscape over which they fly: if the pattern of the flock changes, then the generalized perception of the terrain over which birds fly will also change. In this paper the features of dynamic spatial organization of pigeons in a flock during flights over landscapes with different characteristics were studied based on the analysis of GPS tracks of birds. The ways of group flight were revealed for typical situations, such as survey of unfamiliar terrain or flight home from remote sites. The spatial distribution of distances between pairs of individual birds and directions of movement were calculated, and then related to the features of terrain over which flights were occurred. The data analysis was performed based on comparison of flock patterns during group flights over terrain of distinct types (sea coast, urban and countryside terrain, and natural landscape). The spatial data was processed using the geographic information system QGIS.

AB  - Polo Beyris is a virtually unexplored example of internment under French and German authorities. From 1939 to 1947 the camp of Polo Beyris in Bayonne held successively: Spanish Civil War refugees, French colonial prisoners of war, suspected 'collaborators' and German prisoners of war. Despite having up to 8600 prisoners at one time, the large camp and its numerous satellite work detachments were literally 'forgotten' for decades. Although similar to other camps in its improvised nature, wretched living conditions, lack of food and constant movement of prisoners, Polo Beyris was also unique: located in a dense urban area, within the wartime Occupied Zone and close to the Spanish frontier. Its civil and military administrators were faced with constantly changing, and often chaotic, political and military circumstances. Not a waystation in the Holocaust, Polo Beyris has been lost from the sight of historians. It provides an additional dimension to the complex history of internment in twentieth century France.

AB  - The Ottoman occupation of Hungary (1526-1699) resulted in changes to the urban topographies of the occupied area. Chinese porcelain, unquestionably a luxury product connected to the upper layers of Ottoman society, can be used as the basis for examining the new material culture brought by the Ottomans in the occupied towns. As Hungary was a remote and peripheral yet strategically crucial part of the Ottoman Empire, the presence of Chinese porcelain in such a military-based region provides an opportunity to study the social group with which this type of material culture is connected. The archaeological distribution of Chinese porcelain could possibly be used to reconstruct the connections of this remote province to the centre of the Empire, along with the possible trading routes and distribution patterns of the goods traveling from Anatolia to Buda and Eger. The comprehensive examination of the porcelain assemblages of Ottoman Buda and the Castle of Eger showed intriguing patterns in the distribution of the sherds, implying that this type of material culture might serve as an indicator for detecting their users, identifying their origin and following their route of movement from their production site to the point of disposal.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the clinical characteristics of Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) in Al-Medina region, in patients attending a pediatric ophthalmology clinic at Ohud Hospital.
   Method: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from October 2017 to June 2018 at Ohud Hospital, Al-Medina region, Saudi Arabia. Data was collected using a sheet containing eighteen simple items which include demographic data, family history, surgical history, the clinical characteristics of the disease and the physician's treatment plan. Twenty patients were included in this study.
   Results: All twenty patients included in the study were diagnosed with DRS type I. Male and female were symmetrical in numbers as both 10 (50.0%) respectively. The mean age of the subjects was 8.7 years (SD 9.6). 95% of the subject were unilaterally affected while five percent of them were affected both sides of the eyes. 75% of the patients were affected on the left eye while 20% were affected on the right side. 35% of the patients had amblyopia in the affected eye. 25% of the patients had an abnormal head position. Abnormal eye movement (upshoot and downshoot) more common when the right eye is affected (p-0.035). 75% of the patients were orthotropic while 30% had esotropia. 75% of patients were positive of parents' consanguinity. 16 patients (80.0%) were from Al-Medina city while four of them (20.0%) were from the different area of Al-Medina region (Al Hejeria, Al Henakia, Omluj, Yatmah).
   Conclusion: This cross-sectional observational study is the first one that evaluates DRS in Al-Medina region. Associated abnormal eye movement more common when the right eye is affected. Parents' consanguinity may play a role in the occurrence of DRS as it is not considered as a rare disease in our region. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish the relationship between the occurrence of DRS and parents' consanguinity in our region. Also, further studies are needed to establish the relationship between abnormal eye movement and the involvement of the right eye.

AB  - Predicting the exact urban places where crime is most likely to occur is one of the greatest interests for Police Departments. Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were 'moving' and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them 'move'-is it a particular urban pattern? Is the 'movement' of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.

AB  - The length of road network in Indonesia continues to increase gradually in every year. This increase will influence an availability of natural resources as the formation materials of road structures. For that, it is necessary to develop a green road concept that is able to reduce the use of natural resources and minimize the occurrence of waste materials generated. This concept is an ongoing movement that targets the construction of the planning, implementation, and usage of environmentally friendly construction products, efficient in energy and resource usage, and low cost and the achievement of appropriate construction quality. Increased waste materials in the construction process is one aspect that must be minimized in order to achieve the concept of green roads. This study aims to analyze the relationship and influence the factors of application of green roads concept to waste management of road construction project. Another purpose is to know the dominant factors affecting waste management of road construction projects. This study was done for road construction process in the Banda Aceh in Indonesia. This research uses qualitative and quantitative methods through the distribution of questionnaires. Respondents in this study were 90 units of road contractor companies has implemented projects from 2010 to 2016. The research result shows that the factor of application of green road concept that has the most influence on waste management is economic factor. The effect of this economic factor on road waste management is 18.7%. This indicates that if economic factor is enhanced, the waste management will increase on road construction project in Banda Aceh City.

AB  - This article discusses and analyzes aspects related to the territory and territoriality constituted by the families of farmers from Lagoa do Junco settlement, which for 23 years have been established in the city of Tapes, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The data presented in the study of case integrate a broader research developed in the dissertation of Professional Masters in Environment and Sustainability of UERGS, whose scope was the elaboration and the confrontation of the social representations on the Landless, the MST and the Settlement, from three data streams. In these, from the contents seized in the interviews with settlers, the themes on territory and territoriality emerge as relevant category of analysis. In the process of territorialization, the settlers, who are part of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers (MST), have begun to re-signify the occupied space. This territory, as well as a collective conquest of land and labor, was incorporated as an identity for the settlers, integrating the identity of the Landless people, which they have preserved for decades. Accordingly, a territoriality that emphasizes subjective and symbolic aspects is evidenced. Cooperation is revealed as a fundamental dimension which establishes itself as a combat force, identity and work, on the part of the settlers. It also stands out a sense of accomplishment expressed by the settlers when referring to the work developed. Through production, the vision of the people of the city was transformed from the presentation, marketing and consumption of food. A collective work that has been evolving towards a production that privileges sustainability, the environment and people.

TI  - Resistance and uprising during World War II. The Tuscan National Liberation Committee towards the "battle of Florence"
T2  - RIVISTA STORICA ITALIANA
LA  - Italian
AB  - In many European countries the guerrilla warfare against Nazi occupation tried to promote an insurrection against the retreating German forces and before the arrival of the Allies. To carve out an autonomous space in the clash between armies meant to confirm the resistance's political and military role. The article draws an outline of the issue and explores the case of Florence from late 1943 until the weeks of liberation in the summer 1944. For the first time in Italy the resistance movement led by the Tuscan National Liberation Committee, which collected all anti-fascist parties, pursued and achieved the goal of taking over the political and military government of the city prior to the settlement of the Allied military authorities. Making use of a large number of archival records, the essay covers the ideation of that political plan, the debate and contrasts among the antifascist parties, obstacles encountered, dynamics of the armed conflict in the dramatic moments of passage of the front and, finally, its overall historical meaning.

AB  - Public transportation such as a bus is often used to travel to various places in Indonesia. Each bus will only stop at each bus stop transit. However, the bus stop transit in Indonesia, especially at Bandung city, is not friendly to disable person like visually impaired people. In this research, a smart public transportation bus stop transit is designed and implemented, which can inform the identities of the next arrival bus through sound and text display. This research purposed to provide a device which gives a natural movement for the visually impaired in using public transportation and reducing the dependence on other people in doing daily activities in their lives. This system is using NRF24L01 as a sender and receiver the data between bus and the bus stop transit. According to the testing result, this system can transmit the information about 30 meters from the bus stop transit. The delay occurs around 2-3 seconds for a single coming bus, and 5-6 seconds to the bus which arrived into the bus stop platform at the same time.

AB  - The ecology of wildlife living in proximity to humans often differs from that in more natural places. Animals may perceive anthropogenic features and people as threats, exhibiting avoidance behavior, or may acclimate to human activities. As development expands globally, changes in the ecology of species in response to human phenomena may determine whether animals persist in these changing environments. We hypothesize that American black bears (Ursus americanus) persist within developed areas by effectively avoiding risky landscape features. We test this by quantifying changes in the movements of adult females from a population living within exurban and suburban development. We collected hourly GPS data from 23 individuals from 2012 to 2014 and used step-selection functions to estimate selection for anthropogenic features. Females were more avoidant of roads and highways when with cubs than without and were more responsive to increased traffic volume. As bears occupied greater housing densities, selection for housing increased, while avoidance of roads and responsiveness to traffic increased. Behavioral flexibility allowed bears in highly developed areas to alter selection and avoidance for anthropogenic features seasonally. These findings support the hypothesis that black bears perceive human activity as risky, and effectively avoid these risks while inhabiting developed areas. We document a high amount of individual variation in selection of anthropogenic features within the study population. Our findings suggest that initially, wildlife can successfully inhabit developed landscapes by effectively avoiding human activity. However, variation among individuals provides the capacity for population-level shifts in behavior over time.

AB  - This study aims to determine the level and potential sources of nocturnal surface ozone (NSO) in different regions in Malaysia. Eleven-year (2005-2015) ozone data from 37 continuous air quality monitoring stations throughout Malaysia have been analysed to determine spatio-temporal variations in NSO concentrations. NSO daily maximum concentrations from different regions in Malaysia were used for seasonal variation analysis while linear regression and the Mann-Kendall trend test were used for the annual variation analysis. Average ratios of mean NSO to daytime surface ozone (DSO) for the whole country were found to be 60% of DSO (0.58-0.61). The east coast of the Malaysian Peninsula recorded the highest ratio (70% of DSO) while the central region recorded the lowest concentration (50% of DSO). Titration processes, particularly by NO in the urban areas of the central region, and long transboundary movement of ozone to the east coast are expected to influence the concentration of ozone in these two regions, respectively. On certain occasions, the NSO concentrations (with a maximum value of 137 ppb) exceeded the limit of 100 ppb, the value suggested by Malaysian Air Quality Standard for ambient ozone concentration. The monthly diurnal variation analysis revealed the occurrence of secondary/nocturnal peaks at more than 50% of the stations occurring around 0300-0500 h. The NSO was found to be influenced by the monsoonal season with higher concentrations mainly observed during the boreal winter season. The long-term trend analysis presented the country's overall NSO as having an increasing trend at 27% of the stations.

AB  - Natural ventilation in apartment dwellings in densely built regions could improve occupants' summer thermal comfort and reduce the rapidly increasing energy demand for cooling. This research identified natural ventilation strategies as energy efficient refurbishment solutions for domestic buildings. Four retrofit strategies were tested against the existing single-sided ventilation of an urban multi-storey apartment building in Greece, using computational fluid dynamics simulations. During buoyancy driven flows, acceptable ventilation rates for comfort could be achieved with the implementation of a wind-catcher and a dynamic facade. Under wind-driven ventilation, these strategies delivered significant increases in ventilation rates (up to seven times) and contributed to reductions in indoor air temperatures of up to 2 degrees C, relative to the existing strategy. Cooling by water evaporation enhanced the cooling performance of the wind-catcher providing up to 4 degrees C temperature reductions. The successful performance of the proposed strategies highlights their significant potential for reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort.

AB  - Recent studies have identified cemeteries as potential environmental reservoirs of multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria that could contaminate groundwater sources posing public health threats. However, these findings were based on the identification of culturable bacteria and at times not belowburial grounds. Investigation on the bacterial diversity and functional profiles of bacterial communities above and below burial grounds in human cemeteries are few. The current study used high-throughput sequencing techniques to determine the bacterial composition and their associated functional profiles in cemetery soil samples collected at the surface and belowburial ground in two South African cemeteries (Maitland Cemetery in Cape Town and Fontein Street Cemetery in Middelburg) to evaluate the potential health threat to surrounding populations through contamination of groundwater. Significant differences were observed between sample depths with the clustering of the surface (0 m) and the 2 m samples into separate groups. Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant genera across all samples. Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus were the dominant genera in the 2 m samples while Prauserella and Staphylococcus were dominant in the surface samples. The 2msamples showed a lower alpha diversity but recorded higher proportions of human diseases functional classes compared to the surface samples. Human disease functional profiles revealed involvement, in infectious (cholera), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease) cardiovascular (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) immune system(Systemic lupus erythematosus) metabolic (Type I & II diabetes) diseases and cancer. Antibiotic resistance and antibiotics synthesis signatures were also identified. Thus, cemeteries could be potential sources of microbial and antibiotic pollution in groundwater, especially in areas with shallow water tables such as Maitland. Selection of sites for use as cemeteries should, therefore, require a proper understanding of the hydrogeological characteristics of the selected site. However, further studies are required to trace the actual movement of these pollutants into groundwater resources. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long dismissed as too weak and fragmented to collectively organize, millions of informal workers have begun mobilizing for labour rights over the past 40 years. As informal workers gain a measure of power to reshape the structure and conditions of their work, but continue to face constraints due to their subordinated positions in the broader political economy, tensions may emerge between the imperatives of combatting exploitation and dispossession. Recent conflicts over recycler rights policy in Bogota, Colombia are illustrative of this dilemma. For the first 25 years of its existence, the recycler rights movement experienced little tension between these two imperatives, as it had little capacity to do either. In recent years, however, recyclers have become powerful political agents, and since 2012 conflicts have erupted among recyclers and state officials over how to navigate the twin threat. Drawing on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork, this article exposes both potentials and constraints of state-led interventions to improve informal livelihoods. Such interventions are likely to entail thorny tradeoffs as long as they occur within a broader system of social relations that is based on exploitation and exclusion.

AB  - Understanding migration dynamics of fishes that aggregate-spawn is critical if spatiotemporal closures to fishing are expected to protect them. Concern over fishing of Chrysophrys auratus spawning aggregations in embayments near a west Australian city led to an annual 4-month spatial fishing closure. However, the extent to which it protects fish migrating to and from aggregations is unclear. Acoustic telemetry demonstrated a bimodal pattern of entry to and departure from the main embayment via only one of several pathways. Among years, 33%-56% of fish occurred in the pathway prior to the closure, but most left before it ceased. Fish were detected within the closure in multiple but not always consecutive years. Variation in migration timing and aggregation philopatry may alter capture risk, but pre- and postspawning migratory fish are fished in the main pathway and adjacent reefs, which would presumably impact spawning aggregation biomass. Assessment of this would assist in understanding whether expansion of the closure's spatial and temporal limits is necessary to ensure spawning biomass or whether current management is sufficient.

AB  - The rock instability of granodiorite mountain rock located within a key route for the Mecca city (Al Haram) and Al-Taif (tourist place) was investigated. In this study eight, highly susceptible sites from 22km road selected for kinematic and rockfall analysis to avoid rockfall consequences. Based on the field investigation, this mountain road is characterized by nearly vertical cut slopes with highly fractured and jointed rocks leading to the occurrences of rock instability. The kinematic results indicated that planar, wedge and toppling failure is the main reason for rock block instability. Furthermore, the rockfall movement trajectory and bounce height were modeled with their corresponding translational velocity and kinetic energy for delineating the dynamics of a falling rock block. The bounce height ranged from approximately 1.3m to>8m. The energies ranged from low (<30kJ) to high-intensity zones (>300kJ) capable of causing mortality and damaging infrastructure. The present study indicates the study area is at risk of rockfalls and preventive measures are required to minimize the rockfall hazard. Study results can serve as a reference for predicting rockfall areas under similar conditions.

AB  - For charging battery pack in electrical vehicles need large and expensive devices and circuits, to reduce the volume and prices, it is possible to use the structure of an integrated battery charger with converter and electrical machine. Due to the simplicity of switched reluctance machine's structure and lack of magnet and winding on the rotor, this machine is an attractive option for use in integrated battery chargers. Due to growing use of electrical vehicles and use of city's electricity grid to provide energy, it is necessary to correct power factor in battery chargers. In multi-phase excitation that occur when battery pack is charging, should attention to inductance changes induced by mutual induction and core saturation and due to inductance variations, current must be controlled to prevent the rotor movement. In this study, current margin is selected for phase current and thermal analysis is considered to prevent rising temperature and exceed the winding insulation class, so used copper losses minimization method for minimizing winding temperature in multi-phase excitation.

AB  - The internet has become an integral part of social activism. The widespread nature of movements such as #OccupyWallStreet and #BlackLivesMatter on social media demonstrate the web's efficacy in raising awareness on social issues. These movements often have their detractors, however, and online debate on racial protest in particular is often vigorous. While the #BlackLivesMatter movement has drawn considerable attention in sociological circles, little work has been conducted on how content manifests itself over space. In this article, I undertake a place-based approach to studying the factors driving #BlackLivesMatter and counter-protest content (e.g., #AllLivesMatter) through geolocated tweets in Louisiana and Texas Census Designated and Incorporated Places (i.e. cities). I find that the production of content meshes with color-blind racial theory and aligns with some offline processes, but perhaps not in the ways that one might expect. Percent black and percent Asian have a positive association with the production of both #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter content, while percent white and percent Hispanic have a negative association. The approach presented is novel in that it utilizes tweets with general location and information from users' profile descriptions. The post hoc analysis demonstrates how bifurcating the data based on spatial and temporal characteristics can reveal subtle but, informative trends, yet results should be interpreted cautiously.

TI  - Response of Drivers to Variable Message Signs in Dynamic Lane Assignment Application Using Artificial Neural Networks and Other Traditional Techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRANSPORTATION AND DEVELOPMENT 2019: SMARTER AND SAFER MOBILITY AND CITIES
LA  - English
CP  - ASCE International Conference on Transportation and Development (ICTD)
AB  - Dynamic lane assignment (DLA) is one-way of improving the efficiency of traffic operation at signalized intersections by dynamically changing the number of lanes assigned for a given turning movement depending on the instantaneous demand. For the successful implementation of DLA, the drivers should be aware of the lane assignment well before approaching the intersection through variable message signs (VMS). VMS is one of the widely used intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in urban areas, which can significantly support the implementation of DLA by providing drivers with real-time information on the existing lane group configuration while approaching a signalized intersection. Saudi Arabia has very diverse drivers' population with a large percentage of chauffeurs working for households, industries, as well as taxi drivers with a considerable variation in their educational background and driving habits. This paper investigates the factors affecting the comprehension of VMS when used in conjunction with DLA to identify drivers who need extra attention in the licensing stage if DLA is applied. Statistical analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques were used to assess age, education, occupation, and driver's experience as possible predictors of VMS comprehension.

AB  - The origins of maize farming strategies broadly labeled Basketmaker II have long intrigued archaeologists. Early twentieth century researchers excavating sheltered sites in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest found material culture associated with aceramic farmers that included sophisticated textiles as well as elaborate and exotic mortuary offerings in a region sparsely occupied by foragers. Although early researchers speculated that the San Pedro phase of what is now known as the Early Agricultural Period played a significant role in the emergence of Basketmaker II, data bearing on the topic were scarce for decades.
   Recent, well-documented excavations in the southern Tucson Basin in advance of urban development have strengthened the argument that pulses of influence, likely including population movement, occurred during this period. Here, we explore the relationship between the Late Archaic, Early Agricultural Period and Basketmaker II maize-dependent economies in search of Basketmaker origins. A complex and dynamic picture emerges calling into question both migration and diffusion arguments for the appearance of Four Corners Basketmaker II.

TI  - Simplified Method for Calculating the Active Earth Pressure on Retaining Walls of Narrow Backfill Width Based on DEM Analysis
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - Spaces for backfills are often constrained and narrowed when retaining walls must be built close to existing stable walls in urban areas or near rock faces in mountainous areas. The discrete element method (DEM), using Particle Flow Code (PFC-2D) software, was employed to simulate the behavior of cohesionless soil with narrow width behind a rigid retaining wall when the wall translation moved away from the soils. The simulations focused on the failure model of the soil when the movement of the wall reaches the value where active earth pressure occurs, and the shape of the sliding surface was captured. Then, based on the limit equilibrium method with the obtained slip surfaces in PFC-2D, a simplified analytical method is presented to obtain a solution of the active earth pressure acting on rigid retaining with narrow backfill width. The point of application of the active earth pressure is also obtained. The calculated values agree well with those from physical tests in the previous literature. Furthermore, the effects of the width of the backfill, internal friction angle of soil, and wall-soil friction angle on the distribution of active earth pressure are discussed.

AB  - Pyrimethamine resistance is a major concern for the control of human haemoprotozoa, especially Plasmodium species. Currently, there is little understanding of how pyrimethamine resistance developed in Plasmodium vivax in the natural field conditions. Here, we present for the first time evidence of positive selection pressure on a dihydrofolate reductase locus and its consequences on the emergence and the spread of pyrimethamine resistance in P. vivax in the Punjab province of Pakistan. First, we examined the dihydrofolate reductase locus in 38 P. vivax isolates to look for evidence of positive selection pressure in human patients. The S58R (AG(A)under bar )/S117N (A(A)under barC) double mutation was most common, being detected in 10/38 isolates. Single mutation S117N (A(A)under barC), I173L ((C)under barTT) and S58R (AG(A)under bar) SNPs were detected in 8/38, 2/38 and 1/38 isolates, respectively. The F57L/I (TT(A)under bar/(A)under barT(A)under bar) and T61M (A(T)under barG) SNPs were not detected in any isolates examined. Although both soft and hard selective sweeps have occurred with striking differences between isolates, there was a predominance of hard sweeps. A single resistance haplotype was present at high frequency in 9/14 isolates, providing a strong evidence for single emergence of resistance by the single mutation, characteristics of hard selective sweeps. In contrast, 5/14 isolates carried multiple resistance haplotypes at high frequencies, providing an evidence of the emergence of resistance by recurrent mutations, characteristics of soft selective sweeps. Our phylogenetic relationship analysis suggests that S58R (AG(A)under bar)/S117N (A(A)under barC) and S117N (A(A)under barC) mutations arose multiple times from a single origin and spread to multiple different cities in the Punjab province through gene flow. Interestingly, the I173L ((C)under barTT) mutation was present on a single haplotype, suggesting that it arises rarely and has not spread between cities. Our work shows the need for responsible use of existing and new antimicrobial drugs and their combinations, control the movement of infected patients and mosquito vector control strategies.

AB  - Peasant colonization of the Semirechye region took place in several stages, connected with the attitude of the government towards the resettlement movement, and also with the level and nature of Russia's economic and political development. The emergence of the Resettlement Department and the activities of the Semirechensk resettlement organization for the preparation of land plots for immigrants are being considered. Expanding the process of immigrant movement, the authors consider the structure of old-timer households, the formation of self-contained farms in the Semirechye. The dynamics of the resettlement movement, the transformation of the plans of the Semirechye regional leadership for providing peasants with land, division of the peasant population into old-timers, towns and villages, having different habitation traditions in the region and, accordingly, a different legal status; the number of Russian villages, the main occupations of peasants, the privileges granted to peasant resettlers, and the social differentiation of the peasantry are indicated. It is pointed out that in the process of adaptation to local geographical and natural conditions, the migrants had their own peculiar features of economic and material life: the basis of the economy was now not only agriculture but also cattle breeding.

AB  - During ISIS occupation of the Northern Iraqi city of Mosul between June 2014 to June 2017, healthcare workers remaining in Mosul continued to provide medical services. Little is currently known about Iraqi healthcare workers' personal and professional lives in the ISIS healthcare system, and how these individuals adapted. This study sought to explore their experiences during occupation through thematic analysis of qualitative data from twenty interviews conducted immediately after ISIS withdraw from Mosul in August 2017. Participants were sampled from healthcare facilities still in operation after liberation and included healthcare workers of varying disciplines, age and gender. Participants described major changes to their personal and professional lives under ISIS and an extremely limited perceived ability to negotiate the challenges of providing healthcare in the ISIS system. They described terrifying working environments, the strict separation between the sexes, restricted movement, and continuous monitoring by the Al-Hesba morality police. Infractions of ISIS law and subsequent punishment, deaths and kidnappings, changes in personal relationships, poverty and the disrupted schooling of children were also discussed. The importance of protection by supervisors, access to additional money and transportation were highlighted. Understanding these hardships may help support the recovery of health workers experiencing similar situations.

AB  - A fault-to-fault jumping rupture was found during the 2018 M-w 6.4 Hualien earthquake that occurred in eastern Taiwan. Joint source inversion results indicated that the initial rupture started from a north-south (N-S)-striking fault dipping to the west and propagated to the south with a high rupture speed. The rupture then jumped to the shallower east-dipping Milun fault. Slip on the Milun fault was slow and continued for more than 10 s, which produced the largest asperity near the city of Hualien. The rupture jumped again to the Lingding fault in the northernmost Longitudinal Valley (LV). This fault-to-fault rupture process implied that slip on the Milun and Lingding faults was triggered by the N-S-striking west-dipping fault plane where the initial rupture originated. In other words, the movement on the Milun fault was passive; it was just part of a secondary branch of the major structural system in the northernmost LV. Based on this inverted source model, the static Coulomb failure stress increased along the LV, which is a crucial issue for potential seismic hazards in eastern Taiwan in the near future.

AB  - A large body of research shows that the migration of managers from one professional service firm to another weakens the old employer's relationship with its clients, because migrating managers remove their relationship-specific knowledge and expertise - i.e., human and social capital - from their old employers, redeploying it to their new employers. This study extends this research by introducing a bi-directional perspective of social capital in which both firms and managers may exploit these relationship-specific resources. We use theory on social capital to build arguments about how one form of manager mobility, manager migration between two service providers in a single market, can both lead and lag the movement of client ties between those providers, and signaling theory to hypothesize the conditions under which this is likely to occur. Analyses using longitudinal data on New York City advertising agencies generally support our arguments. Our findings contribute to theory and research on manager migration, social capital, and signaling, and raise new questions for how the portability of relationship-specific social capital shapes markets.

AB  - Bennett's (Notamacropus rufogriseus) and dama (N. eugenii) wallabies have been increasing in numbers and distribution in mainland New Zealand. Here, we update their current distributions; estimate current rates of spread to predict their future distributions; and describe the extent of suitable habitat for each species. Current distributions based on breeding populations and probable distributions based on outlier confirmed sightings resulting from natural dispersal and illegal liberations suggest that Bennett's and dama wallabies currently occupy between 5322-15,229km(2) (532,200-1,522,900ha) and 1865-4126km(2) (186,500-412,600ha), respectively. In 50 years, best- and worst-case estimates predict that they could occupy as much as 5883-44,226km(2) (588,300-4,422,600ha) and 1912-40,579km(2) (191,200-4,057,900ha), respectively. Habitat suitability was predicted to be high in the North and South islands, except for areas of high elevation, intensive agriculture with limited woody vegetative cover and large urban centres. In the absence of widespread intensive control, the ranges currently occupied by Bennett's and dama wallabies are predicted to increase by up to 7- and 20-fold (respectively) in 50 years. As their distributions continue to expand, they will become more difficult to control and their impacts more widespread. We suggest that progressively containing wallabies within increasingly smaller distributions and reducing their numbers to minimise damage within those distributions should be considered the top management priorities. If progressive containment is feasible it could lead to eventual eradication.

The clinical efficacy of remote monitoring of pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (CardioMEMS; Abbott Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA) has been demonstrated in the USA. Currently, the PA sensor is not reimbursed in the European Union as its benefit when applied in addition to standard HF care is unknown in Western European countries, including the Netherlands. Aims To demonstrate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of haemodynamic PA monitoring in addition to contemporary standard HF care in a high-quality Western European health care system. Methods The current study is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised clinical trial in 340 patients with chronic HF (New York Heart Association functional class III) randomised to HF care including remote monitoring with the CardioMEMS PA sensor or standard HF care alone. Eligible patients have at least one hospitalisation for HF in 12 months before enrolment and will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Minimum follow-up will be 1 year. The primary endpoint is the change in QoL as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Secondary endpoints are the number of HF hospital admissions and changes in health status assessed by EQ-5D-5L questionnaire including health care utilisation and formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Conclusion The MONITOR HF trial will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of haemodynamic monitoring by CardioMEMS in addition to standard HF care in patients with chronic HF. Clinical Trial Registration number NTR7672.

AB  - The concept of environmental quality management has been described in papers [1 - 4] that looked at the next generation of low energy buildings from the point of view of the occupant. Optimizing energy use is difficult for a few reasons: presence of dramatic changes in the manner we design and operate buildings, change in the role of an architect who must be a leader of interacting team, often quality management is biased towards the design more than on performance of the finished product and finally the need for integrated monitoring and modeling in the occupancy stage.
   Effectively, we are integrating heating/cooling and ventilation with the structure at the same time as we verify the appropriateness of the new methods to evaluate performance of these systems. In this process we require double controls, one by the occupant and the other by the computerized (smart) control system. The traditional approaches to modify human behavior generally failed because occupants were not given enough control over their environment. Thus, a major part of the trend to a low-carbon, climate resilient future will be focused on methodology to include path from a complex field testing of building performance to simplified testing that combined with simple monitoring and data from utilities would allow assessment of the energy and carbon emission in a district of a city.
   Our experience shows that preliminary design must be optimized during the period of service for all more complex buildings such as large residential, office or commercial buildings. In this context the artificial neural network approach appears to have significant advantages. Yet, traditionally ANN requires large data set to establish functional relations during the learning stage and therefore the first question is how precise can the control of temperature be when the heat exchanger is subjected to different climatic conditions.

AB  - In the remedial phase following an accidental radioactive release, it is important that soil decontamination measures are carried out on the areas that contribute most to the radiation dose. In this study, the newly developed concept of isodose lines was applied to the area around typical Swedish dwellings to identify these areas. The influence of the most common building materials in Sweden, wood and brick, and the importance of the positions of doors and windows on the isodose lines were demonstrated for specific positions inside the houses, as well as for the entire house, assuming the residents exhibit typical resident occupancy. Decontamination of the areas within certain isodose lines was shown to result in a greater dose reduction than decontaminating the same area of soil within a certain distance of the house. Furthermore, the impact of vertical migration of the radioactive contaminants in the soil on the isodose lines was studied, showing that the area enclosed by isodose lines decreases over time as the contaminants migrate deeper into the soil. The resulting isodose lines and their change over time are dominated by the downward movement of the contamination in the upper layer of soil. The impact of the variability in contamination on the final isodose lines and their dependence on building materials are demonstrated.

AB  - Commuter Line became the best public transportation in Jakarta and surrounding cities. But unfortunately, there were still many Commuter Line passengers who did not aware of using the station facilities. This led to a "dilemma" for station managers to design station facilities that meet the needs of passengers. Therefore, the research was focused on the behavior of Commuter Line passengers based on the deviation that occurred. A behavior mapping approach was conducted to understand passenger behavior and its influence on the design of the train station facility. The research was instrumental case study, mean study of the case for external reasons was not merely an intention to know it's the origin, but the case was only an instrument to explained and proved the existing theory. By mapping the passenger behavior, station managers at least got an overview of the passenger's pathway, favorite places to wait for trains, crowded places during peak time, platform capacity, railway crossing capacity, the availability and lack of a primary, secondary and tertiary facilities. The research results told us many stories. The results showed some explanation about passenger movement behavior based on three components of station zone: arrival zone, main facility zone and platform zone. The conclusion of the research explained that in designing a station facility, the station managers have not fully understood the passenger behavior. In another way, they should pay attention to that vital aspect.

AB  - Invasive species cause a severe impact on existing ecosystems. The citrus flatid planthopper (CFP; Metcalfa pruinosa (Say, 1830)) is an invasive species in many countries. Predicting potential occurrence areas of the species related to environmental conditions is important for e ff ective forest ecosystem management. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence patterns of the CFP and predicted its potential occurrence areas in South Korea using a random forest model for a hazard rating of forests considering meteorological and landscape variables. We obtained the occurrence data of the CFP in South Korea from literature and government documents and extracted seven environmental variables (altitude, slope, distance to road (geographical), annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum temperature in July, and annual precipitation (meteorological)) and the proportion of land cover types across seven categories (urban, agriculture, forest, grassland, wetland, barren, and water) at each occurrence site from digital maps using a Geographic Information System. The CFP occurrence areas were mostly located at low altitudes, near roads and urbanized areas. Our prediction model also supported these results. The CFP has a high potential to be distributed over the whole of South Korea, excluding high mountainous areas. Finally, factors related to human activities, such as roads and urbanization, strongly influence the occurrence and dispersal of the CFP. Therefore, we propose that these factors should be considered carefully in monitoring and surveillance programs for the CFP and other invasive species.

AB  - To construct urban metro stations, the concrete diaphragm walls are widely used as the support of deep foundation. During the installation of concrete diaphragm wall, the global instability of slurry trench may occur due to the insufficient internal support. The instability originates at a shallow depth blow ground surface and propagates to the ground surface. This paper develops a three-dimensional mechanism for analysing the trench global instability. In the mechanism, the instability is initiated by the movement of a rigid block with conical discontinuity surfaces. The trench stability is analysed using the kinematic approach of limit analysis and the upper bound solution of the safety factor is obtained. The optimal mechanism is achieved through minimising the safety factor. The critical depth of instability and the influence zone on the ground surface are identified. With the higher frictional angle, the critical failure depth becomes smaller and the volume of the failure zone decreases. The drop of slurry level significantly increases the risk of trench instability especially for cohesionless soils. The mechanism is validated through analysing the slurry trench instability during the construction of a subway station in Suzhou, China. The analysis result shows a close agreement with the field measurements.

AB  - The material conditions of populations in the Global South are interconnected with the material conditions of Black working-class urban communities in the U.S. Through this multi-scalar construction, I put forward a theory of Calle - a transnational ethic of ethno-racial-spatial solidarity. Set within stages of dual geographies, my AfroCuban American cultural and familial history are paramount to understanding the landscapes that shaped my scholarly identity and pedagogy. As a researcher of the Ferguson movement while at the University of Missouri, I learned that Ferguson student-activists led several campus movements: Occupy SLU at St. Louis University (fall 2014), University of Missouri (MU) for Mike Brown (fall 2014), and Concerned Student 1950 (fall 2015) both at the University of Missouri. This residential foundation served as a site of liberation, inquiry, and pedagogy. In this article, I aim to disrupt the binaries of community/classroom, teacher/student, and engage in dialectics centered on the literal and figurative streets of Ferguson, Missouri. This rooting of a racial bone memory aligns with Black Lives Matter (BLM)'s tenet of globalism, which elevates a solidarity between all people of African descent on the continent of Africa and in the diaspora.

AB  - MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus) antibodies were detected in camels since 1983, but the first human case was only detected in 2012. This study sought to identify and quantify possible drivers for the MERS-CoV emergence and spillover to humans. A list of potential human, animal and environmental drivers for disease emergence were identified from literature. Trends in possible drivers were analyzed from national and international databases, and through structured interviews with experts in Qatar. The discovery and exploitation of oil and gas led to a 5-fold increase in Qatar GDP coupled with a 7-fold population growth in the past 30 years. The lifestyle gradually transformed from Bedouin life to urban sedentary life, along with a sharp increase in obesity and other comorbidities. Owing to substantial governmental support, camel husbandry and competitions flourished, exacerbating the already rapidly occurring desertification that forced banning of free grazing in 2005. Consequently, camels were housed in compact barns alongside their workers. The transition in husbandry leading to high density camel farming along with increased exposure to humans, combined with the increase of camel movement for the racing and breeding industry, have led to a convergence of factors driving spillover of MERS-CoV from camels to humans.

AB  - Various types of wastes are the main sources of heavy metal within a landfill system including metal waste components such as food cans, scrap metal, household hazardous waste and electronic waste such as batteries and old computers. The procedure that occurs inside the waste cells quickens that procedure for substantial metal draining from the waste component. This study comparing soil samples taken from four different sites in Selangor of closed non-sanitary (Sungai Kembong) and sanitary (Ampar Tenang, Air Hitam and Kubang Badak) landfills at different depths (0-30 cm, 30-60 cm and 60-90 cm) and radiuses (5-10 m, 10-15 m and 15-20 m), for ten heavy metals (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) to find the risk of heavy metal movement from the upper layer cell into the deeper layer. The data were analysed using ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer NexION 300X). Al and Fe displayed higher concentration at most of the sites with different volume of concentration at different depth and radius. Most of the sites consistently showed higher contamination in deeper soil than the upper layer of the soil.

AB  - The history of nursing also encompasses the history of nurses' professional knowledge, the conditions of its production, and the use of it in both the health system and the city. In what appears to be an undeniable process of development and affirmation of this occupational group due to the emergence of these skills, the creation of the International School of Advanced Nursing Education (Ecole internationale d'enseignement infirmier superieur; EIEIS) in Lyon in 1965 represented a major turning point for French nurses, despite it only training a small number of them. This article aims to examine, starting from the roots of this professionalization movement at the end of the nineteenth century, what this unique school brought to them collectively until its closure in 1995. By entering university for the first time, this occupational group, which had until then been under the yoke of different powers (administrative, medical, and religious), became emancipated by learning to be autonomous and even disobedient. Largely open to the world, this school also laid the foundations for a reflection on the possibility of nursing becoming an academic discipline in France, despite its work remaining incomplete due to its closure as a result of a lack of resources needed to continue its activity.

AB  - The use of experiments is an important didactic strategy for the chemistry teaching, for motivation and learning of scientific contents, especially when designed in accordance with research teaching, in order to encourage questioning, planning and explanations based on evidence, actions essential for understanding the contents of chemistry. The present work had the objective of evaluating the potential of a continued formation of for chemistry teacher's workshop, as well as analyzing the impressions of these teachers on experimental work through teaching by investigation. For this, it was conducted the referred workshop focused on the approach of experimentation in a perspective of teaching by investigation with six chemistry teachers of the High School in the city of Serra Talhada, Pernambuco. The application of the workshop occurred in two moments, totaling eight hours. To compose the proposal of continued formation the following activities were used: comics, videos, theoretical classes, presentation of experiments, among other resources. The data were collected from the use of a camera for recording in audio and video, in addition to the material produced by the participating teachers and were analyzed using description/reflection of the actions and discursive textual analysis, respectively. It was possible to perceive the evolution of teachers' conceptions about the use of experimentation in teaching, in a movement of convergence for ideas of work with experimental activities in the perspective of teaching by research.

AB  - An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 (ML) and 7.2 (Mw) occurred at 13: 41 p.m. local time on October 23, 2011 in the western of the Ercek Lake and about 20 km away from the city center of Van, Turkey (EQE-KOERI in The October 23, 2011 Van, Turkey earthquake (Mw = 7.2). Technical report. Istanbul, 2011). The earthquake was recorded using by the 22 accelerometers in the stations belong to National Strong Motion Observation Network (DEMP 2011. Republic of Turkey prime ministry disaster and emergency management presidency, Earthquake Department, 23-Oct-2011 Van Earthquake Report). The distance of these stations from the earthquake epicenter varies between 42 and 590 km. The closest station to the earthquake is Van-Muradiye acceleration-meter station and measured higher values of acceleration in N-S component, E-W direction and vertical direction are 178 cm/s(2), 168.5 cm/s(2) and 78.5 cm/s(2), respectively. The highest acceleration value was recorded at the N-S component in Van-Muradiye acceleration-meter station. Seismic intensity values calculated by using these acceleration values and for Van-Merkez earthquake, maximum intensity is predicted as IX whereas the maximum intensity value is predicted as VI for Van-Edremit earthquake. It is understood that the Everek Fault with approximately E-W direction has caused the earthquake. Focal mechanism solutions of Mw: 7.2 earthquakes reveal E-W oriented thrust fault mechanism. Since there were no marker to thrust faulting in the field as fault rupture, morphological indicators, other effects of earthquake like mass movements show that E-W oriented thrust fault named as "Everek Fault" is the primary source of this event. The most important proof of this idea was the aftershocks. Due to the Bitlis station is located the Southwestern edge of the fault and the high accelerations in the E-W component, it is seen that the forward directivity effect in the station records. The time of the earthquake is one of the important parameters determining the structural damage. It is also one of the important parameters of the strong motion earthquakes. The acceleration values greater than 50 gal (cm/s(2)) in the Van-Muradiye station has continued approximately 16 s. The area has important seismic activities and complex fault systems. The acceleration record in the Van-Muradiye station is very important to seismology of strong ground motion. When records of Muradiye and Van Stations area analyzed in terms of response spectra, both ground motions are below the design spectra defined for 1st degree earthquake zone. Buildings in Van city and Ercis district generally consists of 4-8 storey concrete structures, which is very common in Turkey. Therefore, due to the higher ground acceleration is greater than expected empirical values, the major damages has occurred in buildings.

AB  - High-grade highways constitute an important transportation infrastructure in coal mine areas in China. The surface subsidence caused by coal mining under high-grade highways poses a serious threat to the safety of high-grade highways. It is imperative to study the influence of mining-induced surface subsidence on high-grade highways. Zouji high-grade highways connect Zoucheng city and Jining city and pass over Nantun Coal Mine. Hence, coal resource exploitation in Nantun Coal Mine negatively affects high-grade highways. The 7328 working face belongs to the upper layers of No. 3 coal of Nantun Coal Mine. A field survey of deformation monitoring points above No. 7328 working face and a field investigation of high-grade highways damage area are performed to examine the subsidence relationship between high-grade highways pavement and surface, high-grade highways deformation and failure characteristics. The results are as follows: (1) the pavement subsidence is essentially consistent with the surface subsidence. When the pavement produces an uplift, the pavement subsidence is lower than surface subsidence. (2) Due to the discontinuous deformation of uplifts and cracks, the inclination curves exhibit obvious fluctuations. (3) The pavement cracks occur in the tensile area. The generation and development of pavement cracks mainly occur prior to the working face advances under the high-grade highways. Advances in working face increases the surface movement and deformation although the cracks width exhibits only a slight change. (4) The pavement uplifts occur in the compression deformation zone. The measured uplift height is between 5 and 15 cm, the length is between 5 and 12 m and the width is between 2 and 9 m. The horizontal profile of uplift generally corresponds to a long and narrow oval. (5) Given a strong stiffness and anti-deformation ability, the kerb also experiences compression failure within 24 h, and this mainly includes folding fracture or comminuted fracture. It is expected that the results of the study can guide coal exploitation under Zouji high-grade highways and provide an experimental reference for coal exploitation under high-grade highways in other mining areas.

TI  - ROUND THREE OF HONG KONG'S CONSTITUTIONAL GAME: FROM SEMI-DEMOCRACY TO SEMI-AUTHORITARIANISM
T2  - HONG KONG LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - A game-analytical framework is used to understand the constitutional development of Hong Kong. The constitutional game of Hong Kong has entered into Round Three. The theme for Round Three is "from semi-democracy to semi-authoritarianism". The existing game-field is neither genuinely democratic nor totally authoritarian. The Civil Society of Hong Kong, a key game player, adopted a new strategy to put pressure on the Central Government (CG) aiming to transform the game-field from semi-democratic to genuinely democratic. A large-scale civil disobedience movement by occupying main streets at the heart of the city was organised in 2014. The CG, the most powerful and resourceful game player, responded by blocking Hong Kong's road to democracy. The CG worries that Hong Kong could be used as a subversive base to threaten its rule in the Mainland if democratic elections were to be fully implemented. The game-field is further transformed by the CG from semi-democratic to semi-authoritarian. The Opposition, the Legislative Council, the Courts and the Civil Society of Hong Kong are weakened so that the Chief Executive under the direction of the CG could have a free hand to gain legitimacy through implementing policies to improve people's livelihood. The voices demanding for democracy might then be silenced. This article analyses how these changes happened and illustrates how these changes may affect all the players in the next round of the constitutional game.

AB  - Collective behaviour of animals has been a main focus of recent research, yet few empirical studies deal with this issue in the context of predation, a major driver of social complexity in many animal species. When starling (Sturnus vulgaris) flocks are under attack by a raptor, such as a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), they show a great diversity of patterns of collective escape. The corresponding structural complexity concerns rapid variation in density and shape of the flock over time. Here, we present a first step towards unravelling this complexity. We apply a time series analysis to video footage of 182 sequences of hunting by falcons on flocks of thousands of starlings close to two urban roosts during winter. We distinguish several types of collective escape by determining the position and movement of individuals relative to each other (which determines darkness and shape of the flock over time) as well as relative to the predator, namely flash expansion', blackening', wave event', vacuole', cordon' and split'. We show that the specific type of collective escape depends on the collective pattern that precedes it and on the level of threat posed by the raptor. A wave event was most likely to occur when the predator attacked at medium speed. Flash expansion occurred more frequently when the predator approached the flock at faster rather than slower speed and attacked from above rather than from the side or below. Flash expansion was often followed by split, but in many cases, the flock showed resilience by remaining intact. During a hunting sequence, the frequencies of different patterns of collective escape increased when the frequency of attack by the raptor was higher. Despite their complexity, we show that patterns of collective escape depend on the predatory threat, which resembles findings in fish.Significance statementPatterns of collective escape in flocks of starlings have always intrigued laymen and scientists. A detailed analysis of their complex dynamics has been lacking so far, and is the focus of our present study: we analysed video footage of hunting by falcons on flocks of thousands of starlings and show how patterns of collective escape (namely flash expansion, blackening, wave event, vacuole, cordon and split) depend on the preceding pattern and on details of attack. A higher frequency of attack during a hunting sequence resulted in a higher frequency of collective escape events. Flash expansion happened most often when the predator attacks at greater speed. A wave event was most likely when the raptor attacks at medium (rather than high or low) speed. These results provide a first quantitative approach to social complexity in collective avoidance of a predator.

AB  - Railyards are important transportation hubs, and they are often situated near populated areas with high co-located density of manufacturing, freight movement and commercial enterprises. Emissions occurring within railyards can affect nearby air quality. To better understand the air pollution levels in proximity to a major railyard, an intensive mobile air monitoring study was conducted in May 2012 around a major railyard area in Atlanta, GA, constituted of two separate facilities situated side-by-side. A total of 19 multi-hour mobile monitoring sessions took place over different times of day, days of the week, and under a variety of wind conditions. High time resolution measurements included black carbon (BC), particle number concentration (PN), particle optical extinction (EXT), oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO2, NOy), carbon monoxide (CO), and speciated air toxics. Urban background was estimated to contribute substantially (>70%) to EXT and CO, whereas BC, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and toluene had comparably low background contributions (<30%). Mobile monitoring data were aggregated into 50 meter spatial medians by wind categories, with categories including low speed wind conditions (<0.5 m s(-1)) and, for wind speeds above that threshold, by wind direction relative to the railyard. Spatial medians of different pollutants measured had a wide range of correlationgas-phase air toxics (benzene, toluene, acetaldehyde) had moderate correlation with each other (r = 0.46-0.59) and between toluene and CO (r = 0.53), but lower correlation for other pairings. PN had highest correlation with oxides of nitrogen (r = 0.55-0.66), followed by BC (r = 0.4), and lower correlation with other pollutants. Multivariate regression analysis on the full set of 50 m medians found BC and NO as having the strongest relationship to railyard emissions, in comparison to their respective background levels. This was indicated by an increase associated with transiting through the yard and inverse relationship with distance from the railyard; NO and BC decreased by a factor of approximately 0.5 and 0.7 over 1 km distance of the railyard boundary, respectively. Low speed, variable wind conditions were related to higher concentrations of all measured parameters.

AB  - Dogs are often commensal with human settlements. In areas where settlements are adjacent to wildlife habitat, the management of dogs can affect risk of spillover of disease to wildlife. We assess dog husbandry practices, and measure the prevalence of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) in dogs, in 10 villages in Nepal's Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), an important region for Himalayan wildlife. A high proportion (58%) of owned dogs were allowed by their owners to roam freely, and many village dogs originated from urban areas outside the region. CDV antibodies, indicating past exposure, were detected in 70% of dogs, and 13% were positive for P-gene, suggesting current circulation of CDV. This is the first detection of canine distemper virus in a National Park in Nepal Himalaya. Dogs were generally in good condition, and none exhibited clinical signs of CDV infection, which suggests that infections were asymptomatic. CDV exposure varied with village location and age of dogs, but this variation was minor, consistent with high rates of movement of dogs across the region maintaining high seroprevalence. Residents reported the occurrence of several species of wild carnivores in or close to villages. These results suggest a high potential for transmission of CDV from village dogs to wild carnivores in ACA. We suggest that control of dog immigration, along with vaccination and neutering of dogs could mitigate the risk of CDV spillover into wild carnivore populations.

AB  - In urban areas, the control of ground surface settlement is an important issue during shield tunnel-boring machine (TBM) tunneling. These groundmovements are affected by many machine control parameters. In this article, a finite difference (FD) model is developed using Itasca FLAC-3D to numerically simulate the whole process of shield 'TBM tunneling. The model simulates important components of the mechanized excavation process including slurry pressure on the excavation face, shield conicity, installation of segmental lining, grout injection in the annular void, and grout consolidation. The analysis results from the proposed method are compared and discussed in terms of ground movements (both vertical and horizontal) with field measurements data. The results reveal that the proposed 3D simulation is sufficient and can reasonably reproduce all the operations achieved by the TBM. In fact, the results show that the TBM parameters can be controlled to have acceptable levels of surface settlement. In particular, it seems that moderate face pressure can reduce ground movement significantly and, most importantly, can prevent the occurrence of face-expected instability when the shield crosses very weak soil layers. The shield conicity has also an important effect on ground surface settlement, which can be partly compensated by the grout pressure during tail grouting. Finally, the injection pressure at the rear of the shield significantly reduces the vertical displacements at the crown of the tunnel and, therefore, reduces the settlement at the ground surface.

AB  - Many sources of data (remote sensing and meteorological data, soils and groundwater samples) were used to estimate the magnitude of geological hazards, which are confirmed with field and laboratory investigation in Najran area, Kingdom Saudi Arabia. Najran area is one of these locations. It is subjected to a range of geo-hazards due to its intrinsic physiographic and geologic nature. Najran area is a growing urban and agricultural development region; however, some infrastructures have been constructed in vulnerable locations to geo-environmental hazards. The potential geo-hazards that may occur under desert conditions include sand accumulations, dune movement, mass westing and rock fall hazards, flash floods, sand stroom and problematic soils. The current study throws more light on all these geo-hazards in Najran area. Also, remediation methods for geo-hazard should be proposed to avoid these natural hazards. The present study is a trail to calculate and evaluate the drainage basins properties and potentiality using remote sensing and (GIS) tools. Twenty morphometric parameters were measured, in order to identify and evaluate flash flood hazards. Flash flood hazards in the Wadi Najran watershed is classified into three groups based on their morphometric parameters results; namely, highly, moderately and low slightly hazard degree. Our findings indicate that Najran area needs more attention and care. The Saudi Government has to join together with other people to reduce the resulting geological hazards.

AB  - The wider Zagreb area is considered one of the few seismically active areas in the Republic of Croatia. During the period 1880-1906, moderate to strong seismic activity with three earthquakes magnitude M-L >= 6 occurred on the NW-SE striking Kaina Fault and since then, the area has not experienced earthquakes exceeding magnitude M-L = 5. In order to estimate the ongoing interseismic strain accumulation along the fault, we analyze Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) and Environmental Satellite (Envisat)-Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) datasets acquired over the period 2007-2010 and 2002-2010, respectively. The data were analyzed using small baseline interferometry (SBI) technique and indicate very slow surface deformations in the area, within +/- 3.5 mm/year, which are in a good agreement with previous geodetic studies. Interseismic strain accumulation analysis was conducted on two 14 km long segments of the Kaina Fault, seismically active in the South and stable in the North. The analysis indicates an ongoing interseismic strain accumulation of 2.3 mm/year on the Southern segment and no detectable strain accumulation on the Northern segment. Taking into consideration the lack of moderate to strong seismic activity in the past 113 years combined with the preliminary geodetic analysis from this study, we can conclude that the Southern segment of the Kaina Fault has the potential to generate earthquake magnitude M-w < 6.

AB  - The study aims to investigate signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) among physicians in a tertiary health-care center. It has estimated the level of symptomatology, determined the association with demographic data, and identified the related occupational risk factors. A cross-sectional survey was used, and physicians of genders, all age groups, and nationalities from King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were recruited. Subjects who had rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, trigeminal neuralgia, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) trauma were excluded. The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire that measured TMD severity and oral parafunctional behaviors. Fonseca's anamnestic index (FAI) and an oral validated behavior checklist were used to assess the signs and symptoms of TMD. A total of 282 physicians participated in the study, and the prevalence of TMD signs among physicians was 37% (106); among them, 88 (83%) were within the light dysfunction category. Female physicians reported significantly higher FAI than males for side-to-side mandibular movement (12% vs. 5%, P = 0.04), reporting ear pain (18% vs. 10%, P = 0.04), and noticing clicking when chewing or opening the mouth (35% vs. 20%, P = 0.006). Younger practitioners (28-31 years old) who reported clicking while chewing or opening the mouth tended to have reported higher TMD dysfunction (35%) than those aged 40 and above (13%; P = 0.007). Self-reported signs of TMD were 37% among our population. Information collected from FAI is useful in early diagnosis and prevention of TMD.

AB  - Long-term deposition of coal spoil piles may lead to serious pollution of soil and water resources in the dumping sites and surrounding areas. Karst aquifers are highly sensitive to environmental pollution. In this study, the occurrence and release/mobilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coal waste and coal spoils fire gas mineral (CSFGM) were evaluated by field and indoor investigations at Yangquan city, one of the major coal mining districts in the karst areas of northern China. Field investigations showed that dumping of coal waste over decades has resulted in soil and water pollution via spontaneous combustion and leaching of coal spoil piles. Indoor analysis revealed that the 2-ring and 3-ring PAHs contribute to 65-80% of the total PAHs in coal spoils, with naphthalene (Nap), Chrysene (Chr), and Phenanthrene (Phe) as the dominant compounds. Based on a heating/burning simulation experiment, the production of PAHs is temperature-dependent and mainly consists of low-ring PAHs: 2-ring, 3-ring, and part of the 4-ring PAHs. The PAHs in the leachate are light-PAHs (Nap, 20.06 ng/L; Phe, 4.76 ng/L) with few heavy-PAHs. The distribution modes of PAHs in two soil profiles suggest that the precipitation caused downward movement of PAHs and higher mobility of light-PAHs.

AB  - BackgroundSAo Jose do Rio Preto is one of the cities of the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil, that is hyperendemic for dengue, with the presence of the four dengue serotypes.Objectives: to calculate dengue seroprevalence in a neighbourhood of SAo Jose do Rio Preto and identify if socioeconomic and demographic covariates are associated with dengue seropositivity.MethodsA cohort study to evaluate dengue seroprevalence and incidence and associated factors on people aged 10yearsor older, was assembled in Vila Toninho neighbourhood, SAo Jose do Rio Preto. The participant enrolment occurred from October 2015 to March 2016 (the first wave of the cohort study), when blood samples were collected for serological test (ELISA IgG anti-DENV) and questionnaires were administrated on socio-demographic variables. We evaluated the data collected in this first wave using a cross-sectional design. We considered seropositive the participants that were positive in the serological test (seronegative otherwise). We modelled the seroprevalence with a logistic regression in a geostatistical approach. The Bayesian inference was made using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) coupled with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation method (SPDE).ResultsWe found 986 seropositive individuals for DENV in 1322 individuals surveyed in the study area in the first wave of the cohort study, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 74.6% (95%CI: 72.2-76.9). Between the population that said never had dengue fever, 68.4% (566/828) were dengue seropositive. Older people, non-white and living in a house (instead of in an apartment), were positively associated with dengue seropositivity. We adjusted for the other socioeconomic and demographic covariates, and accounted for residual spatial dependence between observations, which was found to present up to 800m.ConclusionsOnly one in four people aged 10years or older did not have contact with any of the serotypes of dengue virus in Vila Toninho neighbourhood in SAo Jose do Rio Preto. Age, race and type of house were associated with the occurrence of the disease. The use of INLA in a geostatistical approach in a Bayesian context allowed us to take into account the spatial dependence between the observations and identify the associated covariates to dengue seroprevalence.

AB  - Preparing a plan for reaction to a grave emergency is a significant first stage in disaster management. A group of experts can do such preparation. Best results are obtained with group members having diverse backgrounds and access to different relevant data. The output of this stage should be a plan as comprehensive as possible, taking into account various perspectives. The group can organize itself as a collaborative decision-making team with a process cycle involving modeling the process, defining the objectives of the decision outcome, gathering data, generating options and evaluating them according to the defined objectives. The meeting participants may have their own evidences concerning people's location at the beginning of the emergency and assumptions about people's reactions once it occurs. Geographical information is typically crucial for the plan, because the plan must be based on the location of the safe areas, the distances to move people, the connecting roads or other evacuation links, the ease of movement of the rescue personnel, and other geography-based considerations. The paper deals with this scenario and it introduces a computer tool intended to support the experts to prepare the plan by incorporating the various viewpoints and data. The group participants should be able to generate, visualize and compare the outcomes of their contributions. The proposal is complemented with an example of use: it is a real case simulation in the event of a tsunami following an earthquake at a certain urban location.

AB  - The geographic distribution of sexually transmitted infections reflects the underlying social process of sexual partner selection. This qualitative study explored the social geography of partner selection among sexual minority men and used the results to develop a mid-range theory of STI transmission. In-depth interviews with 31 sexual minority men who lived, worked, or socialized in Toronto, Canada, occurred in June and July 2016. Participants were asked how they found sexual partners and reconstructed their egocentric sexual networks for the previous 3 months. Participants described an iterative process of partner selection involving intention (sex versus dating), connecting with community, and selecting a partner based on intersecting partner characteristics (external, internal, and emergent feelings when interacting with potential partners) and personal preferences. Geography influenced partner selection three ways: (1) participant search patterns maximized the number of potential partners in the shortest distance possible; (2) the density of sexual minority men in a participant's community directly impacted participant's social and sexual isolations; and (3) geosexual isolation influenced sexual mixing patterns. Participants described "convection mixing," where assortative urban mixing nested within disassortative suburban mixing resulted in movement from the suburbs to downtown and back to the suburbs. We theorize that convection mixing may be contributing to the persistence of STI epidemics in core and outbreak areas by creating STI reservoirs outside of, and connected to, core and outbreak areas.

AB  - Ground vehicles are the main sources of noise and infrasounds in residential areas. Numerous published works are devoted to the studies of audible sound, its sources in vehicle, and development of measures to its reduction. The authors believe that the problem of infrasound occurrence and propagation in residential areas and - hence - its negative impact on humans and ambient environment is underestimated. Development of predictions and experimental methods of studying the infrasound generating mechanism and environmental monitoring of this negative factor are an urgent issue. A significant portion of acoustic emission from a vehicle comprises infrasound and low frequency range. Internal and external infrasound of vehicle were measured. A prediction model was proposed and the influence of vehicle design features on the infrasound level was estimated. Predictions of the external infrasound generating the mechanism of vehicles reveal that its frequency and level depend on driving speed, drag coefficient, vehicle body length, and Strouhal number Wheels, which execute rotation and progressive movement in airstream, are important sources of vehicle infrasound. Five wheel harmonics were calculated for motor vehicles at various driving speeds, the existing dependences are detected. It was demonstrated that the regulatory levels of infrasound can be exceeded only in residential areas adjacent to traffic flow with driving speeds higher than 80 km/h. The results of field studies of infrasound level on the streets of Moscow were presented. Recommendations on the development of environmental monitoring and main approaches to reduce infrasound in urban environment were given.

AB  - Through the previous years, a large number of cell phones information has become in the hand for the analysis patterns of people movements. This information's carry a massive assurance for realizing behavior of human on a very large scale, as well as with an accuracy and precision never happened before can be allowed with surveys, censuses or other available data selection techniques. There are a number of researches that has open key advance into analyzing mobility of human utilizing this available recent data source, as well as there have been multiple various calculations of mobility applied. Mobility of human, or motion over large or short distances for narrow or vast durations of time, is an essential until continuous study for occurrence in the sciences of demographic and social systems. Meanwhile there have been harmonious progresses in compassionate migration (consider continuous pattern of mobility) as well as its effect on people happiness, social organizations, economic, and political organization, progresses in researches of mobility have been embarrass by complexity in measuring and recording how people move on a second and in detailed range. In this paper, the ability of using mobile network records will been described for analyzing the mobility of people and society for various objectives such as monitoring the mobility in cities and builds the suitable infrastructure for them. The mobility of individuals will be very benefit for observation the behavior of peoples and their effect in security issues. In order to test the system performance, a set of tests was applied on Zain calls dataset. The results indicates for the society mobility has been exported for the Baghdad Karkh area peoples. The results have been exported for two phases, one phases when the number of people's routes where only 10 movement and the second phase when the people routes where 3 routes.

AB  - This study deals with the theme of the representation of the resilience of space, linked above all to the movement of space over time, through the study of spatial dynamism in processes and strategies of analysis, detection, representation and enhancement of space. Of a psychological nature, linked to the sphere of the conscious self and of the personality, the resilience, attitude of the person and of his internal world, can be transferred to the reading of the external world, adopting the meaning as an aptitude of space to regenerate and rebuild itself in the complexes and sudden transformation processes. The space is constantly looking for a balance to stratify and re-arrange the morphological and functional needs of modernity on its own nature and on its essence. Any intervention aimed at controlling and managing these problems must seek the transformation and regeneration of space as two inseparable and continuous phases. Two phases that must be managed with the aim of reducing problems and critical issues deriving from the need to preserve the historical space but at the same time innovate it and reinvent it. This objective can be achieved through the tools of analysis, detection and representation, not only of space but also of those spatial values that allow us to grasp and represent the dynamics of urban transformation not only from an objective point of view but also from a subjective point of view, ie linked to active perception by man. The introduction of the perception of space by man allows us to understand spatial dynamism in a broader way because each spatial value is not only an intrinsic value of space but is a value that somehow resides in the relationship between man and space and it is also determined by the way in which man lives, lives and perceives the world around him. In the strategies of recovery and enhancement of space a good part of the space vulnerability lies in the folds of the stratifications that occurred over time that often transfigure the places, because those are the most fragile and sensitive areas, where it seems logical to expect future and further movements and future transformations. The analysis and representation of the movement of space allow us to understand its life, the exogenous and endogenous dynamics that occur over time, even assuming its future modifications through the identification of potential areas vulnerable to transformation. In short, a spatial pre-vision able to configure the probable morphological, dimensional and functional movements.

AB  - Recent geographical scholarship on skilled migration has developed a strand of research on the role of mobility in the constitution and production of the highly skilled migrant. In particular, scholars have forwarded the notion of geographical mobility as a form of capital to explain career development, employability and occupational mobility among skilled migrants and international students. While recognising capital-oriented approaches, this paper shifts the focus to how mobility is appropriated into practice in producing highly skilled and professional migrants across phases of movement and settlement. Through the lens of 'mobile practices,' the paper suggests that skilled migrants craft themselves into mobile professionals, through embodied practices that appropriate education, credentials and cosmopolitan attitudes and lifestyles, and the enactment of international geographical mobility across phases of re-location, settlement and re-migration. Drawing from interviews with 33 Filipino highly skilled migrants in Singapore, the paper shows how their aspirations drive their use of mobile practices to fulfil three aims. First, they engage in mobile practices to fashion themselves as skilled migrants qualified for the international labor market. Second, they disengage from mobile practices during their emplacement in the host country to produce themselves as skilled professionals that can adapt and settle in the local environment. Third, mobile practices are re-activated in mapping new routes for re-migration or return, shaped by aspirations of further mobility, family considerations and the life course. Overall, mobile practices as conceptual lens foregrounds how highly skilled migrants produce themselves as mobile professionals across shifts of mobility and immobility.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavioral and physiological responses of dairy cows and their interaction with the milker in two types of milking systems. The experiment was conducted in two farms, in the Coracao de Jesus city, Brazil, where the surface temperature (TS, degrees C), rectal temperature (TR, degrees C), respiratory rate (RR, breaths. min(-1)) and heart rate (HR, beats. min-1) of 44 crossbred cows during the morning shift on twelve days of data collection at each farm. It was monitored the meteorological variables: the black globe temperature (TGN, degrees C), air temperature (TAR, degrees C), relative humidity (RH, %) and wind speed (V,m.s(-1)). Observations about human behavior, negative patterns (tapping, yelling, and pushing) and positive patterns (talking, groping, and naming) were made without people being aware of their nature. The behavioral data observed in the animals were: vocalization (VOC), defecation (DEF), micturition (MIC) and movement (MOV) and milking time (TOR) was also recorded. The physiological variables were significant among farms, except heart rate. The talking, naming, pushing and shouting actions were not significant, only groping and hitting. The behavior occurrences VOC, MIC, and MOV of cows were low. The TO presented a positive correlation (P < 0.01) with TS, TR, and HR and negative correlation (P < 0.01) with RR. Under the conditions of this experiment, the type of milking system influenced the physiological responses. The milking system of type "bucket at the bottom" provided greater contact between the milker and the cow, leading to a greater negative interaction reflected by the defecation behavior.

AB  - The article observes the ethnic processes and ethnic status of Russians on the eve and during the colonization of the territory beyond the Urals by them. It is concluded that also in the European territory of Russia, due to its vastness, diversity of natural zones and regional features of culture and occupation of the Russian ethnos, in the Russian ethnos the processes of formation of ethnographic groups - sub-ethnoses of the Russian ethnos (Cossacks, Pomors, Old Believers) - took place. During the development of the Siberian space, ethnic processes among Russians intensified even more and went on continuously in different combinations, depending on the climatic conditions, the heterogeneity of the Siberian society. A consequence of these processes was the prolonged ethnogenesis of Russians beyond the Urals, which manifested itself in the formation of microgroups of the Russian ethnos. These microgroups in the second half of the 19th century were called sub-ethnos of Russian Siberians (old-term residents).
   The formation of this sub-ethnos did not lead to the formation of cultural and economic homogeneous community ("Kamenshchiks" - Bukhtarman, Karyms, Kamchadals, Siberian Cossacks, etc). The reason was the vastness of the territory of the resettlement of Russians in Siberia. This territory had a variety of climatic zones and geographical landscapes. Also the reason was the weakness of communication links between Russian cities and fortress, the communication with heterogeneous aboriginal population of Siberia and therefore the inclusion of heterogeneous elements in culture. In the 17-18th centuries the main factor in the formation of the sub-ethnos of "Russian Siberians" was Russian-aboriginal marriages, which is explained mainly by the "masculine" character of the early stage of the development of Siberia. The formation of the sub-ethnos was "focal", concentrating around Russian settlements in Siberia, between which were preserved vast territories inhabited by aboriginal population.
   The expansion of agricultural colonization of Siberia in the second half of the 18th century, the intensification of communication between Russians and aboriginal population in everyday life had a strong influence to the processes of acculturation. Part of the aboriginal population gradually began to use the Russian language and to adopt Russian culture and some people changed their class status. By the end of the 19th century a significant part of the aboriginal population of the steppe zone of Siberia had already been so russified that became a part of Russian peasantry of the steppe Siberia.
   The consequence of the large-scale colonization of northern Eurasia by Russians was the presence in their composition of various sub-ethnoses with specific cultural features. One of sub-ethnos is "Russian Siberians" which are also not homogeneous. It should be noted that for them (at least for the most part of them) belonging to the Russian ethnos not to their sub-ethnos was more important. This fact proves the existence of one Russian identity which has various sub-ethnic levels. These sub-ethnic levels add variety and "mosaic structure" to Russian culture, ensure its viability and huge potential for adaptation to a different natural environment and to various cultural, social and economic innovations.

AB  - This article examines the assumption that recent reforms in social and public services can be understood as a transition from New Public Management to post-New Public Management. English and French social housing delivery are selected as two cases in which to test out this assumption, for ostensibly these delivery structures share significant cross-national, post-NPM similarities - a movement towards a more enabling' or steering role for central government, the creation of coordinating agencies, decentralization' initiatives, the extensive use of public-private arrangements to finance social housing and the involvement of a wide range of extra- and semi-governmental organizations. However, further investigation reveals that these reforms of delivery structures have not been predominantly driven by an unfolding post-NPM managerial or governance logic as the thesis assumes. Rather the reforms have been driven by the partisan electoral and ideological goals of central government policymakers within the context of institutional legacies and entrenched social values.
   Points for practitioners New Public Management and post-New Public Management have become the conventional wisdom on administrative reforms particularly in a comparative context. This article argues that these ideas reflect an impoverished understanding of public administration given that they assume that change occurs predominantly through the unfolding of managerial and/or governance logics. These logics exclude the critical role of the political parties and other socio-political factors, such as urban unrest, in driving change. This Anglo-French analysis of social housing delivery demonstrates the significance of these political factors in how policymakers define social problems, re-design and implement social housing service delivery systems.

AB  - Petunia plants are used for urban landscaping in many parts of the world, including South Korea. In this study, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of petunia vein clearing virus (PVCV) infection in petunia plants in Seoul, South Korea. PVCV was detected from 23 of 79 petunia samples collected from Seoul. We obtained the complete genome sequences of the Korean isolates in this study (called PVCV-Kr, Kr2, and Kr3), which were compared with the genome sequence of the USA isolate of the virus (PVCV-USA). The genomic DNA of the three PVCV isolates was found to comprise 7210-7267 nucleotides (nts), which is 4-15 nts longer than the PVCV-USA genome. The genomes of the Kr and Kr2 isolates encode a large polyprotein of 252 kDa (2180 amino acids (aa)). The genome of the Kr3 isolate encodes a large polyprotein of 255 kDa (2203 aa). The polyprotein has six protein domains: a movement protein (MP; 72 aa), a coiled-coil domain (CC; 33 aa), an RNA-binding domain (RB; 18 aa), a protease (PR; 21 aa), a reverse transcriptase (RT; 196 aa), and an RNase H (RH; 121 aa). The large polyprotein and six domains of the three isolates showed 93.9-100.0% sequence homology with those of PVCV-USA. Furthermore, the polymerase polyprotein gene (PR, RT, and RH) of the four PVCV isolates containing the USA isolate grouped with those of Rice tungro bacilliform virus and Soybean chlorotic mottle virus, which belong to the same family (Caulimoviridae). Our findings suggested that the Korean isolates represent a new isolate of PVCV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PVCV detection in South Korea.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are the object of raising concern in conservation biology. People living in urban areas are rapidly increasing worldwide and consequently the temporal pattern of occupation of natural areas for recreation is changing as well, resulting in an ever-increasing concentration of people during weekends and holidays. This is particularly evident in affluent societies, where more recreationists visit natural areas on holidays and weekends, causing disturbance to wildlife in the so-called "weekend effect". Here, we tested the response to disturbance of 30 Bonelli's eagles tracked by high-frequency GPS/GSM telemetry. We analysed daily home-range size, a measure of changing behaviour that integrates their vital requirements, throughout the annual cycle, considering three different levels (95%, 75% and 50% kernel density estimators). Our results showed that eagles made a higher ranging effort on weekends and holidays throughout the annual cycle. This was particularly evident during the non-breeding period, when larger home-ranges were observed. Higher ranging effort can lead to conservation problems such as extra energy expenditure, hunting interference, and eventually nest and/or territory abandonment, decreasing eagles' fitness. Measures aimed at reducing human wildlife conflicts including spatio-temporal limitation of leisure activities particularly during the most critical periods (i.e., incubation, chick rearing) are urgently needed. Finally, where possible, high quality information of animal movement should be incorporated into conservation plans in order to delineate efficient spatially-explicit management measures.

AB  - Bitumen extraction in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta Canada has resulted in 1 billion m(3) of tailings. Base Mine Lake (BML), the first commercial-scale pit lake (PL) in the Alberta oil sands, is currently being assessed as a potential fluid fine tailings (FFT) reclamation strategy. Here, field-based, BML water cap depth-dependent oxygen consumption rate (OCR) determination, geochemical characterization and modelling of physical mixing were combined to identify the key processes driving the oxygen mass balance and distribution. The highest OCR values (66.9 + 5.9 O-2/m(2)/d) occurred at the FFT water interface and were driven by dissolved methane and ammonia concentrations. Given the extensive mass of these reductants within the FFT, their biogeochemical redox cycling is anticipated to impact BML oxygen concentrations for decades. The integration of OCR and modelling results revealed the importance of physical mixing as a mechanism to maintain an oxic hypolimnion and FFT water interface. The oxygen mass balance indicates that without the physical movement of oxygen into the hypolimnion, the OCR values currently observed would result in anoxia in the lower 3.5 m of the BML water cap, migrating upwards of the oxic-anoxic boundary and enabling the generation of new oxygen-consuming constituents directly within the water cap through anaerobic redox transformations. Results here guide the development and application of water-capped tailings as a reclamation strategy for not only the oil sands industry, but also for other anthropogenically impacted or engineered systems with high oxygen demand.

AB  - The article analyzes the reports of the special instructions officer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs L. Naumov, prepared by him on the basis of a trip to the Central Asian outskirts of the Russian Empire in 1910. During the trip L. Naumov had to find out the scale of propaganda work of Turkish emissaries in the region, the degree of penetration of the ideas of pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism in the minds of the indigenous Muslim population. From the information presented in the reports it follows that after the young Turk revolution of 1908, in the Turkestan Governor-General, Bukhara Emirate and Khiva khanate, the work of Turkish residents, aimed at promoting Russophobia, pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism, was significantly intensified. Turkey also actively involved Afghans in the work in the region, using traditional contacts with the Afghan Emirate and considering it the sphere of its geopolitical interests. In his reports L. Naumov cites facts indicating the formation among the Muslim population of the Russian Turkestan adherents propagandized by Turkey ideas, which was expressed in the birth of the Islamic reform movement and the newfangled Muslim education, the refusal to follow all the instructions of the Koran. However, according to the information collected by the official, the traditional Muslim clergy continued to occupy a leading position in the spiritual and religious life of the indigenous population. The negative attitude of the Muslim leaders of Bukhara, Kokand and a number of other cities of Turkestan to the ideas of pan-Islamism, suggesting a spiritual Union of Sunnis and Shiites, allowed L. Naumov to draw conclusions about the futility of the work of Turkish residents in the region and the absence of threats to the territorial integrity of the Russian Empire in the Central Asian suburbs.

AB  - Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) require access to groundwater to meet all or some of their water requirements to maintain community structure and function. The increasing demand of surface and groundwater resources has seen the NSW Government put in place management mechanisms to enable the sharing of water between irrigators, the environment, industry, towns and communities via water sharing plans. The groundwater sharing plans aim to provide adaptive management of GDEs by prioritising for protection those that are considered the most ecologically valuable within each plan area. The High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystems(HEVAE) framework has already been adopted to prioritise riverine ecosystems for management in surface water sharing plans. Here, we provide a method developed using the HEVAE framework to prioritise vegetation GDEs for management. The GDE HEVAE methods provide a derived ecological value dataset for identified groundwater dependent vegetation that is used to inform the planning and policy decisions in NSW. These decisions are required to manage and mitigate current and future risks caused by groundwater extraction. This is achieved via the identification of ecologically valuable assets to then use as the consequence component in a risk assessment for the groundwater sources, to provide vegetation GDE locations for setback distances for new groundwater production bores, and for the assessment of impacts due to current and potential future groundwater extraction. The GDE HEVAE method uses recorded and predicted spatial data to provide weighted scores for each attribute associated with the four HEVAE criteria (distinctiveness, diversity, vital habitat and naturalness). The combined scores categorise the ecological value of each groundwater dependent vegetation community (depicted as geographic information system (GIS) polygon features) from very high to very low. We apply the GDE HEVAE method to three catchments in order to demonstrate the method's applicability across the Murray-Darling Basin with varying elevation and climate characteristics. The ecological value outcomes derived from the methods have been used to inform planning and policy decisions by NSW Government processes to allow for protection in not only areas that are currently at risk but to also manage for potential future risks from groundwater extraction.

AB  - One of the critical factors affecting travel rates while hiking, jogging, or running along a trail is the slope of the underlying terrain. Models for predicting this effect have been used in a wide variety of scientific and applied contexts, including recreation planning, search and rescue, wildland firefighter safety, social network analysis, and recreating historical human movement patterns. Despite their wide use, these models are based on datasets with very small sample sizes that were collected without using instantaneous measures of travel rate and assume symmetrical effects about the slope of maximum travel rate. These models also typically resulted in a single mathematical function, ignoring the significant variability that can occur between a fast and a slow individual, or between walking and running travel rates. In this study we modeled travel rates using a database of GPS tracks from 29,928 individuals representing 421,247 individual hikes, jogs, and runs on trails in and around Salt Lake City, Utah for an entire year between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Three widely-used probability distribution functions (Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz) were used to predict travel rates based on terrain slope along segments of trails with uniform slopes. To account for the variability in travel rates between fast and slow movement, a series of travel rate models were generated to predict travel rate percentiles, ranging from the 1st to the 99th, thus providing a flexible basis for predicting travel rates as a function of slope. The large number of samples allowed us to introduce a novel term that accounts for asymmetry in travel rates on uphill and downhill slopes. All three functions performed well, with Lorentz percentile models averaging an R-2 of 0.958 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.078 m/s, Laplace with R-2 of 0.953 and MAE of 0.088 m/s, and Gauss with R-2 of 0.949 and MAE of 0.090 m/s. All three functions performed notably better at estimating lower travel rate percentiles (e.g. 5th: R-Lorentz(2) = 0.941; R-Laplace(2) = 0.940; R-Gauss(2) = 0.934) as compared to higher (e.g. 95th: R-Lorentz(2) = 0.914; R-Laplace(2) = 0.913; R-Gauss(2) = 0.908), indicating greater consistency in walking rates than the fastest running rates. Lorentz outperformed the other functions for the widest range of percentiles (5th, 30th-90th), and thus is recommended for use as a flexible travel rate prediction function. However, Laplace tended to produce the best results at moderately-low travel rate percentiles (10th-25th), suggesting a combination of the two models could produce the highest accuracies. The results of this research provide a sound basis for future studies aiming to estimate travel rates while hiking or running along slopes.

AB  - The seismic effects in Nyalam, Gyirong, Tingri and Dinggye counties along the southern border of Tibet were investigated during 2-8 May 2015, a week after the great Nepal earthquake along the Main Himalaya Thrust. The intensity was VIII in the region and reached IX at two towns on the Nepal border, resulting in the destruction of 2700 buildings, seriously damaging over 40 000 others, while killing 27 people and injuring 856 in this sparsely populated region. The main geologic effects in this steep rugged region are collapses, landslides, rockfalls, and ground fissures, many of which are reactivations of older land slips. These did great damage to the buildings, roads, and bridges in the region. Most of the effects are along four incised valleys which are controlled by N-trending rifts and contain rivers that pass through the Himalaya Mountains and flow into Nepal; at least two of the larger aftershocks occurred along the normal faults. And, the damage is not related to the faulting of N-trending rifts but rather is distributed along the intensity of Nepal earthquake. Areas weakened by the earthquake pose post-seismic hazards. Another main characteristic of damage is the recurrence of the old landslide and rockfalls. In addition, there is an increased seismic hazard along active N-trending grabens in southern Tibet due to the shift in stress resulting from the thrust movement that caused the Nepal earthquake. NW-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults also may be susceptible to movement. The results of the findings are incorporated in some principle recommendations for the repair and reconstruction after the earthquake.

AB  - Environmental noise management is an important part of the policy across the EU policy context, because transportation noise is a significant local environmental problem for most of the urban population. Increasing numbers of vehicles are associated with growing noise levels from road transport in urban areas and rising public health problems. Motor transport is considered to be a main source of noise pollution, so it is important to investigate the level of traffic noise and assess the relationship with traffic flows. The paper describes the main methods for determination of noise characteristics of traffic flows. The dependences for the prediction of the equivalent noise level and the results of field measurements of sound levels are presented. The results of field experiments and the calculated values of sound levels obtained by the analytical method are tested for homogeneity, using the Wilcoxon test. Experimental studies have established that the external sound level depends largely on the speed of vehicles, road conditions, and basic operating characteristics of highways. The analytical method associated with the use of deterministic and probabilistic models makes it possible to predict the traffic noise. But when dealing with the foregoing methods, there arise specific problems, many of which have not been resolved: there is no uniform terminology, nor is there any consensus on the use of noise characteristics of traffic flows in calculations at different stages of construction and reconstruction of highways of a certain traffic flow model under conditions of human settlements. Standardized measurement methods have been established and revised throughout the years by many renowned researchers. These methodologies have been revised in order to minimize problems that may occur and may not be foreseen by a less experienced researcher when adopting the measurement methods. Standardizing the measurement method is also useful for researchers because it becomes possible for researchers from around the world to compare their data. The joint effect of road conditions and the operational status of the roadway on the acoustic pollution of the roadside area is not fully taken into account. Therefore, applying the internationally recognized acoustical measurement standards is a good way to start any noise measurement experiment. The purpose of experimental research is to investigate the joint effect of road conditions and the operational status of the roadway on the acoustic pollution of the roadside area of settlements: identify the main characteristics of noise produced by traffic flows, consider the comparability of results of the field experiment and analytical computations. Slopes of 20...40 parts per thousand have little impact on the noise caused by the movement of passenger cars and trucks. In this case, the average acoustic emissions are identical to those used in the prediction of noise mode.

TI  - HETEROTOPY OF THE COUNTRY ESTATE IN THE POETICS OF RUSSIAN SYMBOLISM (PART I: ZINAIDA HIPPIUS)

AB  - The article describes the phenomenon of describing a country estate in the literature of Russian modernism as a heterotopy. The estate narrative of Russian literature of the 19th century demonstrates that the most significant events in the hero's life take place in the noble estate, and consequently, the duration of the action and the plot are maximally compressed, and at the same time extended in time. We should not forget that in fact the noble estate served as a repository of intellectual and cultural memory. After the destruction of the landowner estate in Soviet times, the most important signs of the manor heterotopy are preserved: this is the memory of a geographical place, a memory of the manor topos. The heterotopic model of the Russian estate demonstrated exceptional stability for a long time, having functionally transformed, on the one hand, into a summer residence (dacha); on the other hand, the function of the cultural memory is taken over by the modern museum-estate. The article analyzes the stories of Zinaida Hippius "The Witch", "Two - One", "Out of Time". The manor space of Hippius stories not only creates scenery for the storyline, but also reflects the natural world bursting into the hero's mind, that conflicts with the rational-conceptual line of urban behavior. Elements of the folklore-mythological narrative characteristic of the aesthetics of Russian symbolism are revealed (the story "The Witch"). At the heart of the semiosphere of the country estate's world of Hippius stories is the Turgenev's plot of a summer romance flirt. Contact with the elements of nature is not only a triumph of the irrational and mystical in the hero's mind, but also signs of his initiation: thus, the story "Two - one" is devoted to the topic of the physiological maturation of the hero, who overcomes the boundary between the memory of the manor paradise of his childhood and growing up. In one of Gippius' later stories, the world of country estate culture turns into a fantastic and closed world where time flows according to its own laws, and the manor with its old library becomes a repository of the cultural memory of a passing era ("Out of Time"). The semiosphere of the homestead world in Hippius stories demonstrates the hero's movement to a functionally different space compared to his usual world, where real events can receive a fantastic explanation ("The Witch"), and time flows according to its own laws, turning out to be a frozen capsule of time ("Out of Time"). Actual events occur both in a metaphorical (memory and living memory) and mythological (false synchronization) time section (the stories "Out of Time" and "Two - One"); the movement of historical time itself is extremely slow and completely freezes ("Out of Time").

AB  - On June 17, 2019, an M(s)6. 0 earthquake hit the Changning County in Yibin City, the southern margin of Sichuan Basin in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. During the following five days, strong aftershocks of M(s)5. 1, M(s)5. 3 and M(s)5. 4 occurred successively. On July 4, 2019, another M(s)5. 6 earthquake occurred at Gongquan Town in Gongxian. During these events, 13 people and more than 200 people were killed and injured, respectively. A large number of houses were damaged, resulting in heavy casualties and property losses. Based on the seismic data provided by Sichuan Regional Seismic Network, we relocated the early events of the M(s)6. 0 Changning earthquake sequence from June 17 to 22, 2019 by using the multi-stage location method. Meanwhile, the focal mechanism solutions and centroid depths of 16 M-s >= 3. 6 earthquakes before 4 July 2019 were also calculated by using the CAP inversion method. Finally, the seismogenic structure of the sequence is preliminarily analyzed. The distribution of relocated 610 M-L >= 1. 5 events shows that the aftershock area is 25 km long and 5 km wide in a NW-SE trending. The focal depths range from 0 to 10 km and the mean depth is about 3. 2 km, the total sequence is deep in the west and shallow in the east. The M(s)6. 0 Changning earthquake is located at the southeastern end of the aftershock zone, showing its unilateral rupture behavior. The focal mechanism solutions show that the seismogenic structure system of the sequence was dominated by thrust and oblique thrust faulting mode; the centroid depths of 16 M-s >= 3. 6 earthquakes are within 1 similar to 7 km, and the average depth is about 3. 5 km, which is consistent with the relocation result. This observation reveals that the Changning earthquake sequence occurred in the shallow part of the upper crust. Based on the spatial distribution of the sequence, focal mechanism solutions and structural characteristics of the seismogenic area, it is inferred that the occurrence of the M(s)6. 0 Changning earthquake sequence may be related to the Baixiangyan-Shizitan anticline and the Shuanghechang anticline and their associated fault activities. This structure is belonging to the complex Changning-Shuanghe anticlines. The three Gongxian events with M(s)5. 1 on 17 June, M(s)5. 4 on 22 June, and M(s)5. 6 on 4 July which are located along the northwestern segment of the aftershock area, should be caused by the associated fault activity of the Baixiangyan-Shizitan anticline triggered by the M(s)6. 0 Changning earthquake. The tectonic deformation of the seismogenic structure for the Changning earthquake sequence generally presents the characteristics of a large NE-SW component of compression with a small NW-SE extensional component, significantly different from that in the southern area with the NW-SE compression and NE-SW extension characteristics derived from the 16 December 2018 Ms5. 7 Xingwen and the 3 January 2019 M(s)5.3 Gongxian events. Our study reveals that the southern margin of the Sichuan Basin is in a tectonic deformation transition region, the change of tectonic environment leads to the complexity of tectonic deformation characteristics in the seismogenic area of the Changning earthquake sequence and its adjacent regions.

AB  - In the Eastern Adriatic seaboard, the ideas of the ecclesiastical reform movement reverberated considerably in the Osor Diocese, which is not surprising if one bears in mind that the local bishop, St. Gaudentius, established close personal relations with the Italian reformist abbey in Pomposa, and through it with the abbey in Cluny. At the beginning of the 11th century, Romuald, the founder of the Camaldolese order, a separate branch of the Benedictine community, resided in Istria. Prior to his arrival in the territory of the Osor (Ossero) Diocese, he had been in Pomposa, where he befriended the abbot of Cluny at the time, Odilo. The close friendly contacts between Romuald and Odilo were reflected in the field of architecture, which is visible in the translation of certain architectural elements in the Osor Diocese which had their origin in Pomposa. The spread of new artistic ideas to other parts of the eastern Adriatic seaboard occurred thanks to the structure of ecclesiastical administration and the extent of its jurisdiction. Already in the first half of the 11th century, the Osor Diocese began to nurture new architectural models which had been developed in Italy's Pomposa in that period. In the mid-11th century, the former Osor bishop, Lawrence, became the archbishop of Split. At virtually the same time as Lawrence's assumption of the archdiocesan see in Split, John, also from Osor, became the bishop of Trogir. The reformist artistic models from the architecture of the Osor Diocese were thus conveyed to the Dalmatian sphere. This paper constitutes an attempt to first and foremost examine the type of changes that occurred in the architecture of the city of Split in the latter half of the 11th century, when the Split Archdiocese was administered by Lawrence. Since relations between Lawrence and the Croatian kings of that time, particularly Zvonimir, as well as the pope, were quite important, particular attention shall be accorded to an analysis of Lawrence's role in Split's sacral architecture at that time.

AB  - This study forms part of my PhD research. For my thesis I am examining the connection between learning skills and persistent baby reflexes, and how movement exercises can improve children's cognitive skills.
   "The method I research is characterized by the fact that it includes the integration of all of the infant reflexes that have an impact on certain learning abilities. It considers the rate of immaturity, the load capacity resulting from the age and the physical condition of the child. In terms of didactic and training theory aspects, the program is based on the principle of gradualism and adaptivity. It is fundamental that it follows the major stages of the ontogenesis of the child." (Sarlos, 2018)
   Many children suffer from various problems. Some underperform in multiple school subjects, below the level expected of them at their level of intelligence. Some are "clumsy", bite their nails, experience anxiety, keep rocking on their chairs, or occasionally still wet their beds around the age of 6. There are of course other symptoms besides those mentioned above that occur in children participating in state education, making not just school but also their everyday life more difficult.
   My thesis study examines what percentage of baby reflexes are persistent among 4- to 8-year-old children. The study includes 865 children (441 boys, 424 girls) aged between 4 and 8 years who attend kindergarten or primary school. They are from all over Hungary including the capital city. The children were divided into three groups: research, placebo and control group.
   The tests used in the study check seven baby reflexes, the state of vestibular system, seriality, multichannel attention and short-term memory.
   The reflexes tested are: Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex, Moro reflex, Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex, palmar-sucking reflex, Galant reflex, Tonic Labyrinth Reflex (forward), Tonic Labyrinth Reflex (backward). These reflexes affect learning skills.
   In this presentation, I will present the result of the input test which will be compared with the test results of the children after 8-month long sensorimotor training.

AB  - The engineering geological and hydrogeological conditions in the eastern mining area of the Chengchao Iron Mine are analyzed in detail. The results are combined with the results of site investigations and in situ monitoring data, allowing the characteristics of the ground-surface collapse events to be summarized. The mechanism by which ground-surface collapse is induced by underground orebody extraction or de-watering activity was then investigated. The results show that the ground-surface in the mining areas experienced three collapse processes: karst collapse, mixed collapse, and mining-induced collapse. Karst-collapse sinkholes were found during the construction stage of the mine and are generally formed in the marble part of the marble granite contact zone. These sinkholes show a 'bead-on-a-string' distribution, and lines connecting their centers are consistent with the strike of the marble. Such sinkholes are mainly formed due to changes in the dynamic conditions of groundwater caused by de-watering activity. Furthermore, the development level of the collapse mainly depends on the location and scale of the karst caves within the marble. Mixed collapse occurs in the initial mining stage and mainly results from the combined effect of underground orebody excavation and de watering activity. Mining-induced ground-surface collapse pits mostly develop in the diorite and homstone and generally show a zonal distribution along the strike of the orebodies from east to west. Mining-induced collapse occurs in the form of chimney caving. First, a caved pipe is formed where the rock masses above the caved zone are highly fractured. Then, the rock masses around the caved pipe gradually cave, and finally a large caved-zone is formed above the mined-out area. Mixed collapse is of particular interest as it is a peculiar type of subsidence involving the superposition of collapse processes related to both mining and karst cavities, and it can provide some instructive insight into the collapsing behavior of the ground-surface.

AB  - A landslide is the downward-slope movement of soil, rock or organic material under the influence of gravity. It can be caused by a variety of reasons like intense or prolonged rainfall, earthquakes, geomorphology, slope variations and human activities. Landslides include debris flow, slide, toppling or falling movements, and many landslides exhibit a combination of two or more types of movements. Mizoram is one of the most disastrous landslide-prone areas in India. The state experienced landslides yearly during monsoon season. Landslides are a natural disaster. Though landslide occurs naturally, one of the main factors contributing to landslide in city and township can be credited to human interference. The topography of Mizoram is being relatively young; landslide can be a very major economic setbacks. Mostly there are N-S-trending anticlinal strike ridges with steep slopes and narrow intervening synclinal valleys with series of parallel ridges or topographic highs. The other landforms of the state are dissected ridges with deep gorges, spurs, keels, etc. Faulting has produced steep fault scarps. Thus, Mizoram, being a hilly terrain, is extremely prone to landslides. The extent of damage caused varies considerably from place to place, which is mainly caused by human activities and by geological processes assisted by environmental processes. The study area lies in the southern part of the Aizawl district. Remote sensing and GIS techniques are used. Recent advances of satellite remote sensing technology and geographical information system techniques have provided us a more in-depth approach to study landslide phenomena. In the present study, high-resolution satellite data such as QuickBird, IRS and Cartosat-I data were utilized to map the different landslide hazard zones of Serchhip town for undertaking mitigation measures and to identify potential zones of occurrences. Satellite data are utilized for mapping and preparing landslide hazard zones. An in-depth study of slope stability within Serchhip township was also carried out, and it was found that this locality of the town has been severely affected by subsidence and landslides, endangering the lives and property of the people. It was also found that the area comprises very soft shale and interbedded, weathered sandstone and siltstone, which belongs to the Middle Bhuban Formation of Surma Group of Tertiary age. Landslide risk assessment determines the expected degree of loss to landslide and its disruption of economic activities. The correlation of landslide susceptibility with major assets in the region helps to determine the risk assessment. Risk assessment is the final goal. The main objectives are to assess the risk, vulnerability of landslides and mapping, classify the zones of landslide hazards and suggest preventive and remedial measures, methods involving extensive fieldworks and data collections, creation of thematic layers and data analysis. From the present study, it is observed that human activities paired with natural factors have made many parts of Serchhip highly prone to landslides.

AB  - Frequent occurrence of landslides induced by rainfall or irrigation has seriously threatened the urban and rural development in the Loess Plateau, China. The increase in pore water pressure has been identified as a key factor for understanding wetting-induced loess slopes failures. However, experimental studies are limited regarding the increase in pore water pressure of the collapse loess from an initial negative value until failure occurs under constant total stress condition. An old landslide with progressive retreat development at an early stage of the construction of the Lvliang Airport was selected as a case study. Field surveys including exploration wells and boreholes revealed very fresh sliding shear planes and clearly visible cracks, suggesting the creeping movement of the old landslide. In case of heavy rain or long-term rainfall, this old landslide may be resurrected, threatening the stability of the airport site. To examine the mechanism of the failure induced by wetting for this unsaturated loess landslide, loess specimens were taken from the field, followed by performing a series of laboratory tests, including triaxial shear tests at constant matric suctions and wetting tests at constant deviator stresses. The test results revealed that the wetting-induced deformations of the loess included volume and shear deformations, reflecting compression and shearing behaviour induced by wetting. The failure behaviour of the loess along a wetting path was dependent on the stress level and the loss degree of matric suction as well as the hydro-mechanical path, and could be well described by the linear form of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory. On this basis, the threshold value of the stress level was identified, which could be used to judge whether the wetting-induced failure of the loess occurs. The threshold value of matric suction at failure was also identified to analyse the loss degree of matric suction from stable conditions to failure. The mechanism of the failure of the soil due to wetting revealed from the present study could interpret the rainfall-induced landslide in unsaturated loess.

AB  - In the modem world, urbanization processes have become global and comprehensive. The federal law on regional policy "Fundamentals of the state policy of regional development in the Russian Federation for the period up to 2025" points out that the development of agglomerations is the most important condition for ensuring the competitiveness of the economy of the Russian regions and for providing economic growth and technological breakthrough. It can be stated that the significant role of the development of megacities as drivers of national economic growth is officially declared at the federal level of management of socio-economic development of territories. Due to the presence of various modifications of the organization of the economic space of the global economy in recent years, it becomes relevant to find new directions of scientific fundamental and applied research, the subject of which should be the socio-economic mechanisms of functioning of megacities and urban agglomerations formed on their basis, as well as the study of their impact on the municipal, regional, national and world economy in the context of globalization. In order to achieve a high degree of effectiveness in applying the experience of the United States, Western and Eastern Europe in our country, it is necessary to interpret the results of international activities in a certain context while maintaining the main target parameters. International processes of urbanization in the Russian practice are undergoing significant changes and are implemented in the form of suburbanization, a slightly different interpretation of the Western experience. Some of the results of the analysis of the activity of agglomeration movement in the Russian and international practice show that our country is lagging behind other countries, which is reflected in the presence of an insufficient number of municipalities that are larger and more populous then agglomerations: conurbations and others. We see the most important task of further research in studying the theory of urbanization and the processes of spatial and socio-economic development occurring in the territory of municipalities adjacent to the boundaries of megacities.

AB  - Few studies have been conducted on the activity of the Mengzi fault system, which is located to the southeast of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. The Mengzi fault is distributed along the eastern margin of the Mengzi basin. However, little is known about the location, length, and activity of the fault or the occurrence of paleo-earth-quakes during the late Quaternary. This paper studies the geometric distribution and activity of the fault via remote sensing imagery interpretation, fault outcrops in the area, faulted landforms and chronological analyses. The results show that the Mengzi fault extends from Nandong (Kaiyuan basin) in the north through the eastern margin of the Mengzi basin to Pingbian in the southeast, eventually intersecting with the Honghe fault. The Mengzi fault is approximately 250 km long and is characterized as a reverse strike-slip fault. We survey and calculate the offset gullies and terraces dislocated by the fault; combined with sample dating, we calculate the horizontal slip rate of the fault since 30 ka BP to be 0.91-1.56 mm/a. Three paleo-events since 30-40 ka BP are observed with a 10-ka major earthquake recurrence period. We analyze the relationships among the Mengzi fault, southern Xiaojiang fault, and Qujiang-Jianshui fault and note a slip rate loss of >= 8 mm/a from the southern Xiaojiang fault that was absorbed by reverse dextral strike-slip faulting and lateral shortening of the Qujiang-Jianshui fault and the Mengzi fault. The Mengzi fault plays an important role in the adjustment of the large slip rate reduction along the southern Xiaojiang fault. Moreover, the Mengzi fault has a similar tectonic position to the seismogenic faults of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, 2013 Lushan earthquake and 2014 Ludian earthquake, and the Mengzi fault and southern Xiaojiang fault both accumulate the energy generated by the southeastward movement of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. Studies on the Mengzi fault are helpful for renewing our understanding of the tectonic patterns of the southeastern Sichuan-Yunnan block and delimiting the boundary of the southeastern block margin. Furthermore, because the cities of Mengzi and Kaiyuan are located along the Mengzi fault, this study has practical significance for earthquake disaster mitigation.

AB  - Background and objectives: Health systems all over the world are confronted with an alarming rise of cases in which individuals hesitate, delay, and even refuse vaccination, despite availability of quality vaccine services. In order to mitigate and combat this phenomenon, which are now defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as vaccine hesitancy (VH), we must first understand the factors that lead to its occurrence in an era characterized by wide access to safe and effective vaccines. To achieve this, we conducted field testing of the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS), as it was developed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Working Group (SAGE WG), in Cluj-Napoca city, Cluj County, Romania. The scale is designed to quantify VH prevalence in a population, establish which vaccines generate the highest percentage of hesitancy, and allow a qualitative assessment of the individual's reasons for hesitance. Materials and Methods: We conducted an observational cross-sectional survey, which was comprised of descriptive, analytical, and qualitative elements regarding VH. The necessary sample size was 452 individuals. The VHS and Matrix of Determinants (recommended by SAGE WG) for reasons people gave to justify their hesitance, was interpreted by qualitative thematic analysis (QTA) to ensure the validity and reliability in detecting hesitancy across various cultural settings and permit global comparisons. Results: We found a VH of 30.3% and 11.7% of parents reported refusing to vaccinate their child. Among the VH responders, the varicella vaccine generated 35% hesitancy, measles vaccine 27.7%, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 24.1%, and mumps vaccine 23.4%, respectively. The QTA values for percent agreement ranged from 91% to 100%. Cohen's Kappa values ranged from 0.45 to 0.95. Contextual influences identified for VH were media, leaders and lobbies, and perception of the pharmaceutical industry. Individual and group influences for VH were beliefs, knowledge, and risk/benefits (perceived). Vaccine and vaccination specific issues for VH were risk/benefit (rational) and health care practitioners (trustworthiness, competence). Conclusions: One-third of the investigated population had expressed VH, and a further one-third of these had refused a vaccine for their child. Chicken Pox, Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), and HPV vaccines generated the most hesitation. Negative information from the media was the most frequently evoked reason for VH.

AB  - The Kuroshio Shot Hole Borer (KSHB, Euwallacea kuroshio) and the Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer (E. whitfordiodendrus; Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) have recently invaded southern California and are attacking live trees in commercial agriculture groves, urban parks and native riparian forests. Among native forests the worst impacts observed to date have been in the Tijuana River Valley in south San Diego County, where approximately 30% of the native willows (Salix spp.), or 120,000 trees, have died as a result of a KSHB infestation. This paper examines wood densities, wood moisture contents, KSHB infestation rates, and KSHB-induced mortality rates in two willow species (Salix lasiolepis and S. gooddingii) at sites near and far from sewage input. Comparisons were made on two spatial scales: broadly among sites within San Diego County; and locally among sites within the Tijuana River Valley. The results showed that, on average, willow trees growing closest to sewage pollution had significantly lower wood density, higher wood moisture content, higher KSHB infestation rates, and higher KSHB-induced willow mortality rates than those growing farther away. We present the Enriched Tree Hypothesis to explain the link between sewage pollution and KSHB impacts; it is as follows: (A) Riparian trees subject to nutrient enrichment from frequent sewage pollution grow quickly, and their fast growth results in wood of low density and high moisture content. If attacked by the KSHB, the trunks and branches of these nutrient-enriched trees provide an environment conducive to the fast growth of the symbiotic fungi upon which the KSHB feeds. With an abundant food supply, the KSHB population increases rapidly and the trees are heavily damaged by thousands of KSHB galleries in their trunks and branches. (B) Riparian trees not subject to frequent sewage pollution grow more slowly and have denser, drier wood. Conditions in their trunks and branches are not conducive to the fast growth of the KSHB's symbiotic fungi. The KSHB generally ignores, or has low abundances in, these slow-growing trees. This new hypothesis explains current patterns of KSHB impact in San Diego County and focuses attention on the important roles of the environment and preexisting conditions of trees in determining the extent of KSHB impact. It highlights the Tijuana River Valley as an unusual site due to high sewage inputs and predicts that the high KSHB-induced willow mortality seen there should not occur in other natural riparian habitats in southern California. Most importantly, by identifying sewage pollution (or nutrient enrichment) as a major risk factor for KSHB impacts, the hypothesis ratchets down the KSHB-threat level for most riparian sites in southern California and directs attention to other nutrient-enriched sites as those most at risk.

AB  - BackgroundThe goal of this research is to create a system that can use the available relevant information about the factors responsible for the spread of dengue and; use it to predict the occurrence of dengue within a geographical region, so that public health experts can prepare for, manage and control the epidemic. Our study presents new geospatial insights into our understanding and management of health, disease and health-care systems.MethodsWe present a machine learning-based methodology capable of providing forecast estimates of dengue prediction in each of the fifty districts of Thailand by leveraging data from multiple data sources. Using a set of prediction variables, we show an increase in prediction accuracy of the model with an optimal combination of predictors which include: meteorological data, clinical data, lag variables of disease surveillance, socioeconomic data and the data encoding spatial dependence on dengue transmission. We use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to fit the relationships between the predictors (with a lag of one month) and the clinical data of Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) using the data from 2008 to 2012. Using the data from 2013 to 2015 and a comparative set of prediction models, we evaluate the predictive ability of the fitted models according to RMSE and SRMSE as well as using adjusted R-squared value, deviance explained and change in AIC.ResultsThe model allows for combining different predictors to make forecasts with a lead time of one month and also describe the statistical significance of the variables used to characterize the forecast. The discriminating ability of the final model was evaluated against Bangkok specific constant threshold and WHO moving threshold of the epidemic in terms of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).ConclusionsThe out-of-sample validation showed poorer results than the in-sample validation, however it demonstrated ability in detecting outbreaks up-to one month ahead. We also determine that for the predicting dengue outbreaks within a district, the influence of dengue incidences and socioeconomic data from the surrounding districts is statistically significant. This validates the influence of movement patterns of people and spatial heterogeneity of human activities on the spread of the epidemic.

AB  - The article is devoted to development of the health system in the years of the civil war on the territory of Zabaikalskaya oblast during the period of Ataman G.M. Semenov "subordinating" to the government of Admiral A.V. Kolchak. On the basis of materials of periodicals, archives and memoirs, the author revealed the essence of reforms in the medical field produced in the summer and autumn of 1919. Cause-and-effect relations of occurring changes were analyzed. The information about military medicine and the mobilization of medical personnel in the 6th East Siberian corps and military hospitals was understood. The attempts of local authorities to keep the doctors and paramedics to work in civilian medical institutions were detailed. The article also includes information about the work of the medical forces in guerrilla groups that supported the Soviet power. Interesting data was used to characterize the process of evacuating the sick and wounded soldiers from the combat zone. The work of private practitioners was considered in detail. The information about establishing logistics in the region with medicines and medical goods was provided. Attention is drawn to the activities of foreign medical organizations. Opening in Verkhneudinsk (Ulan-Ude) American Red Cross hospital, as well as the activities of Japanese military doctors was specifically mentioned. In addition, the activities of the scientific societies of the Zabaikalskaya oblast were studied. Much of the work was devoted to combating the epidemics. In this regard, the causes of diseases, disasters, mortality, and control measures were undestood. Information about the sanitary cleaning in cities, open baths, disinfection plants, promotion of healthy lifestyle, organization of epidemic mobile units was provided. The spread of epidemics contributed to the movement of large masses of people, which have a special place. Detail information about how to increase places in the military hospitals, the construction of the infectious barracks, supply them with medicines, bed sets, linen and shoes was discussed. Casualties among medical personnel did not remain without attention Insufficient funding, lack of medicines, mobilization of health workers, mass migration of people, the apathy of the military and civil administrations of Zabaikalskaya oblast had a negative impact on the course of fighting infection. The main reasons for the wide spread of epidemics, especially of typhus, were highlighted later response to the problem, lack of sanitary cordons, the reluctance of the administration to make the unpopular measures on allocation of refugees because of the requisitioning of the premises was strongly reminiscent of the nationalization of the Bolsheviks.

AB  - The author defines nation as a territorial community of nativity and attributes significance to the biological fact of birth into the historically evolving territorial structure of the cultural community of nation, which allows to consider nation as a form of kinship. Nation differs from other territorial communities such as tribe, city-state or various 'ethnic groups' not just by the greater extent of its territory, but also by a relatively uniform culture that provides stability over time [22. P. 7]. According to the historical-linguistic comparative studies, "in terms of the history of mankind it is incontrovertible that some of the earliest and greatest human achievements have been accomplished in civilizations founded and headed by Afro-Asiatic peoples" [28. P. 74]. The Oromo people is one of the oldest nations in the world with its own territory (Oromia) and language (Afaan Oromoo). The Oromo possess a common political culture (Gadaa democracy) and pursue one national-political goal of independence to get rid of the Abyssinian colonialism. Oromo national memories consist of memories of independence and national heroism, memories of the long war against expansionist Abyssinian warlords and the Abyssinian invasion of the Oromo land in the 19th century with the new firearms received from the African co-colonizing Western European powers, and these weapons were used not only to conquer the Oromo land but to cut the Oromo population in half. The Oromo nation consider the colonization of their country, loss of their independence, and existence under the brutal colonial rule of Abyssinia to be the worst humiliation period in their national history. The article consists of two parts. In the first part, the author considers the theoretical background of such concepts as nation, national memory, conquest humiliation, and some colonial pejorative terms still used by colonial-minded writers (like tribe and ethnic groups). In the second part, the author describes the Oromo national political and social memories during their long history as an independent nation from the Middle-Ages to the last quarter of the 19th century; presents 'the Oromo question' through the prism of the global history of colonization, occupation of their territory, slavery, and the colonial humiliation of the Oromo nation by the most cruel and oppressive Abyssinian colonial system; presents the two last regimes of the Abyssinian system and the final phase of the Oromo National Movement for sovereignty, dignity, and peace, which contributed greatly to the stability in the Horn of Africa.

AB  - On November 18, 2017, a moderate to strong earthquake occurred at Mainling County, Nyingchi City, Tibet, which was the first moderate earthquake in the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS) region in the past five decades. To gain a better understanding of the rupture mechanism and seismogenic structure of this earthquake, the rupture process through a joint inversion of far-field body wave data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data was present in this study. In addition, the three-dimensional (3D) crustal density structure of the EHS area was inverted using the gravity data. According to the joint inversion results of the rupture process, the Mainling earthquake lasted approximately 18 s and released energy of 8.32 x 10(18) N m (Mw 6.5). The rupture was dominated by the thrust movement. The maximum slip was approximately 0.83 m, and the slip distribution was mainly concentrated at depths of 5-15 km in two patches. According to the results of gravity inversion, the density structure has good constraints on the source depth. The Mainling earthquake's epicenter was located near the junction of high and low density areas. Its rupture extended over nearly 40 km in the ESE direction along the fault strike. In addition, the density structure also clearly shows a uniform density anomaly in this region, which may be beneficial to the release of seismic energy. The clockwise deformation of the erosion effect in the EHS superimposed over the uplifting and thrusting motion of the Namche Barwa (NB) area, and the Northward Indentation effect of the Indian block. All of these processes have strengthened folding deformation and the accumulated of stress and an abnormally high-density concentration within the NB area. The sudden release of accumulated stress led to the occurrence of the Mainling earthquake. These are the seismogenic structure of the NB zone. The regional structure and material characteristics indicates that the Dongjiu segment of the Dongjiu-Mainling Shear Zones (DMSZ) lies in the density anomaly gradient belt, with high density, low velocity, and high resistance media on its northeastern side, which benefits the stress accumulation. The earthquake activity and risks of this segment merits further attention.

AB  - The partial discharge (PD) in a void of epoxy solid insulation is a typical kind of PD behaviour, its occurrences may lead to complete breakdown of the insulation system. The microscopic process of particle movement is simulated here by using particle in cell-Monte-Carlo collision (PIC-MCC) method, which possesses great significance for researching typical discharge. The simulation results of void discharge and point discharge show detailed motion process and the Townsend discharge phenomenon. The PD current pulse waveform possesses similar trends of steep rising edge and gentle falling edge compared with Gaussian function. The behaviour of discharge events is influenced by many factors, such as electric field strength, void thickness, and polarity effect. Thus, the characteristics of PD are discussed and compared by adjusting these simulation parameters to find out internal connection and performance differences.

AB  - Background: Congenital anomalies involve changes that may occur in the central nervous system during the period from gestation until birth. The present study reports a case of cranioschisis and anencephaly in a dog and aims to discuss the possible etiologies of these malformations in dogs.
   Case: A pinscher bitch was referred to a private veterinary clinic in the city of Muriae - MG, for routine consultation and gestational diagnosis, which was carried out by ultrasound on the 39th day. Routine care was extended until delivery, and clinical and complementary examinations were performed to assess the health of the female dog and that of the fetuses. Vital parameters and morphological characteristics showed that all fetuses had present cardiac activity, correctly formed bone skeleton, definition of the head, trunk and limbs, presence of fetal movements, definition of the hepatic region and hepatic parenchyma typically hypoechoic, hyperechoic pulmonary parenchyma, and visualization of the stomach and bladder. The delivery lasted two hours, and three female puppies were born. A macroscopically significant cranial alteration was observed in the second pup; it was located in the middle line of the skull unprotected by skin. The placenta was dark in color. The puppy's respiratory activity was present, but with dyspnea, body movements were limited and presented hypothermia. In the first 24 h, the female puppy was fed homemade milk compound through a syringe because of difficulty in performing the suction movement. Delay in urination and defecation were also observed in relation to the other neonates. Before completing the first 48 h of birth, this newborn died, and his cadaver was submitted for necropsy. The necropsy procedure identified the presence of acrania (partial absence of the bones of the skull), aplasia of the skin of the eyes, meningoencephalocele demonstrating that the meningeal formed an external pocket, and partial anencephaly and exencephaly (brain outside the cranial cavity). Subsequently, organ samples were sent for evaluation by means of qualitative PCR for canine herpesvirus and the result was negative.
   Discussion: Anencephaly is a result of erroneous closure of the neural sulcus, causing partial formation or no formation of the brain. The etiology ranges from environmental factors or teratogenic effects such as radiation, viruses, toxic substances, maternal diseases, maternal genotype, enzymatic activity, and fetal susceptibility. CaHV-1 type 1 canine herpesvirus has been reported to cause abortion, fetal mummification, stillbirth, the birth of weak pups, or neonatal death. The anomalies involving cranial and encephalic malformation have a multifactorial etiology, which made it difficult to identify the actual cause that led the pup to present the reported characteristics. Despite the negative result of the PCR test, Canine herpesvirus (CaHV-1 type 1), as well as the use of some drugs during pregnancy, are major causes of this disease.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: Since first hypothesizing the existence of nanobubbles (NBs) in 1994, the empirical study of NB properties and commercialization of NB generators have rapidly evolved. NBs are stable spherical packages of gas within liquid and are operationally defined as having diameters less than 1000 nm, though they are typically in the range of 100 nm in one dimension. While theories still lack the ability to explain empirical evidence for formation of stable NBs in water, numerous NB applications have emerged in different fields, including water and wastewater purification where NBs offer the potential to replace or improve efficiency of current treatment processes. The United Nations identifies access to safe drinking water as a human right, and municipal and industrial wastewaters require purification before they enter water bodies. These protections require treatment technologies to remove naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, chromium, fluoride, manganese, radionuclides, salts, selenium, natural organic matter, algal toxins), or anthropogenic (e.g., nitrate, phosphate, solvents, fuel additives, pharmaceuticals) chemicals and particles (e.g., virus, bacteria, oocysts, clays) that cause toxicity or aesthetic problems to make rivers, lakes, seawater, groundwater, or wastewater suitable for beneficial use or reuse in complex and evolving urban and rural water systems. NBs raise opportunities to improve current or enable new technologies for producing fewer byproducts and achieving safer water.
   This account explores the potential to exploit the unique properties of NBs for improving water treatment by answering key questions and proposing research opportunities regarding (1) observational versus theoretical existence of NBs, (2) ability of NBs to improve gas transfer into water or influence gas trapped on particle surfaces, (3) ability to produce quasi-stable reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the surface of NBs to oxidize pollutants and pathogens in water, (4) ability to improve particle aggregation through intraparticle NB bridging, and (5) ability to mitigate fouling on surfaces. We conclude with key insights and knowledge gaps requiring research to advance the use of NBs for water purification. Among the highest priorities is to develop techniques that measure NB size and surface properties in complex drinking and wastewater chemistries, which contain salts, organics, and a wide variety of inorganic and organic colloids. In the authors' opinion, ROS production by NB may hold the greatest promise for usage in water treatment because it allows movement away from chemical-based oxidants (chlorine, ozone) that are costly, dangerous to handle, and produce harmful byproducts while helping achieve important treatment goals (e.g., destruction of organic pollutants, pathogens, biofilms). Because of the low chemical requirements to form NBs, NB technologies could be distributed throughout rapidly changing and increasingly decentralized water treatment systems in both developed and developing countries.

AB  - State departments of transportation (DOTs) are responsible for operating and maintaining the highway system in a safe and efficient manner to facilitate the movement of people and goods. Maintenance facilities play a critical role in the operations of DOTs by storing equipment and materials, providing a base of operation for department of transportation personnel, and serving as the beginning and ending location for maintenance activities. Maintenance activities occur year-round, but winter maintenance activities are typically the most time and resource intensive for northern state DOTs. Maintenance operations generally consist of facilities, routes, and equipment. The life spans of maintenance facilities are typically measured in decades, which compounds any inefficiencies in their locations over a long time horizon. Less research has been conducted to optimize facility locations than routes and fleets. This paper reviews the available literature related to facility optimization, including maintenance facilities and non-maintenance facilities. Several specific takeaways were documented from the research reviewed. DOTs have conducted research to optimize the locations of their facilities. These works have typically examined a small area and included only a few facilities. The larger-scale optimizations only located facilities at the town level. A second level of facilities may be necessary to improve the cost effectiveness of the optimization. Such facilities could include material storage depots strategically placed between maintenance sections to reduce the amount of deadheading. At a certain point, further consolidation of maintenance facilities will increase the overall costs because more vehicles and staff are required to reach the further extents of maintenance areas.

TI  - Christian Michael Wolff (1707-1789) and his Chorale Preludes for Organ
T2  - MUSICOLOGY AUSTRALIA
LA  - English
AB  - An organist by training and occupation, Christian Michael Wolff lived most of his life in the small Pomeranian town of Stettin (today, Szczecin in Poland), but a period spent in Berlin between 1728 and 1732 widened his horizons and brought his activity as a composer within the orbit of the so-called Berlin school, representative figures of which included the Graun brothers, J.J. Quantz and C.P.E. Bach. Four early orchestral works dating from the years around 1740 reveal Wolff's skill and originality as a composer, displaying some attractive stylistic features that continued to characterize his music after his transition to a more empfindsam musical language in the 1760s. In the 1770s Wolff began-belatedly-to publish collections of his works. His accompanied sonatas (1776) and songs for voice and written-out keyboard accompaniment (1777) have received comment from modern scholars, who are struck and sometimes bemused by the music's bold juxtaposition of conservative (Baroque, contrapuntal, structured) and progressive (Classical, homophonic, improvisatory) elements. Similar contrasts pervade the fifty-seven chorale preludes for organ making up Wolff's final and most impressive publication (1782), which has been less kindly treated by modern commentators, resistant to his mixture within a single movement of features associated with different varieties of chorale prelude and unsympathetic towards his penchant for decorative chromaticism. The analysis and evaluation of that collection is the main business of this article, which seeks to pave the way for the wider appreciation and performance of Wolff's highly individual music.

AB  - This work aims to understand the process of potential landslide damming using slope failure mechanism, dam dimension and dam stability evaluation. The Urni landslide, situated on the right bank of the Satluj River, Himachal Pradesh (India) is taken as the case study. The Urni landslide has evolved into a complex landslide in the last two decade (2000-2016) and has dammed the Satluj River partially since year 2013, damaging similar to 200 m stretch of the National Highway (NH-05). The crown of the landslide exists at an altitude of similar to 2180-2190 m above msl, close to the Urni village that has a human population of about 500. The high resolution imagery shows similar to 50 m long landslide scarp and similar to 100 m long transverse cracks in the detached mass that implies potential for further slope failure movement. Further analysis shows that the landslide has attained an areal increase of 103,900 +/- 1142 m(2) during year 2004-2016. About 86% of this areal increase occurred since year 2013. Abrupt increase in the annual mean rainfall is also observed since the year 2013. The extreme rainfall in the June, 2013; 11 June (similar to 100 mm) and 16 June (similar to 115 mm), are considered to be responsible for the slope failure in the Urni landslide that has partially dammed the river. The finite element modelling (FEM) based slope stability analysis revealed the shear strain in the order of 0.0-0.16 with 0.0-0.6 m total displacement in the detachment zone. Further, kinematic analysis indicated planar and wedge failure condition in the jointed rockmass. The debris flow runout simulation of the detached mass in the landslide showed a velocity of similar to 25 m/s with a flow height of similar to 15 m while it (debris flow) reaches the valley floor. Finally, it is also estimated that further slope failure may detach as much as 0.80 +/- 0.32 million m(3) mass that will completely dam the river to a height of 76 +/- 30 m above the river bed.

AB  - A state of war was declared in the western regions of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. This did not in any case mean only purely military operations. The safeguarding of security in the rear was considered extremely important. On 25 June 1941, the Union-wide Communist Party (CPSU) Central Committee Politburo adopted the decision 'On the tasks in the rear of front-line forces', which placed all agencies and units of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs and State Security (NKVD and NKGB) under the command of the commanders of rear defence of the front lines. The following was prescribed as the more general tasks of rear defence: maintenance of law and order in the rear and on roads; the capture of deserters and 'disorganisers of the rear'; protection of communications; the organisation of evacuations and the transportation of supplies; the destruction of saboteurs. Since rebellion against Soviet rule also began in parallel with combat action in many regions (primarily in regions that the Soviet Union occupied and annexed in 1939/1940), then combat against the so-called internal enemy became the primary task of rear defence units in the vicinity of the front in many areas. Thirdly, rear defence units were assigned the task of destroying all property of any value that could not be removed from the region of the front in the event of possible retreat. At the same time, all communications of military importance were to be destroyed in the course of retreat.
   NKVD internal forces and border guard forces on the one hand, and irregular people's defence units (destruction battalions, workers' regiments, people's defence divisions, etc.) formed locally in the summer of 1941 on the other hand were to bear the brunt of this action. The various irregular people's defence units were on the one hand supposed to be manifestations of 'nationwide struggle' deriving from ideology; on the other hand, the need for an improvised territorial defence force was due to pragmatic needs that made it possible to skip many of the formalities associated with mobilisation, transport, formation and supply. At the same time, the possibilities for utilising these units were also considerably more flexible. The formation and utilisation of the 'people's defence force' varied from region to region. The destruction battalions that were formed in the Estonian SSR are considered illustratively in this article.
   As elsewhere in areas in the vicinity of the front, the formation of destruction battalions began in the Estonian SSR at the end of June, 1941. The 'Estonian SSR operative group of destruction battalions' was established for their formation and command at the NKVD Baltic Border Guard District headquarters. At the start of July, this operative group was placed under the command of the assistant responsible for rear area defence of the commander of the 8th Army, which had retreated into Estonia.
   The destruction battalions did not have any definite composition of personnel. Although the self-evidence of patriotism was stressed, in reality the battalions were manned in Estonia by way of 'Party mobilisation'. If a person was a member or candidate member of the CPSU or the communist youth organisation and did not have any other administrative duties, joining the destruction battalions was in essence mandatory. Generally speaking, this obligation also applied to the employees of other Soviet institutions as well.
   The operations of destruction battalions in Estonia can conditionally be divided into three periods: 1) combat against the armed resistance movement before the arrival of German forces; 2) the direct employment of destruction battalions in military assignments alongside securing the rear area; 3) the deployment of destruction battalions and regiments formed out of them at the front in combat against regular Wehrmacht units.
   This periodisation is nevertheless conditional. It is rather difficult to present temporal frames of reference more precisely because the actions and composition of different units varied depending on the situation at the front and they also do not match temporally. While battalions were initially formed in the counties and in the cities of Tallinn and Narva, later on units were disbanded and combined, and new additional units were also formed. In total, over 20 such units operated in Estonia (in addition to several more Latvian destruction units that had retreated into Estonia) in the summer war of 1941. Over 6,000 fighters were entered in the lists of the Estonian SSR militia companies, destruction battalions and workers' regiments. These in turn were divided up according to specific assignments: some went on raids and later fought at the front line as part of the Red Army; others were part of the armed units guarding certain industrial enterprises or Soviet institutions, or provided security for communications of military importance (railroads, bridges, communications lines, and other such sites). Third, there was a large group that was formally connected to destruction battalions because they were tied mainly to other military-administrative duties (the organisation of evacuation, fortification works, mobilisation of horses and motor vehicles, future partisan warfare, and other such duties).
   As the name 'destruction battalion' already says, these units were initially supposed to be used mainly in combatting saboteurs, spies and local 'bandits', and in carrying out 'scorched earth tactics'. Yet as we can already see from the previous periodization, the role of destruction battalions in Estonia already became blurred at the start of July, 1941. Since the front was breached in many places, some units that were completely unprepared for it were quickly sent to the front to plug the holes. The Southern Estonian destruction battalions that had retreated in the direction of Narva fell apart, disintegrating into isolated troops that retreated together with civilians who wanted to evacuate. Other units were incorporated into the Red Army in Northern Tartu County in the latter half of July, and most of them were cut off there in a pocket. In August, two companies were formed in Harju County and Narva out of the remnants of the destruction battalions, and were already utilised directly as front-line units.
   In conclusion it can be said that while the destruction battalions that operated in Estonia initially were indeed a rather effective force for a short time in the fight against armed resistance, their utilisation in front-line combat not only had negligible effect, it was also rather short-sighted in terms of Soviet rule because it resulted in the destruction of a large proportion of the cadre that was trustworthy in the eyes of the Soviet regime, and this cadre was already quite modest in numbers to begin with. A large proportion of the fighters of the destruction battalions left behind in the rear met their end in the course of vigilante justice in the summer war of 1941. And secondly, since the Germans did not count the members of the destruction battalions as soldiers, the status of prisoners of war did not extend to them, and many of them who were taken prisoner were shot on the spot or were executed at a later time as 'active communists'.

AB  - After receiving the divine authorization from Allah to openly notify people of Islam, the Messenger of Allah started to publicly to invite the people of Mecca to Islam. Idolaters however felt heavy shame to give up the faith of their ancestors, and the pagans did not accept the Prophet's invitation to Islam. They applied various pressures to the Messenger of Allah and the believers to renounce the cause of Islam. When the animosity against the new Muslims became intolerable, Almighty Allah gave permission to immigrate, first to Habasha and then to Medina. Some of the companions of the Prophet periodically immigrated to Habasha and then to Medina. In the sources that have survived to the present day, poets (sababa: companion of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him) reflect the events experienced during the immigration to Medina and the intensity of emotions they felt during the holy journey. These poets demonstrate in their writings a sense of elation and pride, having followed the Prophet's favorable advice to immigrate to Medina and portend that their religion will be strengthened in Medina by their presence. Their poems in terms of style are more focused on unscripted, or spontaneous feelings, a style of pauses to give harmony between the shorter verses, unlike long poetic tradition in the period of ignorance (Jahiliyya).
   Summary: The Messenger of Allah comes into the world of Mecca, where injustice and distorted belief forms prevail, and when he is forty years old, he is commissioned as a prophet by Allah Almighty. Considering the possibility that the Islamic invitation will not be accepted and welcomed by the pagan Arabs in Mecca, the Prophet tries to spread his cause among the people only he has trusted for three years. When revelation regarding publicly conveying Islam came, the Prophet begins to openly invite the people of Mecca to Islam. Since leaving the beliefs that are patrimonies preponderated the pagans, they started oppressing the Prophet and the believers. When the pressure exerted by the pagans exceeded the limit of tolerance, the Prophet advised the Sahaba for the temporary migration to Abyssinia. Some Muslims in need of protection followed the advice of the Messenger of Allah, and they migrated to Abyssinia.
   In the meantime, the Prophet was under the protection of his uncle Abu Talib. After the death of Abu Talib, the pressure on the Prophet increased day by day. Moreover, it was even planned by the pagans to have them eradicated through conspiring against them. The Prophet, who understood that he cannot convey Islam in Mecca, went to Taif to describe his case. The Prophet, however, faced a harsh reaction in Taif and was forced to return to Mecca. In the meantime, the people of Medina were in search of a leader to eliminate the mess in consequence of wars and instability with Jews on the one hand and among each other on the other hand.
   The Prophet came to Mecca in the Hajj (pilgrimage) season and also presented the religion of Islam to groups from Medina People who perceived that the Prophet has the features to overcome the disasters between them, they pledge allegiance to the Prophet through the agreements known as Bala al-Aqaba in the region called al-Aqaba, respectively as Bala al-Aqaba I and II. In this way, the city of Medina became ready to welcome the immigrants and to be a base of the Islamic religion that will open up to the world.
   Almighty Allah is first allowed to Sahaba and then to Prophet to migrate to Medina and with migration of Prophet to Medina, a significant breakthrough was achieved in the history of Islam.
   Since the issue of the migration to Medina corresponds to the early period of Islam, the sources of poetry reflected the migration of the Sahaba to Medina are few in number. Relevant texts in the available sources can be found consist of five articles as, three of them belong to Abu Ahmad b. Jahsh, the fourth belongs to Bujaid b. 'Imran al-Huzai'e and the last one belongs to an unknown poet. Because of his connection to the hegira, a verse pursuant to idolater poet Utbe b. Rabia was also included in the subject.
   In related poem texts, it is seen that the Sahabahs poets had prided themselves on the fact that they followed the advice made by the Messenger of Allah on his way to hegira to Medinaand they tried to reflect the intensity of emotions they experienced in the face of the developments that occurred since the first moments of the movement of emigration to the poems.
   Determined to migrate to Medina in order to strengthen the Islamic invitation, the poet Abu Ahmad reflected the self-confidence of walking on the right way. Abu Ahmad promised the Messenger of Allah that he will migrate to Medina and he was faithful to his word. Abu Ahmad tried to resolve his concerns of his wife Umm Ahmad that they might be harmed by the polytheists if they migrate to Medina and emphasized that they migrate to Medina in order to strengthen the God Almighty against superstitions.
   Undoubtedly, the concerns of Umm Ahmad in this context give clues about the dimensions of mobbing, oppression and torture policies applied to Muslims in Mecca.
   Abu Ahmad and his associates were full of belief that Almighty Allah will meet their expectations as they migrate to Medina in line with the recommendations of the Prophet. In this respect, the poet turns a deaf ear to the advice of many men, women and friends to not to leave Mecca environment that he was born and grew up in and the memories that adorns his inner life shaped.
   The poet also points to the importance of the fellowship of Islam, rather than the spirit of Jahiliyya As a matter of fact, because of tribal chauvinism, the poet called for the termination of hostilities in the past and convinced those around him to follow the call. In this respect, the poet is in peace with the fact that the family members will also have the blessings waiting for those who migrate for Allah. According to the poet, the idolaters who favored blasphemy and who opposed Muslims, deserved the wrath of Allah. Even if there are blood ties with the Muslims, the idolaters who favor the blasphemy and opposed the Muslims are frustrated.
   In another poem, the poet also boasts Ghanm family, of whom he was a member, because they had fulfilled the promise they had given to the Prophet, that they would migrate to Medina. According to the poet, the Ghanm family is essentially loyal to the Prophet. As a matter of fact, the Ghanm family, which once occupied Mecca and lived off in Mecca, left the lands they lived in for Allah and migrated to Medina in groups of single and two in order to strengthen the invitation to Islam.
   Poet Bujaid b. 'Imran al-Khuaz`i boasts about the fact that Khuza'a tribe, of which he was a member, that is the lower tribe of the Ka`b sons, supported the Prophet and some of his people migrated to Medina in his verses. In fact, according to the poet, the members of the Khuza'a tribe trotted off to the Medina on the advice of the Prophet without wasting any time. Moreover, due to the agreement between the Khuza'a tribe, who played a key role in the reasons causing conquest of Mecca, and the Prophet, Mecca was conquered and Mecca skies were cleaned from idolatry mist. The Khuza'a tribe was instrumental owing to their admirable attitude in the conquest of Mecca and the Prophet to gain strength, despite the idolaters who once forced the Prophet to leave Mecca.
   In the verses of the unidentified poet, it is seen that the names of the eight Sahaba who were subjected to oppression in the most troubled early periods of Islam, who left their homeland for Allah, migrated to Abyssinia or Medina and were heralded to enter heaven were mentioned. According to an unidentified poet, it is not possible for anyone to reach the rankings of these eight people due to the beautiful actions they performed.
   In the last poem text, it is seen that the poet Abu Ahmad was dissatisfied with the confiscation and sale of his house by Abu Sufyan when he emigrated to Medina. In the verses, the poet likens his home being unjustly confiscated by Abu Sufyan to a hunter holding the dove he seized tightly and he emphasizes that he will get his due in the afterlife from Abu Sufyan.
   The poetry texts bearing the traces of migration to Medina are a continuation of the poetry technique of the period of Jahiliyya in terms of the poetry technique, when wordings that are in accordance with the spirit of Islam are left aside. As a matter of fact, poets try to reflect the intensity of emotions they live in short verses instead of long term poems. Again, poets use the types of art, such as borrowing, metaphor and comparison, which are frequently used in the poetry of the Jahiliyya in order to bring the intensity of emotion they live in closer to the audience's perception. Poets build on these poems on taweel, muteqareb, baseetand qamel, which are frequently found poetic measures in the poetry of Jahiliyya.
   As a last word, it is necessary to say that the poetry texts of Sahaba poets are historical objects in terms of shedding light on the events experienced during the Hijra. Again, the poem texts in question are important in terms of getting an idea about the state of old Arabic poetry during the transition period from the period of Jahiliyya to the period of Islam.
