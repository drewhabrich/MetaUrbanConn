AB  - Cities are growing rapidly worldwide, yet a mechanistic understanding of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity is lacking. We assessed the impact of urbanization on arthropod diversity (species richness and evenness) and abundance in a study of six cities and nearby intensively managed agricultural areas. Within the urban ecosystem, we disentangled the relative importance of two key landscape factors affecting biodiversity, namely the amount of vegetated area and patch isolation. To do so, we a priori selected sites that independently varied in the amount of vegetated area in the surrounding landscape at the 500-m scale and patch isolation at the 100-m scale, and we hold local patch characteristics constant. As indicator groups, we used bugs, beetles, leafhoppers, and spiders. Compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems, urban ecosystems supported a higher abundance of most indicator groups, a higher number of bug species, and a lower evenness of bug and beetle species. Within cities, a high amount of vegetated area increased species richness and abundance of most arthropod groups, whereas evenness showed no clear pattern. Patch isolation played only a limited role in urban ecosystems, which contrasts findings from agro-ecological studies. Our results show that urban areas can harbor a similar arthropod diversity and abundance compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems. Further, negative consequences of urbanization on arthropod diversity can be mitigated by providing sufficient vegetated space in the urban area, while patch connectivity is less important in an urban context. This highlights the need for applying a landscape ecological approach to understand the mechanisms shaping urban biodiversity and underlines the potential of appropriate urban planning for mitigating biodiversity loss.

AB  - As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5-20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure - through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity - but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

AB  - Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity.

AB  - In this study, we aim to gain a better insight on how habitat filtering due to urbanization shapes bird communities of Vienna city parks. This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks - surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 - was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence). Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters. Our results suggest a loss of species richness and functional diversity, hence most likely indicate a decline in ecosystem function, with decreasing park size and increasing sealed area of the surrounding urban landscape matrix.

AB  - 1. The successful movement of individuals is fundamental to life. Facilitating these movements by promoting ecological connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation. Urban areas contain more than half of the world's human population, and their potential to support biodiversity and to connect their citizens to nature is increasingly recognized. Promoting ecological connectivity within these areas is essential to reaching this potential. However, our current understanding of ecological connectivity within urban areas appears limited.
   2. We reviewed the published scientific literature to assess the state-of-the-art of ecological connectivity research in urban areas, summarized trends in study attributes and highlighted knowledge gaps.
   3. We found 174 papers that investigated ecological connectivity within urban areas. These papers addressed either structural (48) or functional connectivity (111), and some addressed both (15), but contained substantial geographic and taxonomic biases. These papers rarely defined the aspect of connectivity they were investigating and objective descriptions of the local urban context were uncommon. Formulated hypotheses or a priori predictions were typically unstated and many papers used suboptimal study designs and methods.
   4. We suggest future studies explicitly consider and quantify the landscape within their analyses and make greater use of available and rapidly developing tools and methods for measuring functional connectivity (e.g. biotelemetry or landscape genetics). We also highlight the need for studies to clearly define how the terms 'urban' and 'connectivity' have been applied.
   5. Knowledge gaps in ecological connectivity in urban areas remain, partly because the field is still in its infancy and partly because we must better capitalize on the state-of-the-art technological and analytical techniques that are increasingly available. Well-designed studies that employed high-resolution data and powerful analytical techniques highlight our abilities to quantify ecological connectivity in urban areas. These studies are exemplary, setting the standards for future research to facilitate data-driven and evidence-based biodiversity-friendly infrastructure planning in urban areas.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in urbanized area is an increasing challenge worldwide. A quantitative tool is needed to provide a spatially explicit representation of habitat mosaics and thus afford insight into the ecological consequences of landscape changes. We developed a method for identifying core habitats and generating a cost surface that was used to identify both the permeability of the landscape matrix and the quality of core habitats and then we developed a least-cost model to delimit the links between pairs of core habitats. We defined a graph-theoretic dispersal flow index to measure the dispersal potential of certain ecological processes, i.e. functional connectivity. A network consisting of core habitats and links was assembled in the rapid urbanized Shenzhen City of China. The results showed that the cell-based least-cost distance calculation between the core habitats can avoid the subjectivity of land cover-based approaches that rely on expert experience. A highly connected network can facilitate DF and reduce the ecological risk of extinction due to habitat fragmentation. For saving construction cost in the urban environment, urban planner can efficiently design ecological corridors along the least-cost paths to connect isolated core habitats and promote appropriate animal behaviors. The methodology described here will be useful in making better conservation decisions and predictions regarding the consequences of human activity and thereby promote sustainable development.

AB  - The spatial distribution of biodiversity has specific patterns in urban environments. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological profiles of plants in man-made traffic corridors and natural river corridors in the city of Vantaa. The number of corridor species represented 76.3 % of Vantaa's total flora, even though corridors covered only 2.7 % of the city area. Corridor plants are mostly generalist species with wide ecological niches, and have ruderal and competitor life-strategies, while plants without occurrences in corridors are habitat specialists and species with narrow ecological niches. The conservation value of non-corridor habitats arises from the rarity of species, and the representation of the original boreal nature, while corridors contribute to the total diversity of species. The potential of corridors in urban conservation has not been fully appreciated.

AB  - Urbanization has resulted in remnant natural patches within cities that often have no connectivity among themselves and to natural reserves outside the urban area. Protecting ecological connectivity in fragmented urban areas is becoming crucial in maintaining urban biodiversity and securing critical habitat levels and configurations under continual development pressures. Nevertheless, few studies have been undertaken for urban landscapes. This study aims to assess ecological connectivity for a group of species that represent the urban desert landscape in the Phoenix metropolitan area and to compare the connectivity values along the different urban gradient. A GIS-based landscape connectivity model which relies upon ecological connectivity index (ECI) was developed and applied to this region. A GISbased concentric buffering technique was employed to delineate conceptual boundaries for urban, suburban, and rural zones. The research findings demonstrated that urban habitats and potential habitat patches would be significantly influenced by future urban development. Particularly, the largest loss of higher connectivity would likely to be anticipated in the "in-between areas" where urban, suburban, and rural zones overlap one another. The connectivity maps would be useful to provide spatial identification regarding connectivity patterns and vulnerability for urban and suburban activities in this area. This study provides planners and landscape architects with a spatial guidance to minimize ecological fragmentation, which ultimately leads to urban landscape sustainability. This study suggests that conventional planning practices which disregard the ecological processes in urban landscapes need to integrate landscape ecology into planning and design strategies.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide essential ecosystem services and improve resident quality of life, but open space networks are often fragmented by urban development, and it is difficult to reclaim natural lands after they have been built up. Shrinking cities (i.e., cities experiencing population decline) typically contain an abundance of vacant and abandoned residential buildings that are demolished for safety and maintenance reasons. The resulting empty lots can potentially be reclaimed as natural areas to defragment the green network and increase open space connectivity. To date however, planning efforts have largely ignored post-demolition land uses for these lots, allowing many to become empty wastelands. This research approaches this gap by presenting an alternative plan for residential demolition sites using landscape ecology principles and methods to incorporate them into the open space network. Using Buffalo, NY - a typical rustbelt shrinking city - as a case study, areas most at risk for experiencing demolitions are identified using a clustering technique, and each building within the cluster is assigned a likelihood it will be demolished using a logit model. Properties with the highest risk for demolition are then prioritized based on their ability to contribute to and connect the open space network using landscape connectivity metrics. Results indicate the approach can foster large increases in green network connectivity using small parcels (a 356% increase in total open space area was observed in this study after three years of purposeful selection), allowing cities to reclaim unused urban areas and defragment the open space network.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity is regarded as a key factor for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in production landscapes. We investigated whether grassland sites at close vicinity to forested areas are more frequently used by bats. Considering that bats are important consumers of herbivorous insects, including agricultural pest, this is important for sustainable land management. Bat activity and species richness were assessed using repeated monitoring from May to September in 2010 with acoustic monitoring surveys on 50 grassland sites in the Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (North-East Germany). Using spatial analysis (GIS), we measured the closest distance of each grassland site to potentially connecting landscape elements (e.g., trees, linear vegetation, groves, running and standing water). In addition, we assessed the distance to and the percent land cover of forest remnants and urban areas in a 200 m buffer around the recording sites to address differences in the local landscape setting. Species richness and bat activity increased significantly with higher forest land cover in the 200 m buffer and at smaller distance to forested areas. Moreover, species richness increased in proximity to tree groves. Larger amount of forest land cover and smaller distance to forest also resulted in a higher activity of bats on grassland sites in the beginning of the year during May, June and July. Landscape elements near grassland sites also influenced species composition of bats and species richness of functional groups (open, edge and narrow space foragers). Our results highlight the importance of forested areas, and suggest that agricultural grasslands that are closer to forest remnants might be better buffered against outbreaks of agricultural pest insects due to higher species richness and higher bat activity. Furthermore, our data reveals that even for highly mobile species such as bats, a very dense network of connecting elements within the landscape is beneficial to promote activity in open areas and thus assure vital ecosystem function in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The rapid expansion of urban landscapes has significant consequences for wildlife. Habitat loss and fragmentation cause significant loss of species richness. While remnant fragments of habitat are important areas for conservation, the urban matrix between fragments is also critical. Increasing the suitability of the matrix for wildlife can increase the diversity of wildlife that utilise urban landscapes and increases the potential for dispersal among fragments. We investigated the effectiveness of retaining remnant trees during for increasing the species richness and abundance of birds in new urban housing developments. We measured species richness and abundance in four habitat types: non-vegetated streets, vegetated streets, recreational parks and bush sites. We discovered that the number of bird species observed was lowest on the non-vegetated streets and highest within the bush fragments. Species richness on vegetated streets was intermediate between non-vegetated streets and parks. The abundance of birds was highest within recreational parks and we observed significantly more birds on vegetated streets than non-vegetated streets. Additionally, we found the number of species and total abundance of birds was positively associated with the total number of retained mature trees within a vegetated street. The dominant feeding guild and species composition varied between the different habitat types. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of retained mature trees in new housing developments may be an effective means of increasing the number of bird species that utilise the urban matrix.

AB  - The value of ponds in urban areas historically has been overlooked. While some recent studies have described considerable biodiversity in urban areas, it is unclear as to how far this extends to different urban habitats. The aims of this study were to determine the condition of 21 urban ponds in Bradford (northern England) and to quantify the connectivity of wetlands in the district. The study showed that macroinvertebrate and plant biodiversity was substantially lower than would be expected based on pristine reference sites. Of the 21 ponds surveyed, 15 were found to be classified as having very poor ecological quality, with 5 being classed as poor and just 1 was classed as moderate. The number of aquatic plant species found in the ponds ranged from 0 to 6 and the number of macroinvertebrate families found ranged from 4 to 13. It was suspected that the aquatic plant diversity was low due to management techniques such as the removal of emergent vegetation. The average distance to a wetland was found to be higher in urban areas (533 m) compared to rural areas (448 m) although this difference was small, which indicates that the low diversity found in urban ponds is likely due to habitat variables.

AB  - The world is becoming increasingly urban. Tools to support urban planning and management are necessary to reconcile needs to develop buildings, to ensure a high quality of life and to protect urban biodiversity. In this paper, we present a tool based on algorithms of Hellwig's method that can be used in decision-making processes concerning biodiversity management of urban green areas, e.g., identification of ecologically primary areas that should be protected from development, quantitative comparisons of various arrangements of urban green areas and identification of sites that can be built-up with the least loss of urban biodiversity. The tool has been tested with empirical data on species composition and abundance of small mammals in the city of Lublin, Poland (central Europe). We used small mammals as a bioindicators of the ecological significance of green areas. Our scenarios show that this method works well for untransformed species composition and species abundance data. Issues of the universality of the method, its ease of use and low cost, the possibility of use in decision-making process that includes public participation and the credibility of the data and are discussed.

AB  - Insect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service, but are under threat. Urban areas could be important for pollinators, though their value relative to other habitats is poorly known. We compared pollinator communities using quantified flower-visitation networks in 36 sites (each 1 km(2)) in three landscapes: urban, farmland and nature reserves. Overall, flower-visitor abundance and species richness did not differ significantly between the three landscape types. Bee abundance did not differ between landscapes, but bee species richness was higher in urban areas than farmland. Hoverfly abundance was higher in farmland and nature reserves than urban sites, but species richness did not differ significantly. While urban pollinator assemblages were more homogeneous across space than those in farmland or nature reserves, there was no significant difference in the numbers of rarer species between the three landscapes. Network-level specialization was higher in farmland than urban sites. Relative to other habitats, urban visitors foraged from a greater number of plant species (higher generality) but also visited a lower proportion of available plant species (higher specialization), both possibly driven by higher urban plant richness. Urban areas are growing, and improving their value for pollinators should be part of any national strategy to conserve and restore pollinators.

AB  - Background: Land-use change has led to a dramatic decrease in total forest cover, contributing to biodiversity loss and changes of ecosystems' functions. Insect communities of medical importance can be favored by anthropogenic alterations, increasing the risk of novel zoonotic diseases. The response of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance and richness to five land-use types (shade coffee plantation, cattle field, urban forest, peri-urban forest, well-preserved montane cloud forest) and three seasons ("dry", "rainy" and "cold") embedded in a neotropical montane cloud forest landscape was evaluated.
   Methods: Standardized collections were performed using 8 CDC miniature black-light traps, baited with CO2 throughout the year. Generalized additive mixed models were used to describe the seasonal and spatial trends of both species richness and abundance. Rank abundance curves and ANCOVAs were used to detect changes in the spatial and temporal structure of the mosquito assemblage. Two cluster analyses were conducted, using 1-beta sim and the Morisita-Horn index to evaluate species composition shifts based on incidences and abundances.
   Results: A total of 2536 adult mosquitoes were collected, belonging to 9 genera and 10 species; the dominant species in the study were: Aedes quadrivittatus, Wyeomyia adelpha, Wy. arthrostigma, and Culex restuans. Highest richness was recorded in the dry season, whereas higher abundance was detected during the rainy season. The urban forest had the highest species richness (n = 7) when compared to all other sites. Species composition cluster analyses show that there is a high degree of similarity in species numbers across sites and seasons throughout the year. However, when considering the abundance of such species, the well-preserved montane cloud forest showed significantly higher abundance. Moreover, the urban forest is only 30 % similar to other sites in terms of species abundances, indicating a possible isolating role of the urban environment.
   Conclusion: Mosquito assemblage was differentially influenced by land-use change and seasonality, but at the same time the assemblage is rather homogeneous across the studied landscape, suggesting a high degree of spatial connectivity. Information generated in this study is potentially useful in the development of urban planning and surveillance programs focused mainly on mosquito species of medical and veterinary importance.

AB  - Urbanization is a major threat to arthropod biodiversity and abundance due to reduction and loss of suitable natural habitat. Green spaces and small-scale agricultural areas may provide habitat and resources for arthropods within densely developed cities. We studied spider activity density ( a measure of both abundance and degree of movement) and diversity in urban gardens in Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and Monterey counties in central California, USA. We sampled for spiders with pitfall traps and sampled 38 local site characteristics for 5 mo in 19 garden sites to determine the relative importance of individual local factors. We also analyzed 16 landscape variables at 500-m and 1-km buffers surrounding each garden to determine the significance of landscape factors. We identified individuals from the most common families to species and identified individuals from other families to morphospecies. Species from the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae composed 81% of total adult spider individuals. Most of the significant factors that correlated with spider activity density and richness were local rather than landscape factors. Spider activity density and richness increased with mulch cover and flowering plant species, and decreased with bare soil. Thus, changes in local garden management have the potential to promote diversity of functionally important spiders in urban environments.

AB  - As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps.

AB  - Urban green space is an important refuge of biodiversity in urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between the landscape pattern of green spaces and biodiversity to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization. In this study, we collected insects from 45 green patches in Beijing during July 2012 using suction sampling. The green patches were dominated by managed lawns, mixed with scattered trees and shrubs. We examined the effects of landscape pattern on insect species density using hierarchical partitioning analysis and partial least squares regression. The results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that five explanatory variables, i.e., patch area (with 19.9% independent effects), connectivity (13.9%), distance to nearest patch (13.8%), diversity for patch types (11.0%), and patch shape (8.3%), significantly contributed to insect species density. With the partial least squares regression model, we found species density was negatively related to patch area, shape, connectivity, diversity for patch types and proportion of impervious surface at the significance level of p < 0.05 and positively related to proportion of vegetated land. Regression tree analysis further showed that the highest species density was found in green patches with an area < 500 m(2). Our results indicated that improvement in habitat quality, such as patch area and connectivity that are typically thought to be important for conservation, did not actually increase species density. However, increasing compactness (low-edge) of patch shape and landscape composition did have the expected effect. Therefore, it is recommended that the composition of the surrounding landscape should be considered simultaneously with planned improvements in local habitat quality.

AB  - Suitability of the local habitat (habitat filtering') and dispersal between stream reaches determines the composition of insect communities, and urban land use may affect both processes. While urban streams are often poor habitats for insects and dispersal between them is often hindered, conservation and restoration activities generally focus solely on the local (in-stream) environment.
   We determined whether in-stream habitat filtering (a local' process) or dispersal between reaches (a regional' process) controlled assemblage composition in a landscape subject to ongoing urban development (urbanizing'). We compared models incorporating geographic distance between sites, environmental dissimilarity, and land-use/land-cover attributes of dispersal pathways in an attempt to explain the dissimilarity of stream insect assemblages. Distance and land-use/land-cover attributes were characterised along both overland (straight line) and corridor pathways.
   Both in-stream habitat filtering and dispersal affected assemblage composition, but habitat had a stronger influence. Overland distance was a better predictor of assemblage dissimilarity than corridor distance, implying stream insect dispersal occurs across catchment boundaries as well as along stream corridors. The best model incorporated land-use/land-cover attributes along dispersal pathways, which supported the idea that urban land-use in the terrestrial environment mediates dispersal.
   Conservation and restoration strategies for streams in urbanizing landscapes that focus on local habitat quality and ignore dispersal are missing a potentially important mechanism affecting insect assemblage composition. While the primary focus should be on maintaining or improving the local habitat, potential dispersal pathways should also be considered.

AB  - Urban parks are isolated fragmentary areas within the urban environment, providing both recreational spaces for its citizens and habitat for birds. This study focuses on analyzing factors, which affect the richness of breeding bird communities in 26 urban parks within Beijing city. A bird census and a survey of biological factors were carried out from April to November, 2012. Simultaneously, non-biological factors were examined. A path analysis based on a structural equation model was carried out to explore biological and non-biological environmental variables affecting bird communities breeding in wooded habitats. In total, 38 species of wild breeding birds were observed in the 26 parks. Based on the results, we conclude that the size of green space in parks is the most significant variable affecting bird occurrence. Green spaces surrounding a park are positive and significant factors for breeding bird communities. Wild grasses/herbs are also crucial because they maintain a high level of insects. Omnivorous bird species and birds nesting in trees did benefit by an increasing area covered by coniferous trees, by increasing richness of grass/herb species and increasing richness of woody plant species. The richness of insect communities (phytophagous and pollinating insects) has a significant effect on the richness of breeding bird communities. This study confirmed the importance of connectivity that the parks are connected to surrounding green spaces, thus forming an integrated green system avoids impervious surfaces. Proper management of coniferous woody plants, promoting wild grasses/herbs, reducing the area of planted monocultures and minimizing the use of pesticides in urban vegetation management will contribute effectively to improve the quality of breeding bird habitats in urban parks.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss diminish population connectivity, reducing genetic diversity and increasing extinction risk over time. Improving connectivity is widely recommended to preserve the long-term viability of populations, but this requires accurate knowledge of how landscapes influence connectivity. Detectability of landscape effects on gene flow is highly dependent on landscape context, and drawing conclusions from single landscape studies may lead to ineffective management strategies. We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts. By integrating geneland and individual-based methods we effectively identified regional limiting factors that have landscape-level implications for population viability.

AB  - Urban environments rely on the surrounding natural ecosystems remnants as providers of ecosystem functions, therefore these areas not only support a unique biodiversity but also have a social value for maintaining public health and wellbeing. For this reason, urbanization is considered to be one the biggest threats to ecosystems, leading to native biodiversity simplification and, thus, to a detriment of the provided ecosystem services. Moreover, this change in land use results in high levels of landscape fragmentation and modification in areas surrounding the habitat remnants which, in consequence, become inadequate for many native species. In this context, it is important that urban planners have the information to assess the possible consequences of future changes in land use in order to increase the landscape chances of supporting both, native biodiversity and the needs of a growing human population. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the ecological integrity of natural and semi-natural vegetation patches immersed in an urban area in order to generate a conceptual framework for landscape assessment that allows urban planners to envision the best choice for city development at a given place. To do so, we developed a quantitative integral environmental evaluation index that includes ecological characterization, geological characterization, and environmental characterization (presence of anthropic disturbance) of the assessed area. We conclude that the index we have generated in this work is suitable to be used as a management tool to allow an unbiased valuation and to identify managing situations that require a short term response.

AB  - 1. In cities, green roofs may favour an increase in the local diversity, although the role they play on host-parasitoid interactions is still unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the specialist leaf-miner Liriomyza commelinae and its parasitoid assemblage are able to colonise and exploit patches located on roofs, but with a lower efficiency than at ground level. We also predicted that parasitoid species may differ in their abilities to colonise patches on roofs due to traits related to their life strategy (idio/koinobionts) and morphology (body size).
   2. Through experimental exposure of non-mined and mined host plants located at ground level and on the bare roofs of houses, we determined colonisation levels for the leaf-miner and its parasitoids respectively. Changes in leafminer abundance, parasitism rates and parasitoid species richness were also investigated.
   3. L. commelinae was able to locate host plants on rooftops, but revealed a lower rate of colonisation and abundance than on the ground. A few species of the parasitoid assemblage were associated with the leaf-miner in plants on roofs, resulting in decreasing colonisation rates, less species richness and lower parasitism. Interestingly, parasitoid species categorised as 'small' did not colonise plants on roofs.
   4. Our results provide evidence on how habitats at height influence host-parasitoid interactions in cities, representing one of the first approaches to the biological role that green roofs might have on them.

AB  - Analyzing the genetic diversity of a population can be useful in identifying some of the silent effects of habitat fragmentation. We examined and compared 4 mitochondrial loci of the near threatened Short-tailed Babbler (Pellorneum malaccense), a rainforest understory bird, between a highly fragmented population in Singapore and populations from elsewhere in the Sundaic region. We found that the fragmented Singaporean population is genetically impoverished, with <20% of the intrapopulation genetic diversity present in a comparable sample from Borneo within intact forest. Differences in haplotype diversity among Singaporean sites of occurrence suggest that there may be extremely poor genetic diversity and connectivity among Singaporean subpopulations. These findings highlight the importance of connectivity in maintaining population genetic diversity in urban tropical forest patches. Our results also corroborate previous findings that there are 3 deeply diverged lineages of Short-tailed Babbler across the Sundaic region.

AB  - Urbanization is a primary driver of landscape conversion, with far-reaching effects on landscape pattern and process, particularly related to the population characteristics of animals. Urbanization can alter animal movement and habitat quality, both of which can influence population abundance and persistence. We evaluated three important population characteristics (population density, site occupancy, and species detection probability) of a medium-sized and a large carnivore across varying levels of urbanization. Specifically, we studied bobcat and puma populations across wildland, exurban development, and wildland-urban interface (WUI) sampling grids to test hypotheses evaluating how urbanization affects wild felid populations and their prey. Exurban development appeared to have a greater impact on felid populations than did habitat adjacent to a major urban area (i.e., WUI); estimates of population density for both bobcats and pumas were lower in areas of exurban development compared to wildland areas, whereas population density was similar between WUI and wildland habitat. Bobcats and pumas were less likely to be detected in habitat as the amount of human disturbance associated with residential development increased at a site, which was potentially related to reduced habitat quality resulting from urbanization. However, occupancy of both felids was similar between grids in both study areas, indicating that this population metric was less sensitive than density. At the scale of the sampling grid, detection probability for bobcats in urbanized habitat was greater than in wildland areas, potentially due to restrictive movement corridors and funneling of animal movements in landscapes influenced by urbanization. Occupancy of important felid prey (cottontail rabbits and mule deer) was similar across levels of urbanization, although elk occupancy was lower in urbanized areas. Our study indicates that the conservation of medium-and large-sized felids associated with urbanization likely will be most successful if large areas of wildland habitat are maintained, even in close proximity to urban areas, and wildland habitat is not converted to low-density residential development.

AB  - Urban environments generally have reduced biodiversity, nevertheless they may contribute to biodiversity conservation. The presence of epiphytes on urban trees indicates viability of urban areas as repositories of biodiversity; however the influence of biophysical and local habitat variables on the occurrence and diversity of epiphytes on urban trees has not been studied. Epiphytes were surveyed on 1170 roadside Albizia saman trees along 39 roads in the tropical city-state of Singapore. Eighty-seven percent of trees were host to at least one epiphyte species. A total of 51 epiphyte species were encountered, 33 of which were native and represented one-third of Singapore's 113 extant native epiphyte species. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that at the tree level, DBH, fork structure (branch multiplicity), and distance of the host tree from nearest forest patch were associated with epiphyte richness, whereas at the road level, surrounding habitat type, fork structure, and average tree height were associated with epiphyte diversity (Simpson's reciprocal index [1/lambda]). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the presence of a species was often influenced by a single factor rather than multiple factors, e.g. distance to forest, host tree trunk diameter or height, or host tree branching complexity. This study suggests that an understanding of native epiphytes' dispersal syndrome, the preservation of forest remnants, and protection of trees-especially large and tall trees exhibiting complex architecture-are crucial for epiphyte conservation in highly urbanized environments.

AB  - Green spaces not only provide natural environments in urban areas in various forms and sizes, and with differing functions, but also they contribute to the physical and psychological health and socialisation of citizens. Sheffield is the third largest municipality in the UK and is widely regarded as one of the greenest cities in the UK. Therefore, it is important to determine the spatial structure and character of different land use types, and particularly green spaces, in Sheffield. FRAGSTATS class level metrics are used as a basis for quantifying the spatial structure of different land uses (11 classes) and green spaces (8 subclasses of recreation and leisure). The results revealed that the recreation and leisure is the main land use type in Sheffield (47.44%); while urban fabric land uses occupy only 13.97% of the total landscape. Recreation and leisure show a high structural continuity and dense clusters of patches. Countryside/urban fringe and, natural and semi-natural green spaces are the dominant land use types under recreation and leisure. Consequently, the results of this study suggest that countryside/urban fringe and natural and semi-natural green spaces would make a crucial contribution to a potential green network for both people and biodiversity in Sheffield.

AB  - In recent decades, theories of landscape ecology have offered new perspectives toward planning and landscape design. Development of ecological network concept is one of the findings of this topic. In general, the ecologists and designers use landscape ecology concepts to apply a developed spatial strategy to different urban areas. In order to analyze urban ecological conditions and networks, landscape metrics have been used widely by ecologists. Landscape metric also have been used in order to judge the heterogeneity of urban greenbelts, to construct a sustainable landscape plan, to assess and provide biodiversity conservation planning, to describe landscape patterns for agro-ecosystems and to quantify the changes in forest cover patterns. In addition, the current study also tried to has looked into the urban ecological network of Tabriz city in urban scale in order to provide rehabilitation of urban ecological network of Tabriz city. The city of Tabriz is one of the main industrial cities in Iran with a population of over one and a half million people (Fig. 1). Tabriz with cold winters and temperate summers is located in a valley to the north of the long ridge of the volcanic cone of Sahand. In this study, satellite images of Landsat with ETM instrument of 2002 are used to study the elements of ecologic network. To secure the results, land use maps at the scale of 1: 2000 were also used. Meanwhile, in order to perceive and identify the structure of ecological network and its basic components, we essentially elicited the natural and artificial information-based layers such as the hydrological maps, green spaces and transportation network for verifying the natural and artificial patches and corridors. In such a way, we can best examine the ecological network of Tabriz city based on the basic elements of the patch, corridor and matrix. Thus, it is essential to analyze the ecological network through superimposing these layers and studying them based on landscape metrics (McGarigal et al. 2002) which includes MPS (Mean Patch Size), NP (Number of patches) and MNN (Mean Nearest Neighbor). The said metrics having been matched with the selective model (mosaic model) to study the network structures effectively. These metrics are analyzed using Arc GIS. By measuring the Mean Patch Size, large natural patches for conservation were identified. Number of patches indicates the level of fragmentation and the Mean Nearest Neighbor shows the level of isolation and fragmentation of patches. To map these metrics, a combined network of 100-ha hexagonal polygons is used. So the ecological network of the city was zoned and geographical data for each zone was defined. Size of hexagonal polygons was chosen based on the aim of this paper and quality and accuracy of data. Using hexagonal polygons helps optimal coverage of the whole city. With summarizing the features of Tabriz ecologic network, some zones can be identified in the study area. Then the functional approaches will be introduced based on landscape ecological approaches and the purposes assigned for creating ecological networks in urban scale. In this way, the protection and restoration of ecological connection in a system including the core areas, buffer-zones and the biological alternative connections are considered the main objectives of creating ecological networks. Such connection can also be helpful in providing social, cultural and aesthetic functions in urban environments (Bonnin et al. 2007).
   Some of the important ecological functions of such a network are providing a suitable habitat for the urban wildlife, built corridors to move and transport the species, food and wind and even creating some blocks for some transportation which consequently lead to a protected biodiversity (Ahern 2007). To reach the above mentioned objectives, the following approaches have to be considered:
   Increasing the consistency in urban ecological network through developing, distributing and promoting the quality of corridors;
   Maintaining the remnant patches and rehabilitating the spoiled natural patches to develop the balanced distribution in network level;
   Increasing the artificial green patches to create and maintain their balanced distribution; Increasing the size of patches or building large green patches to make a balanced distribution of large green patches. In general, some solutions can be suggested for each of ecologic zones defined by analysis of study area. In the first zone patches are few and small and the situation is adverse. Density of buildings and population is high in this area. So ecological rehabilitation in this zone is difficult and expensive and it is not possible in short-term. Therefore it is suggested to have a long-term plan for conversion of existing land use to green space. The second zone where patches are smaller and less coherent, conservation of green patches and their integrity is suggested. In the third zone because the patches are small and near each other, conservation value is higher. So conservation of this zone is in a high priority.

AB  - Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.

AB  - Populations in fragmented urban remnants may be at risk of genetic erosion as a result of reduced gene flow and elevated levels of inbreeding. This may have serious genetic implications for the long-term viability of remnant populations, in addition to the more immediate pressures caused by urbanisation. The population genetic structure of the generalist skink Ctenotus fallens was examined using nine microsatellite markers within and among natural vegetation remnants within a highly fragmented urban matrix in the Perth metropolitan area in Western Australia. These data were compared with samples from a large unfragmented site on the edge of the urban area. Overall, estimates of genetic diversity and inbreeding within all populations were similar and low. Weak genetic differentiation, and a significant association between geographic and genetic distance, suggests historically strong genetic connectivity that decreases with geographic distance. Due to recent fragmentation, and genetic inertia associated with low genetic diversity and large population sizes, it is not possible from these data to infer current genetic connectivity levels. However, the historically high levels of gene flow that our data suggest indicate that a reduction in contemporary connectivity due to fragmentation in C. fallens is likely to result in negative genetic consequences in the longer term.

AB  - Low Impact Development (LID) is a strategically sound approach to mitigate stormwater pollution and restore landscape hydrology in urbanized watersheds. Since it promotes preserving and enhancing vegetation, open spaces, and soil integrity to mimic natural processes, it provides a myriad of benefits including flood control, habitat protection, climate change mitigation and adaptation, greater livability, greater social connectivity, energy savings, smog reduction, enhanced community aesthetics, and many other ecosystem services. A great number of LID tools are available such as green roofs, raingardens, tree planters, bio swales, which are efficient, simple, and cost effective. Some pioneer cities are successfully implementing this technology in development and redevelopment projects. However, a wide spread adoption has not occurred.
   This paper explores the barriers prevailing in the U.S. cities, with a focus on legal and policy aspects. The analysis will focus on the city codes, ordinances, regulations, and other legal and policy documents related to stormwater and other land development activities of select cities. Finally a policy framework conducive to LID implementation will be presented.

AB  - Urbanisation often has profound impacts on ecological processes. Management of these impacts is central to urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had little influence on weaver movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i.e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To alter the sharply decreasing trend of biodiversity due to human disturbances, much emphasis has been placed on the ecological networks comprised of core areas with high ecological significance and corridors connecting them. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel viewpoint and method to identify, analyze and optimize the ecological network of Wuyishan City. The bidirectional least-cost distance model is applied to identify the landscape network in Wuyishan City for the year 1995 and 2005, which can incorportate digraph in ecological network modeling, overcome the limitation of failing to reflect the orientation of the species' dispersal process, and make the process of modeling more convincing by distinguishing flux orientation of "go" and "return" of two random patches. Three new metrics, i.e., network cyclicity, degree of cyclicity, and degree of connectedness, which can quantify the integrity and continuity of network and the relation between network organization and ecological process, are introduced to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and reflect the network's ability to transfer bio-flux. The results show that the ecological network of Wuyishan City in the year 1995 and 2005 have respectively a network size of 18 and 17, degree of connectedness of 1 and 0.7647, network cyclicity of 7.1378 and 8.2570, and degree of cyclicity of 0.3965 and 0.4857, which indicate that the network in Wuyishan City for the year 2005 has strong ability to transfer bio-flux, a high level of eco-process diversity, and a low level of integrity and continuity. It can be concluded that during the past 10 years, different areas of Wuyishan City have gone through landscape degradation and restoration. In the northeast, network components degraded severely and made several patches "isolated islands", while in the southwest, the network has been developed because of landscape restoration. In particular, the linkages among the patches of natural reserve and its neighborhood increased remarkably, which directly increased the interaction strength and the whole network cyclicity. Then, via scenario analysis, we also identify the patches and linkages that make great contributions to the entire cyclicity and connectedness, such as patches [1,2,3,4,5,6] (Nature reserve and its neighborhood), [12] (bridging the north and west part) and [19] (bridging the south and west part), and linkages among the central patches.

AB  - Facing increasing human demands on Earth, understanding how endangered species may survive in isolated remnants of natural habitat within heavily transformed landscapes is key to contemporary conservation biology. Against this background we here investigate the factors affecting pond occupancy in the endangered European tree frog (Hyla arborea L.) within an urban landscape, being located in north-eastern Germany where the species is still fairly common. Our survey revealed that 58 out of 122 ponds were occupied by H. arborea. Ponds with a higher percentage of floating vegetation, being deeper and surrounded by higher percentages of crop fields and forests were more likely to be occupied, while factors associated with urbanization such as the percentage of built-up area were strongly detrimental. Habitat requirements of H. arborea were complex as occurrence was simultaneously affected by different spatial scales, including the landscape scale, the immediate surroundings of ponds and the ponds themselves. H. arborea avoided highly urbanized areas, but occurred frequently in agricultural areas surrounding the city. The latter suggests that this species is fairly tolerant towards human-induced transformations, and that vast arable fields yielded positive rather than negative effects on H. arborea occurrence. We conclude that the most important conservation issues for supporting H. arborea populations at the periphery of urbanized areas are (1) maintaining an open (agricultural) landscape structure, (2) providing undisturbed overwintering habitats, and (3) maintaining pond quality by halting shrub and tree encroachment.

AB  - Knowledge of habitat use by animals within urban-riparian corridors during the breeding season is important for conservation, yet remains understudied. We examined the bird community along an urban-riparian corridor through metropolitan Boise, Idaho and predicted that occupancy of individual species and species richness would be greater in forested areas than in urbanized areas. We surveyed birds throughout the summers of 2009 and 2010 and quantified the m(2) of each cover-type within 50-m, 100-m, and 200-m buffers surrounding each survey location using satellite imagery. Occupancy modeling revealed that eight of 14 species analyzed were positively associated with riparian forest, and no species avoided forest. Species richness was negatively associated with the amount of paved surface within 100 m of a survey site with richness declining by more than two species for every hectare of paved surface. Most associations with cover-types - especially riparian forest-were at >= 100 m. Therefore, the riparian forest within 100 m of a given site along an urban-riparian corridor should be the most important for maintaining species richness. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Urban riparian plant communities exist at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and they are rich sources of species biodiversity and ecosystem services. The periodic floods that promote species diversity in riparian plant communities also increase their vulnerability to nonnative plant invasions. Plant invasions are constrained by seed and suitable habitat availability. However, how seed dispersal and establishment limitations interact to shape nonnative plant invasions in riparian communities is poorly understood. We use Stream Visual Assessment Protocol data to evaluate the hydrological and geomorphological parameters that influence the seeding and establishment of six common nonnative species in urban riparian habitats: garlic mustard, purple loosestrife, reed canarygrass, common reed, Japanese knotweed, and multiflora rose. To address this objective, we analyzed stream reach data collected during a basin-wide environmental assessment of the extensively urbanized upper Niagara River watershed. We found limited support for our prediction that propagule limitation constrains the distribution of nonnative riparian species, likely because these species are well established in the study area. Instead, we found that opportune stream reach characteristics better predict the distribution of the common invasive riparian species-most notably open tree canopy. Given that there is widespread investment in urban riparian forest restoration to improve water quality, increase stream-bank stability, enhance wildlife habitat and promote recreation, our data suggest that riparian forests may provide the additional benefit of reducing the abundance of some, but not all, invasive plants.

AB  - Conversion of terrestrial land for the purposes of agriculture and urban development continues to result in loss and fragmentation of natural habitats. In this study, we focus on butterflies and investigate the relative importance of landscape-level habitat amount (the proportion of woodland area within a landscape), habitat fragmentation (length of woodland edges within a landscape), urbanization (the proportion of urban area within a landscape), and local host plant diversity for butterfly communities in a fragmented landscape in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Butterfly species observed in the field were grouped into woodland and open-land species. The results showed that both landscape and local factors shape the butterfly community. At a landscape-scale, woodland butterflies positively responded to woodland area and negatively to edge density, whereas open-land butterflies showed opposite responses. At a local-scale, positive influences of local host plant diversity on woodland butterflies were evident, but not for open-land species. These results suggest that negative influences of anthropogenic land-use changes on biodiversity could be mitigated by strategies aimed at stopping the spread of woodland edges and providing a wide variety of different host plant species in the landscape. Unfortunately, this study implies that further increases in habitat loss and fragmentation and decline in host plant diversity lead to a homogenization of local biological communities and functions.

AB  - As part of the Global Urban Soil Ecology and Education Network and to test the urban ecosystem convergence hypothesis, we report on soil pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) measured in four soil habitat types (turfgrass, ruderal, remnant, and reference) in five metropolitan areas (Baltimore, Budapest, Helsinki, Lahti, Potchefstroom) across four biomes. We expected the urban soil characteristics to "converge" in comparison to the reference soils. Moreover, we expected cities in biomes with more limiting climatic conditions, or where local factors strongly affect soil characteristics, would exhibit the greatest variance across soil types within and among cities. In addition, soil characteristics related to biogenic factors (OC, TN) would vary the most because of differences in climate and human efforts to overcome limiting environmental conditions. The comparison of soils among and within the five cities suggests that anthropogenic, and to a lesser degree native, factors interact in the development of soils in urban landscapes. In particular, characteristics affected by anthropogenic processes and closely associated with biogenic processes (OC, TN) converged, while characteristics closely associated with parent material (K, P) did not converge, but rather diverged, across all soil habitat types. These results partially supported the urban ecosystem convergence hypothesis in that a convergence occurred for soil characteristics affected by climatic conditions. However, the divergence of K and P was unexpected and warrants adjusting the hypothesis to account for variations in anthropogenic effects (e.g., management) that may occur within soil habitat types impacted by humans.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest suffered five centuries of continuous deforestation related to successive economic cycles, and is now reduced to 11.7 % of its original cover. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact was launched in 2009 and aims to restore 15 million hectares until 2050. Natural regeneration can play an important role in meeting this target, however little attention has been paid to this process and there is a gap in the knowledge about its driving factors at the landscape scale. We mapped forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil, in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36 years, forest cover increased 3,020 hectares (15.3 %), related to the decreasing of both rural population (R-2 = 0.9794, p = 0.0013) and cropland cover (R-2 = 0.8679, p = 0.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position, slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same area would have meant a total expense of U$ 15.1 million (U$ 419 k/year). We show here that spontaneous regeneration must be accounted for and incorporated into the spatial planning of Atlantic Forest restoration.

AB  - How increasing urbanization affects biodiversity is one of the most understudied aspects of global change biology. It is, however, known that it may negatively affect plant population genetic diversity in numerous ways, for example through its negative effects on plant population size, between-population connectivity, and reproductive success. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent different levels of urbanization result in these negative phenomena. Here we used microsatellite markers to investigate urbanization effects on the population genetic structure of 23 populations of the self-incompatible, partially clonal herb Linaria vulgaris which were sampled across a gradient of urbanization. Clonal diversity as measured by the Pareto-parameter varied between 1.11 and 2.97 and was negatively correlated to both the degree of urbanization and to population size. Urbanization and population size were not interrelated. The least clonally rich populations also experienced significantly reduced seed set. Irrespective of the degree of urbanization, L. vulgaris populations exhibited strong genetic differentiation (F-ST=0.33) and there was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting low gene flow among populations. In conclusion, we showed that urbanization negatively affected fitness of L. vulgaris populations through decreasing their clonal diversity and reproductive success, an effect that may be exacerbated by the low gene flow between populations. Although the effect was modest, the results could probably be extrapolated to bigger cities where it would be considerably more pronounced.

AB  - Seed predalion and dispersal can have strong, albeit opposing effects on plant communities and their extent depends on interactions between seeds and their vectors (abiotic factors or different animal taxa). We assume that vectors, due to their specific requirements, act at different spatial scales and seed-vector interactions might differ greatly between landscapes. So far, it remains largely unclear, how the interaction between seeds and their vectors affects the degree of seed predation and dispersal in novel anthropogenic landscapes. We expect changes in patterns either at the landscape scale (urban vs rural areas), habitat scale (habitat heterogeneity) or microhabitat scale (vegetation variability).
   We assessed seed predation and dispersal of two seed species by rodents, earthworms, other invertebrates and rain in cafeteria experiments in urban gardens and rural field margins and implemented generalized mixed effect models to test the effect of spatial scales and other environmental variables.
   Seed predation and dispersal were generally low and similar patterns emerged when he same vector facilitated the function. Overall, predation and dispersal were similar in urban and rural areas but when differentiating between vectors, scale effects were 'dent. Seed predation by rodents and earthworms was affected at the landscape scale, seed predation by other invertebrates increased with higher habitat heterogeneity and seed dispersal by rain was negatively affected at the microhabitat scale through increased plant cover.
   We show that one vector can facilitate the contrasting two functions, seed predation and dispersal, simultaneously, resulting in similar patterns at a specific spatial scale however, different vectors might lead to contrasting patterns for the same function, depending on the spatial scale. This needs to be considered especially in anthropogenic areas, where ecosystem management decisions are also made at different spatial scales from private garden owners to landscape planning committees.

AB  - Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews held with key actors involved in the planning of the Greater Montreal region, we seek to understand the conditions that could lead to the establishment of a green infrastructure for the city. This article first describes the region's environmental and political context and then analyzes the opportunities, constraints, advantages and disadvantages in the implementation of this type of project. We conclude that experts favor an approach leading to ecological connectivity, but they underline several obstacles that could hinder its implementation.

AB  - In urban and other built environments, management decisions serve as a prominent feedback between biodiversity patterns and human-controlled environmental variables. In this study, we used the metacommunity concept to assess the mechanisms that link zooplankton biodiversity to different management regimes in urban water bodies associated with the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research site (USA). In the summer of 2011, we sampled zooplankton in 21 ponds built for stormwater management. Ponds were classified as either unmanaged (n=9) or actively managed (n=12) for recreation and aesthetic value, where managed ponds received multiple chemical and algaecide applications to improve water clarity. We found managed ponds had higher local (alpha) diversity and lower spatial turnover in community composition (beta-diversity), and thus greater biotic homogenization than ponds that were unmanaged. We developed a lottery-based metacommunity simulation (MCSim) to assess how niche and dispersal dynamics could create the observed biodiversity patterns, and to assess whether biotic homogenization was related to management. A comparison of empirical and simulated diversity patterns suggests the zooplankton pond metacommunity was influenced by both dispersal and niche-based community assembly dynamics. Simulations showed that the observed biotic homogenization effect was expected based on the spatially aggregated distribution of managed ponds, but pond management was not likely exacerbating biotic homogenization in this system. Such insight is essential to understand how environmental management can affect biodiversity at local and regional scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ecological impact of roads and traffic is now widely acknowledged, with a variety of mitigation strategies such as purpose designed fauna underpasses and overpasses commonly installed to facilitate animal movement. Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road.

AB  - Identifying, promoting and preserving a strategically planned green infrastructure (GI) network can provide ecological, economic and social benefits. It has also become a priority for the planning and decision-making process in sectors such as conservation, (land) resource efficiency, agriculture, forestry or urban development.
   In this paper we propose a methodology that can be used to identify and map GI elements at landscape level based on the notions of ecological connectivity, multi-functionality of ecosystems and maximisation of benefits both for humans and for natural conservation. Our approach implies, first, the quantification and mapping of the natural capacity to deliver ecosystem services and, secondly, the identification of core habitats and wildlife corridors for biota. All this information is integrated and finally classified in a two-level GI network.
   The methodology is replicable and flexible (it can be tailored to the objectives and priorities of the practitioners); and it can be used at different spatial scales for research, planning or policy implementation. The method is applied in a continental scale analysis covering the EU-27 territory, taking into account the delivery of eight regulating and maintenance ecosystem services and the requirements of large mammals' populations. The best performing areas for ecosystem services and/or natural habitat provision cover 23% of Europe and are classified as the core GI network. Another 16% of the study area with relatively good ecological performance is classified as the subsidiary GI network. There are large differences in the coverage of the Cl network among countries ranging from 73% of the territory in Estonia to 6% in Cyprus. A potential application of these results is the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, assuming that the core GI network might be crucial to maintain biodiversity and natural capital and, thus, should be conserved; while the subsidiary network could be restored to increase both the ecological and social resilience. This kind of GI analysis could be also included in the negotiations of the European Regional Development Funds or the Rural Development Programmes. 0 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With economic growth and the improvement of the urbanization level, human activities have constantly interfered with landscape patterns, resulting in serious threats to regional ecological security. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the evolution and optimization of the landscape patterns. Based on three TM images from 1990, 2000, and 2010, and selected landscape pattern indexes, the changes in the landscape pattern of Nanjing in the past twenty years were studied based on landscape ecology theory using Remote Sensing (RS) and a Geographical Information System (GIS). The ecological network was built on the basis of extracted ecological nodes and the minimum cumulative resistance. The results show that changes in the landscape pattern of the city of Nanjing were notable. Class-level indexes indicate that the farmland landscape area decreased and the degree of patch fragmentation increased. The construction land area increased, and it tended to show dispersed distribution. The proportion of forest land increased and the shape of patches became more complex. The proportion of water firstly showed a decrease, followed by an increase, and the shape of the water became more regular. Landscape-level indexes indicate that biological diversity and the degree of fragmentation increased. Spatial heterogeneity of the natural landscape increased, and the patch shape of each landscape type developed similarly. The results also call for stepping-stones to enhance the connectivity and optimization of the ecological network, which will help improve ecological services and improve the landscape pattern of the city.

AB  - Characteristics of land use and land use diversity play an integral part in determining how a city develops, and also can influence the allocation of funds for urban redevelopment, crime prevention, and civic and transportation projects. With the rise of the sustainability movement and concern about environmental degradation, more cities are interested in optimizing transportation routes and utilizing their budgets to accommodate high-priority projects that benefit the most people. This paper develops a method for measuring land use diversity for Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and explores the relationship between land use diversity and a suite of demographic variables. To accomplish this, a land use diversity index (LUDI) was developed to examine spatial patterns in diversity of land use. The analysis shows that areas with a higher LUDI are near interstates and main corridors while areas with a lower LUDI are located closer to where newer residential areas have been developed. A multivariate statistical approach was then used to identify those variables that might explain the specific spatial patterns of the LUDI in Oklahoma City. The results identify the relationship between the demographic variables and land use across the city, and illustrate the most interesting and significant spatial patterns. By coupling the land use diversity index and demographic data, Oklahoma City planners can apply the information to help make important decisions for the city, and it will provide quantifiable data to support their decisions.

AB  - In the last decades, due to the population increase and the relative need of new land to cultivate, expand urban centers and develop transportation networks, most of the Italian natural protected areas are subject to different typologies of human pressures that generally cause habitat fragmentation. This process represents a major concern for biodiversity conservation and a key driver of species loss.
   The main purpose of this paper was to investigate levels of natural habitat fragmentation due to roads and railways networks in the Italian National Parks (INPs) through the use of an Infrastructural Fragmentation Index (IFI).
   All the operations (geospatial analysis, image classification, and fragmentation analysis) were performed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) software for elaborating a national database. The obtained results include an IFI value for each natural territorial unit inside any INP. Moreover, in order to highlight which are the INPs characterized by higher infrastructural fragmentations, an IFI weighted mean was calculated for each INP. These results represent important indicators for the prioritization of,biodiversity conservation interventions and the planning of a INPs sustainable management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Scarce Copper (Lycaena virgaureae) is a species that has suffered serious decline in several European countries. In Scandinavia it is still comparatively abundant, but with ongoing losses of flower-rich grasslands near forests further decline is expected. A mark-release-recapture study was carried out in July 2013 at 14 sites on the outskirts of a village located near Malmo, Sweden. The study area comprised in total an 11.4 ha network of abandoned agricultural sites, road verges and forest edges. A private garden was also included. Butterflies were marked individually and the capture position was recorded by GPS. Sex, behaviour and flower visits were also recorded. During the study 852 butterflies were marked and 170 of these were recaptured at least once (recapture rate 20 %), resulting in 1,078 captures (including multiple recaptures). Movement between patches accounted for 41 % of all recaptures and mean distance between recaptures was 112 +/- A 146 m (n = 226). The number of captures was strongly positively correlated with patch size (rho = 0.95, p < 0.05), while the emigrant and immigrant fractions were significantly negatively correlated with patch size. Overall, the Scarce Copper was surprisingly abundant in the area, but planned construction of residential areas will result in the loss of most habitat patches.

AB  - This article expands on the quotidian perspectives of ordinary cities' and everyday resistance' and explores the migrant urbanisms that emerge out of movement, mixing and exchange. The article argues for a shift beyond a focus on encounter across racial and ethnic difference, to engage with whether everyday social practice can effectively contaminate political practice. The question is raised within the understanding that everyday life is rooted in inequality, and extends to an analysis of migrant participation in city life as creative expression and everyday resistance. Against a pernicious migrancy problematic in the UK that defines migration as an external force assaulted on national integrity from the outside, I explore migrant urbanisms as participatory practices of reconfiguration within ordinary cities, where diversity and innovation intersect. At the core of this exploration is how migrants are active in the making of urban space and urban politics.

AB  - Stream networks are vulnerable to fragmentation. Anthropogenic structures, such as dams and culverts, can isolate stream branches, potentially interrupting longitudinal gradients of fish distribution. The effect of single barriers is well documented, but the effect of multiple barriers in small streams is not as well characterized. We used a landscape approach and spatially continuous sampling across 2 y to examine the influence of anthropogenic structures on fish distributions in an urban stream network. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation, we found higher Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) and lower Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) densities at locations up-than downstream of multiple culverts. Culverts had species-and year-specific stepwise effects that overrode fish distribution patterns attributable to environmental gradients. Prickly Sculpin exhibited strong spatial autocorrelation in both years, whereas Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) had negligible spatial autocorrelation in one year, a result indicating that spatial structure depends on species and year. Reaches did not have consistent fish densities across years and showed high temporal variability of fish or their habitats. Spatially continuous sampling captured gradients and heterogeneity in fish distributions and highlighted how anthropogenic structures alter these gradients. Our study also revealed which culverts had the strongest influences on fish densities throughout the stream network. The study design used can inform riverscape-management approaches, which are needed to conserve stream biodiversity effectively.

AB  - Nowadays, 118 urban natural protected areas of Moscow occupy more than one-fifth of the city territory. They are mostly located in urban peripheral areas which appeared within the city borders in 1960 and 1984. Their major role is provided for recreation and sports activities of the urban dwellers along with the protection of natural landscapes. The number of visitors of the Moscow city protected areas is about 5 million people annually. The analysis of the current situation shows several problems, including insufficient availability of protected areas in particular districts of the city; poor transport access, including that for disabled persons; incompleteness of the protected areas network and their weak connection with protected areas in the Moscow suburbs; absence of the general management programmes for the forest belt of the region; space discrepancy of the urban protected areas to the world city green standards and ecotourism. The actual experience of landscape planning in the urban protected areas of Moscow reveals different methodological difficulties. One of them is the contradiction between strict protection status of some protected areas and necessity of special regimes of landscape management. For example, it is impossible to maintain areas which are suitable for recreation without tree cutting. Another one is the erroneous point of view that urban protected areas are a virgin space. In fact, the majority of Moscow city protected areas have a long history of land use/land cover changes reflected in their present-day state. Landscape reconstruction for the Moskvoretsky Park demonstrates several stages of landscape evolution during the last 150 years. On the base of that history, the plan for landscape management was elaborated. The main aim of the plan is to define the desired state of landscape depending on landscape vulnerability and capacity and human perception.

AB  - Due to increasing urbanization, wetlands and streams within city limits are being altered, filled in, and degraded. The habitat that remains is critical for providing urban areas with ecosystem services and maintaining biodiversity, yet is often insufficiently monitored by environmental agencies due to a lack of resources. To help fill this void, the Urban-Rural Biomonitoring and Assessment Network (URBAN) was developed as a citizen science education and outreach program for Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Through this program, volunteers gain insight into the dynamics of biological systems, learn how to identify species, and may experience growth personally in terms of environmental stewardship or even career path decisions. The implementation and development of URBAN followed a nine-step model developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Here, we offer an overview of URBAN's development, successes, and challenges by utilizing this citizen science model as a guideline.

AB  - Stream microhabitats are strongly influenced by adjacent terrestrial land use and other anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, sensitive stream fauna can be highly imperiled. We investigated relative susceptibility of stream-associated salamanders to riparian land use by studying species-specific responses that influence community assembly. The Piedmont and Blue Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States have high aquatic biodiversity, centuries of land use, and increasingly extensive urbanization. We surveyed low-order streams in these regions for salamanders across four riparian land uses (forests, agricultural, residential, and urban) and assessed 15 habitat variables at each sampling site. We found that forested streams were more diverse compared to streams affected by riparian land uses. Our study showed two distinct assemblages of salamanders in response to riparian land use: forest-dependent, large-bodied, long-lived species sensitive to riparian land uses (disturbance avoiders) and cosmopolitan, small-bodied, short-lived species that are relatively resistant to impacts of riparian land uses (disturbance tolerants). These assemblages varied in composition between the ecoregions, with Blue Ridge harboring more land-use-intolerant species. Results indicated that multiple habitat features of the riparian zone (canopy cover, canopy height, leaf litter cover), and stream geomorphology (bank complexity, streambed heterogeneity, sedimentation) are dramatically altered by riparian land uses, and influence the assemblage structure of salamanders. Riparian buffers in both ecoregions are largely unprotected (70% in Blue Ridge, 96% in Piedmont) and are possibly threatened with anthropocentric land uses. Results suggested that conservation of stream salamander communities should be strengthened with protection and restoration of riparian forests, connectivity among riparian forests, and soil-conservation practices.

AB  - The potential for citizens to reclaim and reappropriate the physical spaces of their city has garnered a great deal of attention over the past year or so. The Occupy movement, "Arab Spring," and various social protest movements around the world have all reinvigorated debates over the political importance of public space. These movements posit an alternate historical trajectory to the one depicted by urban theorists and sociologists over the past half-century, who lament the steady "decline" of public space. One of the most vocal critics of the detrimental effects of contemporary urban planning for the sanctity of public space and urban life is the New York-based architect, academic, and architectural critic Michael Sorkin. Sorkin is currently Distinguished Professor of Architecture and Director of the Graduate Urban Design Program at the City College of New York. He is the author of several books and hundreds of articles on buildings, cities, and urban planning and design. In this interview, Sorkin weighs into these debates over the political and social importance of public space in cities and the challenges to disempowerment and disenfranchisement in urban environments. He discusses his early influences, the ongoing importance of Jane Jacobs to urban planning, sustainable living and "the possibility of New York becoming completely self-sufficient within its political boundaries"; as well as his views on the Occupy movement and post-9/11 surveillance and paranoia.

AB  - Urban habitats differ in their disturbance regimes, which act as an environmental filter determining plant community species composition. This is why plant communities in different urban habitats provide a suitable model for studying the effects of disturbance on phylogenetic diversity. We explore how phylogenetic diversity varies across urban plant communities and whether the introduction of alien species changes the phylogenetic diversity of resident communities of native species. In 32 cities in central Europe and Benelux countries we studied seven types of habitats subject to different disturbance regimes. Plots of 1 ha were sampled in each habitat by recording all spontaneously occurring species of vascular plants. A phylogenetic tree was constructed for all recorded species and phylogenetic diversity based on phylogenetic distances was calculated for each plot. A null model corresponding to random distribution of species on the phylogenetic tree was used to test whether phylogenetic diversity is non-random. Phylogenetic diversity was compared between the subsets of native and alien species, further divided into archaeophytes and neophytes. Phylogenetic diversity of plant communities in all the urban habitats studied was lower than in the null model. It varied with the disturbance regime in all the species subsets (native species, archaeophytes and neophytes). Introduction of alien species reduced phylogenetic diversity of the urban plant communities studied. Archaeophytes (widespread and common species that had enough time to spread to all suitable habitats) tended to decrease phylogenetic diversity more strongly than neophytes (often rare species which are still spreading and depend on dispersal vectors). Low phylogenetic diversity of disturbed plant communities in urban habitats probably results from strong environmental filtering, which selects species from a limited number of lineages that have traits that enable them to survive in disturbed habitats.

AB  - Urbanization is accompanied by the intense transformation and conflicts among different land use types that produce a series of economic, social, and environmental impacts. Ascertaining the quantity and pattern optimization of urban ecological land is critical to solving urban environmental problems and realizing urban sustainable development. Using the Chinese city of Changzhou, an important and typical city in the Yangtze River delta, as the case study, we applied the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM) to calculate the amount of ecological land that meets the demand of socioeconomic development and ecological protection considerating the source of ecological land and constructed land, ecosystem services, and the resistance plane. Results showed that the suitable ecological land area is about 1006.9 km(2), which is 53.8% of the total urban area of Changzhou, and is mainly distributed in Wujin and Xinbei districts. Considering the ecological land space and functional changes of the study area and comparing the current land use status with the model simulation results, we propose three land use types. For urban ecological land, positive protection measures and prohibiting economic development initiatives are necessary. For ecotones between urban developed land and ecological land, protection should be given priority and economic development activities should be rigidly controlled. For constructed land, measurements and policies should be taken to promote reasonable development and improve land intensity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While certain US cities are still depopulating, others have experienced a reversal of aggregate out-migration patterns. Some scholars, politicians and real estate boosters celebrate this urban population influx, as it will likely increase property values and municipal tax bases; however, we know little about the social costs associated with the back-to-the-city movement. This study investigates the consequences of the back-to-the-city movement through a four-year (2009-2012) ethnographic case study of the revitalisation of Washington, DC's Shaw/U Street neighbourhood. The redevelopment of this African-American neighbourhood is associated with the city's 5.2 percent population increase, which occurred between 2000 and 2010. While affordable housing efforts help to keep a portion of long-term, low-income residents in place, political and cultural displacement is occurring as upper-income newcomers flock into this neighbourhood. This article contributes to the urban literature by highlighting that population influx, and associated neighbourhood revitalisation, can have important social implications.

AB  - This paper explores the recent resurgence of occupation-based practices across the globe, from the seizure of public space to the assembling of improvised protest camps. It re-examines the relationship between the figure of occupation and the affirmation of an alternative right to the city'. The paper develops a critical understanding of occupation as a political process that prefigures and materializes the social order which it seeks to enact. The paper highlights the constituent role of occupation as an autonomous form of urban dwelling, as a radical politics of infrastructure and as a set of relations that produce common spaces for political action.

AB  - Purpose - Proposals for changing city-nature relationships are currently dominated by geographical approaches about urban form. They arguably lack a sufficient appreciation of design issues and opportunities. The knowledge and skill sets of urban designers and architects could improve the level of debate. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This discussion evaluates two opposing radical proposals for urban growth. These and most other proposals for future human settlements can be located on a densification-dispersal axis. They are reviewed in terms of their ability to address the fundamental social and ecological prerequisites of sustainability.
   Findings - Neither model of urban form is sustainable without a new kind of built environment design that can address rapidly depleting ecological carrying capacity and social equity. Current models of urban growth in green urbanism and design fields would not adequately protect or increase the remaining natural life support system, which should be the foundation for any sustainability plan. These problems need to be resolved by design which can entertain a much broader range of sustainability criteria than formulas.
   Research limitations/implications - Given the broad subject area, there is a diversity of opinion and issues that cannot be adequately represented in a short paper. Therefore, the spotlight is placed on the far ends of this (dispersal-densification) dualism.
   Originality/value - This densification-dispersal axis can be transcended by moving from current approaches that close off future options to ones that can expand future options by increasing the public estate and ecological base: the basic prerequisites of sustainability. This is arguably possible, but only with a new design paradigm.

AB  - Worldwide, lotic ecosystems are heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbance, leading to a significant decline in freshwater biodiversity. In recent years, increasing efforts have been directed towards the restoration and revitalization of disturbed streams and rivers to reverse this trend. Although it is widely acknowledged that species dispersal is the key to the recolonization of restored streams and rivers and ultimately to their ecological recovery, dispersal often remains unaddressed in restoration ecology. In this study, we present an approach to predict larval (aquatic) and adult (terrestrial) dispersal ranges of three lotic insect species (Hydropsyche dinarica [Trichoptera], Calopteryx virgo [Odonata] and Dinocras cephalotes [Plecoptera]) within one life cycle. The actual species' distributions (presence / absence) were obtained from a total of 1,198 sites evenly distributed within the Ruhr catchment, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The predictions for aquatic and terrestrial dispersal were made for two scenarios: with and without dispersal barriers included in the predictive modelling. In-stream dispersal barriers included weirs, dams, culverts and impounded water bodies, whereas terrestrial barriers were related to the stream corridor (degraded riparian vegetation) and different forms of land use (urban land use, coniferous and deciduous or mixed forest, open land, road infrastructure). We applied a least-cost modelling approach and combined each species' life-cycle-specific dispersal capabilities and the corresponding dispersal barrier's "friction" costs in a gridbased GIS model. Among the three model species, H. dinarica was the best disperser and was predicted to be able to reach between 81 % (without barriers) and 67 % (with barriers) of all river sections in the model catchment within one life cycle. Aerial (terrestrial) dispersal was by far the most important dispersal mechanism. For validation purposes, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to identify sample sites with environmentally suitable habitats. Within these sites that are not considered constrained by habitat limitations, the comparison of actual and predicted absences revealed a better match, if barriers were included in the dispersal models. At the same time the mismatch of actual absences and predicted presences decreased. Our results suggest that dispersal models can contribute to a better assessment of the potential recolonization of rivers. Yet, the dispersal of lotic insects may be considerably overestimated if dispersal barriers remain unaddressed.

AB  - Natural habitats are lost and fragmented by urbanization globally, resulting in isolated urban remnants of low biodiversity, devoid of specialist species. This homogenization of the urban landscape can be redressed if urban biodiversity hotspots are identified and conserved. Mires have the potential of being such refuges, since they host many mire specialist species of, e.g. arthropods. Here we investigated twenty pine mires that differed in urbanization level (low, intermediate and high) in southern Finland by evaluating the responses of carabid beetle and spider species and communities to potential landscape (level of urbanization, total mire area) and local (pH of peat, vegetation cover, wood volume) drivers. Pitfall trapping was used to collect the arthropods. We showed that high levels of urbanization have a negative effect on mire arthropod biodiversity. However, urban mire community structure seems not to be very different from rural communities as urban mires are still inhabited by mire specialists. Furthermore, tree-covered parts of urbanized mires can serve as refuges for rare forest specialist species and Sphagnum mosses play an important role in supporting mire species and communities, thus Sphagnum growth should be promoted. We showed that urban mires can be considered urban biodiversity hotspots and their protection should be secured in urban development.

TI  - INTEGRATING COMPONENTS OF RESILIENT SYSTEMS INTO CULTURAL LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
T2  - CHANGE OVER TIME-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Cultural landscape managers are seeking to enhance the ability of landscapes to endure stressors, disturbances, and environmental change. The components of resilient systems-diversity, redundancy, network connectivity, modularity, and adaptability-are valuable tools to examine current landscape vulnerability and to attempt to minimize climate change impacts. These components are derived from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's "National Incident Management System'' and were recently included in the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Rebuild by Design competition brief. 1 This article discusses the resiliency components and provides examples from cultural landscapes in national parks across the country. It is intended to stimulate thought about sustainable practices and the ways in which cultural landscapes can be managed through preservation maintenance or rehabilitation treatment for greater resilience to the effects of changing climates.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is likely to have deleterious genetic consequences for plant populations. Although the genetic effects of fragmentation in plants have been investigated in various landscapes, such studies are scarce in urban landscapes where forests tend to be fragmented and have a complex internal structure.
   This study aimed to determine the factors, including patch and sub-patch level spatial factors, affecting the genetic diversity of a herbaceous species in urban fragmented forests.
   We collected 30-39 leaf samples of Viola grypoceras A. Gray var. grypoceras, a perennial herbaceous species with short-distance seed dispersal, from 12 fragmented and 12 suburban forests each at Kyoto City, Japan, and analyzed the genetic diversity of this species by developing six simple sequence repeat markers. Field survey was conducted to collect demographic and spatial data.
   There was no significant difference in allelic richness between the urban fragmented and suburban forests. However, statistical analysis revealed that the area of vegetation, distribution pattern of populations in a forest, and average distance between nearest populations affected the genetic diversity of this species in urban fragmented forests.
   Although V. grypoceras has traits that allow it to tolerate fragmentation, such as self-pollination and seed bank-formation ability, pure loss of habitat and reduced fragment size might have deleterious effects on this species, and these effects might become more apparent if fragmentation continues to proceed in the future.

AB  - The Mediterranean region is both a global biodiversity hot spot and one of the biomes most strongly affected by human activities. Ecologists and land managers are increasingly required to advise on threats to biodiversity under foreseeable climate change. We used expert surveys to evaluate current understanding and uncertainties regarding climate change impacts on biodiversity in terrestrial, inland freshwater, and marine ecosystems of Israel. Finally, we propose a response strategy toward minimizing these changes. The surveys and the published literature indicated that the main climate change impacts in Israel include ongoing deterioration of freshwater habitats, decline of shrubland and woodland areas, and increased frequency and severity of forest fires. For the Mediterranean Sea, the surveys predict further introduction and establishment of invasive species from the Red Sea, accelerated erosion of coastal rocky habitat, and collapse of coastal rocky platforms. In the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, corals may be resilient to foreseen climate change due to their high tolerance for rising water temperatures. Despite these predictions, science-based knowledge regarding the contribution of management toward minimizing climate change impacts on biodiversity is still lacking. Habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation are presently the primary and immediate threats to natural ecosystems in Israel. Protection of natural ecosystems, including local refugia, must be intensified to maintain existing biodiversity under pressure from mounting urban development and climate change. This protection policy should include ecological corridors to minimize the consequences of fragmentation of existing natural habitats for species survival. A longer-term strategy should mandate connectivity across environmental and climatic gradients to maintain natural resilience by allowing reorganization of natural ecosystems facing climate change.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the physical and chemical properties of different human-mediated ecosystems (urban, peri-urban/industrial and agricultural including forested areas as a control) and to evaluate their effects on the taxonomic and functional trait composition and microhabitat preferences of collembolan communities. Soils impacted by different types of land management were sampled in urban and surrounding areas of Naples, Italy. The physical and chemical properties of the soil were measured, and the species distribution, functional traits and microhabitat preferences of its collembolan community were characterized. The results indicated that different types of human activities markedly affect the abiotic properties of soils. We found that agricultural soils were more altered than forest soils, and that collembolan communities in agricultural soil were dominated by few species (mainly Proisotoma minuta and Entomobrya multifasciata), and that these species showed adaptations to open or disturbed environments. Instead, the collembolan communities in urban soils were comparable to those observed in forest soils. It appears that agricultural activities have a greater effect on the taxonomy and functional traits of collembolan communities than urban impact has. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - This paper presents a review of city logistics (also known as urban freight transportation) modelling efforts reported in the literature for urban freight analysis. The review is based on an extensive search of the academic literature. We position the contributions in a framework that takes into account the diversity and complexity found in the present-day city logistics practice. The framework covers the fundamental aspects in the modelling selection process, including: (1) the stakeholders involved in the model, (2) the defining criteria, that is the descriptor for modelling purpose, (3) the objective of the model and (4) the solution approach implemented for achieving the objective. In our discussion and overview, we take these situational factors as the starting point for categorizing and evaluating the city logistics modelling literature. The review analyses the trends of city logistics modelling research in terms of its relevance to city logistics problems and attempts to identify missing links in modelling the urban freight domain.

AB  - Squatters occupy and restore empty buildings to establish self-managed social centres, where they put in practice alternative ways of living while engaging in various protest campaigns. Episodes of squatters' activism have occurred in many European cities, including the occupy' movement and the demonstrations against austerity measures in several countries. Despite this trajectory, there is little comparative research on squatters' movements. This article addresses this gap by examining the determinants of the strength of squatters' movements in Western Europe using an original dataset of 61 cities (2001-2007). Employing logistic regression analysis, this article investigates the influence of factors that have not been previously examined in a comparative framework. The study shows that large leftist communities provide crucial resources for the squatters' movement, while prominent extreme right parties polarize the local society, triggering squatters' activism. Moreover, it demonstrates that larger cities are related to stronger movements and discusses the mechanisms that explain this association. Finally, this article shows that youth unemployment impinges on stronger movements when it interacts with other variables, but overall higher levels of youth unemployment are related to stronger movements. Therefore, resources, polarization and the structural configuration of the city are important determinants of the differential strength of this movement across locations.

AB  - Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) act as reservoirs of many zoonotic diseases and are highly adept at persisting in urbanized landscapes in high densities. A better understanding of the interaction between skunks and the urban environment can aid in the development of management approaches to disease outbreaks, as well as provide information on wildlife responses to urbanization-induced habitat fragmentation. We studied the genetic structure of a population of striped skunks in an urban environment, assessing the presence of subpopulation structuring, sex-biased philopatry, and natal habitat-biased dispersal. Analysis of microsatellite data failed to detect any significant population clustering or evidence of natal habitat-biased dispersal, but spatial autocorrelation analyses did reveal patterns of limited dispersal (<2 km) and suggest female-biased philopatry. Our results suggest that urban habitats provide few barriers to gene flow in striped skunks.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion is a serious issue in estuarine deltas all over the world due to rapid urban sprawl and water shortage. Therefore, detecting the major flow paths or locations at risk of saltwater intrusion in estuarine ecosystems is important for mitigating saltwater intrusion. In this paper, we introduce a centrality index, the betweenness centrality (BC), to address this problem. Using the BC as the weighted attribute of the river network, we identify the critical confluences for saltwater intrusion and detect the preferential flow paths for saltwater intrusion through the least-cost-path algorithm from a graph theory approach. Moreover, we analyse the responses of the BC values of confluences calculated in the river network to salinity. Our results show that the major flow paths and critical confluences for saltwater intrusion in a deltaic river network can be represented by the least cost paths and the BC values of confluences, respectively. In addition, a significant positive correlation between the BC values of confluences and salinity is determined in the Pearl River Delta. Changes in the salinity can produce significant variation in the BC values of confluences. Therefore, freshwater can be diverted into these major flow paths and critical confluences to improve river network management under saltwater intrusion. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A major conservation objective of wildlife overpasses is to maintain levels of dispersal between fragmented areas of habitat, thereby allowing gene-flow and sustaining population viability of target species. We documented crossing rates of a range of avian species, of four defined species guilds, over a vegetated 15 m wide wildlife overpass in suburban Brisbane, south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The overpass spanned a 60 m wide major arterial road, and linked two areas of isolated sub-tropical eucalyptus forest. Crossing rates of these species guilds were also determined over the major road, and two other high-traffic roads, 20 and 90 m wide respectively.
   Species guilds differed markedly in their crossing rates of the overpass, and in their method of crossing. They also differed in their relative ability to cross high-traffic roads of different width. Our results indicate that, although honeyeater and large forest insectivore guilds made extensive use of the wildlife overpass as a foraging resource and as a conduit between forest areas, the conservation value of wildlife overpasses in relation to potential gene-flow lies mainly with the small insectivore species guild, predominantly with forest-dwelling species of lower bodyweight and with flight characteristics not well-suited to sustained direct flight. Differences between species within this guild may be linked to a range of inter-related factors, including flight capacity, habitat use, and evolutionary history.
   Overpasses specifically for birds have rarely, if ever, been constructed. It would, however, be relatively simple to incorporate narrow, linear strips of appropriate vegetation strata into multi-purpose overpasses to benefit these target species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Incidence Function Model (IFM) has been put forward as a tool for assessing conservation plans. A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species-area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent events have demonstrated that revolutionary movements continue to play an important role in shaping local, national, and international politics. This paper theorizes the spatial practice of revolutionary movements through three case studies: Tehran during the 2009 Green Movement, Prague during the 1989 Velvet Revolution, and Paris during the 1968 student protests. Urban space provides the primary location of movement mobilization. Furthermore, urban mobilization activates the memory of past struggles and prior political events, and movements use these political memories to connect with an urban population and to justify the challenge to state power. Secondary spaces, defined as important civic or cultural spaces within the city, potentially contribute leadership and organization toward the goal of revolutionary transformation. This paper demonstrates that movements that are able to formally organize within secondary spaces, instead of relying only on a tactic of urban occupation, defined as sustained mobilization within central streets and plazas, will be more successful in orchestrating political transition.

AB  - Despite aspirations to halt biodiversity loss by 2020 under the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, urban development continues to negatively impact UK wildlife and habitats. Reasons behind continued biodiversity decline are examined through the use of semi-structured interviews with ecologists, statutory regulators and land developers. It is found that despite strict legislation and best practice, for both planning and ecology, there is still much room for subjectivity regarding the protection of specific ecological features and the implementation of the mitigation hierarchy. Interviews also revealed that such subjectivity often facilitates the prioritisation of commercial over ecological benefits during site design. Furthermore, many felt an over reliance on the protection of individual animals, as opposed to maintaining functional connectivity for conservation of wider populations was detrimental to both the development industry and ecology. Our findings support the case for further research into the development of innovative geographical information systems to allow spatial deliberation, and collaborative decision-making between the three stakeholder groups.

AB  - Sustainability analysis of urban complex systems, as an interdisciplinary study, necessitates integrative modeling approaches for analyzing relationships between land parameters and landscape patterns. The present paper emphasizes applicability of dynamic and scenario-based investigation of urban environments for understanding the interactions between urbanization suitability and landscape pattern. Combining parameter modification and model integration approaches for introducing growth alternatives, a basis was established for detailed assessment of the Karaj urban context, Iran. SLEUTH's probabilistic images of future urbanized lands of two growth scenarios (historical trend-based urban growth and compact urban growth) were simultaneously employed as dynamic factors for urbanization suitability mapping and landscape pattern analysis of the years 2011, 2020, 2030 and 2040. Findings of the present studies showed while historical trend-based urban expansion occupied more land resources, this growth option resulted in a more manageable pattern of urban landscape in terms of its connectivity and compactness as well as possessing higher urbanization suitability index across the study time frame. This study addresses utility of scenario-based analysis of urban areas that furnishes urban planners with insights into cumulative impacts of an ongoing urbanization process under different environmental circumstances.

AB  - The long-lived migratory fish in the lower Athabasca region (including the Athabasca oil sands region) are valued ecosystem components and good bio-indicators of changes in habitat condition, water quality and quantity over the entire stream network. Changes in this region may have been caused by a variety of human activities including oil sands development, forestry, urban development, and recreational activities. We reviewed existing data to examine whether community composition and health of migratory fish (such as northern pike, walleye, and suckers) in the lower Athabasca region have changed over the past 40 years and whether these could be explained by changes in hydrology or water chemistry. Declines of 53%-100% in the abundance of three migratory fish species were detected in the Muskeg watershed (15% land change). Significant changes in fish health were detected. The largest decreases in body condition of fish in the region occurred in the late 1990s and coincided with elevated levels of fin erosion, the most frequently occurring external abnormality, and with extreme discharge conditions. Fish habitat can be affected by both increases and decreases in discharge, and the most pronounced changes were increases in some watersheds of up to 20% of average discharge post-development. In contrast, decreases in discharge post-development in the Muskeg and Steepbank rivers correlated with a decrease in precipitation. Our results show that climatic events and landscape features such as wetlands are important for understanding changes in the system. Further research is needed to examine potential ecological consequences of the observed changes in hydrology for fish and to explore what caused the changes in migratory fish communities and fish health. This will require a better understanding of the trophic structure of the system and a better monitoring program for migratory fish.

AB  - This paper is motivated by the observation that our understanding of global cities in Germany and beyond is limited because the practices through which producer service firms (PSFs) are involved in managing and governing their clients' global commodity chains (GCCs) have barely been studied. Based on interviews with representatives of PSFs in the secondary global city of Hamburg, the paper scrutinises whether and how service professionals contribute to the functioning and the control of their clients' cross-border operations. It also analyses why clients choose global PSFs located in Hamburg, and it discusses which place Hamburg occupies in the network of German global cities. The paper concludes that because PSFs fulfil management functions for their clients' global operations Hamburg is, beyond the role of its port, a critical node in many GCCs. Secondly, PSFs influence their clients' decision-making processes. They are part of economic governance processes, though this impact cannot be straightforwardly equated with 'command and control'. The paper also confirms that (and explains why) the world city network is the spatial correlate of a globalising economy. Finally, there is no such a thing as a 'global city hierarchy' because the division of labour between the offices of PSFs is functional. As regards further research, a first task is to verify this paper's findings through interviews with clients of PSFs to consolidate our knowledge on the role of PSFs in GCCs. Secondly, the contention that the world city network is flat has to be re-examined against the backdrop of an evident clustering of PSFs in specific cities. Finally, the discussion of whether and how PSFs are involved in the governance of their clients` GCCs needs to be continued and deepened.

AB  - In this paper I address the nationwide impulse to use new High-Speed Railway (HSR) stations to catalyse the urban extension of Chinese cities. I aim to unfold four modalities of actor relations in the process of urbanisation around the HSR stations-that is, the vertical intergovernmental relations, horizontal intergovernmental relations, government-market relations, and government-society relations. By introducing the network perspective, I demonstrate how the particular policy networks in China shape actor relations in policy games, and correspondingly impact on the outcomes of such urban policies. The new subcentre in Wuhan is taken as an in-depth case study. I identify key policy networks as the institutional settings, and analyse the role of such policy networks in the key policy games: location choice, infrastructure integration, functional diversity, and the quality of environmental and public space. Finally, as a consequence, the characteristic coordination problems that yield the policy games of urbanisation are characterised, which concern: tension between central and local competences of decision making; cross-jurisdiction separation; the overdominant role of governments and their opportunist behaviours; and, finally, lack of public participation.

AB  - The measure of map information has been one of the key issues in assessing cartographic quality and map generalization algorithms. It is also important for developing efficient approaches to transfer geospatial information. Road network is the most common linear object in real world. Approximately describe road network information will benefit road map generalization, navigation map production and urban planning. Most of current approaches focused on node diversities and supposed that all the edges are the same, which is inconsistent to real-life condition, and thus show limitations in measuring network information. As real-life traffic flow are directed and of different quantities, the original undirected vector road map was first converted to a directed topographic connectivity map. Then in consideration of preferential attachment in complex network study and rich-club phenomenon in social network, the from and to weights of each edge are assigned. The from weight of a given edge is defined as the connectivity of its end node to the sum of the connectivities of all the neighbors of the from nodes of the edge. After getting the from and to weights of each edge, edge information, node information and the whole network structure information entropies could be obtained based on information theory. The approach has been applied to several 1 square mile road network samples. Results show that information entropies based on edge diversities could successfully describe the structural differences of road networks. This approach is a complementarity to current map information measurements, and can be extended to measure other kinds of geographical objects.

AB  - Quantitative understanding of human movement behaviors would provide helpful insights into the mechanisms of many socioeconomic phenomena. In this paper, we investigate human mobility patterns through analyzing taxi-trace datasets collected from five metropolitan cities in two countries. We focus on three statistics for each dataset: the displacement of each occupied trip, the duration of each occupied trip, and the time interval between successive occupied trips by the same taxi (interevent time). The results indicate that the displacement distributions of human travel by taxi tend to follow exponential laws in two displacement ranges rather than power laws; the trip duration distributions can be approximated by log-normal distributions; the interevent time distributions can be well characterized by log-normal bodies followed by power law tails. For each considered measure, the rescaled distributions of all cities collapsed into a master curve. These results provide empirical evidence supporting the common regularity of intra-city human mobility. Moreover, we show that airport locations could play a role in explaining the spikes of displacement distributions of taxi trips in certain cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Migratory water birds, including the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) - one of the most abundant waterfowl species - are involved in the dispersal of microfungi. This study was undertaken to collect data on the possible differences in fungal biota between mallards in urban and non-urban areas. In total, 53 species of microfungi were found in samples taken from the bill cavity and the cloaca. Among them, 19% are pathogens of humans, including the most common fungus, Candida albicans (18.0% of all isolates). Mallards living in proximity to humans were colonised with a higher number of fungal species than were birds living in non-urban areas. This might be the result of conditions that are favourable for microfungi in cities. The differences between the urban and non-urban environments are responsible for the higher levels of similarity in the species structure of the fungi found in the bill cavity and the cloaca within the same environment rather than in the same ontocenoses from different sites.

AB  - Major roads cause barrier effect and fragmentation on wildlife habitats that are suitable places for feeding, mating, socializing, and hiding. Due to wildlife collisions (Wc), human-wildlife conflicts result in lost lives and loss of biodiversity. Geographical information system (GIS)-based multi criteria evaluation (MCE) methods have been successfully used in short-term planning of road networks considering wild animals. Recently, wildlife passages have been effectively utilized as road engineering structures provide quick and certain solutions for traffic safety and wildlife conservation problems. GIS-based MCE methods provide decision makers with optimum location for ecological passages based on habitat suitability models (HSMs) that classify the areas based on ecological requirements of target species. In this study, ecological passages along Motorway 52 within forested areas in Mediterranean city of Osmaniye in Turkey were evaluated. Firstly, HSM coupled with nine eco-geographic decision variables were developed based on ecological requirements of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) that were chosen as target species. Then specified decision variables were evaluated using GIS-based weighted linear combination (WLC) method to estimate movement corridors and mitigation points along the motorway. In the solution process, two linkage nodes were evaluated for eco-passages which were determined based on the leastcost movement corridor intersecting with the motorway. One of the passages was identified as a natural wildlife overpass while the other was suggested as underpass construction. The results indicated that computer-based models provide accurate and quick solutions for positioning ecological passages to reduce environmental effects of road networks on wild animals.

AB  - Tree cavities are used by a wide variety of species for nesting, food storage, and cover. Most studies on cavity availability have been conducted in forests, and little is known about urban areas. With urbanization, species that excavate cavities may be less abundant, natural tree-decay processes are managed, and tree densities are reduced, all of which may influence tree-cavity availability. We investigated three questions: 1) What is the prevalence of tree cavities in different habitats in the Chicago area? 2) How do the characteristics of natural and woodpecker-excavated cavities and cavity-trees differ across habitats? 3) How does the urban landscape influence the prevalence of tree cavities? We tested the capacity for large urban parks and residential areas to provide tree cavities at levels similar to forested areas. We surveyed 1,545 trees in these three habitats for excavated and natural (caused by decay) cavities. Cavities were most available in forests, where the density of trees was highest. We found that a similar proportion of trees in forests and parks had excavated cavities, but excavated cavities were rare in residential areas. Trees containing cavities were larger than control trees and had more decay, and excavated cavities were in larger trees with more decay than natural cavity trees. Canopy cover was the main landscape variable influencing excavated cavity availability. Our results suggest that the prevalence of tree cavities may not be a limiting factor for urban wildlife, however that is contingent on the levels of use of natural cavities, which is currently unknown.

AB  - The main aim of the research was to create models of landscape aesthetic network, to determine the character of those networks and to give a proposition of usefulness of the proposed modeling approach in the urban area. Landscape aesthetic value data which was necessary to create network models was collected using the method which is appropriate to urban areas. Models of aesthetic landscape networks were drawn on the basis of six ways of linking values: the maximal increase in value, the minimal increase in value, the maximal decrease in value, the minimal decrease in value, the maximal difference in value and the minimal difference in value. The distribution of nodes and links showed that the networks were scale-free. This empirical statement gives scientific basis to perform simulations of the changes in their structures, which in turn allows modeling certain behaviors of the system. While identifying the developed network models of landscape value as scale-free, the author identifies their nodes and centers, and simulates changes that occur in a given model as a result of removing chosen nodes, centers and elevating certain nodes to the rank of centers. Simulations show what kind of action can be taken to optimize the organization of the urbanized area, both for the development of tourism and other functions of the space.

AB  - Large ungulates commonly perform seasonal or annual movements that encompass considerable land area and various habitat types. Effective conservation of these species relies not only on insights on their basic ecology, but also an understanding on their requirements to move across landscapes. To determine the key landscape characteristics of the endangered takin (Budorcas taxicolor), we systematically surveyed for their occurrence in the Northern MinShan Mountains, China, during 2010-2011. We then modeled takin distribution at a regional scale using autologistic regression models, and produced a predictive map for their distribution. The results showed that occurrence probabilities for takin were higher in areas with a larger range of elevation, closer to protected areas, farther from townships, and with more forest coverage. There was a considerable overlap between highly suitable takin habitat and the network of protected forest formed by nature reserves originally established to conserve giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). A broad elevation gradient and the protected area network were essential landscape characteristics in predicting takin distributions and our results suggested that takin should be considered landscape- and conservation-dependent species. The results of this study are applicable to the conservation of large ungulates throughout the mountains bordering the Tibetan Plateau and to a broader suite of mammals that conduct seasonal migrations.

AB  - Coastal freshwater and tidal wetland habitats are being transformed as a result of increasing demand for commercial, residential and tourism activities. The consequence is a habitat seascape complex, comprising a mosaic of natural and engineered coastal features. This study used the freely available mapping tool (Google Earth) to define the extent of coastal engineering structures in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBR; Australia), a marine ecosystem of global biodiversity and cultural significance. Continuing threats to the heritage estate concomitant with expanding urban and industrial developments has raised concerns directed at the future conservation and resilience of the reef ecosystems, along with maintaining expected human lifestyles and livelihoods it provides. The data here shows that break walls and pontoons/jetties dominate development, contributing to approximately 10% (equivalent) of the coastline linear length. Most (60%) development occurs along the coastline or within the first few kilometres upstream along estuaries. While conservation and protection of natural coastal habitats is still preferred for the objective of fisheries production and biodiversity, managers must consider seascape implication/benefits more broadly when approving new marine infrastructure rather than a case-by-case approach which further contributes to an ad hoc mosaic seascape of natural and engineered habitats. Not only within the GBR heritage estate, but more broadly, coastal managers need to regard wider seascape connectivity processes during the assessment of any new development. There is an urgent need for policy and planning instrument reform that is inclusive of accumulative impacts of urban and industrial development in this heritage estate. Opportunities to include eco-friendly (green engineering) solutions, in the repair and revitalisation of existing artificial structures, is necessary in any new proposed urban and industrial development and expansion.

AB  - Asexual reproduction lacks genetic diversity but is predicted to be advantageous for dispersal and for increasing abundance relative to sexual reproduction. The oceanic Ogasawara Islands are inhabited by two gecko species, the asexual (parthenogenetic) all-female Lepidodactylus lugubris and the sexually reproductive Hemidactylus frenatus. This situation offers a unique opportunity to examine the relationships among sexuality and the abundance, distribution, and genetic diversity of the two species. A total of 445 geckos were collected across nine islands, and the population genetic structure of both species was estimated using microsatellite markers. Lepidodactylus lugubris was collected on all nine islands and consisted of two widely distributed clones: one diploid and the other triploid. In contrast, H. frenatus was limited to four islands and exhibited variation in population genetic structure among islands, with some bottleneck effects. Successful dispersal may be more frequent in L. lugubris than in H. frenatus; therefore, the asexual reproductive strategy of L. lugubris appears to have contributed to its dispersal success and increased abundance among the small oceanic islands. However, the absence of H. frenatus on islands not inhabited by humans may be partially explained by their different microhabitat preferences, as H. frenatus collection sites were relatively more confined to artificial substrates in towns and along roadways compared to L. lugubris. Moreover, the colonization histories of these two geckos have not yet been assessed; therefore, further study is needed to confirm the effects of sexuality on the population dynamics of these species.

AB  - Planning of semi-urban developments is often hindered by a lack of knowledge on how changes in land-use affect catchment hydrological response. The temporal and spatial patterns of overland flow source areas and their connectivity in the landscape, particularly in a seasonal climate, remain comparatively poorly understood. This study investigates seasonal variations in factors influencing runoff response to rainfall in a pen-urban catchment in Portugal characterized by a mosaic of landscape units and a humid Mediterranean climate. Variations in surface soil moisture, hydrophobicity and infiltration capacity were measured in six different landscape units (defined by land-use on either sandstone or limestone) in nine monitoring campaigns at key times over a one-year period.
   Spatiotemporal patterns in overland flow mechanisms were found. Infiltration-excess overland flow was generated in rainfalls during the dry summer season in woodland on both sandstone and limestone and on agricultural soils on limestone due probably in large part to soil hydrophobicity. In wet periods, saturation overland flow occurred on urban and agricultural soils located in valley bottoms and on shallow soils upslope. Topography, water table rise and soil depth determined the location and extent of saturated areas. Overland flow generated in upslope source areas potentially can infiltrate in other landscape units downslope where infiltration capacity exceeds rainfall intensity. Hydrophilic urban and agricultural-sandstone soils were characterized by increased infiltration capacity during dry periods, while forest soils provided potential sinks for overland flow when hydrophilic in the winter wet season. Identifying the spatial and temporal variability of overland flow sources and sinks is an important step in understanding and modeling flow connectivity and catchment hydrologic response. Such information is important for land managers in order to improve urban planning to minimize flood risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanisation has an important impact on biodiversity, mostly driving changes in species assemblages, through the replacement of specialist with generalist species, thus leading to biotic homogenisation. Mobility is also assumed to greatly affect species' ability to cope in urban environments. Moreover, specialisation, mobility and their interaction are expected to greatly influence ecological processes such as metacommunity dynamics and assembly processes, and consequently the way and the spatial scale at which organisms respond to urbanisation. Here we investigate urbanisation impacts on distinct characteristics of species assemblages - namely specialisation degree in resource use, mobility and number of species, classified according to both characteristics and their combination - for vascular plants, butterflies and birds, across a range of spatial scales (from 1 x 1 km plots to 5 km-radius buffers around them).
   We found that the degree of specialisation, mobility and their interaction, greatly influenced species' responses to urbanisation, with highly mobile specialist species of all taxonomic groups being affected most. Two different patterns were found: for plants, urbanisation induced trait divergence by favouring highly mobile species with narrow habitat ranges. For birds and butterflies, however, it reduced the number of highly mobile specialist species, thus driving trait convergence. Mobile organisms, across and within taxonomic groups, tended to respond at larger spatial scales than those that are poorly mobile. These findings emphasize the need to take into consideration species' ecological aspects, as well as a wide range of spatial scales when evaluating the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity. Our results also highlight the harmful impact of widespread urban expansion on organisms such as butterflies, especially highly mobile specialists, which were negatively affected by urban areas even at great distances.

AB  - Ecosystem services are strongly influenced by the landscape configuration of natural and human systems. So they are heterogeneous across landscapes. However lack of the knowledge of spatial variations of ecosystem services constrains the effective management and conservation of ecosystems. We presented a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the geographic variations in ecosystem services for the Fuzhou City in 2009 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis. Results confirmed a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation, and revealed several hot-spots and cold-spots for the spatial distribution of ecosystem service intensity (ESI) in the study area Also the trend surface analysis indicated that the level of ESI tended to be reduced gradually from north to south and from west to east, with a trough in the urban central area, which was quite in accordance with land-use structure. A more precise cluster map was then developed using the range of lag distance, deriving from semivariance analysis, as neighborhood size instead of default value in the software of ESRI ArcGIS 10.0, and geographical clusters where population growth and land-use pressure varied significantly and positively with ESI across the city were also created by geographically weighted regression (GWR). This study has good policy implications applicable to prioritize areas for conservation or construction, and design ecological corridor to improve ecosystem service delivery to benefiting areas.

AB  - Coastal areas are undergoing continuous transformation to sustain the increasing residential, commercial, and tourist activities. However, the proliferation of artificial infrastructures (i.e. marinas and breakwaters) may contribute to destroy and fragment marine natural habitats, to alter the connectivity among populations and, as a consequence, the natural seascape. In particular, the upper sub tidal rocky fringe, where the coastal transformations are more conspicuous, represents the natural habitat of dominant engineering algae, such as Cystoseira and Sargassum; some of them, because of their sensitivity to environmental variability, are considered biological elements of water quality.
   The recent attempt to measure historical changes in macro algal diversity in the Gulf of Naples has highlighted a dramatic decrease of Cystoseira species in the upper sub littoral zones and at the same time the lack of information on their up to date extension. To verify the influence of coastal development on the decline of Cystoseira species in the Gulf, the percentage of natural/artificial coastal length has been estimated with Google Earth orto-photos. The results testified a correspondence: the higher was the Cystoseira spp. loss, the greater was the development of artificial urban infrastructures.
   To follow the temporal dynamics of these shallow systems, a complete remonitoring of the fucoid distribution along the Neapolitan coast has been planned. Up to now, the occurrence of these species has been mapped and digitalized in a qGIS database (scale 1:2,500) for the shallowest fringe of the island of Ischia. An ongoing homogenization of diversity at a medium scale has been recorded: Cystoseira compressa (the less sensitive species) is the widespread species; fragmented stands of Cystoseira amentacea (the most sensitive) still exist. Their distribution is limited to natural habitats slope more gently while the highest diversity has been reached in rocky pools. Occasional settlements were recorded on artificial structures when natural marine habitat was preserved in the surrounding area and the distance among the algal patches could not be a limiting factor in the spreading of the species. These preliminary data seem to suggest that a stronger collaboration between engineers and ecologists could favour a better coastal management in order to mitigate the impacts of artificial infrastructures on natural marine ecosystems and avoid the loss of biodiversity.

AB  - The study of spatio-temporal variability of airborne bacterial communities has recently gained importance due to the evidence that airborne bacteria are involved in atmospheric processes and can affect human health. In this work, we described the structure of airborne microbial communities in two urban areas (Milan and Venice, Northern Italy) through the sequencing, by the Illumina platform, of libraries containing the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and estimated the abundance of airborne bacteria with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Airborne microbial communities were dominated by few taxa, particularly Burkholderiales and Actinomycetales, more abundant in colder seasons, and Chloroplasts, more abundant in warmer seasons. By partitioning the variation in bacterial community structure, we could assess that environmental and meteorological conditions, including variability between cities and seasons, were the major determinants of the observed variation in bacterial community structure, while chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) had a minor contribution. Particularly, Ba, SO4 (2-) and Mg2+ concentrations were significantly correlated with microbial community structure, but it was not possible to assess whether they simply co-varied with seasonal shifts of bacterial inputs to the atmosphere, or their variation favoured specific taxa. Both local sources of bacteria and atmospheric dispersal were involved in the assembling of airborne microbial communities, as suggested, to the one side by the large abundance of bacteria typical of lagoon environments (Rhodobacterales) observed in spring air samples from Venice and to the other by the significant effect of wind speed in shaping airborne bacterial communities at all sites.

AB  - Purpose - Studying the cultural dynamics of expatriate amateur theater in Brussels, the purpose of this paper is to investigate multicultural marketplace development in global cities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper performs an interpretive analysis of the expatriate amateur scene from an ethnographic perspective, combining observations of rehearsals and performances, in-depth interviews with actors, directors and audience, and secondary data.
   Findings - The fluidity of global cities allows their inhabitants to engage in creative processes of cultural experimentation, performing a continuous back-and-forth movement between hybridization and pluralization. The former creates enough homogeneity for the expatriates to feel targeted; the latter ensures a level of cultural diversity necessary to satisfy their cosmopolitan aspirations.
   Practical implications - The paper points to the important role of global cities for cultural experimentation. Such cities are not only an interesting market for culturally diverse products, but also experimental hubs. Managers willing to address multicultural marketplaces might target these markets with dynamic cultural offers that ensure a balance between rendering a product globally appreciated and recognizable, and maintaining a cosmopolitan appeal for consumers in search of diversity.
   Originality/value - Drawing on global cities as markets in continuous reconstruction and subject to cultural experimentation, the paper turns the attention of the research community to the collective, reflexive, and experimental aspects of symbolic consumption. It shows how arts and cultural products represent valuable contexts for international marketing research, providing original insights into market dynamics and cultural experimentation.

AB  - Serological confirmation of dengue in 1,410 school-going children aged 7-18 years provided prevalence data for 16 different sites in Malaysia. These sites ranged from highly urbanized cities to small towns. We found that at least similar to 7 % of children in the study group had been exposed to dengue by age 12 and similar to 16% by age 18. Here we report that the dengue seroprevalence correlates with i) increasing land development and decreased vegetation, and ii) the overall population growth. Water bodies did not significantly affect dengue prevalence. High prevalence of dengue was also recorded in few of the non-urban sites suggesting the expanding geographical locality of those who get dengue in Malaysia in tandem with increased land usage activities. These findings highlight the need to give closer consideration to future urban planning and development, taking into consideration the changing demography and the importance of built environment to mitigate the increasing incidence of dengue in the non-urban areas of Malaysia.

AB  - This article argues that an ideological struggle organized around competing Haitian cultural definitions of liberte conditioned the development of Haiti's transport infrastructure from independence in 1804 to the U.S. Occupation of 1915-1934. This definition of liberte was linked to the ideological reproduction of state power by maintaining cultural constructions of people as urban or rural. Using historical sources, an analysis of the institutions, policies, and practices of infrastructure use and development shows that movement itself serves as cultural symbol and site of ideological struggle, as differential access to freedom of movement influences the maintenance of urban and rural classifications. During the colonial period and immediately after independence, the plantation economy neglected transport infrastructure, which helped keep cities small and laborers on plantations. By the mid-19th century, the plantation economy collapsed, and landowners moved to port cities to enter commerce or politics. Smallholding peasantries emerged in rural areas, but continued lack of transport investment kept them there. Only in the late 19th century did Haitian elites invest in transport infrastructure; this was enhanced by the early-20th-century American occupation. Only then did cities begin to grow substantially.

AB  - This study presents the rough set theory and catastrophe progression method to regionalize the land-use change and to analyze the land ecological process. It uses the land-use database of Yixing City of Jiangsu Province, an urbanized and industrialized city in Yangtze River Delta of China, as an exemplification. The study area is divided into six kinds of land-use types according to the national standard of land-use classification. It includes arable land, garden, woodland, urban-rural construction land, water, and unused land. The six kinds of land-use types are formed into their corresponding landscape types in the scale of 1:10,000 by the aid of ArcGIS9.3 software of ESRI. In ArcGIS9.3, the landscape pattern indices are calculated by using Fragstats (raster version 3.3) software. Based on these landscape pattern indices, an integrated indicator system of landscape regionalization of land use in Yixing was established, and land-use regionalization models are set up using the catastrophe theory. Rough set theory is introduced to avoid the subjectivity in the indicator's importance in catastrophe models. The hidden rule among the raw data is acquired by knowledge reduction of the data mining in the rough set theory. In the process, indicators needed to be arranged according to the computed importance of an attribute without considering the determination of weight function. This greatly avoids the subjectivity in the process of weight factor determination. The zoning of land use based on landscape indices finally is made by the multi-indicator integrated catastrophe progression method. According to these indices, Yixing is divided into four grading land-use zones when the rough set and catastrophe progression methods are combined. The zones include high-, medium-, low-, and weak-intensity zones, indicating that land use primarily varies the landscape pattern. With the increase of water and forest area proportion, the human disturbance to land system wanes; patch fragmentation reduces; patch shape complexity enhances; and landscape diversity decreases. Moreover, it can mostly avoid the subjective evaluation in artificially determining factor weights by using rough set theory. It makes the zoning results more objective and exact.

AB  - Indigenous migration to cities in Mexico has been the focus of a range of research initiatives in Mexican anthropology, as new research approaches, questions and problems have emerged. In the context of a strengthened indigenous movement and of constitutional reforms that recognize cultural diversity and indigenous rights, the enhanced visibility of indigenous migrants that started in the 1990s has led to the development of new research topics, which are analysed in this article.

AB  - In order to secure pollination services and improve conservation strategies, a better understanding of factors influencing population structure of pollinator species is vital. Here, we aimed to empirically evaluate various individual-and population-based statistical methods for characterization of genetic structure of the widespread dronefly, Eristalis tenax. Thirty-five European populations, comprising 888 individuals, were genotyped at five polymorphic allozyme loci. Three Bayesian genotypic clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, BAPS and Geneland), pairwise F-ST estimates, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), principle component analysis (PCA) and Mantel tests were applied in a comparative way in attempt to reveal the patterns of gene flow that occurs at various spatial scales in E. tenax. STRUCTURE analysis and PCA results provided no evidence of conspecific differentiation. In contrast, BAPS and Geneland clustering solutions did acknowledge low but significant proportion of among-populations genetic variation revealed by AMOVA. Similarly, pairwise FST estimates partially argue against genetic homogeneity across Europe. The lack of correlation between genetic distance and both latitude and longitude variation suggests that the flies disperse in multiple directions. Therefore, our results indicate that continued long-range dispersal tend to homogenize populations over time, resulting in little population structure in E. tenax across the European landmass. On the other hand, significant differentiations between geographically proximate populations indicate that dispersal potential may not be realized and that gene flow patterns in E. tenax might be geographically complex. Using information from our genetic approaches will be useful for identifying patterns of migration and population connectivity across continent, which is an important issue for conservation efforts. Since E. tenax is an important pollinator, our results contribute to understanding the potential extent to which this taxon can facilitate gene flow among plant populations across natural and semi-natural habitats, agroecosystems and urban environments. Dronefly-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-dronefly conservation will require large-scale action.

AB  - Planting tree species with desirable traits may catalyze forest regeneration in increasingly common degraded lands by restoring soil properties and attracting seed dispersers. We sampled forest regeneration in an experimental plantation of Albizia lebbek, an introduced N-fixing species, on a degraded pasture in northern Puerto Rico, 27 years after its establishment. We hypothesized that the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species within this unmanaged plantation would be (1) greater than in adjacent pastures; (2) higher at distances closer to secondary forest; and (3) increased over the 20 years since floristic surveys were last conducted in the site. We sampled forest structure and tree species composition, and compared the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species on plots located within the adjacent pasture and the A. lebbek plantation, within the plantation in plots distanced at 10, 35, and 60 m from secondary forest, and within the plantation at 7 vs. 27 years after plantation establishment. We found higher abundance of animal-dispersed tree species in the A. lebbek plantation than in the pasture. Distance from secondary forest had no effect on the abundance of animal-dispersed species. The abundance of animal-dispersed species increased by 14% between 7 and 27 years after plantation establishment. In all, these results indicate that A. lebbek trees facilitated the establishment of native animal-dispersed species by shading out tall grasses and acting as perches for animals throughout the plantation. We found that A. lebbek lost its dominance in the site to another introduced N-fixing species, Leucaena leucocephala, possibly due to unfavorable traits such as susceptibility to pathogens. Our findings document a transition from an experimental plantation to a novel urban forest that harbors an array of native tree species, largely due to the digiersal of seeds by animals. A noteworthy example is the presence of Guaiacum officinale, an animal-dispersed and endangered tree species native to the dry forests of southern Puerto Rico. Our results highlight how monocultures of introduced tree species with desirable traits can catalyze the regeneration of native tree species in chronically degraded lands. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper aims to summarize the organization of communication networks for internet in Brazilian's territory at the beginning of the 2010s, by constructing a graphical model that is the result of spatial analysis of internet accesses and the backbone's topology. To this end, we treat the fundamental territorial and informational structures base of the internet, showing the telecommunications and computing equipments that allow the interconnection of digital networks and various services, as well as the spatial dynamics of the internet in Brazil, considering the distribution of these networks between places. The translation of these spatial logics into "coremes" aimed to emphasize the complex structural basis of this network, as well as the contrast between the privileged areas of information flow and the opposite, where the network is dispersed and void, places with low density of access or low technological diversity. The article pointed out that the internet replicates much to Brazilian urban hierarchy, but the topology of the network, despite following the same logic, brought very significant changes in the hierarchy of cities in regional terms. Of a purely graphical validity, the final model synthesizes the view we've got of the internet over the survey, which showed the deformity of internet's organization in Brazil, scattered and rarefied particularly in rural and peri-urban areas.

AB  - Factors affecting avian demography and abundance in urban landscapes are poorly understood and this hinders attempts to manage urban bird communities. Several recent studies indicate that lack of invertebrate prey in urban landscapes may constrain avian productivity and fitness relative to that in other habitats. House Sparrow Passer domesticus populations have undergone large declines in many European urban centres and inadequate reproductive success linked to invertebrate availability has been postulated as a potential cause of these declines. We conducted a replicated supplementary feeding experiment to test whether the availability of invertebrate prey limits the breeding success and adult abundance (colony size) of House Sparrows in suburban London, where House Sparrow populations declined by 60% during the decade preceding our study. Daily mealworm provision over two successive breeding seasons, sufficient to provide 82% of chick energy requirements of House Sparrow pairs nesting within 50m of feeders, had a large positive impact on the abundance of recently fledged birds (+62%), but only a small positive impact, limited mainly to small colonies, on the overall abundance of territorial males. Colony growth was only weakly related to fledgling abundance in the previous year and did not appear to be constrained by nest-site availability. Conservation interventions that enhance invertebrate availability for suburban House Sparrows may increase reproductive success but are unlikely, on their own, to lead to population growth or recovery.

AB  - Can protest bring about social change? Although scholarship on the consequences of social movements has grown dramatically, our understanding of protest influence is limited; several recent studies have failed to detect any positive effect. We investigate sit-in protest by black college students in the U.S. South in 1960, which targeted segregated lunch counters. An original dataset of 334 cities enables us to assess the effect of protest while considering the factors that generate protest itself-including local movement infrastructure, supportive political environments, and favorable economic conditions. We find that sit-in protest greatly increased the probability of desegregation, as did protest in nearby cities. Over time, desegregation in one city raised the probability of desegregation nearby. In addition, desegregation tended to occur where opposition was weak, political conditions were favorable, and the movement's constituency had economic leverage.

AB  - Urban habitats differ from adjacent natural habitats in terms of disturbance regimes, light, temperature, rainfall, habitat distribution and resource abundance. Meteorological differences advance and prolong the growing season in urban habitats compared to nearby rural areas. In turn, urban bird populations may potentially start singing earlier, and reproduce earlier and more frequently than rural populations. However, this prediction has previously only been tested with data from single species using single spatial replicates from rural and urban sites. Here we provide the first general (paired urban and rural populations of 54 bird species) and large-scale (a 3800 km long latitudinal gradient across Europe) empirical evidence for longer and earlier singing periods in urban compared to rural habitats. Effects of urbanization on start and duration of the singing period (as a proxy for the breeding season) were positively related to size of cities and ecological characteristics of species. Bird species that have been urbanized for a long time started to sing earlier and had a more extended singing period in urban compared to rural habitats. We also found that the singing period started later and was shorter at higher latitudes. Geographical variation in phenology was related to temperature and rainfall, although differences between urban and rural habitats were not. Differences in duration of singing periods between paired urban and rural sites were as large as latitudinal differences between southern and northern Europe (5, 6 and 28 d for 3 common species, as compared to a mean latitudinal variation of 17.1 d). This suggests local adjustment to urban environments, either due to evolution or to plasticity of phenological behaviour.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts contribute to the fragmentation of urban mangrove forests, and in the Sydney region of Australia, Avicennia marina is commonly found in small stands of < 50 adult trees that have altered pollinator services. However, genetic diversity may not vary with stand size because insufficient time has passed since stands were established or pollen and propagule dispersal are sufficient to overwhelm the effects of genetic drift and founder events. We tested the predictions that, despite the potential of mangroves for dispersal of propagules by water and long distance dispersal of pollen by honeybees, fragmentation and localized foraging by honeybees causes small stands of A. marina to display reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. Using four microsatellite markers, we quantified the genetic and genotypic diversity present within samples of 20 adults taken from three large (> 1500 trees), intermediate (300-500 trees) and small (< 50 trees) stands within each of two urbanized estuaries and estimated mating system parameters using progeny arrays for sets of five adults within the large and small stands. We detected no significant effect of stand size on levels of single-locus genetic diversity. There were low, although significant, levels of allelic differentiation within (F (SE) = 0.021, P = 0.003) and among (F (ET) = 0.055, P = 0.005) estuaries but no evidence of isolation by distance. In contrast, our analysis of progeny arrays revealed that, while all stands displayed high levels of biparental inbreeding, an expected consequence of pollination by honeybees, current outcrossing rates (t (m) ) were significantly lower in small (0.55) as compared to large (0.75) stands. The genetic makeup of the adult populations imply that stands are interconnected and suggest little impact of habitat fragmentation, while the progeny arrays suggest that plants within small stands may display reduced fitness.

AB  - We applied a river habitat quality (RHQ) assessment method to the Hai River Basin (HRB); an important economic centre in China; to obtain baseline information for water quality improvement; river rehabilitation; and watershed management. The results of the assessment showed that the river habitat in the HRB is seriously degraded. Specifically; 42.41% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 3.31 x 10(4) km; were designated poor and bad. Habitat in the plain areas is seriously deteriorated; and nearly 50% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 1.65 x 10(4) km; had either poor or bad habitats. River habitat degradation was attributable to the limited width of the riparian zone (5 m); lower coverage of riparian vegetation (40%); artificial land use patterns (public and industrial land); frequent occurrence of farming on the river banks and high volumes of solid waste (nearly 10 m(3)); single flow channels; and rare aquatic plants (1 category). At the regional scale; intensive artificial land use types caused by urbanization had a significant impact on the RHQ in the HRB. RHQ was significantly and negatively correlated with farmland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01) and urban land (r = 0.998; p < 0.05); and was significantly and positively correlated with grassland and woodland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01). Intensive artificial land use; created through urbanization processes; has led to a loss of the riparian zone and its native vegetation; and has disrupted the lateral connectivity of the rivers. The degradation of the already essentially black rivers is exacerbated by poor longitudinal connectivity (index of connectivity is 2.08-16.56); caused by reservoirs and sluices. For river habitat rehabilitation to be successful; land use patterns need to be changed and reservoirs and sluices will have to be regulated.

AB  - Recreational trails are one of the most common types of infrastructure used for nature-based activities such as hiking and mountain biking worldwide. Depending on their design, location, construction, maintenance and use, these trails differ in their environmental impacts. There are few studies, however, comparing the impacts of different trail types including between formal management-created trails and informal visitor-created trails. Although both types of trails can be found in remote natural areas, dense networks of them often occur in forests close to cities where they experience intense visitor use. To assess the relative impacts of different recreational trails in urban forests, we compared the condition of the trail surface, loss of forest strata and changes in tree structure caused by seven types of trails (total network 46.1 km) traversing 17 remnants of an endangered urban forest in Australia. After mapping and classifying all trails, we assessed their impact on the forest condition at 125 sites (15 sites per trail type, plus 15 control sites within undisturbed forest). On the trail sites, the condition of the trail surface, distance from the trail edge to four forest strata (litter, understory, midstorey and tree cover) and structure of the tree-line were assessed. Informal trails generally had poorer surface conditions and were poorly-designed and located. Per site, formal and informal trails resulted in similar loss of forest strata, with wider trails resulting in greater loss of forest. Because there were more informal trails, however, they accounted for the greatest cumulative forest loss. Structural impacts varied, with the widest informal trails and all formal hardened trails resulting in similar reductions in canopy cover and tree density but an increase in saplings. These structural impacts are likely a function of the unregulated and intense use of large informal trails, and disturbance from the construction and maintenance of formal trails. The results demonstrate that different types of recreational trails vary in the type and range of impacts they cause to forests. They highlight the importance of careful consideration towards management options when dealing with trail networks especially in areas of high conservation value. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main image of the 15-M Movement is symbolized by the occupations in the squares of many Spanish cities, i.e., its urban appearance. However, the rights to healthy food, responsible consumption, access to land, the preservation of agricultural ecosystems and the depopulation of rural areas have been some of the topics discussed at the heart of the movement. This demonstrates a substantial concern for both environmental and agricultural issues, which demand alternatives from a properly rural perspective. As we propose in this article, urban and rural issues are inseparable in the 15-M Movement. The themes that we highlight are the demand of food sovereignty and agro-ecology as horizons for a transformation of the territories organization. This article summarizes the aspects of rurality of the 15-M Movement and its political, social, economic, environmental and territorial claims. In particular, we consider the characteristics of emerging initiatives in the province of Alicante, in the southeast of the Spain, as well as its relations with rural movements in regional, national and international level.

AB  - The movement of large numbers of vehicles along the complex network of roads in a city result in interactions between them that become stronger as the traffic density increases. The non-trivial behavior arising from the collective dynamics of vehicles include the occurrence of persistent congestion at different points of the transport network that typically reduce the efficiency of overall traffic flow. In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for the characteristic spatio-temporal patterns of urban traffic, we first need to identify statistically robust features from empirical observations, which one can then try to recreate in computational models of traffic dynamics. In this article, we have analyzed the GPS traces collected round the clock for more than a hundred taxis operating in a major Indian city over a period of 1 month. The available information allows us to precisely measure the periods during which the vehicle is static and when it is moving. We focus on the intermittent patterns of rest and motion that a car exhibits during its passage through city traffic, which provides a window into key aspects of collective dynamics resulting from congestion. We show that the distribution of waiting time, i.e., the period during which a car is static between two successive epochs of movement, has a highly skewed nature. The bulk of the probability distribution appears to follow power-law scaling with exponent value of 1.78. As city traffic has very different densities during peak hours and off-peak hours, we have also investigated this distribution at different times of the day. While the power-law scaling is found to be robust, the exact value of the exponent does change slightly. We have also considered the active time distribution, i.e., the period of movement between two epochs when the car is static, which does not exhibit a power-law signature but rather resembles a inverse Gaussian or a log-logistic distribution. We also look at the recurrence relation between the durations of successive waiting times, as well as, that between active time duration and the duration of the preceding waiting time. Our results can be used to help understand how the statistical properties of large-scale traffic movement over complex road networks which characterize cities deviate from that of other types of collective dynamics, e.g., the diffusion of random walkers.

AB  - Habitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies using massive, passively collected data from communication technologies have revealed many ubiquitous aspects of social networks, helping us understand and model social media, information diffusion and organizational dynamics. More recently, these data have come tagged with geographical information, enabling studies of human mobility patterns and the science of cities. We combine these two pursuits and uncover reproducible mobility patterns among social contacts. First, we introduce measures of mobility similarity and predictability and measure them for populations of users in three large urban areas. We find individuals' visitations patterns are far more similar to and predictable by social contacts than strangers and that these measures are positively correlated with tie strength. Unsupervised clustering of hourly variations in mobility similarity identifies three categories of social ties and suggests geography is an important feature to contextualize social relationships. We find that the composition of a user's ego network in terms of the type of contacts they keep is correlated with mobility behaviour. Finally, we extend a popular mobility model to include movement choices based on social contacts and compare its ability to reproduce empirical measurements with two additional models of mobility.

AB  - The paper discusses the means and methods of design of Smart Region. Region and landscape are too large for the classical description. Moreover, they are too heterogeneous and require mixed formal means. In other words - there is impossible to form a central feedback control block. The paper follows two issues: - Motivation for the design of Smart Regions. It is emphasized the emergence of situations of instability and emergency situations such as wet and dry cycles, interruption of small water cycle, decreased volumes evapotranspiration (plant respiration) and its impact on high volumes of energy flow outgoing into the atmosphere, strong storms (tornadoes) and floods. - Computation network for the content and the area of a Smart Region. The examples illustrate application of the method for a very dense and industrial region and for the region with rich vegetation and low density of cities and industry.

AB  - Aim The global sprawl of marine hard infrastructure (e.g. breakwaters, sea walls and jetties) can extensively modify coastal seascapes, but the knowledge of such impacts remains limited to local scales. We examined the regional-scale effects of marine artificial habitats on the distribution and abundance of assemblages of ascidians, a key group of ecosystem engineer species in benthic fouling systems.
   Location Five hundred kilometers of coastline in the North Adriatic Sea.
   Methods We sampled a variety of natural reefs, marine infrastructures and marinas, and tested hypotheses about the role of habitat type and location in influencing the relative distribution and abundance of both native and non-indigenous species.
   Results Assemblages differed significantly between natural and artificial habitats and among different types of artificial habitats. Non-indigenous species were 2-3 times more abundant on infrastructures built along sedimentary coastlines than on natural rocky reefs or infrastructures built close to rocky coastlines. Conversely, native species were twice as abundant on natural reefs than on nearby infrastructures and were scarce to virtually absent on infrastructures built along sedimentary coasts. The species composition of assemblages in artificial habitats was more similar to that of marinas than of natural reefs, independently of their location.
   Main conclusions Our results show that marine infrastructures along sandy shores disproportionally favour non-indigenous over native hard bottom species, affecting their spread at regional scales. This is particularly concerning for coastal areas that have low natural densities of rocky reef habitats. We discuss design and management options to improve the quality as habitat of marine infrastructures and to favour their preferential use by native species over non-indigenous ones.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae), the main vector of dengue and urban yellow fever in the world, is highly adapted to the human environment. Artificial containers are the most common larval habitat for the species, but it may develop in tree holes and other phytotelmata. This study assessed whether tree holes in San Ramon de la Nueva Oran, a city located in subtropical montane moist forest where dengue outbreaks occur, are relevant as larval habitat for Ae. aegypti and if the species may be found in natural areas far from human habitations. Water holding tree holes were sampled during 3 years once a month along the rainy season using a siphon bottle, in urban and suburban sites within the city and in adjacent forested areas. Larvae and pupae were collected and the presence and volume of water in each tree hole were recorded. Finding Ae. aegypti in forested areas was an isolated event; however, the species was frequently collected from tree holes throughout the city and along the sampling period. Moreover, larvae were collected in considerably high numbers, stressing the importance of taking into account these natural cavities as potential reinfestation foci within dengue control framework.

AB  - The expansion of urban environments is a major cause of species decline. Regulatory protection of rare species leads however to major conflicts between urban development and species protection. Here, we develop an interdisciplinary study to address three main issues concerning a legally protected endemic reed, Arundo donaciformis (Poaceae), threatened by urban development of the town of Frejus (Mediterranean France). First, we found an absence of genetic variation across the whole range of the species and that this species has a generalist ecological niche in ruderal habitats. These findings should facilitate its practical conservation. Second, a diachronic study revealed a decline of 50% of species distribution in the last twenty years. However, this species plays a dominant structural role in the urban network of green ways and on the banks of watercourses. It thus provides ecological services associated with riverbank stabilization and natural corridors between peripheral natural areas and urban green spaces. Third, sociological interviews revealed two contrasting perceptions of the species among local actors who view the plant either as a rare endemic species in regression or as a highly resistant, even invasive, weed of urban wastelands. Moreover, this protected species is quasi-absent from urban planning documents and locallactors show little comprehension of the need for conservation management, illustrative of another case of the "knowing-doing" gap. In the dynamic urban environment of a Mediterranean town, this species requires pragmatic collaboration that complements scientific information with local knowledge and perceptions in order to enhance links among stakeholders and implement sustained conservation action.

AB  - The public transit and roadway systems of large metropolitan areas transport millions of passengers in fleets of trains, buses and passenger cars to work, home, schools, entertainment and shopping. In addition, goods are moved every day on the same networks. The performance of these systems is critical for the orderly functioning of the city both in terms of human movement and the movement of goods. Currently, there isn't a detailed monitoring system or a "dashboard" of Urban Mobility; a system that answers fine-grained questions such as: what is the crowding at a train station? how occupied are buses on in the peak time on a particular route? how can the available supply of transport capacity be better used to address daily demand as well as the demand on exceptional days (such as rallies and severe weather events).
   In this talk, we present a big data dashboard for urban mobility, describe its capabilities for operational and planning purposes, and as a learning system (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exurban development (e.g., second homes) in woodlands spreads urban land use impacts beyond suburbs, but because exurban developments often retain many components of original ecosystem structure-such as a forest canopy rather than open lawn-their ecological impacts may be underestimated. Changes in seed-dispersing ant behavior prompted by exurban land use, such as edge avoidance, may pose deleterious impacts on the woodland plants (myrmecochores) they disperse, and hence the floristic diversity of exurban forests. We examined the effects of exurbanization on seed-dispersing ant nesting and foraging, seed retrieval, dispersal direction and subsequent impact on myrmecochores. We used a matrix of forested and exurbanized habitats to test whether (1) exurban edges decrease ant nest colonization and seed foraging, (2) ants disperse seeds away from exurban edges, and (3) consequently, there is lower ant-dispersed plant abundance nearer exurban edges. We found that exurban development poses little impact on keystone seed-dispersing ants because they foraged, colonized and thrived in fragmented woodland habitats as well as they did in intact forests. Exurban edges changed ant behavior, however, so that they generally moved seeds toward forest interiors, and, hence, away from edges. Corresponding to this behavioral change, we found that ant-dispersed plants declined with proximity to edges, whereas other woodland herbs with dispersal modes other than ants were unaffected. Exurbanization poses little threat to seed-dispersing ant viability, but, by changing foraging patterns (specifically, limiting the directionality of dispersal), it indirectly threatens the plants they disperse. Edge effects on biota commonly are associated with cascades through abiotic resources, but we show a deleterious biotic cascade between exurban edge, keystone ants and herbaceous plants. Species-mediated services, such as seed dispersal and pollination, are key resources, and assessing the full consequences of land use change therefore necessitates evaluation of impacts on biotic interactions.

AB  - In recent years, ecological networks are taking on an increasingly strategic role in regeneration policies of the territory and the landscape for their prerogative to be a tool aimed to biodiversity conservation through the identification, protection and connection of habitats and more generally of natural areas. In heavily anthropised areas such aspects have to be included in the transformation strategies both in order to recover the compromised areas, but also to connect with each other elements of naturalistic diffused quality present on the territory and necessary to promote the spatial diffusion of plant and animal species. Currently a large part of human activities take place in technological complexes supported by systems of infrastructural networks and integrated with the environment in which are placed through relationships increasingly complex. In order to tackle the problems associated with sustainability of urbanization, deepening the dynamics of interference between natural and anthropic aspects, it is proposed the integration of infrastructural and ecological networks that generates a new type of network, defined environmental, which takes account not only the supply and flow of matter and energy, but also the quality of ecosystemic processes and the preservation of biodiversity. Taking a cue from these issues this paper aims to provide method indications concerning the urban regeneration interventions of sensitive areas with particular reference to a specific context as the territory of Pompei in Campania within of the CAMPUS project "Ecoturismo urbano per la fruizione sostenibile dei Beni culturali in Campania" (Scientific director: prof. arch.

AB  - Within the realm of urban logistics, Macario (2013) developed a hypothesis, denominated the Logistics Profile (LP) concept that suggests homogeneous groups of urban zones with respect to three dimensions, which could be used to analyze freight movement policy: (1) the social and built environment; (2) characteristics of the goods/products being moved; (3) characteristics of the deliveries at the receiver establishment. The concept was expected to ease the transferability of best practices in city logistics, by analyzing similarities and differences between zones. This research uses a quantitative methodology to apply the LP concept, and assess its potential, using the city of Lisbon as a case study. The analysis is focused on: (a) the extrapolation of freight trip generation per establishment and delivery characteristics from a sample of commercial establishments to the population within the case study, (b) proposing a methodology to test the LPs, (c) testing the existence of proposed LPs. Freight trips have been extrapolated using a Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) model. Freight delivery characteristics were attributed to establishments from a sample-based probability distribution. LPs were tested using a two-step cluster analysis. Some LPs have been matched with clusters of case-study zones, subject to case study particularities. Profile overlap was not an issue and occurrences were expected. The testing showed that Logistic Profiles have the potential for being used as a departure point for urban freight planning and policy analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial processes deployed by the 15-M movement in Spain include elements of social change that exceed the limits of conventional politics. Located at a liminal level, these processes operate in the often unnoticed realm of the micro-politics of urban everyday life and the regimes of place that regulate it, providing new criteria for understanding sociospatial and urban phenomena. This article shows how public space, its representations and the spatialities associated with them have served as a support for, have determined and, ultimately, have been reshaped and transformed by the Spanish "indignados" (outraged), in particular in the city and the metropolitan area of Madrid. Drawing on a series of theoretical approaches to the articulation of recent revolts, the deployment of a prefigurative politics and the occupation of public space, I will give an experience-based account of the spatial constitution and effects of these connections in and around Madrid's Puerta del Sol. As a whole, the indignados' occupations and actions provide urban theory with conceptual and practical tools to imagine alternative forms of collective commitment in the production of spaces of hope for social progress and generalized self-management.

AB  - Soil seed banks can act as an important source in forest regeneration, and the information on the seed bank composition is vital for determining the resilience of plant communities under severe environments such as urban settings. In this study, we examined the seed bank density and functional composition, and their relationships with aboveground vegetation in three remnant evergreen broad-leaved forests, i.e., PuGang (PG), LuoGang (LG), and DaLingShan (DLS) under urbanization in Guangzhou, South China. In both years of our study (2010-2011), seed density and species richness for overall soil seed banks and each classified life forms (tree, shrub, herb and grass) significantly differed among the forests and were much higher in the PG forest. The prevailing life forms in the seed banks were herbs and grasses, and the proportion of tree species Importance Value index (IV) of the seed banks was low. We did not detect significant difference in the percentage of exotic species seeds in the seed banks among the forests. The proportion of species with animal dispersal mode was much higher in the DLS forest than in the PG and LG forests. The similarity in species composition between standing vegetation and seed banks was low with the lower value in the DLS forest than in PG and LG forest. Our findings suggest that the regeneration potential of the soil seed banks is limited for the remnant forests in urban areas. Therefore, greater proactive and enhanced conservation efforts are thus needed.

AB  - The Atlantic forest of Brazil is a biodiversity hot spot, but is extremely fragmented. Local extinction of important seed dispersers, such as primates, threatens the maintenance of these fragments. It is important to evaluate the capacity of fragment-tolerant species to disperse seeds and help maintain plant communities within fragments. Green iguanas Iguana iguana are large, fragment-tolerant, canopy-dwelling lizards and have been noted to disperse seeds. We described the seed dispersal patterns produced by green iguanas in six urban forest fragments (1.2-8ha in size) in the Atlantic forest of north-east Brazil, over 20months. A total of 294 seeds were counted in 321 scats, and 12 plant species were dispersed. The largest seeds dispersed were 14.9mm long and up to 9.2mm wide. Iguanas deposited 86.9% of scats within latrines, which were used over a mean of at least 9 months. We show that iguanas can be effective seed dispersers and might partially replicate deposition patterns produced by howler monkeys in other studies. It is critical that we improve our understanding on the functional roles played by these cryptic, yet common, iguanas in order to determine whether they could buffer the negative effects caused by the local extinction of primates from forest fragments.

Within such a diversified context, the municipality of Colmenar Viejo should be given special attention. Situated in the Manzanares basin, North of Madrid, Colmenar is currently a hybrid between its historical ambitions of market town, certain dormitory-town features and hints of an evolution towards a metropolitan sub-centre.

AB  - Land cover (LC) refers to the physical state of the Earth's surface such as soil, vegetation and water, etc. However, most LC features occur at spatial scales much finer than the resolution of the primary remote sensing satellites. In this paper, we explore the possibility of collaborative sparse unmixing for estimation and quantification of LC classes at subpixel level to obtain abundance maps in both the unconstrained and constrained forms (with abundance nonnegativity and abundance sum-to-one constraints imposed). Firstly, computer simulated noise-free and noisy data (Gaussian noise of different noise variance: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256) were unmixed with a set of global endmembers (substrate, vegetation and dark objects) in the NASA Earth Exchange. In the second set of experiments, a spectrally diverse collection of 11 cloud free scenes of Landsat-5 TM data representing an agricultural set-up in Fresno, California, USA were unmixed and validated using ground vegetation cover. Finally, Landsat-5 TM data for an area of San Francisco (an urbanized landscape), California, USA were used to assess the algorithms and compared with the fractional estimates of World View-2 data (2 m spatial resolution) for validation. The results were evaluated by using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient, RMSE, probability of success and bivariate distribution function. With computer-simulated data, both unconstrained and constrained solutions gave excellent results up to a certain noise variance, beyond which the performance in classification gradually decreased. For the agricultural setup, mean absolute error (MAE) of vegetation fraction between actual and estimated abundance values was 0.08 for both unconstrained and constrained case, and for the urban landscape, average MAE of the three classes considered was 0.73 for unconstrained and 0.07 for the constrained solution.

AB  - The organisms in aerosol microenvironments, especially densely populated urban areas, are relevant to maintenance of public health and detection of potential epidemic or biothreat agents. To examine aerosolized microorganisms in this environment, we performed sequencing on the material from an urban aerosol surveillance program. Whole metagenome sequencing was applied to DNA extracted from air filters obtained during periods from each of the four seasons. The composition of bacteria, plants, fungi, invertebrates, and viruses demonstrated distinct temporal shifts. Bacillus thuringiensis serovar kurstaki was detected in samples known to be exposed to aerosolized spores, illustrating the potential utility of this approach for identification of intentionally introduced microbial agents. Together, these data demonstrate the temporally dependent metagenomic complexity of urban aerosols and the potential of genomic analytical techniques for biosurveillance and monitoring of threats to public health.

LA  - English
AB  - Praktijkproef Amsterdam (Field Operational Test Integrated Network Management Amsterdam) is a project focused on the design and implementation of an innovative system for the coordinated deployment of traffic management measures in the regional network around the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands. On the basis of the generic functional architecture described in previous publications, monitoring and control functions were specified, implemented, tested, and tuned, both in a model environment and in practice. The focus here is on the controller design, which adapts and generalizes the master-slave structure used in the well-known HERO algorithm. It is shown how the principles are applied to use the urban arterials as storage locations for freeway metered traffic as well as to solve problems occurring on the urban arterials themselves for example, in the case of spillback or gridlock. The key control principles are explained and the resulting feedback controller is analyzed to show how to choose its parameters to ensure stability and minimize the time needed to achieve the target value. To this end, a new methodology is proposed to analyze the dynamics of the controller in relation to the control parameters for different controller designs. Finally, the implementation of the system is discussed, and preliminary tuning and evaluation results from the field tests are provided.

AB  - This article explores the issue of the acceptance of people who lived in popular neighborhoods in Bogota in the late 70s and at the beginning of the 90s. We highlight the cultural and political processes of the circumstances that defined the media, the protests, and the space where they occurred. From this scenario, we analyzed the urban development of Bogota during this period, finding a fragmented and accelerated growth in distant and disconnected occupations. We also found a marginal situation in the suburbs and in downtown Bogota. This led to wrong answers from the State and the district's administration while the inhabitants of these sectors protested in order to claim for their right to the city and to generate changes within the urban policy. All this helped create a collective identity.

KW  - social policy
KW  - affordable housing
AB  - This paper, presenting evidence from the Netherlands, aims to connect two issues that are mostly dealt with in isolation: the development of the squatters' movement and the increasing vacancy of offices in urban areas. As a result of overproduction of office space, the shrinking number of employed people and the growing popularity of the so-called ' new working arrangements', the vacancy of offices in urban areas is increasing quickly. Urban managers are faced with a significant challenge of managing these empty spaces and this paper discusses how squatting, despite an unsupportive legislative environment, has historically proliferated when vacancy rates rise.
   In order to understand contemporary policy debates surrounding this issue, this paper first sets out a brief history of the squatters'movement in the Netherlands, Europe and elsewhere. Dutch government has wrestled with the squatting issue since 1976 and has tried to control this movement by legislation. Hence, the paper provides a critical overview of legislative and practical developments affecting squatters in the Netherlands, particularly in their occupation of vacant office space. Finally, the paper considers how vacant office space might be used more effectively to provide affordable housing, with a particular focus on the role of squatting.

AB  - Urbanization changes landscape, causes destruction of natural habitats, and reduces species diversity. Urbanization can alter the interaction between fruit-bearing plants and frugivorous birds such as the Fieldfare, Turdus pilaris, and Bohemian waxwing, Bombycilla garrulus, which are the most abundant frugivorous bird species in Finland. Rowanberry, Sorbus aucuparia, is an ornamental tree species used commonly in the urban landscaping. It can promote bird diversity and the pleasantness of the urban environment for humans. The study was conducted on three spatial scales ranging from the macro scale (600 km latitudinal gradient) to the regional scale (rural vs. urban habitats), and to the micro scale (different tree parts) in three towns and their nearby rural areas in Finland. About 25 trees were photographed on each site three times during the autumn until the rowanberry fruit-crop had been used up. At the beginning of the research the crop size was larger on the urban trees than that of rural ones. The fruit removal rate was not related to the geographical location. However, in urban habitats the fruits were consumed later than in rural habitats. At the tree-level, the rowanberry fruits were removed earlier at the tops of trees. Our results suggest that earlier use of rowanberry fruits from rural habitats and tree tops may be related on human and predator-related disturbances. Our results indicated that urban rowanberry fruit crop is important food resource for frugivorous bird species in urban areas. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Amphibian populations have been declining worldwide over the last few decades due to causes like habitat modification, climate change, and emergent diseases. Hyla suweonensis, a treefrog species endemic to Korea, has disappeared from much of its historic distributional range. Past studies reported this species to breed exclusively in man-made rice paddies. This study reports the habitat characteristics of a seminatural site for H. suweonensis. Out of 100 sites where H. suweonensis was present, only one was not a rice paddy. This seminatural site was characterized by a network of swamps bordered with forests of willow trees. H. suweonensis individuals located on willow trees called from 0.2 to 1.50 m above ground at the edge of the forest near the swamps. The seminatural site has a large percentage of rice paddies with a very low percentage of urban areas, a feature consistent with findings of a previous study. H. suweonensis was found calling with two other amphibian species. Although extracted from a single site, the information from this study is important for the management and the conservation of the species.

AB  - Over 350,000 families have been evicted from their homes since Spain's property market crashed in 2008. The response of Spanish civil society has been the emergence of a networked social movement, Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH; the Spanish Mortgage Victims Group), to stop the evictions and change applicable legislation. This paper uses social movement theory and the travel of ideas metaphor from organization theory to understand how the PAH movement and its practices and tactics, originally born in Barcelona in 2009, have successfully spread to over 160 cities and stopped over 1135 evictions throughout the country. We argue that the ability of networked social movements to quickly replicate has fuelled their power to resist, protest, and induce change. We contend that the fast growth of networked social movements in Global North and South cities, is fuelled by its ability to create a hybrid space between communication networks and occupied urban space in which face-to-face assemblies and protests take place.

AB  - Background objectives: The Colombo City in Sri Lanka is experiencing tremendous development and construction of multiple storey buildings and high rise apartments. The change in housing types and microhabitats might have altered the flight and breeding behaviour of Aedes mosquito population. This study was carried out to determine the vertical dispersal and abundance of Aedes mosquitoes in multiple storey buildings in the Colombo district, with respect to abiotic factors such as rainfall, humidity and wind speed. Hence, this study is of paramount importance, particularly for planning and implementation of control measures against Aedes mosquitoes. Methods: An ovitrap based study was carried out at four selected multiple storey buildings in four residential areas located in Colombo, Sri Lanka, from August to December 2013. Results were analyzed using four indices; ovitrap index, mean number of larvae, mean number of eggs and mean number of larvae per ovipaddle. Results: The results implied that Aedes mosquitoes could be found in different elevations from ground floor to the highest floor (130 ft). There was a significant difference between height and ovitrap index (p < 0.05), and height and mean number of larvae per recovered ovipaddle (p < 0.05). The highest index value for mean number of eggs was observed as 3.492 0.655 at the 6th floor (60 ft high from ground level). At the same height (60 ft height) other indices (ovitrap index, mean number of larvae and mean number of larvae per ovipaddle) also displayed higher values, i.e. 13.19 2.98%, 1.366 0.527, and 2.070 0.421%, respectively. Abiotic factors such as wind speed, coastal nature, etc. displayed a significant effect to the vertical dispersal of Aedes mosquitoes (p < 0.05). Interpretation conclusion: The study suggested that Aedes mosquitoes are able to breed at any level of the buildings and not restricted by their height. The indices (mean number of larvae, mean number of eggs) representing the vertical dispersal with respect to abundance seemed to be statistically non-significant (p > 0.05) with height which indicates high abundance of Aedes mosquitoes at higher floors. Abiotic factors also seemed to cause significant effect to the vertical dispersal of Aedes mosquitoes in high rise buildings.

AB  - The thinking of architects from the city of Recife in the past 50 years has gone from a building-centered debate to a city-centered approach.
   In this period we watched a rearrangement amid the professional practice and the academia where the spotlight was to the gap between the fields of urbanism and architecture. Next, in this century, we watched a sort of merger between these two courses, and its name can be condensed into the idea of the urban design.
   The background of these changes is a fast growth in the amount of professionals in Recife, as well as the depletion of job opportunities in the building design sector and also the rapid scarcity of available areas for new projects in the city. This scenario has led to an increase in new projects in historical areas of the city, and with that - in a kind of counter movement - to the creation of an awareness in favor of the historical heritage of the city.
   In this 50-year period, we will show how the curricular structure of the Architecture Program of UFPE starts to abolish the courses of urbanism and architecture design and places them together now, in a common axis called integrated workshop - with an interdisciplinary approach focusing the city and no longer the building.
   Such conceptual change takes place at the same time that architects - previously divided into urbanists and building architects - start occupying the same areas of professional representation.

AB  - Both injured and uninjured box turtles (Terrapene spp.) are admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centers where they are treated and/or released. However, nothing is known of their movements, activity, and site fidelity following release. Studies of other reptiles suggest site fidelity and survival following release may be poor. We translocated 17 adult, two juvenile, and 20 hatchling Ornate Box Turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata) from a wildlife rehabilitation center in Lubbock, Texas to four sites varying in degree of urbanization. Forty percent of hatchlings remained at the original release sites, but only 24% of adults (all females) did so. Adults and hatchlings displayed roughly similar bimodal activity patterns related to time of day, and activity related to median ambient temperature range during the study period. Hatchlings were significantly more active than adults over a wider range of relative humidity and at higher relative humidity, however. Translocated hatchling home range size did not differ significantly between urban and natural release sites. Translocation of hatchling turtles may be a viable conservation strategy, though mortality of these age cohorts (25%) should be considered when planning translocations. Our data suggest translocations of adults are not likely to be successful in most cases.

AB  - Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot threatened with new introductions of marine species. As with many countries, Indonesia has a stratified shipping network of international ports linked to a large suite of domestic ports. We developed a hub and spoke network model to examine the risk associated with the secondary transfer of introduced marine species from the port hub of Tanjung Priok in Jakarta Bay to the 33 Indonesian provinces (including other ports in the Jakarta province). An 11-year shipping dataset was used (vessel next port of call records for maritime vessels that originated in Jakarta Bay and that remained in domestic waters) to derive a province ranking of vulnerability. Fifteen provinces represented almost 94% of the traffic frequency, with East Java and Jakarta provinces dominating. All urban provinces featured within the top seven highest frequency traffic provinces. Traffic patterns reflect an intra-coastal reliance on shipping, with traffic frequency decreasing with distance from Jakarta Bay. Provinces were regionalized into three categories (Lampung to East Java, Makassar Straits, and Malacca Straits) each with different vulnerabilities based on their values.

AB  - Urbanization level evaluation (ULE) is an important scientific basis for guiding urban managers to make decisions. By introducing information entropy to describe the interactions between all indicators, a holistic structural parameter its dynamic equation and self-organizing feature map simulation technique are derived to describe the structural evolution of the indicator network. In this way, a novel ULE model is universally proposed. Then, we use the model to assess the evolutionary urbanization level of Beijing during 2005-2012. We calculate structural parameter values of the indicator network with 35 microscopic indicators as nodes. The results show Beijing's urbanization level has ever kept increasing. Large increase of values in 2008 and 2012 represented significant improvements of urbanization level in these two years, while a rapid adjustment of urbanization development occurred in 2010. Five meso-scopic subsystems as urban construction, economic development, social development, ecological environment and urban-rural development affected Beijing's urbanization level in different ways. The radar chart of the model shows the contributions of economic development and urban-rural development to Beijing's urbanization changed most, while poor coordination of urban-rural development largely existed. By showing Beijing's ULE based on two analytical ways, we further discuss the objectivity and flexibility in choosing indicator network. Finally, beyond the application case, we discuss the universality and superiority of the new model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article aims to discuss how, nowadays, the city create a selective and corporative use of the territory (SANTOS, 2005) by land and real estate markets that produce artificially housing deficit through the income and speculative use of the urbanvoids which are potentially useful for a housing policy. At the same time, we intend to demonstrate how this process contributes to the emergency of homeless movements that occupy subversively urban voids, through programmed occupations, whose goal is to restore rights and break with the logic of private appropriation of the city by great capital. Our main aim is to point arguments for the necessary contextualization of distinct but complementary territorial practices that would affect the right to housing and how they would reinforce the corporative use of territory. Finally, we conclude that homeless actions, as contra-hegemonic actions (SANTOS, 2008a), result of the corporative use of territory by capital. Thus, the built environment is base for conflict operations resultant from different intentionality and distinct projects inside the city.

AB  - The study presents results of habitat creation and riparian vegetation recovery in artificial oxbow lakes in urbanized area within the large river valley. The investigation of open water, rush and wet meadows flora and vegetation in three ponds located in the city centre of Opole was conducted in years 2001-2013. Oxbow lakes were constructed as a compensation measure and no vegetation was transplanted into the ponds on purpose. 13-years observation showed that (1) the red-listed species are able to spontaneous reoccurrence after habitat restoration, but they can thrive only in first years of oxbow lakes recolonisation process, (2) there are some restoration constraints, especially in relation to Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea expansion, but alien species invasions were insignificant and (3) the species number and vegetation cover was constantly increasing during the recolonisation process in recreated oxbow lakes. The dynamic of vegetation was considerable, especially in first 6 years of experiment when the significant increase in diversity and richness of native plant species was observed. After that time, the increasing expansion of P. australis and N. lutea was noted causing the decline of several species and vegetation types. So, restoring just the environmental conditions may be sufficient for a limited period of time only. Strong disturbances, much intense that moderate inundations, imitating disastrous flooding within the valley each 10-13 years are need to maintain the ecological niches for river corridor and riparian species.

AB  - Linear spectral unmixing remains an important subject of research in image processing community. It deals with disintegrating a pixel spectrum into its constituent spectra through a mixture model assuming that observed data are linear mixtures of two or more objects, representing a mixed pixel. The linear mixture model allows a number of target materials (classes) to be present, each contributing a fraction of its unique, fixed spectrum corresponding to the area occupied by that material in a pixel. The linear model is inverted to produce estimates of those fractional abundances. The optimal solution of the mixture model can be an unconstrained solution, partially constrained solution or a fully constrained solution when the abundance non-negativity and abundance sum-to-one constraints are imposed. Although constrained algorithms are appropriate for target quantification and for estimating abundance fractions, unconstrained models are more suitable for applications seeking target detection, identification and discrimination. In this paper we perform a comparative study of five unconstrained mixture models - unconstrained least squares, orthogonal subspace projection, singular value decomposition, sparse unmixing via variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (SUnSAL) and SUnSAL Total Variation (SUnSAL TV). The algorithms are tested on computer-simulated data of various signal to noise ratio and Landsat-5 TM data of an agricultural landscape and an urban scenario. The results were validated using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient, RMSE, probability of success, and bivariate distribution function.

AB  - This paper proposes that incorporating professional expertise (e.g. landscape architects and architects) in school ground greening projects, with a commitment towards engaging in a democratic participatory process with children (known as co-design), could lead to equitable and enriching outcomes for all stakeholders. These have been documented as: learning opportunities for participating children plus their greater ownership in the process and the result, fulfilment of environmental sustainability education and stewardship responsibilities within the community for landscape architects and architects, reciprocal benefits for these professionals through achieving better outcomes due to the creative input and knowledge of place that children bring to the process, and the establishment of community-integrated green spaces and wildlife corridors within the urban fabric. The paper draws on participatory learning theory, New Zealand case study projects and international literature sources to suggest a paradigm shift to architects and landscape architects towards engaging more with schools on school ground greening and building projects as a community service. This could see them contributing to creating pedagogically and ecologically richer school grounds that are creatively designed to encourage indoor-outdoor connections, sensibly planned for maintenance and sensitively planned to increase biodiversity and provide ecosystem services within communities.

AB  - 1. The effect of a range of ecologically relevant broader spectrum street light intensities on the dispersal timing of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fry was investigated to assess the efficacy of a proposed management tool, the dimming of lamp brightness, for reducing the ecological consequences of artificial night light on aquatic ecosystems. Dispersal timing under treatment street light intensities of 8, 4, 2 and 1 lux was compared to that under a control night light intensity of 0.1 lux, representative of approximately half that experienced from a full moon. Dispersal timing was significantly delayed (by 1.4 to 2.2days), and its diel pattern significantly disrupted under the treatment street light intensities. However, the dose-response for both delay and disruption effects was not linear, with a strong effect apparent at 1 lux, and little or no additional impact seen when the light intensity was increased further. Under control conditions, the mean time of dispersal was 3:58h after dusk, with very few fry (<4%) dispersing during daylight hours. For the treatment street light intensities, the mean time of dispersal of fry was significantly later (5:31h after dusk at 1 lux) at night, and a much wider distribution of fry dispersal times was apparent with many more fry (19% at 1 lux) dispersing during daylight hours. Survival to dispersal in aquarium conditions was high (97.8%) and comparable in the control and treatment street light intensities. However, in the wild, the period between fry dispersal and the establishment of feeding territories is considered to be of critical importance in the dynamics of salmonid populations and any disruption may significantly increase predation and reduce fitness. The findings of this aquarium-based investigation suggest that the dimming of lamp brightness has little potential as a successful management strategy to reduce the disruptive impact of street lighting surrounding freshwater ecosystems. We therefore recommend that the best course of action is to maintain and increase natural unlit areas.

AB  - Utilization of movement data from mobile sports tracking applications is affected by its inherent biases and sensitivity, which need to be understood when developing value-added services for, e.g., application users and city planners. We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R-2 > 0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reptiles are commonly impacted by roads. Mortalities from road traffic are best documented in snakes, but information on roadside habitat features where snakes cross or attempt to cross roads are less frequently reported. If roadside habitat is important, then snakes should be selective of where they make a crossing. To test this hypothesis, roadside habitats where snakes crossed or attempted to cross roads were compared with roadside habitat availability in a study site in western France. Vipera aspis, Hierophis viridiflayus, Natrix natrix and N. maura crossed roads more often than expected next to woodland and low density urban areas. Road crossing locations were also compared with snake abundance in roadside habitat. Frequencies of crossings were higher than expected in woodland and high-density urban areas in relation to their abundance in these habitats. However, abundance related road crossings were less frequent than expected near hedgerows. This suggests that snakes were reluctant to emerge from a habitat pathway that connects prime habitat patches in a fragmented landscape.

AB  - This research presents Tibumbi's celebrations in Itaunas village, as narrative, as socio-cultural, historical and geographical production. The poetic dwelling creates an esthetic. Ticumbi is a congo and is the biggest local social institution. It organizes village calendar, in a network of affections. The village is inhabited by fishermen and is located in Espirito Santo's State north, at Conceicao da Barra city. This location is suitable for tourism due to the beautiful landscape. Ticumbi's visibility occurs mainly in devout celebrations around 20th January, San Sebastian's day, and in which Saint Benedict is also celebrated. This celebration's scenes can be displayed as "acts" and were, therefore, divided into five acts. We can say that this process is festive, religious, and but deeply political in Adendt's sense; so we infer that the devout celebrations are a territorial identity narrative in the landscape of Itaunas Village.

AB  - Context The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) lives in remarkably close proximity to humans in the degraded and prey-depleted landscapes in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, predominantly feeding on human organic waste.
   Aims We sought to provide an estimate of spotted hyena abundance at garbage dumps and open agricultural areas across Tigray.
   Methods We used 28 calling stations, including 12 at garbage dumps and 16 in open agricultural areas located in nine randomly selected urban districts across Tigray. We also used 65 randomly placed calling stations in three districts to establish spotted hyena abundance in Tigray. We also collected 610 scat samples during wet (n=134) and dry season (n=476) so as to identify diet.
   Key results A total of 398 hyenas responded, including 356 hyenas at garbage dumps and 42 hyenas in open agricultural areas. The response at the garbage dumps was significantly higher. Approximately 2525 hyenas were estimated from 65 calling stations in three districts. There was no statistically significant difference in the diet of hyena between wet and dry seasons for any food item. Frequency occurrence of prey remains of donkeys and cattle were dominant, followed by human, goat and sheep, respectively.
   Key conclusions We infer that a very large hyena population persists in unprotected areas of Tigray in northern Ethiopia, where they concentrate around urban waste dumps at night for scavengeable food resources, mainly originating from slaughterhouse waste of livestock.
   Implications We suggest promotion of nature-based ecotourism of this exceptional coexistence of hyenas and humans in Ethiopia. We raise questions about local hyena social structure, movement, home-range, activity pattern and the implications for human-hyena coexistence.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation strongly affects the abundance, distribution, body size and population genetics of invertebrates. Urban growth in Brazil has led to severe fragmentation, especially in the Atlantic Forest and savannas. The effects of this fragmentation on the common funnel-web spider Aglaoctenus lagotis were examined in two forest fragments within the interior savanna: a smaller fragment within an urban environment and a larger fragment within a rural environment. The reproductive period occurred in October, coinciding with the beginning of the rainy season, when the species was aggregated in the two forest fragments. The smaller fragment contained a larger population, and the spiders had a larger average prosoma size and web area. The presence of a larger population in a smaller area within the urban centre may reflect a limited dispersal ability, reduced predator abundance or low interspecific competition. The larger prosoma length and web area in the smaller habitat fragment suggest greater resource availability and a higher probability of capturing prey in the urban environment. In both areas, a larger number of capture threads was positively correlated with the presence of inquiline spiders in the webs. The genetic data indicate close similarity between and within the two areas, indicating that the species has low genetic variability or that the areas studied, consistent with their proximity, have separated only recently. Most savannas and forests in midwestern Brazil have recently undergone severe fragmentation, and further studies of this nature are needed.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic organic pollutants produced from combustion. Associated with urban runoff, they have been detected worldwide in urban wetlands. Because PAHs and their associated metabolites are often carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic, they can pose significant risks to wetland-dependent organisms. We investigated the occurrence of 16 PAHs within water samples and tissues of damselflies (Odonata: Enallagma civile, a flagship group of predatory wetland insects) from seven urban wetlands (known regionally as playas) along a constructed stormwater gradient in Lubbock, Texas. PAH detections from water samples were highly variable across sites and dates, with naphthalene and pyrene occurring most often. PAH detections in adult damselflies were also variable but significantly different from corresponding water samples (suggesting bioaccumulation rather than passive chemical exposure), with naphthalene and fluoranthene occurring most often. The number of specific PAH detections was significantly associated with percent impervious surface within 300 m of a playa, but not with position along the stormwater gradient or number of drainage inflows. Therefore, for the urban playas and odonates of Lubbock, local factors were more important in determining PAH contamination than were landscape-level factors. PAH contamination can be reduced in future urban landscape planning and design by minimizing the amount of impervious surface around stormwater retention ponds, even if they are linked along a hydrologic gradient.

AB  - Native Megalobulimus paranaguensis was identified on Brazil's Ilha Porchat promontory, an area that Achatina fulica commonly populates. The population structures of these species were investigated for interactions. Spatial distribution, niche overlap and mark-recapture analysis were conducted. The outer lip of M. paranaguensis and environmental variables were measured. One and two abundance peaks were observed for A. fulica and M. paranaguensis, respectively. Survivorship was higher in A. fulica. Distribution was aggregate for M. paranaguensis, whereas for A. fulica it varied from random to aggregate. Both species aggregate as abundance increases. The lifespan of M. paranaguensis in this location is shorter than its lifespan in a nearby location. Achatina fulica was affected by soil temperature and humidity; M. paranaguensis was influenced by humidity. Niche overlap was random. The results show that M. paranaguensis can keep its natural activity and abundance in the presence of A. fulica, but environmental degradation impacts M. paranaguensis and should be evaluated.

AB  - To block human mosquito interactions by eliminating dengue vectors, Aedes aegypti L and Aedes albopictus Skuse have been considered the main strategies for dengue prevention. Spatial targeting of dengue risk areas is the highest priority for implementing control measures. However, the frequency of human-Aedes mosquito contacts as human factors for assessing the risk of dengue has not been taken into account by past studies. The objective of this study is to clarify the geographic effects of crowd-gathering places on the frequency of dengue vector for assessing the spatial risk of exposure to dengue in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to integrate crowd-gathering places and ovitrap locations for investigating potential human mosquito contacts. A negative binominal regression was used to estimate the spatial risk of dengue by integrating vector mosquitoes from the ovitrap survey, urban environmental risk factors and human crowd-gathering places as the surrogate of human activities. We also compared the estimated spatial risk of exposure to dengue with traditional approaches. Our results indicated that the spatial distribution of the residential populations is not consistent with the locations of social activities. Additionally, people closer to crowd-gathering places have a higher frequency of contact with Ae. aegypti than with Ae. albopictus larvae. The dengue risk is caused by the human-Aedes aegypti contacts concentrated around city centers, while the risk caused by the human-Aedes albopictus contacts is distributed around the city boundary. Our study concluded that only relying on infected human cases or the abundance of vector mosquitoes is not enough for assessing the spatial risk of dengue. This reliance could ignore the areas with frequent vector existence and; therefore, result in the underestimated risk of dengue transmission. This study demonstrates the methodological framework for estimating the potential dengue risk and identifies the crowd-gathering places that facilitate dengue transmission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article from a research master's thesis entitled "THE BOARD COMPOSITION presented.

One aim of the meeting was to analyze the positions and power relations of the feminist movement against gender equality agenda of the Civic and Social Progressive Front influences how the double militancy (feminist and party). The case study method was relevant to relieve local features, the naturalist analysis was key to account for the density and intensity of feminist military in a specific and limited context of a city (and province) governed by the Progressive Front Civic and Social (which the Socialist Party has its referent, party tradition whose claim was linked to the demands of feminists and sexual diversity) and in a national policy framework and socially very polarized (in positions kirchnerismo/antikirchnerismo). While activists recognize the high incidence of "problem-Shirt" within the feminist movement, that is, the presence of party life in feminist struggles, a complex plot that goes from the recognition of the patriarchal character is also looms party politics to the deployment of a number of feminist politics made within the same (cintureo).

AB  - Crime studies are often performed in order to reduce the rate of crime in Malaysia. Most research on crime studies focus on social factor and it is often being a main reason of having burglary in residential area however, few take the responsibility of spatial layout pattern against crime. The layout of housing plays an important role to influence the incidence of crime and has to be considered. This research study proposes to examine the connectivity between housing layout in urban area and crime activity of burglary using GIS as tools of analysis. Study was conducted in several types of residential areas in Shah Alam Selangor and selected due to the crime rate report in order to distinguish all. The characteristics of housing layout such as open space, degree of road accessibility, environmental characteristics, and housing facilities are the main assessment in the course of this study. The result found that houses which faces along the main road, near the entrance of the residential area, poor surrounding landscape of housing and poor facilities inherent the high crime rate of burglary in Shah Alam. The road accessibility becomes an interesting feature in this study as nearer the house to the main road, the more vulnerable and attention for areas of housing with high tendency toward the occurrence of the crime of burglary.

AB  - The forest conservation organizations in Turkey have recommended changing the classical forest management systems to protect forest biodiversity since 2006. This study discusses the spatio-temporal analysis of forest management activities and land use changes in Yalova Forest Ecosystems, Turkey. We focused on the Yalova City because (a) it is located in a highly urbanized area, northwestern Turkey, (b) forest is a governmental ownership and producing of many non-wood forest product and wildlife species, (c) governmental organizations are encouraged to be decreased clear-cuts to protect forest ecosystems; (d) GIS databases are available in Yalova; (e) Yalova Forestry Administration has a membership of the Mediterranean Model Forest Network in 2011, and (f) many new forest policies will be developed in Turkey after the membership of the model forest . This study used forest management plans of Yalova Forest during 1971-2008 periods and analyzed data in geographic information system (GIS). Results showed that the rate of forest area in the Yalova steadily increased from 53.4 % in 1971 to 61.2 % to 62.5 % between 1994 and 2008 respectively.

AB  - Extreme hydrological events (floods, droughts) in flowing waters can alter habitat availability and structure and produce significant shifts in biodiversity, species assemblages and ecosystem processes. Extreme floods and droughts occur over large spatial extents and can greatly alter links between streams and their catchments. The nature and strengths of these links differ between degraded and intact streams and their catchments, strongly influencing the responses to and recovery from extreme events. It is essential that these catchment-stream linkages be identified and considered when planning stream restoration. Despite the scarcity of comprehensive, long-term monitoring of most stream restoration projects, our understanding of the influence of extreme events on running waters suggests both positive and negative impacts on restoration efforts. Extreme hydrological events can impair stream restoration efforts giving rise to delays or complete failures in achieving restoration objectives. Alternatively, extreme floods may facilitate progress towards restoration goals by engendering key ecological processes. Understanding the impacts and the temporal-spatial scales over which extreme events alter the ecological structure and function of streams (in both natural and damaged systems), as well as their underlying mechanisms, is a challenge for stream restorers that will only progress with the accumulation of long-term data. Restorers should recognise and plan for hydrological extreme events and their interactions with other disturbances (e.g. fire, urban development). Increasing connectivity of restoration efforts along with their spatial extent can lessen the negative effects of extreme hydrological events on stream restoration. Successful ecological stream restoration requires long time spans and thus with a changing climate the prediction of more frequent and intense extreme events only strengthens the need to incorporate their likelihood into restoration planning and implementation.

AB  - This study reports new records of Procambarus clarkii Girard, 1852 in Southeastern Brazil and investigates its possible pathways of introduction. The Brazilian crayfish pet trade was surveyed with regard to species' availability and price, reporting its persistence, even though illegal. An invasion risk analysis was performed by applying a protocol developed specifically to invasive freshwater invertebrates (FI-ISK). Procambarus clarkii has confirmed occurrences from urban and non-urban areas in the state of Sao Paulo, including the Jaragua State Park, an Atlantic Forest conservation area. The pet trade is an important introduction vector but some subsequent translocation can also be due to the release of live bait by anglers. Besides passive dispersal, these newly discovered populations, especially those located in non-urban areas, are likely to naturally disperse further through active spread and river drift of juveniles. Although confirmed colonized areas are all located in the state of Sao Paulo, the invasive risk analysis showed that P. clarkii is a potential highly invasive species for Brazil. These introductions have unknown consequences; however, many impacts are associated with this species establishment around the world, underlining the urgency to understand the invasion process in Brazil and develop efficient management techniques.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation have important consequences for population persistence by reducing dispersal, connectivity, and population size. Characterizing patterns of population genetic structure and gene flow, and testing for the genetic signature of population declines and inbreeding can provide key insights into conservation for at-risk species. We use 12 microsatellite DNA markers to quantify the spatial structuring across two regional populations of the threatened eastern hog-nosed snake (Heterodon platirhinos) in Ontario, Canada. We further test for inbreeding and recent, rapid population declines, for the latter using both a 'heterozygosity excess' approach and Approximate Bayesian computation. Spatial Bayesian assignment tests revealed four distinct genetic clusters that were not apparent from species occurrence data, suggesting that the current designation of a single management unit for this species is invalid. We found some evidence for inbreeding in all studied locales. However, heterozygosity excess tests provided only weak evidence for recent bottlenecks and varied according to mutational model specified. In contrast, ABC provided strong support for a recent and rapid reduction in population size within one sample locale (Wasaga Beach), where individuals are largely confined to a small area circumscribed by expanding urban areas. For three other locales investigated, we found equal support for either recent rapid or gradual population declines. Immediate action is required for Wasaga Beach if this population is to persist.

AB  - Since the 1970s urban spaces have increasingly been the focal point of conflict for politically active groups. Berlin, because of its occupied status, was in some aspects distinct from any other East or West German city, which is evident in the continuous negotiations between the municipal administrations and politics of both city halves to cope with the historical situation of the city. Though historical scholarship points to the transfers that occurred between East and West Berlin, this article claims that the Wall was not as permeable as the research suggests. Indeed contacts were scarce between East and West Berlin activist groups. The reason for only sporadic contact was not the Wall as such, but much more that the political groups on each side of the Wall had their own agendas. Given that East Berlin environmental groups have been the focus of a number of historical studies, this article will place the West Berlin protagonists and their actions at the center of the paper and analyze three ways of cooperation between two communal administrations and different environmental groups in East and West Berlin. It explores the circumstances under which reciprocal transfers between the different groups in East and West Berlin were possible and investigates how the environmental situation on one side of the city could influence the official politics on the other side through the geographic proximity and the common history of both city halves. It also explores the political groups and their environmental goals during the 1980s and locates these within the context of urban Berlin.

AB  - Eighteen polymorphic microsatellite loci and 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 1 095 individual Hessian fly specimens representing 23 populations from North America, southern Europe, and southwest Asia. The genotypes were used to assess genetic diversity and interrelationship of Hessian fly populations. While phylogenetic analysis indicates that the American populations most similar to Eurasian populations come from the east coast of the United States, genetic distance is least between (Alabama and California) and (Kazakhstan and Spain). Allelic diversity and frequency vary across North America, but they are not correlated with distance from the historically documented point of introduction in New York City or with temperature or precipitation. Instead, the greatest allelic diversity mostly occurs in areas with Mediterranean climates. The microsatellite data indicate a general deficiency for heterozygotes in Hessian fly. The North American population structure is consistent with multiple introductions, isolation by distance, and human-abetted dispersal by bulk transport of puparia in infested straw or on harvesting equipment.

AB  - Breeding birds in forest ecosystems are generally diverse, habitat selective, and easily sampled. Because they must integrate environmental variables over space and time, local populations of forest birds (like other animal and plant taxa) may provide meaningful signals of local forest health or degradation. We evaluated 949 breeding bird surveys in areas ranging from degraded urban/suburban forest remnants to relatively pristine old growth forests in the western Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. The "human footprint'' across this landscape was represented by a one-dimensional numeric gradient derived from land cover variables, forest fragmentation metrics, and publicly available data on housing density and transportation corridors. We used an iterative, maximum likelihood approach to quantify species-specific responses to this human disturbance gradient. Many species showed significant directional responses, consistent with known life history attributes. Other species were most commonly detected at intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, yielding unimodal responses. Relationships between the "human footprint'' and occurrences of 38 bird species were illustrated by general Gaussian functions that represented both unidirectional and unimodal patterns. These biotic response (BR) functions were combined into a bird-based index of ecological condition (IEC) ranging from 0 (maximally degraded) to 10 (minimally degraded). We described a successful application of the IEC method at the Wild Rivers Legacy Forest (WRLF), a >260 km(2) conservation landscape in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, managed primarily under a working forest conservation easement established in 2006. In general, areas within the WRLF yielded high IEC values (7.0-9.0), but nearby forest areas not under the conservation easement were characterized by significantly lower IEC values based on breeding bird assemblages.

AB  - Originating in East Asia, the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, has established in North America and Europe where it has become an urban and agricultural pest. Although initial populations in Europe were only reported in Switzerland, H. halys has expanded its range to include areas in France, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. Analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial COI gene was used to evaluate the genetic diversity of these populations and to investigate the movement and spread of different COI haplotypes of this pest in Europe. A total of 9 haplotypes are now confirmed in Europe. Four of these haplotypes have not been previously reported elsewhere, and one of these haplotypes has not been previously reported in Europe but is known from Korea. The H. halys population in Greece was the most diverse, with 7 of the 9 haplotypes occurring in the area of collection. Haplotype H1, which is known from North America, Italy, and China, was also present in samples collected in France, Greece, Hungary, and Switzerland. In fact, the H1 haplotype was the dominant haplotype detected in Budapest, Hungary and also occurred frequently in the samples from Athens, Greece. Patterns of haplotype diversity indicate the movement of successful invasive populations to generate secondary invasions within Europe ('bridgehead effect'), as well as the occurrence of multiple invasions from Asia. Scenarios regarding the movement and spread of particular haplotypes in Europe are discussed.

AB  - The main objective of the National Seismic Network for Constructions, operated by the National Institute for Research and Development in Constructions, Urban Planning and Spatial Territorial Development "URBAN-INCERC", is the monitoring of situations generated by earthquakes or other dangerous sources of vibrations induced in constructions on the entire Romanian territory. The NIRD URBAN-INCERC seismic records obtained in-situ and on buildings were and are extremely important for designers, especially in 1977, 1986 and 1990. It is the largest network in Romania, consisting of some 60 digital acceleration recorders distributed in Bucharest and in the country. This network is strategic from the population safety point of view. Due to the specific seismic hazard and vulnerability, our country shall be in preparation for the impact of a possible earthquake, which cannot be predicted in time domain, but it is possible to occur anytime. To prevent and mitigate negative consequences of such an event, urgent actions are required to ensure structural safety. Given the facts, Romania is in a critical time on strategic options regarding the seismic risks.
   Presently, a urgent necessity is the seismic network function in order to get as much as possible strong-motion data for advanced research and to understand why damages in buildings occurred. The next goal is to have more parametric and spectral data for engineering design, as well as to improve the zoning maps, having more stations at reduced distances. If possible, strong-motion micro-zonation data would explain some specific shaking differences, as a future option for local arrays.
   The paper presents the necessity, means and requirements of achieving a holistic and integrative concept for the national seismic network of constructions, taking into account geological settings, environmental and local soil conditions on regional profiles, attenuation patterns, architectural and structural patterns, and number of seismic stations in specific seismic zones. Also, a case study of building seismic instrumentation in Bucharest according to the Romanian Seismic Design code, indicative P100-1:2013.

AB  - Background: This study examined the associations of subjective and objective measures of the neighbourhood environment with the transportation physical activity of community-dwelling older persons in Singapore.
   Method: A modified version of the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) measures of the built environment characteristics were related to the frequency of walking for transportation purpose in a study sample of older persons living in high-density apartment blocks within a public housing estate in Singapore. Relevant measured variables to assess the complex relationships among built environment measures and transportation physical activity were examined using structural equation modelling and multiple regression analyses.
   Results: The subjective measures of residential density, street connectivity, land use mix diversity and aesthetic environment and the objective GIS measure of Accessibility Index have positively significant independent associations with transportation physical activity, after adjusting for demographics, socio-economic and health status.
   Conclusion: Subjective and objective measures are non-overlapping measures complementing each other in providing information on built environment characteristics. For elderly living in a high-density urban neighborhood, well connected street, diversity of land use mix, close proximity to amenities and facilities, and aesthetic environment were associated with higher frequency of walking for transportation purposes.

AB  - Genetic studies constitute a powerful approach to study the introduction and expansion of invasive species. Senecio inaequidens DC is one of the Europe's fastest plant invaders and is suspected to use railway corridors to expand. In France, the species has first been observed in the city of Paris in the late 1990's and today it is present throughout the region. In order to assess the role of railways in S. inaequidens invasion, we used innovative multivariate analyses to study population genetic diversity of this allotetraploid species. We analyzed the genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite markers of a total of 450 individuals sampled at 15 locations along railways connecting the city of Paris to the surrounding suburban/rural areas. Geographical distances among locations ranged from 1 to 83 km with four locations within Paris at the departure train stations of the national/international train lines studied. To our knowledge, studies on invasive allotetraploid plants where data were kept in the tetraploid format are still scarce. Our analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and clear genetic differentiation among some populations, with a genetic gradient detected along one railway line. Results also showed no genetic bottleneck between Parisian populations and the historically introduced population located in South of France. Our study thus revealed the role of railways as a corridor among S. inaequidens populations within central Paris. However, connecting networks appeared more complex in the suburban and rural areas suggesting other potential vectors.

AB  - The Occupy Movement ended abruptly in Toronto on November 21, 2011, after a judge of the Ontario Superior Court ruled in Batty v. City of Toronto that protesters have no right under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to remain overnight in a public park without being subject to municipal by-laws and eviction notices. Counsel for Occupy Toronto failed to recognize that while legal narratives in real life rarely correspond to narratives about the law in fictional literary works, the perceived threat to the civic order posed by the Occupy Movement was as ancient as the one depicted in Aeschylus' play The Furies. Cross-examination of the City's witnesses might have helped challenge and change that archetypal narrative. Instead, the similar outcome in The Furies and Batty v. City of Toronto suggests that in a Greek myth and in Charter litigation, "law is prophecy and nothing more" (Oliver Wendell Holmes)

AB  - Land-use change around protected areas limits their ability to conserve biodiversity by altering ecological processes such as natural hydrologic and disturbance regimes, facilitating species invasions, and interfering with dispersal of organisms. This paper informs USA National Wildlife Refuge System conservation planning by predicting future land-use change on lands within 25 km distance of 461 refuges in the USA using an econometric model. The model contained two differing policy scenarios, namely a 'business-as-usual' scenario and a 'pro-agriculture' scenario. Regardless of scenario, by 2051, forest cover and urban land use were predicted to increase around refuges, while the extent of range and pasture was predicted to decrease; cropland use decreased under the business-as-usual scenario, but increased under the pro-agriculture scenario. Increasing agricultural land value under the pro-agriculture scenario slowed an expected increase in forest around refuges, and doubled the rate of range and pasture loss. Intensity of land-use change on lands surrounding refuges differed by regions. Regional differences among scenarios revealed that an understanding of regional and local land-use dynamics and management options was an essential requirement to effectively manage these conserved lands. Such knowledge is particularly important given the predicted need to adapt to a changing global climate.

TI  - An Integrated Framework To Support Global and Local Pattern Assessment for Residential Movements
T2  - CITYSCAPE
LA  - English
AB  - Residential mobility is a defining characteristic of society in the United States. A 2003 U.S. Census Bureau migration report highlights that more than 22 million people were characterized as domestic migrants between 1995 and 2000. Understanding resulting patterns is important because it provides insights on rationale for movement and for housing, services, and supporting infrastructure implications. The method for facilitating pattern identification and exploration of movements unfortunately is lacking. It is often the case that migration and movement are considered in aggregate terms-between cities and counties in a state or region. Individual behavior reflective of a movement trajectory is therefore masked in various ways. Survey evidence also indicates that residential movements of short distance-for example, those occurring within a city or county-reflect the greatest proportion of total migrations. To address limitations, this research proposes a framework integrating spatial analytical methods to support pattern analysis for individual movements, relying on detailed information of origin and destination change. The framework can explore the patterns at both the global and local levels. The framework is designed using various visual analytic interfaces coupled with statistical evaluation and significance testing, representing both exploratory and confirmatory assessment. The integrated framework is applied to study residential movement involving 2,636 housing changes in Franklin County, Ohio, and effectively estimates some special global and local patterns from those events.

AB  - With the recent development of the Occupy Movement, public criticism of neoliberalism has climaxed since the onset of a global financial crisis in late 2008. The mobilization of protesters in cities throughout the world was preceded by much speculation in the media and blogosphere over the past few years, where commentators have been quick to suggest that the end of neoliberalism is upon us. The validity of postneoliberalism, however, remains tenuous, as its advocates continue to treat neoliberalism as a monolithic, static, and undifferentiated end-state. Despite the desire to move beyond neoliberal strictures, there is an undeniable continuity to neoliberalism that must be appreciated if we ever hope to leave this unforgiving version of capitalism truly in the past.

AB  - Hybridization between domestic and wild animals is a major concern for biodiversity conservation, and as habitats become increasingly fragmented, conserving biodiversity at all levels, including genetic, becomes increasingly important. Except for tropical forests and true deserts, African wildcats occur across the African continent; however, almost no work has been carried out to assess its genetic status and extent of hybridization with domestic cats. For example, in South Africa it has been argued that the long-term viability of maintaining pure wildcat populations lies in large protected areas only, isolated from human populations. Two of the largest protected areas in Africa, the Kgalagadi Transfrontier and Kruger National Parks, as well as the size of South Africa and range of landscape uses, provide a model situation to assess how habitat fragmentation and heterogeneity influences the genetic purity of African wildcats. Using population genetic and home range data, we examined the genetic purity of African wildcats and their suspected hybrids across South Africa, including areas within and outside of protected areas. Overall, we found African wildcat populations to be genetically relatively pure, but instances of hybridization and a significant relationship between the genetic distinctiveness (purity) of wildcats and human population pressure were evident. The genetically purest African wildcats were found in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, while samples from around Kruger National Park showed cause for concern, especially combined with the substantial human population density along the park's boundary. While African wildcat populations in South Africa generally appear to be genetically pure, with low levels of hybridization, our genetic data do suggest that protected areas may play an important role in maintaining genetic purity by reducing the likelihood of contact with domestic cats. We suggest that approaches such as corridors between protected areas are unlikely to remain effective for wildcat conservation, as the proximity to human settlements around these areas is projected to increase the wild/domestic animal interface. Thus, large, isolated protected areas will become increasingly important for wildcat conservation and efforts need to be made to prevent introduction of domestic cats into these areas.

AB  - Land that is of great value for conservation can also be highly suitable for human use, resulting in competition between urban development and the protection of natural resources. To assess the effectiveness of proposed regional land conservation strategies in the context of rapid urbanization, we measured the impacts of simulated development patterns on two distinct conservation goals: protecting priority natural resources and limiting landscape fragmentation. Using a stochastic, patch-based land change model (FUTURES) we projected urbanization in the North Carolina Piedmont according to status quo trends and several conservation-planning strategies, including constraints on the spatial distribution of development, encouraging infill, and increasing development density. This approach allows simulation of population-driven land consumption without excluding the possibility of development, even in areas of high conservation value. We found that if current trends continue, new development will consume 11% of priority resource lands, 21% of forested land, and 14% of farmlands regionally by 2032. We also found that no single conservation strategy was optimal for achieving both conservation goals. For example, strategies that excluded development from priority areas caused increased fragmentation of forests and farmlands, while infill strategies increased loss of priority resources proximal to urban areas. Exploration of these land change scenarios not only confirmed that a failure to act is likely to result in irreconcilable losses to a conservation network, but that all conservation plans are not equivalent in effect, highlighting the importance of analyzing tradeoffs between alternative conservation planning approaches.

AB  - We monitored the last remaining Asian elephant populations in China over the past decade. Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, alpha and beta, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu'Er) carried mtDNA from the a clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the a clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region.

AB  - Localism has become dominant in mainstream Hong Kong identity politics after the occupation period of the Umbrella Movement. This localism demonstrates the will of Hong Kong people to reclaim their own destiny, to reject the authoritarian rule of Beijing and to reclaim unique local cultural identities as different from China, e.g. uphold universal values and cosmopolitanism. However, this localism neither shares a unified cultural imaginary and symbolic order nor a single operational logic. There are at least two major kinds of localism in Hong Kong, i.e. one whose logic is based on anti-China blaming of the immigrant (i.e. xenophobia and exclusionary politics), and one whose modus operandi is to rebuild local communities (i.e. based on progressive, participatory, democratic values of inclusion, diversity and empowerment of the weak). These two polarized localisms often coexist. The question is which one takes the lead or even becomes hegemonic in a situation or context. This article re-examines the emergence and transformation of localism in the last decade through participant observation in Hong Kong urban social movements. Instead of explaining why xenophobic localism (blaming the immigrant) becomes a dominant political power, we will take a closer look at the transformation of the progressive and recalcitrant localism through community rebuilding movement, or simply New Preservation Movement as the actually existing alternative.

AB  - Internet is one of the basic requirements of the current age. Rural areas, particularly in the developing countries, do not have access to internet. Infrastructure based communication is very expensive, which makes it infeasible for the inhabitants of the backward areas. The presence of sparse nodes in the rural areas compared with urban areas decreases the chances of interaction among nodes. This can result in communication delay. In this paper, we propose a social interest based routing scheme that incorporates user interest into working movement model for delivery of data. Leveraging the diversity of interest in bus movement and placing the Throw box in the evening activity places in the working movement model, the proposed scheme achieves higher delivery probability. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme since delivery probability as high as 0.81 is attained. Furthermore, average cost and average latency is also improved.

AB  - Context. In peri-urban environments, high availability of anthropogenic resources may result in relatively high abundances of some species, with potentially negative implications for other native biota. Effective management of such impacts requires understanding of the spatial ecology of problem species. However, home range and habitat use have not been described for the little raven (Corvus mellori), a superabundant native predator that occurs in urban and natural habitats, including those where threatened shorebirds breed.
   Aims. The aim of this study was to provide basic information on little raven home range, habitat use and movements in a coastal peri-urban landscape.
   Methods. Between October 2011 and January 2012 we radio-tracked 20 little ravens captured in a coastal wetland (near Melbourne, Australia).
   Key results. Little ravens were highly mobile, moving up to 9.9 km in an hour (median = 2 km), and had large ranges: Minimum Convex Polygons were 1664-9989 ha (median = 3362 ha). Although most birds used both anthropogenic and natural habitats, some birds strongly selected for coastal wetland habitat. Birds used multiple roosts during the study period, most of which occurred in grassland (58.7%) or urban (22.3%) areas. Movement of up to 8.3 km (median = 2.2 km) between roosts during the night was also detected.
   Conclusions. Ravens were highly mobile and used large home ranges and a variety of habitats, with habitat preferences varying between birds.
   Implications. Considering the large home ranges and inter-individual variation in habitat preferences of little raven populations, localised management to reduce their impacts on breeding shorebirds is unlikely to be successful.

AB  - In the 1980s, the red border town, as Potsdam was called then, was a center of the East German left-wing punk and skinhead movement; as a countermovement it soon became a location for right-wing extremist violence and counter-violence. To confront right-wing organizing, Antifa groups were established in Potsdam and other towns nearby, bringing the taboo topic of neo-Nazism as a social problem to the public's attention. Initially, the SED state tried to downplay the confrontations as typical conflicts between youth groups; however, the newly founded Antifa groups were openly criminalized from the start. This course of action led to protests by both the left-wing alternative scene and the political civil rights movement. In memorandums and practical political actions, the Antifa groups fundamentally criticized the state, its failure to mold a socialist people, its militarization of society, and the state-enforced consensus of silence. In 1989, this critical approach became a part of the revolutionary, pro-democratic protest and reform movement, and Potsdam's anti-Nazi League itself became an active factor of local revolutionary upheaval, a factor that has been largely ignored by research as well as memorial culture. This article uses the city of Potsdam as an example of how communicationa democratic process in itselfbetween subcultures and information transfer occurred between the center and periphery, that is, socialist capital, district town and surroundings. In addition, the article will also analyze the Antifa movement as a political and urban phenomenon of town environments and follows the question as to which locations the confrontations arose and why.

The theoretical and methodological driving is based the qualitative approach, endorsed by the dialectical method, showing the relationships established in the different school construction process, using the literature and document analysis. Brings as fundamental public policies for indigenous education and cultural diversity concepts, ethnic, indigenous education and indigenous school. Verifies the claims of organizations / indigenous communities of Manaus, by offering differentiated education. Identifies the actions of the municipal government in response to indigenous demands in the light of national guidelines for indigenous school. The survey results find that the municipal government has advanced the definition of guidelines and action plans for the organization of indigenous education, under the demands of the indigenous movement. However, the implementation of indigenous education has not materialized, remaining as a challenge to be overcome by the municipal government of Manaus.

AB  - This text deals with the theory of world risk society, developed by Ulrich Beck, as a tool for understanding Jornadas de Junho movement in Brazil, as well as other social protest movements (such as the events associated to Ocuppy and Indignados). Emerging in the urban environment in the last decade, these events associated the problem of living in cities to a radical criticism of the political and economic world order. The goal is not to offer a definitive comprehension about the social protest movements but, on the contrary, reflecting critically about important concepts presented in Beck's theory, therefore discussing the extent to which these notions could contribute to the clarification of the political meaning of these events. Drawn up in the form of essay, the text argues, under various angles, by the advantages and limits of Beck's Sociology of risk, highlighting a counterpoint with those new critical theories committed with the purpose of thinking political subjectivity as event, like it occurs in Jacques Ranciere and Slavoj Zizek.

AB  - Rising levels of nitrogen (N) deposition are influencing urban forest carbon (C) and N dynamics due to greater human disturbance compared to those in rural areas. N deposition in combination with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water limitation may alter C and N storage in urban forests. This review aimed to provide a better understanding of N and C storage under N deposition scenarios in urban forests.
   Globally, fuel combustion and biomass burning contribute in approximately 70 and 16 % of the NOx emission respectively. It is also estimated that NHy and NOx are two to four times higher in urban forests compared to rural areas. However, higher N deposition may not always result in increased N and C storage in urban forests. In fact, urban forests may even show early symptoms of N and C losses under climate change. For example, urban forests in fire-prone areas require higher frequency of burning to reduce the threat of wildfires, leading to an acceleration of C and N loss. Additionally, chronic N deposition may result in an early N loss in urban forests due to faster N saturation and soil acidification in urban forests compared to rural forests. Studies of N deposition on urban forests using N isotope composition (delta N-15) also showed that N loss from urban forests can occur through the direct leaching of the deposited NO3 (-)-N. We also noted that using different N-15 signal of soil and plant in combination of tree ring delta N-15 may provide a better understanding of N movement in urban forests.
   Although urban forests may become a source of C and N faster than rural forests, N-limited urban forests may benefit from N deposition to retain both N and C stocks longer than non-N-limited urban forests. Appropriate management practices may also help to delay such symptoms; however, the main source of emission still needs to be managed to reduce both N deposition and rising atmospheric CO2 in urban forests. Otherwise, the N and C stocks in urban forests may further decline when prolonged drought conditions under global climate change increase the frequency of fires and reduce plant photosynthesis.

AB  - The WRF-Noah-urban canopy model (UCM) coupled modeling system is used to investigate the influence of urbanization on a typical frontal rainfall event that occurred in June 2008 over the greater Beijing metropolitan area (GBMA). The comparison between results of two experiments with and without the presence of urban areas suggests that more precipitation can be induced over and in the area downwind of Beijing because of the urbanization effects while less rainfall is found in the upwind region of central urban areas. The urbanization effects delay the onset of precipitation over Beijing but keep it sustained for a longer period with stronger rainfall intensity. The underlying urban surface not only retards the cold-frontal movement but also favors the development of a wet and unstable atmosphere. This explains why the precipitation can be sustained for a longer time with higher rainfall intensity over urban areas. From analyses of a density-current speed equation, it is found that the abrupt pressure jump during the frontal passage has a significant influence on the cold-frontal movement. A method derived from the surface pressure tendency equation is used to explore the mechanism of urban effects on the cold-frontal system. The cold advection is less intense in the experiment with urban land surface than in the experiment with urban areas replaced by cropland. Hence, the weaker-than-normal cold advection and subsequent smaller pressure jump during the frontal passage over the GBMA are the major mechanisms behind the urbanization effects, which lead to the retardation of the cold-frontal movement and late onset of precipitation over the GBMA.

AB  - Populations around the world are rapidly ageing, with some of the fastest change occurring in less-developed countries. One of the key determinants of the capabilities of older people, and whether they can achieve the things that are meaningful to them, is the environment in which they live. There is growing interest globally on how to foster "age-friendly" environments, and the World Health Organization's Global Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities now includes over 250 member cities with responsibility for around 100 million people. This paper outlines the background to the Network and describes some innovative strategies being adopted by members in different parts of the world.

AB  - The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Rhynchophorinae), which is one of the most serious pests of palm plants, was first found in China in the city of Wenchang (Hainan Province) in the 1990s and has now expanded to South China, including Fujian Province. In this paper, we provide a genetic characterization and determine the genetic relationships among geographic populations of RPW in Fujian using microsatellite loci and cytochrome oxidase subunit (COI) sequences. The results indicate a low-level microsatellite diversity of RPW. Four genetic clusters of RPW were found in Fujian. No correlation was detected between the genetic and geographical distances in the microsatellite data. The mitochondrial COI sequence analyses revealed a high level of diversity in the Fujian populations. Eleven haplotypes were detected, and these included eight haplotypes that were different from those found earlier in Mediterranean, Middle East, Japanese, and other populations. Significant genetic variations were observed mainly within populations, both with microsatellites and with COI sequences. Low gene flow among the populations was observed. Our results indicate that the nuclear allelic diversity was low compared with the microsatellite results from populations in Wardan and Oman, but the mitochondrial diversity was not reduced to a similar extent. The low level of the genetic structure of RPW is related to the limited flight capacity of RPW and human-aided dispersal rather than to the geographic distance.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion is a major contributor to environmental change in many parts of the world. This study investigated land cover changes that occurred between 1988 and 2010 in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor in Alberta, a region that has undergone considerable recent urban expansion. We used satellite imagery to develop land cover maps for four different snapshots in time between 1988 and 2010 and used these maps to investigate two principal questions related to urban expansion: (1) How did urban expansion affect other land cover types? and (2) How did urban expansion affect the availability of high-quality agricultural land in the region? Our results show that 60 % of new urban and peri-urban growth between 1988 and 2010 occurred on agricultural land. Nevertheless, total agricultural land increased in the region because of the greater clearing of natural vegetation for agriculture away from the urban core. Urban expansion predominantly occurred on soils that were highly suitable for farming, while new agricultural expansion occurred on soils of poorer quality. As a result, the average soil quality of land used for agriculture has declined in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor, confirming other studies of the food security implications of urbanization.

AB  - Research benefits increasingly from valuable contributions by citizen scientists. Mostly, participating adults investigate specific species, ecosystems or phenology to address conservation issues, but ecosystem functions supporting ecosystem health are rarely addressed and other demographic groups rarely involved. As part of a project investigating seed predation and dispersal as ecosystem functions along an urban-rural gradient, we tested whether elementary school children can contribute to the project as citizen scientists. Specifically, we compared data estimating vegetation cover, measuring vegetation height and counting seeds from a seed removal experiment, that were collected by children and scientists in schoolyards. Children counted seeds similarly to scientists but under-or overestimated vegetation cover and measured different heights. We conclude that children can be involved as citizen scientists in research projects according to their skill level. However, more sophisticated tasks require specific training to become familiarized with scientific experiments and the development of needed skills and methods.

AB  - A double referent connoting both movement and immobility, the border region has been, for more than a century, the setting for those who come to stay, those who try to cross over into the United States, and, more recently, those who are deported from the US. Accordingly, the religious practices in this area flow along with the shifting populations and are transformed by them. From a socio-anthropological perspective, this article examines the main religious figures venerated in the city of Tijuana, located just south of the US-Mexico border, and the social contexts of their devotees, who have come from other parts of Mexico. This religious panorama does not display a homogeneous group of creeds, but rather reflects a variety of regional traditions in which religion is practiced and divine figures are revered.

AB  - Road density and proportion of urban area are considered to be useful indicators of invasion risk from non-native plants. However, the mechanisms behind the relationship between these indicators and establishment of non-native species have rarely been addressed explicitly. To identify these mechanisms, we used a species distribution model (MaxEnt) for an invasive ornamental weed Rudbeckia laciniata using road density and proportion of urban area as explanatory variables, along with soil moisture and solar radiation. Overall model performance is relatively high (AUC = 0.91). Road density explained most R. laciniata occurrence, followed by the proportion of urban area. The occurrence probability of R. laciniata increased monotonically with road density, but the rates of increase constantly fell. The occurrence probability also increased with urban area when the proportion of urban area was small, but started to decrease when the proportion of urban area reached 0.2. Our results suggest that both road density and proportion of urban area are important factors in determining R. laciniata establishment but work differently.

AB  - Anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic (erosion) processes contribute to the continuing presence of asbestos and nonasbestos elongated mineral particles (EMP) of amphibole and serpentine in air and water of urban, rural, and remote environments. The anthropogenic processes include disturbance and deterioration of asbestos-containing materials, mining of amphibole- and serpentine-bearing rock, and disturbance of soils containing amphibole and serpentine. Atmospheric dispersal processes can transport EMP on a global scale. There are many methods of establishing the abundance of EMP in air and water. EMP include cleavage fragments, fibers, asbestos, and other asbestiform minerals, and the methods employed do not critically distinguish among them. The results of most of the protocols are expressed in the common unit of fibers per square centimeter; however, seven different definitions for the term "fiber" are employed and the results are not comparable. The phase-contrast optical method used for occupational monitoring cannot identify particles being measured, and none of the methods distinguish amphibole asbestos from other EMP of amphibole. Measured ambient concentrations of airborne EMP are low, and variance may be high, even for similar environments, yielding data of questionable value for risk assessment. Calculations based on the abundance of amphibole-bearing rock and estimates of asbestos in the conterminous United States suggest that amphibole may be found in 6-10% of the land area; nonanthropogenic erosional processes might produce on the order of 400,000 tons or more of amphibole per year, and approximately 50 g asbestos/km(2)/yr; and the order of magnitude of the likelihood of encountering rock bearing any type of asbestos is approximately 0.0001.

AB  - Field observations of landslide movements in residential area induced by the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (M9.0) were conducted. The Midorigaoka 4-chome (Midorigaoka #4) subdivision in the southern part of Sendai City sprawled across the flatland stretching between the terrace and valley floor. The large landslides, the Midorigaoka #4 landslide, occurred in the widening fills of the lower part of this subdivision. The fills consist of soft and loose mixed bedrock material, sand, clay, and sandy silt with gravel. The ground water level was very shallow-0.5 to 1.1 m below the ground surface. Measurements on ground inclination using borehole inclinometers, and pore water pressure changes were made from June 2011 with high precision time interval of 100 Hz. The inclination measurement results indicate the self-dumping at the weak layers in ground structure. The effects of self-dumping varied depend on the thickness of weak layers and distance from epicenters. Excess pore water pressure in the landslide increased in direct proportion to horizontal peak ground velocity (PGV) during earthquakes. The failure process at the slip layer of landslide developed from small local failures to landslide movement was found by chance. The performance of landslide during strong motion has not been discussed based on observed facts. Precise field observation on landslide movement during earthquake should be significant to mitigate the landslide risk in urban region.

AB  - This article introduces a protest news framing cycle and presents the results of a longitudinal analysis of news attention and framing of protest movements. To identify the frame-changing dynamic occurring over time, a content analysis of the news coverage of Occupy Wall Street was conducted on 228 articles and 37 editorials in The New York Times from the start of the protest in September 2011 until long after the protest had subsided in July 2014. The article identifies longitudinal changes in news frames about the economic substance of the protest and the ensuing conflict between protesters and city officials during the occupation. Findings suggest that conflict had a significant impact on the number of news stories about the protest. Further, the results demonstrate how news framing opportunities changed as the movement reached different stages of the news attention cycle. As the movement grew, journalists focused on the movement's economic grievances, including economic inequality, bank bailouts, and foreclosures. As the movement peaked, news attention shifted to the intensifying conflict between city officials and protesters.

AB  - Stream temperatures in urban watersheds are influenced to a high degree by changes in landscape and climate, which can occur at small temporal and spatial scales. Here, we describe a modelling system that integrates the distributed hydrologic soil vegetation model with the semi-Lagrangian stream temperature model RBM. It has the capability to simulate spatially distributed hydrology and water temperature over the entire network at high time and space resolutions, as well as to represent riparian shading effects on stream temperatures. We demonstrate the modelling system through application to the Mercer Creek watershed, a small urban catchment near Bellevue, Washington. The results suggest that the model was able to produce realistic streamflow and water temperature predictions that are consistent with observations. We use the modelling construct to characterize impacts of land use change and near-stream vegetation change on stream temperatures and explore the sensitivity of stream temperature to changes in land use and riparian vegetation. The results suggest that, notwithstanding general warming as a result of climate change over the last century, there have been concurrent increases in low flows as a result of urbanization and deforestation, which more or less offset the effects of a warmer climate on stream temperatures. On the other hand, loss of riparian vegetation plays a more important role in modulating water temperatures, in particular, on annual maximum temperature (around 4 degrees C), which could be mostly reversed by restoring riparian vegetation in a fairly narrow corridor - a finding that has important implications for management of the riparian corridor.

AB  - Increasing populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in urban areas have resulted in an increase in deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). Deer-vehicle collisions represent a human-wildlife conflict of serious concern, given that they result, most notably, in significant risk to human safety, deer mortality, and costly vehicle damage. Although many communities have developed databases that track the frequency and location of DVCs, there is a need for analysis of the factors that affect DVC locations in urban areas. Data on deer movement patterns across roads in urban areas are valuable to reduce the occurrence of DVCs on existing roads and to assist planning of future urban road design and placement. Using DVC data from 2005 to 2009 provided by the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation, we found that DVCs in Winnipeg, Canada, were not spatially or temporally random, and that human-induced deer movement patterns play a role in the frequency and location of DVC occurrence. Deer-vehicle collisions occurred more frequently near suburban areas and grasslands and were clustered near where people provided food for deer. A ban on feeding deer may help reduce the frequency of DVCs.

AB  - Few biologists have studied the evolutionary processes at work in indoor environments. Yet indoor environments comprise approximately 0.5% of ice-free land area - an area as large as the subtropical coniferous forest biome. Here we review the emerging subfield of 'indoor biome' studies. After defining the indoor biome and tracing its deep history, we discuss some of its evolutionary dimensions. We restrict our examples to the species found in human houses - a subset of the environments constituting the indoor biome - and offer preliminary hypotheses to advance the study of indoor evolution. Studies of the indoor biome are situated at the intersection of evolutionary ecology, anthropology, architecture, and human ecology and are well suited for citizen science projects, public outreach, and large-scale international collaborations.

AB  - Objective: The physiological demands of 15 essential, physically demanding fire-fighting tasks were investigated to identify criterion tasks for bona fide recruit selection. Methods: A total of 51 operational firefighters participated in discrete, field-based occupational simulations, with physiological responses measured throughout. Results: The most stressful tasks were identified and classified according to dominant fitness attributes and movement patterns. Three movement classes (single-sided load carriage [5 tasks], dragging loads [4 tasks], and overhead pushing and holding objects [2 tasks]) and one mandatory strength task emerged. Seven criterion tasks were identified. Load holding and carriage dominated these movement patterns, yet no task accentuated whole-body endurance. Conclusion: Material handling movements from each classification must appear within a physical aptitude (selection) test for it to adequately represent the breadth of tasks performed by Australian urban firefighters.

AB  - The Great Beijing Metropolitan Area (GBMA), located in North China, is one of the most rapidly developing regions in the world. In this study, ensemble simulations are conducted to investigate the urban effects on a summertime heavy rainfall event in the GBMA. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that couples with a single-layer Urban Canopy Model (UCM) is used for the ensemble simulation. Results show that the ensemble simulation with a realistic land-use representation of urban areas (i.e. control run) can well reproduce the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the rainfall event. The simulated total precipitation agrees well with observation. Compared with the sensitivity ensemble simulation, in which the urban area is replaced by cropland, the control run generates more precipitation over the southwest of Beijing, while less rainfall is found in the area to the northeast of Beijing. This result suggests that the underlying urban surface and urban canopy physics in the surface layer have remarkable impacts on precipitation. The stronger upward motion along with larger convergence and more moisture transportation caused by the urban dynamic and thermodynamic effects directly contribute to the differences in rainfall distribution between the control run and the sensitivity run. In addition, the urban effects are found to slow the cold front movement due to the intense warm air over the urban area, leading to a delayed occurrence of the peak rainfall. However, the slow-moving cold front over the urban area enhances the maximum precipitation intensity. The evolution of the rainfall pattern during the intensification period of the precipitation event is dependent on the movement of the cold front in both the control and sensitivity experiments, indicating that urban effects tend to modify the precipitation distribution and influence the temporal variation of the rainfall process.

AB  - The endangered Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) is restricted to eastern Oklahoma and western and north-central Arkansas, where populations may be susceptible to losses of genetic variation due to patchy distribution of colonies and potentially small effective population sizes. We used mitochondrial D-loop DNA sequences and 15 nuclear microsatellite loci to determine population connectivity among Ozark big-eared bat caves. Assessment of 7 caves revealed a haplotype not detected in a previous study (2002-2003) and gene flow among colonies in eastern Oklahoma. Our data suggest genetic mixing of individuals, which may be occurring at nearby swarming sites in the autumn. Further evidence of limited gene flow between caves in Oklahoma with a cave in Arkansas highlights the importance of including samples from geographically widespread caves to fully understand gene flow in this subspecies. It appears autumn swarming sites and winter hibernacula play an important role in providing opportunities for mating; therefore, we suggest protection of these sites, maternity caves, and surrounding habitat to facilitate gene flow among populations of Ozark big-eared bats.

AB  - Urban expansion replaces wetlands of natural origin with artificial stormwater management facilities. The literature suggests that efforts to mimic natural wetlands in the design of stormwater facilities can expand the provision of ecosystem services. Policy developments seek to capitalize on these improvements, encouraging developers to build stormwater wetlands in place of stormwater ponds; however, few have compared the biophysical values and social perceptions of these created wetlands to those of the natural wetlands they are replacing. We compared four types of wetlands: natural references sites, natural wetlands impacted by agriculture, created stormwater wetlands, and created stormwater ponds. We anticipated that they would exhibit a gradient in biodiversity, ecological integrity, chemical and hydrologic stress. We further anticipated that perceived values would mirror measuredbiophysical values. We found higher biophysical values associated with wetlands of natural origin (both reference and agriculturally impacted). The biophysical values of stormwater wetlands and stormwater ponds were lower and indistinguishable from one another. The perceived wetland values assessed by the public differed from the observed biophysical values. This has important policy implications, as the public are not likely to perceive the loss of values associated with the replacement of natural wetlands with created stormwater management facilities. We conclude that 1) agriculturally impacted wetlands provide biophysical values equivalent to those of natural wetlands, meaning that land use alone is not a great predictor of wetland value; 2) stormwater wetlands are not a substantive improvement over stormwater ponds, relative to wetlands of natural origin; 3) stormwater wetlands are poor mimics of natural wetlands, likely due to fundamental distinctions in terms of basin morphology, temporal variation in hydrology, ground water connectivity, and landscape position; 4) these drivers are relatively fixed, thus, once constructed, it may not be possible to modify them to improve provision of biophysical values; 5) these fixed drivers are not well perceived by the public and thus public perception may not capture the true value of natural wetlands, including those impacted by agriculture.

TI  - Understanding Human Mobility from Twitter
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Understanding human mobility is crucial for a broad range of applications from disease prediction to communication networks. Most efforts on studying human mobility have so far used private and low resolution data, such as call data records. Here, we propose Twitter as a proxy for human mobility, as it relies on publicly available data and provides high resolution positioning when users opt to geotag their tweets with their current location. We analyse a Twitter dataset with more than six million geotagged tweets posted in Australia, and we demonstrate that Twitter can be a reliable source for studying human mobility patterns. Our analysis shows that geotagged tweets can capture rich features of human mobility, such as the diversity of movement orbits among individuals and of movements within and between cities. We also find that short-and long-distance movers both spend most of their time in large metropolitan areas, in contrast with intermediate-distance movers' movements, reflecting the impact of different modes of travel. Our study provides solid evidence that Twitter can indeed be a useful proxy for tracking and predicting human movement.

AB  - Highways provide commuter traffic and goods movement among regions and cities through wild, protected areas. Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) can occur frequently when wildlife are present, impacting drivers and animals. Because collisions are often avoidable with constructed mitigation and reduced speeds, transportation agencies often want to know where they can act most effectively and what kinds of mitigation are cost-effective. For this study, WVC occurrences were obtained from two sources: 1) highway agencies that monitor carcass retrieval and disposal by agency maintenance staff and 2) opportunistic observations of carcasses by participants in two statewide systems, the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS; http://wildlifecrossing.net/california) and the Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch (MAWRW; http://wildlifecrossing.net/maine). Between September, 2009 and December 31, 2014, >33,700 independent observations of >450 vertebrate species had been recorded in these online, form-based informatics systems by >1,300 observers. We asked whether or not WVC observations collected by these extensive, volunteer-science networks could be used to inform transportation-mitigation planning. Cluster analyses of volunteer-observed WVC were performed using spatial autocorrelation tests for parts or all of 34 state highways and interstates. Statistically-significant WVC hotspots were modeled using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. High density locations of WVC, that were not necessarily hotspots, were also visualized. Statistically-significant hotspots were identified along similar to 7,900 km of highways. These hotspots are shown to vary in position from year to year. For highways with frequent deer-vehicle collisions, annual costs from collisions ranged from US$0 to >US$30,000/km. Carcass clusters from volunteer data had very little or no overlap with similar findings from agency-collected WVC data, during a different time-range. We show that both state agency-collected and volunteer-collection of WVC observations could be useful in prioritizing mitigation action at US state-scales by state transportation agencies to protect biodiversity and driver safety Because of the spatial extent and taxonomic accuracy at which volunteer observations can be collected, these may be the most important source of data for transportation agencies to protect drivers and wildlife.

AB  - Understanding the population genetic structure and demographic history helps in the management and restoration of endangered species. Cycas panzhihuaensis (Panzihihua sago palm) is narrowly distributed in the eastern Sichuan Basin of China. The only extant population is in the Panzhihua Cycad Nature Reserve (PCNR), which is close to Panzhihua City, and is threatened by the mining industry and slash-and-burn agriculture. To protect this rare species, the local government implemented an ex situ conservation project. In this study, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to explore the genetic diversity of wild and cultivated populations. Two evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) in PCNR were determined based on significant differences in genetic diversity and demographic histories. The western ESU has low genetic diversity and shares common genotypes with a part of the eastern ESU. The founder effect is suggested as the best-fit scenario to explain the current genetic distribution among the eastern and western ESUs. Small carrying capacity limits both census and effective population sizes, and the gene surfing hypothesis explains the high frequency of fixed alleles without private alleles in multiple loci in the western subpopulation. Every cultivated population, established for either conservation or horticultural purposes, has only genotypes from a single ESU. Supplementary collection for ex situ conservation is suggested to preserve the genetic features of C. panzhihuaensis.

AB  - Humans are greatly modifying biogeochemical cycles, in part, by increasing the abundance of many trace elements in heavily developed environments. As a means to study the biogeochemical cycling of trace elements in the urban landscape, we examined their accumulation in the sediments of ponds located in residential developments. To do so, we measured the content of trace elements (Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ag, Cd, Ba, Tl, Pb) and minerals (Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Mn, Fe) in the sediments of stormwater management ponds located in residential catchments of southern Ontario, Canada. Trace elements and associated mineral composition of the sediments primarily clustered in three groups. In one group, several trace elements (e.g., Co and V) were correlated to soil-related minerals (Al and Fe), which indicate a predominant role of soil erosion in their movement across the urban landscape. Elements in the second group (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Mo) were positively correlated with sediment organic carbon content suggesting an importance of internal pond processing such as adsorption to organic matter. In the third group, Ca and Ag negatively correlated with most other elements likely because, at least for Ca, importation of carbonates in coarse particulate material (i.e., sand) dilutes the concentration of other trace elements. Variability in trace elements among ponds and between municipalities suggests that these elements are deposited and move differently among catchments in a relatively homogenous urban landscape. Our results demonstrate a trace element biogeochemistry in urban environments that is connected to human sources, physical disturbance of the landscape, biological processing, and underlying geological composition of the catchment.

AB  - Subway system is a critical and fundamental urban infrastructure and provides essential transport services for promoting economic development and social stability. Due to the serious result of operation interruption and accident, it is increasingly important for risk management to be proactive, targeted, and effective. In this paper, a new framework based on network theory and FMECA method is proposed to study the vulnerability of subway system, in the form of analyzing network efficiency by network theory and risk matrix in FMECA method. Then, a case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the framework in identifying the vulnerable and critical functional module in subway system and assessing severity of its failure modes. In the end, an organizational structure is put forward from three aspects of operation, research, and manufacturer for improving the subway safety level. This research would be conducive to provide recommendations and suggestions regarding safety provisions for subway operation to reduce the occurrence of accidental failures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Collaborative Performances of Resistance in Twenty-First Century Toronto: Occupy Toronto and The Encampment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES
LA  - English
AB  - This essay examines connections between protest camps and artist interventions in the Canadian context, focussing on two cases. In October 2011, Occupy Toronto organizers set up a protest camp in St. James Park as part of a global movement in 950 cities to decry the effects of global capitalism. Six months later, another collective set up an artistic occupation consisting of 200 A-frame tents called The Encampment at Fort York National Historic Site. This intervention recast the military fort, which conventionally operates as an open-air living history museum depicting the social and military history of the War of 1812, as a space that showcased the war's civilian history. The author approaches each as a space of convergence dependent upon the calculated co-ordination of people and tents to signal calls for change. The author also takes into account significant differences between the two camps in that Occupy Toronto was a hard intervention that was ultimately evicted by order of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, while The Encampment was a soft one, co-commissioned by the city.

AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent global arboviral disease that affects over 300million people every year. Brazil has the highest number of dengue cases in the world, with the most severe epidemics in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Rio). The effective control of dengue is critically dependent on the knowledge of population genetic structuring in the primary dengue vector, the mosquito Aedesaegypti. We analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism markers generated via Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing, as well as traditional microsatellite markers in Ae.aegypti from Rio. We found four divergent mitochondrial lineages and a strong spatial structuring of mitochondrial variation, in contrast to the overall nuclear homogeneity across Rio. Despite a low overall differentiation in the nuclear genome, we detected strong spatial structure for variation in over 20 genes that have a significantly altered expression in response to insecticides, xenobiotics, and pathogens, including the novel biocontrol agent Wolbachia. Our results indicate that high genetic diversity, spatially unconstrained admixing likely mediated by male dispersal, along with locally heterogeneous genetic variation that could affect insecticide resistance and mosquito vectorial capacity, set limits to the effectiveness of measures to control dengue fever in Rio.

AB  - Although naturally occurring vibrations have proven useful to probe the subsurface, the vibrations caused by traffic have not been explored much. Such data, however, are less sensitive to weather and low visibility compared to some common out-of-road traffic sensing systems. We study traffic-generated seismic noise measured by an array of 5200geophones that covered a7x10km area in Long Beach (California, USA) with a receiver spacing of 100m. This allows us to look into urban vibrations below the resolution of a typical city block. The spatiotemporal structure of the anthropogenic seismic noise intensity reveals the Blue Line Metro train activity, departing and landing aircraft in Long Beach Airport and their acceleration, and gives clues about traffic movement along the I-405 highway at night. As low-cost, stand-alone seismic sensors are becoming more common, these findings indicate that seismic data may be useful for traffic monitoring.

AB  - In this paper, processes of rural gentrification are assessed in the post-Soviet context. In-depth, qualitative interviews were undertaken with 22 dacha (second country home) owners and 11 rural dwellers in two Russian regions. We draw on Bourdieu's concepts of capital exchange to assess processes of capital investment, social-up grading, landscape change and population displacement. Findings demonstrate a diverse range of approaches to dacha occupation, grounded in the Soviet legacy of elite and subsistence dacha cultures. Gentrification processes are distinguished in three types of dacha settlement: (I) the spread of gated communities through supergentrification and the 'new dachniki' movement, (2) transformations within dacha and garden comradeships through inheritance and reorientation of dacha food practices, and (3) gentrification in traditional villages, which features seasonal migration of urban offspring and a growing 'back to the land' movement. We focus on the 'demand side' of Russian gentrification and distinguish multiple pull factors, such as acquisition of a status symbol, access to rural pursuits, spaces for family reunion, production of 'ecologically clean food', and an escape from consumerist society. The authors argue that the analysis of the Russian case identifies areas for further development of rural gentrification literature more broadly, particularly 'super-gentrification', alternative food production movements in the countryside and the potential for gentrification from within locales through inheritance and rural wealth creation (in multiple forms).

AB  - Orientia tsutsugamushi is the causative agent of scrub typhus, a disease transmitted by Leptotrombidium mites which is responsible for a severe and under-reported public health burden throughout Southeast Asia. Here we use multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to characterize 74 clinical isolates from three geographic locations in the Lao PDR (Laos), and compare them with isolates described from Udon Thani, northeast Thailand. The data confirm high levels of diversity and recombination within the natural O. tsutsugamushi population, and a rate of mixed infection of similar to 8%. We compared the relationships and geographical structuring of the strains and populations using allele based approaches (eBURST), phylo-genetic approaches, and by calculating F-statistics (F-ST). These analyses all point towards low levels of population differentiation between isolates from Vientiane and Udon Thani, cities which straddle the Mekong River which defines the Lao/Thai border, but with a very distinct population in Salavan, southern Laos. These data highlight how land use, as well as the movement of hosts and vectors, may impact on the epidemiology of zoonotic infections.

AB  - Independent movement is a precondition for independent living and full participation of disabled citizens, which is guaranteed by the United Nations Convention and applicable laws of the Republic of Kosovo. Disabled citizens should have the equal right of access to public spaces as all other citizens. Discrimination occurs when they are not treated equally with others. Denial or restriction of access to public spaces represents limitation of basic human rights. This research is part of a broader study on public space and accessibility for disabled and aged persons in Prishtina and Prizren, which final purpose is setting principles and guidelines for designing future inclusive public spaces that offer basic conditions for disabled and aged population in cities in Kosovo. To date, the focus on the matters related to disability and accessibility was centred on isolated buildings. With this research, among other things I would like to shift the focus to issues related to accessibility and public spaces and the city design in general. The present article focuses on a research which objective is to identify the major problems arising from bad planning, design and management of the city, that results in manifold barriers disabled people confront on daily basis when trying to access and navigate public spaces in Prishtina and Prizren.
   For the purpose of research two surveys identifying physical barriers that impede the movement of different disability groups in public spaces in Prishtina and Prizren were conducted in November and December 2013. The methodology of the survey is based on walking along the trail of similar to 1.5 km with representatives of seven different categories of disabled persons in Prishtina and 12 categories in Prizren. All through the movement through the selected paths, the encountered physical barriers in public spaces were marked on the map, analysed in terms of spatial and physical characteristics, presented graphically and quantified based on the typology of disability. As a result of these two surveys, two maps containing barriers and illustrations of various obstacles disabled people met during the survey. Analysis of the results of two surveys helped in drawing some general recommendations that have to be taken in consideration when planning and designing inclusive public spaces.

AB  - Sourcing plant species of local provenance (eco-sourcing) has become standard practice in plant-community restoration projects. Along with established ecological restoration practices, knowledge of genetic variation in existing and restored forest fragments is important for ensuring the maintenance of natural levels of genetic variation and connectivity (gene flow) among populations. The application of restoration genetics often employs anonymous 'fingerprinting' markers in combination with limited sample sizes due to financial constraints. Here, we used two such marker systems, AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and ISSRs (inter-simple sequence repeats), to estimate population-level genetic variation of a frequently used species in restoration projects in New Zealand, mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus, Violaceae). We examined two rural and two urban forest fragments, as potential local source populations, to determine whether the mahoe population at the recently (re)constructed ecosystem at Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park, Hamilton, New Zealand, reflects the genetic variation observed in these four potential source populations. Both marker systems produced similar results and indicated that, even with small population sizes, levels of genetic variation at the heritage park were comparable with in situ populations. However, the AFLPs did provide finer resolution of the population genetic structure than ISSRs. ISSRs, which are less expensive and technically less demanding to generate than AFLPs, may be sufficient for restoration projects where only a broad level of genotypic resolution is required. We recommend the use of AFLPs when species with a high conservation status are being used, due to the greater resolution of this technique.

AB  - Using a socioecological systems perspective, we advance a conceptual approach for characterizing trajectories of change in rural forest-based communities. We call attention to "communities in the middle," communities positioned within forested regions representing neither unpopulated wilderness nor heavily urbanized or densely populated places on the edge of urban areas. In 2010, these middle places accounted for 27.3% of the continental United States landscape yet less than 5% of the human population. Common shocks, such as the decline of traditional production industries, demographic shifts, new information technologies, climate change, invasive species, and demand for new energy resources, unite these areas. Yet, we observe variation in existing patterns of change across communities, which grows out of interactions between local contexts and larger drivers of change. Focusing on community dynamics, structure, and well-being in transitioning rural forested landscapes, we synthesize insights on three commonly identified development trajectories. We identify interactions among the resource base, connectivity to other places, and social adaptability as critical to these trajectories. Further, we describe vulnerabilities, opportunities, contingencies, diversity, novel recombinations, and mitigation as useful concepts for understanding community pathways within these trajectories. This framework provides a starting point to guide further synthesis, formal meta-analyses, and future interdisciplinary research on change in these important 'middle' places. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - As a way of operationalizing the notion of scene, a concept that is dear to the study of artistic production in places, we analyze the depth of the hip hop culture in Recife, from the 1980s up to the present day. This work develops an approach based upon everyday life as a geographical dimension, analyzing the connections between hip hop culture, subjects' actions within places and the sheltering of communication in the metropolis. The break down of the Hip Hop scene in Recife required not only bibliographical and documentary research on the subject, but also extensive field work, thus yielding important primary information. A timeline for hip hop in the Recife region is suggested, emphasizing two structural moments for this street culture: initially disseminated by black music parties and break dancing - hip hop's body language -, the establishment of this movement culminated in the current situation around the mid-1990s, since when rap music has been dominating the Hip Hop Scene in the Recife region. Break dancing gatherings serve as an opportunity for individuals to meet and articulate. They are geographical events of strong spatial impact and point towards the occupation of the streets and other public spaces in downtown Recife by peripheral subjects. These gatherings greatly influenced the dynamics of the first days of Recife's hip hop, prevailing roughly throughout the 1990s. The contemporary scene, stirred up by rap, indicates that the Recife region, especially its suburbs, serves as home to about 70 groups, plus two small recording labels and seven phonographic studios specialized in the production of street culture music. Today, by means of the Rap Scene, this region articulates itself with a number of places in the Brazilian urban network. One can notice that, through the actions of a group of subjects, mostly peripheral individuals, hip hop has become a constitutive element of the city. It is more a question of practices aimed at artistic satisfaction and vindication of essential citizen rights than at economic gains.

AB  - The 2011 Census showed that Scotland's population had increased and part of this increase is due to inward migration. Among the in-migrants, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of black and minority ethnic people living in Scotland, notably those with a 'black' ethnicity. So, the ethnic geography of Scotland is changing and this appears to be due in part to significant numbers of asylum seekers and refugees who have been housed in Glasgow in recent years. This paper reports on two research studies carried out with refugees to explore their decision-making processes and the reasons why many have opted to stay in Scotland. Among the important factors identified are education (with children settled in schools), the availability of housing, a sense of loyalty to cities like Glasgow for accepting them, and the absence of obvious onward destinations. Some onward migration has taken place, but the numbers who have chosen to remain have had an important effect on the ethnic make-up of the country. The paper seeks to extend our understanding of the long-term implications of refugee decision-making for Scotland's ethnic geography.

AB  - Communication networks among responders are critical to effective coordination and information transfer across agencies active in a disaster response. Using the theory of embeddedness, we investigate how aspects of relational and institutional embeddedness influence the emergence and efficacy of interactions among responding agencies using network data from three significant wildfire events in the wildland/urban interface. For this study, relational embeddedness is investigated as the degree of familiarity between two responders before the incident. Institutional embeddedness is explored in terms of nesting within shared affiliations and common roles. Our findings suggest that both relational and institutional embeddedness significantly shape the disaster communication network during an incident, but relational embeddedness appears to play a stronger role. Further, the most problematic interactions appear to occur among institutionally embedded responders who do not know each other. Consequently, knowing something about relational and institutional embeddedness within the network of responders before an incident provides insight into what the communication network will look like when a disaster occurs. Findings also provide insights for how we might mitigate risk for problematic information flow and coordination during the incident.

AB  - The presence of argentiferous gold ore, mining and mountain crossing have favored, even from the early Middle Ages (the 13th century), the occurrence and development of the prosperous Oppidum of Rodna. Designed and accomplished by the German colonists brought here by the Hungarian kings in view of recharging mining and overseeing the Carpathian passages, the stylish medieval mountain town had imposing buildings, a monumental Dominican basilica, along with a network of mysterious rooms and underground passages (catacombs), most likely disposed in order to ensure the security of the population and their goods. Largely shattered by the rapacious Tatar-Mongol hordes in 1241-1242, the urban dowry of the medieval small town was rebuilt in two decades, but, unfortunately, the second Tatar invasion in the 13th century, 1285, transformed the Oppidum of Rodna into ruins, and the town never succeeded in reaching the charm, greatness and glamour it once had. Based on the scarce documents of the time, the materials and published writings, along with the personal investigations, the attempt is to reconstitute the old Rodna Oppidum.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TEACHING AND LEARNING
LA  - English
AB  - The authors of Brave New Teachers adopt a critical-democratic lens to analyze how neoliberal educational agendas have impacted the ability of progressive teachers to cultivate equitable and inclusive classrooms. The book is based on a longitudinal study that documents the self-reported teaching experiences of a group of teachers who graduated from the Urban Diversity Program at York University. Brave New Teachers explores how the current context of Canadian schooling has been shaped by neoliberalism. Within this paradigm, the authors thematically emphasize how standardized testing and the accountability movement, as well as the top-down imposition of curriculum standards, circumscribe the efforts of courageous teachers who work diligently on creating anti-oppressive curriculums and school environments. The tension that exists when these teachers feel pressured to conform to higher top-down authorities is documented throughout the book.

AB  - Dengue vector Aedes aegypti L. is invading peri-urban and rural areas throughout Latin America. Our previous research in the Peruvian Amazon has shown that river boats are heavily infested with immature and adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, likely playing a major role in their long-distance dispersal and successful invasion. However, the presence of immature mosquitoes provides no information about the timing of oviposition, and whether it took place in the boats. Here, we used baited ovitraps deployed on river boats to test the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti oviposition occurs during boat travel. We deployed 360 ovitraps on 60 different barges during August and October of 2013, and February 2014 (with 20 barges sampled during each month). We found that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in 22 individual ovitraps from 15 of the 60 barges (premise index 25%) across all sampling dates. Further, the distribution of Ae. aegypti egg abundance was highly aggregated: 2.6% of traps (N = 7) were responsible for 71.8% of eggs found, and 1.5% of traps (N = 4) were responsible for all (100%) of the larvae found. Similarly, 5% of boats were responsible for the 71.47% of eggs. Our results provide strong evidence that Ae. aegypti oviposition commonly occurs during boat travel. Baited ovitraps could represent a cost-effective means of monitoring and controlling mosquito populations on boats.

AB  - The diversity and range of economic, cultural and political phenomena in individuals and groups in our daily life highlights the urgency of understanding communication from a great variety of codes, given its polysemic nature. Considering that appropriation of the internet for political purposes has spread to a global scale, this work is the result of an investigation that examined the practice of cyber communication taking as an object of study the Brazilian movement Fiscal Grapiima (FG), which was created as a consequence of concerned citizens that were worried about the political course of the city of Itabuna, in Brazil, after the electoral process that took place in 2012. The aim was to detect if the group managed -and if so, to what extent- to politically mobilize their followers through and from the specific connection between the virtual and the real life.

AB  - The Occupy movement made a series of local sit-ins' in cities across the world in response to financial and political injustices. Prior to the movement's emergence, the Internet provided a transnational forum for people across the world to discuss their opinions and coalesce about the financial and political contexts. Here, we analyse 5343 posts on the #OccupyWallStreet' Facebook event page to identify linguistic markers of shared social identity formation. Results suggest that discussants formed a shared identity if they agreed on both the desired change (the injunctive norm, revoke corporate personhood') and the predefined action (Occupy Wall Street). Lines of consensus and dissensus on injunctive norms and actions delineated the development of both affirmational in-group and negational out-group identities. We conclude that online discussion can create both in-groups and out-groups through (in)validating ideas about social reformation and delineating shared psychological spaces.

AB  - This article explores the global mass assembly movement, focusing on its redefmitions of democracy and political membership, where one of the most interesting and promising aspects is reaffirmation of spatiality. In a way, the so-called Occupy Movement imagined new concepts of democracy and political membership worked out on a more manageable scale, that is to say, within local communities. We build on the recent scholarly attention given to the notion of nonstate spaces, which we chose to call exilic spaces because they are populated by communities that voluntarily or involuntarily attempt escape from both state regulation and capitalist accumulation.

AB  - The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is common and widely distributed within the UK. It is a carrier or potential carrier of numerous zoonotic diseases. Despite this, there are no published reports on the population genetics of foxes in Britain. In this study, we aim to provide an insight into recent historical movement of foxes within Britain, as well as a current assessment of the genetic diversity and gene flow within British populations. We used 14 microsatellite markers to analyse 501 red fox samples originating from England, southern Scotland and northern France. High genetic diversity was evident within the sample set as a whole and limited population genetic structure was present in British samples analysed. Notably, STRUCTURE analysis found support of four population clusters, one of which grouped two southern England sampling areas with the nearby French samples from Calais, indicating recent (post-formation of the Channel) mixing of British and French populations. This may coincide with reports of large-scale translocations of foxes into Britain during the nineteenth century for sport hunting. Other STRUCTURE populations may be related to geographic features or to cultural practices such as fox hunting. In addition, the two British urban populations analysed showed some degree of differentiation from their local rural counterparts.

AB  - The success of the 15-M was a surprise to all, not least for its organizers. Nothing made us imagine that the demonstrations called on May 15, 2011, in sixty cities of the Spanish state under the slogan "Occupy the streets! Real Democracy Now! We are not merchandise in hands of politicians and bankers" would become the spark that would start the fire, causing one of the most significant citizens' protests in Spain since the return of democracy and the beginning of a mobilization cycle from New York to Tel Aviv. However, it's always difficult to examine one movement in progress when the most part of the literature about it is more journalistic than academic. For this reason, I'll center my analysis in the explanation of some factors that could be useful to understand the success of the mobilization, and its low impact in formal politics (the mobilization paradox). To achieve this goal, I'll use the analytic background of Social Movement theory in order to answer the key question of one research about collective action: What's going on here?

KW  - Space and spatiality
AB  - Purpose - This paper is one of the first attempts to explain the local dynamics of the 2010 ethnic riots in Kyrgyzstan. No scholarly work has attempted to systematically analyze the 2010 ethnic violence and its local dynamics on the neighborhood scale. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on this gap by analyzing neighborhoods' responses to the emerging violence in the city of Osh. In order to do this, the author compares two typical neighborhoods in Osh, one violent and the other non-violent, with different spatial structures and built environments that demonstrate/represent similar dynamics of riots in many other neighborhoods.
   Design/methodology/approach - The empirical findings of this paper are based on the ethnographic fieldwork the author carried out in 2010 and between 2012 and 2014. During nine months (in total) of the author's ethnographic fieldwork, the author conducted around 60 semi-structured interviews in Osh city mainly with community leaders. In the author's interview sampling, the author used two approaches: the snowball method and geographically/territorially representative sampling.
   Findings - The author argues that among other factors, a particular type of public space provides favorable conditions for riot occurrence or non-occurrence. For example, in Osh, such places as areas around the central bazaar and densely populated multi-story building complexes were especially riotprone. By contrast, residential areas with individual-unit houses and low residential mobility represented communally private spaces with more easy riot-control. In addition, some residential areas implemented strategies such as physical self-isolation to avoid violence. By restricting freedom of movement and erecting improvised barricades, the residents of such neighborhoods created a temporally new space with its own rules and interethnic cooperation.
   Originality/value - This paper suggests new insights in the analysis of riots by connecting theoretical categories and concepts of space provided by scholars of contentious politics and applying them to the case of the 2010 ethnic riots in Osh city. By analyzing riot dynamics on the neighborhood scale, this research contributes to the understanding of the spatial dynamics of ethnic riots.

AB  - During 2013, Mexico was inundated by massive protests organized by hundreds of thousands of the close to two million teachers that form the mostly public, national school system. Twenty-six of the thirty-two states of the Republic witnessed some form of protest. For months schools were closed by teachers in several states, the border to the United States was barricaded a couple of days, main national highways were closed for many hours on several occasions and in Mexico City tens of thousands of teachers came from all corners of the country surrounded the National Palace, the Supreme Court building, the presidential house, the Stock Market, and the City Airport. Teachers created a tent city that for months occupied the main central square of the capital. In this article explains why these protests erupted, the dynamics and the strategic moves of the teachers' movement, and the current balance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) is a major pest of soft fruit and ornamental crops. There is an urgent need to improve control of vine weevil and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult vine weevil to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges. To be effective this approach requires that the weevils move through the crop environment and in doing so spread the pathogen from the artificial refuges.
   OBJECTIVE: Use passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to study the movement of adult vine weevil within crop environments.
   METHOD: A series of laboratory bioassays were completed in which the effect of attaching RFID tags using a thermoplastic or a cyanoacrylate adhesive on survival and movement, on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, of adult vine weevil was determined. An outdoor field experiment was then completed at Harper Adams University in order to test the potential of this technique for studying vine weevil movement within crop environments.
   RESULTS: Attaching RFID tags using the thermoplastic adhesive did not result in any weevil deaths over a 21 day period. In contrast, just over half (53%) of the weevils to which the RFID tag was attached using the cyanoacrylate adhesive died over the same period. The mean of weevil horizontal movement speed was significantly slower when an RFID tag was attached using a thermoplastic (1.01 cm/s) or a cyanoacrylate (0.29 cm/s) adhesive compared with untagged weevils (1.83 cm/s). However, weevils that were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive were significantly faster than weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mean vertical movement speed was also significantly slower when weevils were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive (0.18 cm/s) compared with untagged weevils (0.37 cm/s). Weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive were unable to climb vertical surfaces.
   In the field experiment, weevils moved away from their release points. Nine days after the start of the experiment weevils were on average 3.38m from their release points indicating a speed of movement of 0.38 m/day. The mean distance of movement from their release points did not increase further during the rest of the experimental period, but remained relatively constant at between 2.50 and 3.28 m. As such, for weevils that remained within the crop environment, there is no evidence of dispersal behaviour, with movement behaviour observed more likely to be driven by resource utilisation. However, not all weevils remained within the crop area. Indeed, 15 (38%) of released weevils and/or RFID tags left the crop area, indicating possible long range dispersal by these individuals or evidence of predation of the weevils.
   A total of 11 (28%) of the RFID tagged weevils released into the crop were recovered alive and with the tag still attached after 35 days. These weevils were estimated to have moved a distances of between 2.65 and 17.30m (average distance moved 7.50 m) during this period. These distances are likely to underestimate the distance moved by each weevil as they assume that each weevil took the most direct route between each point and did not move other than this. In total eight of the RFID-tagged weevils moved both along and between rows of strawberry grow-bags. At the start of the experiment the 11 RFID tagged weevils occupied 11 (14%) of the strawberry grow-bags. If these weevils took the most direct route between each position within the crop where they were detected these weevils would have crossed, and potentially laid eggs in, 44 (58%) of the grow-bags during the 35 days of the experiment. If they had taken a more indirect route the weevils could have potentially laid eggs in a higher number of the grow-bags.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results presented here indicate that RFID tags can be used to study the movement of vine weevil adults within crop environments. However, the weight and size of currently available tags significantly slows the movement of weevils under laboratory conditions and frequency of detection may affect estimates of actual distance moved. Despite this, the rate at which vine weevil dispersed through the strawberry crop was comparable to the speed of movement recorded previously by others when weevils were released into an urban environment. Use of RFID tags also resulted in detection rates far higher than those reported in studies by others using traditional mark-release-recapture techniques. Use of RFID tags in the present study indicates that adult vine weevil have the potential to disperse spores of a suitable entomopathogenic fungus from artificial refuges throughout the crop environment. Use of this technique could also be applied to investigate the effect of other plant protection products as well as the impact of different cropping systems on vine weevil movement and survival.

AB  - The availability of large amounts of mobility data has stimulated the research in discovering patterns and understanding regularities. Comparatively, less attention has been paid to the study of variability, which, however, has been argued as equally important as regularities, since variability identifies diversity. In a transport network, variability exists from person to person, from place to place, and from day to day. In this paper, we present a set of measuring of variability at individual and aggregated levels using multi-day smart-card data. Statistical analysis, correlation matrix and network-based clustering methods are applied and potential use of measured results for urban applications are also discussed. We take Singapore as a case study and use one-week smart-card data for analysis. An interesting finding is that though the number of trips and mobility patterns varies from day to day, the overall spatial structure of urban movement always remains the same throughout a week. This finding showed that a systemic framework with well-organized analytical methods is indeed, necessary for extracting variability that may change at different levels and consequently for uncovering different aspects of dynamics, namely transit, social and urban dynamics. We consider this paper as a tentative work toward such generic framework for measuring variability and it can be used as a reference for other research work in such a direction.

AB  - Exotic species have had devastating impacts worldwide and are a major threat to native wildlife. Human commensal species (hereafter commensals) are a special class of exotic species that live largely off the resources associated with human activity. The encroachment of commensals from an urban area into surrounding bushland has been frequently overlooked as an important component of urban impacts, even though human-commensals are common to many urban regions globally. In this review, we present theoretical and empirical evidence for the processes and outcomes occurring when exotic commensal species encroach into native bushland. Specifically we ask when, how and why exotic commensal species encroach into bushland, what determines whether they establish, and what are the ecological consequences. We focus on the black rat, Rattus rattus, arguably the archetypal commensal species with a cosmopolitan distribution and the greatest potential for ecological damage of all the commensal rodents. We expect that the processes that we outline apply to other commensal species more broadly. We argue that commensals are in fact natives of the urban milieu and only become alien when they encroach into peri-urban bushland. We propose that the mechanisms of this encroachment will be different from those of other, non-commensal exotic species because urban areas act as dispersal hubs to overcome many of the barriers of invasion that other exotic species face. We suggest that resource supplementation by urban areas creates a great potential for promoting encroachment, invasion as well as impact. However, biotic and abiotic barriers to invasion are still relevant for commensals, highlighting the need to maintain the integrity of ecosystems and wildlife populations in urban edges so as to prevent commensal incursion. We examine how commensal black rats affect wildlife via three fundamental mechanisms, namely, predation, disease transfer and competition for resources, and also consider their possible positive impacts acting as functional replacements for lost natives. We conclude the review with an outline of research priorities and future directions that are essential for progressing our understanding of the ecology of commensal species.

AB  - In the present paper, bottom ashes from urban waste incineration were used as sole source material to develop geopolymers activated with alkali solution. This study intends to gather basic structural data on the synthesized materials at fixed curing times (3 h; 1, 4, 5, 7, 30 days; 20 months) by X-ray (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. Curing time affects both crystalline phase transformation and the geopolymeric gel structure. The XRD results showed the starting of geopolymerization, due to the alkali activation, already within the first 3 h of curing. New phases such as hydrated sodium carbonate and gismondine, confirming the progressive ash reactivity, appeared after 4 h and 1 day of curing respectively. Finally, after approximately 30 days curing at room temperature, the condensation process and, consequently, the formation of a stable 3D gel of aluminosilicate network occurred. FTIR showed a 40 cm(-1) displacement of the band at 980 cm-1 during the first hours of the geopolymer formation confirming the formation of the geopolymeric network also from a matrix without metakaolin. Furthermore Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS) analyses were performed to assess morphological characteristics and to evaluate the presence of unreacted aluminosilicate particles in the obtained geopolymers.

AB  - Charter Schools emerged in the 1990s as an alternative to the U.S. public schools with the hope that charter schools would not be exposed to the same problems of the traditional public schools that are due to high levels of bureaucracy, less autonomy and no competition for students, hence for financial resources. This came about following the success of "magnet schools" that emerged as a product of the previous generation in the 1970s. Likewise, charter school movement had bipartisan support from many levels and today, although still only about 1 percent of students is enrolled in charter schools they emerged as a successful model to traditional public schools and even to the private schools in many areas. U.S. has the most diverse group of students in its history and all the basic trends indicate the diversity will become even greater. Among the school age population after only one generation the entire country will become a minority non-white or non-European in origin. Diversity is growing rapidly in the nation's suburban rings, which have become the center of American life and politics. Yet schools remain largely segregated and are becoming more so although Americans still believe that their children benefit from integrated education and there is substantial evidence that those beliefs are correct. Segregated schools are still highly unequal. Segregation by race related to segregation by poverty and to many forms of educational inequality for African American and Latino students; few whites experience impoverished schools. Efforts to overcome the effects of segregation through special programs have had some success, but there is no evidence that they have equalized systems of segregated schools. Segregated schools particularly those in big cities have stunningly high levels of high school dropouts and very poor records of preparing students for higher education. Segregation has not been a successful educational or social policy. Yet U.S. school system is experiencing a continuing expansion of segregation for both blacks and Latinos and serious backward movement in the South. Specifically in this study, effect of charter school movement on the issue of ethnic, racial, religious, socio-economic segregation has been analyzed and it has been concluded that in fact there is a relation between the segregation issue and the charter school movement and that this relationship is mostly a negative one unlike magnet schools, which substantially improved the segregation problem in the 1970s; however it was not clear whether it is the charter school movement that is the cause or it is the other way around.

AB  - Communications-based train control (CBTC) is an emerging technology for urban rail transit systems. An integrated method for assessing the capacity of CBTC-system-installed urban rail lines is proposed in this paper. Based on the UIC Code 406 method, the new integrated method includes train movement simulation, timetable construction, test and optimisation. In order to achieve an accurate blocking time, this paper introduces three operational scenarios, namely: consecutive running of trains, entering a station and turn-back at a terminal station. A practical timetable is implemented and optimised by simulating and evaluating the capacity with UIC Code 406. This paper considers Beijing's Yizhuang metro line in a case study. It is found that a speed limit on the line produces a greater impact on the capacity compared with dwell time and switch speed restrictions. Furthermore, it is noted that a capacity bottleneck can easily occur during the process of entering a station and also during a turn-back operation at a terminal station.

AB  - Wildfire is a particular concern in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) of the western United States where human development occurs close to flammable natural vegetation.
   (1) Assess the relative influences of WUI expansion versus climate-driven fire regime change on spatial and temporal patterns of burned WUI, and (2) determine whether WUI developed in the future will have higher or lower wildfire risk than existing WUI.
   We projected the spatial pattern of the WUI and its associated wildfire risk from 2005 to 2050 at 90-m spatial resolution and 5-year intervals in Colorado Front Range using CHANGE, a landscape change model that simulates land cover and land use change, natural vegetation dynamics, and wildfire in a unified framework. A total of four scenarios from a factorial design with static versus changing WUI and static versus changing fire regimes were simulated to examine the effects of WUI expansion and climate-driven fire regime change on burned area in the WUI.
   Both WUI expansion and fire regime change contributed to the increase of burned WUI, but fire regime change had a stronger influence. The effects of WUI expansion and fire regime change had a combined influence greater than the sum of their individual effects. This interaction was a result of projected WUI expansion into regions of higher wildfire risk than existing WUI.
   The human footprint will continue to expand into wildland areas and must be considered along with climate effects when assessing the impacts of changing fire regimes in future landscapes.

AB  - Introduction: The present article is part of a broader research entitled "Perspectives on otherness. Production of social representations about Senegalese and Argentinean migrants in Buenos Aires. 2010-2014", in the framework of the Doctorate in Social Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, in which I sought to address the relationships that occur between the two populations and the representations that a group built on the other.
   Method: I analyzed twenty in-depth interviews with Senegalese migrants who had arrived in Buenos Aires Autonomous City between 1995 and 2014. This data have been analyzed under various categories, which have allowed me to reflect on those migrants' circulation and insertion in the territory.
   Results: Senegalese migrants who arrived in Argentina over the last decade and a half follow a particular pattern of movement in the city of Buenos Aires, marked by their employment and residential segregation, as a result of the implementation of neoliberal policies during the 1990's. Such policies led to a reduction of opportunities among the most poor and vulnerable population, to which migrant groups tend to belong.
   Conclusion: Some of the strategies developed by Senegalese migrants to get integrated into society are: working as street vendors and residing in hotels located at impoverished neighborhoods in the City of Buenos Aires. Those strategies involve migrants' own cultural patterns.

AB  - Rural idyll' nostalgia situates the English village as timeless, bounded and static. It is contrasted to urban modernity and dynamism. The urban moves; the rural is held still. This has been echoed by limited scholarly engagement with rural mobilities. Against spatio-temporal boundedness, this article emphasises the centrality of rural mobilities and conceptualises movement as occurring in, of and through the village. Drawing upon ethnographic research undertaken during 2011-2012 in Lyng Valley', a post-industrial rural district in West Yorkshire, Northern England, I illustrate the village as on the move in both the past and the present. Arguing for rural mobility as continual and intrinsic, I challenge the concatenation of mobility with urbanity.

AB  - This paper examines the process through which Occupy activists came to constitute themselves as a collective actor and the role of social media in this process. The theoretical framework combines Melucci's (1996) theory of collective identity with insights from the field of organizational communication and particularly from the CCO' strand - short for Communication is Constitutive of Organizing'. This allows us to conceptualize collective identity as an open-ended and dynamic process that is constructed in conversations and codified in texts. Based on interviews with Occupy activists in NewYork, London and other cities, I then discuss the communication processes through which the movement was drawing the boundaries with its environment, creating codes and foundational documents, as well as speaking in a collective voice. The findings show that social media tended to blur the boundaries between the inside and the outside of the movement in a way that suited its values of inclusiveness and direct participation. Social media users could also follow remotely the meetings of the general assembly where the foundational documents were ratified, but their voices were not included in the process. The presence of the movement on social media also led to conflicts and negotiations around Occupy's collective voice as constructed on these platforms. Thus, viewing the movement as a phenomenon emerging in communication allows us an insight into the efforts of Occupy activists to create a collective that was both inclusive of the 99% and a distinctive actor with its own identity.

AB  - One century after its discovery, the Columns Tomb of Kumbi Saleh (Mauritania) remains an archaeological riddle. Since 1914, six field programs have been successively carried out at the medieval urban site of Kumbi Saleh, which now is commonly identified as Ghana. The latter was the famous capital city of the medieval West African state, which controlled the gold mines of West Africa and was involved in the gold trade with North Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. However, interpretation of the tomb, the largest structure from the necropolis, is still an issue as its dating itself has never been firmly established. As a consequence, scholars have usually referred to an unsatisfactory timeframe spanning 1000 years. The study of this monument was recently resumed, motivated by the rediscovery of bones collected in the tomb in 1914 and stored at the Musee de l'Homme (Paris, France). AMS radiocarbon dating of the bone and tooth apatite fraction of three skulls demonstrates that the three individuals occupying the main vault of the tomb died between the end of the 11th century and the 12th century, precisely at the time of expansion of the Muslim Almoravid movement south of Sahara.

AB  - A salient geomorphic feature of the Yarlung River is its abundance of large knickpoints, which in many cases coincide with north-south trending rifts. Across one of these rifts, near the town of Jiacha, the Yarlung falls nearly 500 m from an elevation of similar to 3500 m over 80 river kilometers, making this the second largest knickpoint on the river. We propose that the Jiacha knickpoint represents a wave of incision migrating upstream through the drainage network in response to a downstream base level fall, not a disturbance in the channel to due rift tectonics.
   Longitudinal profile slope-area and chi (chi) analysis of Yarlung River tributaries and those of several major rivers in southeastern Tibet indicate several knickpoints are present at 3500 m elevation, all resulting from a single regional-scale base level fall. Retreat rates calculated from celerity modeling indicate that the Jiacha knickpoint was located at the upstream edge of the Namche Barwa massif at similar to 10 Ma, a history consistent with apatite He-4/He-3 thermochronometry data and thermokinematic modeling from that region. These data suggest the Yarlung River has flowed in its present course through this area since at least 10 Ma and imply that at least 500 m of incision occurred within this canyon over this time period. The spatial scale of these observations suggests that these knickpoints resulted from surface uplift of southeastern Tibet of 500 to 2500 m just prior to 10 Ma. Additionally, our mapped knickpoint locations indicate that reorganization of the drainage network just east of the Namche Barwa massif occurred prior to this time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - New York City anarchists played a major role in Occupy Wall Street. Opposition to the ruling 1% promoted an anti-capitalist class consciousness and a political emphasis on inequality. OWS' militant encampments and street action avoided assimilation into the Democratic Party. However, not only massive repression, but dysfunctional organization and an unrealistic strategy also led to its decline. Its supposedly "leaderless" horizontalism and consensus process made decisions impossible, while the autonomy of individuals and groups produced an inability to coordinate its many working groups. Rejection of the demands of actual struggles limited outreach, and made identification with the 99% mostly symbolic rather than the basis for a unifying mass movement. Emphasis on mutual aid enabled an effective response to hurricane Sandy, but also involved a utopian strategy based on unsustainable encampments rather than class struggle.

AB  - People are on the move, coming in from beyond the borders of the European Union and circulating within it. Our major cities in particular are rapidly becoming "super-diverse" communities with many different (cultural) minorities. Many immigrant groups are, at least in the initial phase of their residence in a new community, often unable to communicate effectively in the official language. This poses important challenges for public service providers, who ought to be able to ensure equal access to their services to anyone who requires them. Yet, not all public service providers in Europe are prepared or equipped to operate in such a multilingual environment, and in many countries both comprehensive policies and structural funding are still lacking. As a result, public service interpreting and translation are available and made use of very unevenly. Following earlier initiatives to put public service interpreting and translation (PSIT) on the agendas of the European Commission and EU member states, such as the report drawn up by the European Language Council's Special Interest Group on Translation and Interpreting for Public Services (SIGTIPS) in 2011, more recently the European Network for Public Service Interpreting and Translation (ENPSIT) was founded. Its main aims are to have the right to high-quality language assistance in service contexts officially recognized, and to see the development of (harmonized) public service interpreter and translator training, assessment and accreditation across the EU. This paper sketches (i) the societal framework within which PSIT provision is organized, (ii) how ENPSIT wishes to deploy strategies to influence European and national policy-making as well as foster excellent PSIT training and quality assurance, and (iii) how the fight for optimal communication in public services is not, nor should be, restricted to improving PSIT.

AB  - Sosnowiec is located in the Katowice Region, which is the most urbanized and industrialized region in Poland. Urban areas of such character favor enhancement of pollution concentration in the atmosphere and the consequent emergence of smog. Local meteorological and circulation conditions significantly influence not only on the air pollution level but also change air temperature considerably in their centers and immediate vicinities. The synoptic situation also plays the major role in dispersal and concentration of air pollutants and changes in temperature profile. One of the most important are the near-ground (100 m) inversions of temperature revealed their highest values on clear winter days and sometimes stay still for the whole day and night. Air temperature inversions in Sosnowiec occur mainly during anticyclone stagnation (Ca-anticyclone centre and Ka-anticyclonic ridge) and in anticyclones with air advection from the south and southwest (Sa and SWa) which cause significantly increase of air pollution values. The detailed evaluation of the influence of circulation types on the appearance of a particular concentration of pollutants carried out in this work has confirmed the predominant influence of individual circulation types on the development of air pollution levels at the Katowice region. This paper presents research case study results of the thermal structure of the near-ground atmospheric layer (100 m) and air pollution parameters (PM 10, SO2, NO, NO2) changes in selected days of 2005 year according to regional synoptic circulation types. The changes in urban environment must be taken into account in analyses of multiyear trends of air temperature and air conditions on the regional and global scales.

AB  - Handroanthus heptaphyllus is a long-lived tropical tree, insect-pollinated, common in secondary vegetation, and is economical useful for urban and forest restoration purposes. However, when considering seed harvest for reforestation, it is fundamental to know the mating system of populations, since that determines the effective size of the sample. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the mating system of two H. heptaphyllus populations, using microsatellite markers, to estimate the number of seed trees for seed collection procedures. To do that, open pollinated seeds were collected from 15 seed trees in a Lageado population and from 15 at Veu da Noiva. Population multilocus outcrossing rate (t(m)) was equal for the two provenances (t(m) = 1.0), however we observed individual variation for outcrossing rate among trees (0.68 to 0.99). The rate of mating among relatives (t(m) - t(s), minimum of 0.21) and multilocus paternity correlation (r(p), minimum of 0.11) were substantial in both populations, where 97% of the trees crossed with relatives. This suggests a spatial genetic structure in the populations from where seeds were harvested. Due to correlated mating, the co-ancestry within progenies was higher (Theta minimum of 0.139) and effective size was smaller (Theta maximum of 3.07) than the expected in half-sibs (Theta = 0.125, N-is an element of = 4). Consequently, the number of seed trees for seed harvest for breeding, conservation, and reforestation programs must be at least 49.

AB  - This article highlights the contribution of the Nepalese Maoist Movement in the dynamics of claiming symbolic space by formerly bonded labourers (freed Kamaiya) during the Nepalese Maoist revolution. In Nepal, the appropriation of symbolic space by marginalized groups throughout the revolutionary period remains in the shadows of the grand event of the Maoist revolution. Focusing on an urban municipality in Kailali district, in the far-western lowlands of Nepal, the article examines how the changing balances of power brought about by the revolutionary Maoist Movement allowed a group of formerly bonded labourers to squat and claim the land of a public airport. The article then addresses the question of whether and how the act of urban capture has benefitted the formerly bonded labourers, and what sorts of community politics emerged in the squatter camps where they settled. It is argued that the changes brought about by the revolutionary context improved the conditions that the formerly debt-bonded labourers encounter at workplaces but also led to the formation of a new political elite within the squatters community. The article contributes to an understanding of the complexities of political mobilization in revolutionary Nepal and the resulting consequences.

AB  - In this paper I examine the practices of encountering of Occupy London, and argue that they provide a means for rethinking the production of territoriality. Specifically, I argue that boundary making not only involves hierarchical relations of power-over but also the articulation of bottom-up power-to. I first examine literature on boundary making, and propose encountering as a more appropriate vocabulary to represent this practice in the context of urban activism. I then conceptualise encountering as the articulation of power-to, a moment in the production of territoriality from below, bringing together Holloway's dialectical understanding of power and Lefebvre's writings on territorial autogestion and urban encounters. In the remainder of the paper I examine practices of encountering in Occupy London on the basis of militant research with the movement that combined ethnography, interviews, and archive analysis. The paper focuses on the spaces of the General Assembly and the protest camp, exploring how encounters were productive of new social relations and highlighting key tensions. In particular I note the inevitable ephemerality of activist encounters and tensions over institutionalising encounters, and I end by calling for greater attention to the power relations involved, warning against assumptions that encounters of power-to necessarily lead to positive outcomes.

AB  - This paper introduced an evaluation framework of spatial configuration and cross-regional sharing of urban shelters. The evaluation was based on the population of the study area and the service areas of the shelters. Two kinds of nature disasters were considered: flood and earthquake. Taking into account the occurrence time of disasters, the disaster types and whether or not the shelters will be cross-regional shared, six scenarios were chosen to be evaluated. A case study in Jing'an District of Shanghai in China was proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of this new framework. After the daytime and nighttime population estimation, and the spatial assessment for the six scenarios, the supply-demand situations of the shelters were revealed. We compared the scenarios without cross-regional sharing between five subdistricts of the study area and the scenarios with the consideration of cross-regional sharing. The comparison illustrates that cross-regional sharing can effectively reduce the imbalance degree of the spatial configuration of urban shelters and decrease the movement distance for evacuees to the nearest shelters. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other emergency situations such as acts of terrorism, hurricanes and major fires.

AB  - The objective of this review is to demonstrate the non-linear properties of the Cuban process of agricultural development by characterizing and analyzing recent historical changes in this process, using the theoretical and methodological approach of adaptive renovation cycles. These changes are summed up in four stages: i) The stage of growth, which followed the period of the latifun.dio (large extensions of land devoted to monoculture or livestock), involved a series of structural changes,oriented toward diversifying production and guaranteeing food self-sufficiency; during this stage, the nation's agricultural production was organized into State businesses, State farms, and small farmers' cooperatives. ii) During the stage of agricultural maturity, Cuba adopted the dominant global tendency of increasing productivity through mechanization, based on use of high levels of agrochemicals; this was accompanied by environmental costs, and depended on high priced exports of sugarcane, coffee, tobacco, and citrus, and low priced imports of processed foods to meet the population's dietary needs, through a commercial agreement with the socialist nations of Eastern Europe. iii) The stage of collapse occurred due to the late 1990s economic crisis which resulted in loss of access to markets of machinery, fuels, and other inputs; ensuing problems included soil erosion, groundwater contamination, and deforestation. iv) During the renovation stage, agriculture was reoriented toward cleaner production based on agroecology, organic practices, innovation, and collective learning. At the national level, the Farmer to Farmer Agroecology Movement was developed on rural family farms. Furthermore, the "urban agriculture" movement sprung up on small urban and pen-urban plots. Currently, regardless of the type of land ownership, agriculture in Cuba is oriented toward agroecology and cleaner production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wolves (Canis lupus) in Italy represent a relict west European population. They are classified as vulnerable by IUCN, though have increased in number and expanded their range in recent decades. Here we use 17 years of monitoring data (from 1993 to 2010) collected in a mountainous region of central Italy (Arezzo, Tuscany) in an ecological niche-based model (MaxEnt) to characterize breeding sites (i.e. the areas where pups were raised) within home ranges, as detected from play-back responses. From a suite of variables related to topography, habitat and human disturbance we found that elevation and distance to protected areas were most important in explaining the locality of wolf responses. Rendezvous sites (family play-back response sites) typically occurred between 800 and 1200 m a.s.l., inside protected areas, and were usually located along mountain chains distant from human settlements and roads. In these areas human disturbance is low and the densities of ungulates are typically high. Over recent years, rendezvous sites have occurred closer to urban areas as the wolf population has continued to expand, despite the consequent human disturbance. This suggests that undisturbed landscapes may be reaching their carrying capacity for wolves. This, in turn, may lead to the potential for increased human-wolf interactions in future. Applying our model, both within and beyond the species' current range, we identify sites both within the current range and also further afield, that the species could occupy in future. Our work underlines the importance of the present protected areas network in facilitating the recolonisation by wolves. Our projections of suitability of sites for future establishment as the population continues to expand could inform planning to minimize future wolfhuman conflicts.

AB  - Objective: In this third communication, the processes for converting criterion occupational tasks into bona fide pre-employment selection tests are presented using urban firefighters as the worked example. Methods: A total of 14 individuals participated in potential screening tests that targeted three loaded movement categories: single-sided load carriage (4 tests), dragging loads (2 tests), and overhead pushing and holding objects (5 tests). Results: Seven tests emerged, one performed as an isolated pass/fail barrier test (ladder raise) and six incorporated into a sequential, timed circuit simulating hazmat incidents, ventilation fan carriage (stairs), motor-vehicle rescues, bushfire incidents, fire attacks, and a firefighter rescue. Conclusion: Because three tests provided predicted performance speeds to replicate the oxygen cost of firefighters performing the corresponding occupational simulations, notional performance thresholds could be projected and recommended for the final phase of this research.

AB  - The current conjuncture is becoming defined by political austerity, and this paper engages with different forms of contentious politics that are emerging in response. The paper reviews debates on post-politics arguing that while post-political perspectives speak to important tensions in relation to contemporary social and political relations, they also risk limiting an engagement with existing forms of political contestation. The paper makes three cuts through crisis geographies by exploring contested place making in relation to the 2011 riots, debates about localism and resilience, and the construction of spaces of antagonismby the Occupy Movement. By considering such diverse forms of resistance alongside each other rather than treating them separately, we emphasize the importance of attending to multiple articulations of contentious politics. We conclude by arguing that it is important to recognize the different means by which actors are seeking to bring crisis and austerity into contestation.

AB  - Urban forests are often modified and fragmented by human land use and the original habitat might exist only in remnant patches. Due to their specific habitat requirements and unwillingness to move through matrix many forest-dwelling mammals are susceptible to changes in landscape structure. It is important to understand how the availability of suitable habitat and landscape fragmentation affect species distributions, and what landscape characteristics are essential to the persistence of a given species to conserve urban wildlife. We investigated the effect of landscape composition and configuration on the occurrence of the Siberian flying squirrel, a small-sized arboreal rodent, in a partly urbanized area of Eastern Finland. All suitable and potential forest patches were searched to determine the presence or absence of species, and the landscape characteristics of occupied sites were compared to those of unoccupied sites. Flying squirrels occurred both at the edges of large suitable forested areas, but also in small forest fragments within residential areas. Surprisingly, urban areas did not have a negative effect on the flying squirrel occurrence. Occurrence probability was not either associated with the proportion of suitable habitat, but occupied sites contained larger amount of movement habitat and had shorter distances to nearest occupied sites than unoccupied sites. Our results show that flying squirrels can exist in urbanized landscape and near residential areas, but more detailed information on habitat use and survival is still needed to determine the long-term persistence and viability of the urban populations.

AB  - We analyzed the recent (< 25 yr) spread in New Hampshire, USA, of the exotic tree Kalopanax septemlobus, native to Asia. The invasion was likely initiated by a single tree planted ca. 1972. Our objective was to assess the viability of the invasion, especially in light of the small propagule size. We tallied, mapped, aged, and measured the height and growth of K. septemlobus individuals at two sites, the University of New Hampshire campus (UC) and Thompson Farm (TF), both in Durham. We found over 3,800 plants at UC and 270 at TF in < 120 ha (296 ac) total area. Plant age ranged from 0 to 22 yr, and UC plants were as far as 775 m (2,543 ft) from the purported parent tree. Annual height growth was comparable to midtolerant native trees. Plants occurred in both open and forested habitats, and the mean level of photosynthetically active radiation incident on understory plants was 4 to 6% of full sun. The large population size, shade tolerance, rapid height growth, and ability to sprout from damaged stems suggest potential for K. septemlobus to invade and persist in forests, the most common natural ecosystem in the northeastern United States. We further suggest that small propagule size, likely a single tree, has not prevented K. septemlobus from initiating a spatially extensive and vigorous population. Kalopanax septemlobus has been planted as an ornamental in the northeastern United States, and prevention of region-wide invasion might depend on removal of these trees, even when they occur as single individuals.

AB  - Congregation-based community organizing (CBCO) federations play an important role in uniting a diverse array of religious congregations and community-based organizations in movements for social justice at the neighborhood, regional, state, and national levels. Metropolitan-level CBCO federations provide a novel and noteworthy example of meso-mobilization contexts as described in the social movement literature in that many such federations engage in multiple concurrent issue campaigns. This study examines collaboration among organizational members of Communities Creating Opportunity, a CBCO federation based in Kansas City, Missouri. Qualitative interviews with organizers, clergy, and lay-leaders, together with an analysis of organizational records, reveal a cooperative structure of interorganizational relations built upon specific organizing activities, roles, and relations. These activities, roles, and relations are in turn conditioned on each member organization's own level of connection to a particular organizing issue. Findings suggest that this innovative form of cooperative relational structure affords multi-issue federations an enhanced capacity to mobilize voluntary labor resources and turn-out at public events relative to single issue organizing.

AB  - Driving simulator studies can reveal relevant and valid aspects of driving behavior, but underestimation of distance and speed can negatively affect the driver's performance, such as in performance of overtaking. One possible explanation for the underestimation of distance and speed is that two-dimensional projection of the visual scene disrupts the monocular-based illusory depth because of conflicting binocular and monocular information of depth. A possible solution might involve the strengthening of the monocular information so that the binocular information becomes less potent. In the present study, we used an advanced high-fidelity driving simulator to investigate whether adding the visual depth information of motion parallax from head movement affects sense of presence, judgment of distance and speed, and performance measures coupled with overtaking. The simulations included two types of driving scenario in which one was urban and the other was rural. The main results show no effect of this head-movement produced motion parallax on sense of presence, head movement, time to collision, distance judgment, or speed judgment. However, the results show an effect on lateral positioning. When initiating the overtaking maneuver there is a lateral positioning farther away from the road center as effect of the motion parallax in both types of scenario, which can be interpreted as indicating use of naturally occurring information that change behavior at overtaking. Nevertheless, only showing tendencies of effects, absent is any clear additional impact of this motion parallax in the simulated driving. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of Myorelaxation Therapy in temporomandibular disorders on the basis of mandibular movement measurements, reported functional impairment and clinical findings.
   Material/methods: To ascertain the mandibular movements 78 women were investigated. The first group consisted of 32 consecutive patients (23.3 +/- 4.8 years) suffering from muscle disorder and disk displacement with a reduction serving as a treated group. The second group was formed from 46 volunteers, as a healthy group (20.1 +/- 1.3 years). Jaw-tracking records (K7, Myotronics-Noromed Inc.) were performed including the measurements of opening, lateral and protrusive movement range, maximal and average velocity of opening/closing. Reported impairment and clinical data were collected. The treatment involved nocturnally applied a non-occluding sublingual relaxation splint combined with daily performed stretching exercises. Measurements were taken before treatment, after 4 weeks with no interventions (control period) and after 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months.
   Results: After the treatment mandibular opening range increased by 8 mm (19%, p < 0.05), lateral movement by 2.1 mm (36%, p < 0.05) while protrusive movement decreased by 0.5 mm (p > 0.05). Maximal and average velocity parameters significantly increased (p > 0.05). These results were supported by the decrease in reported impairment and clinical pain occurrence (p < 0.05). Only joint clicking change was non-significant (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Myorelaxation Therapy was effective in the treatment of our group of patients. A significant improvement in the opening and lateral movement range, as well as opening/closing velocity was obtained after 6 months of treatment. This method can be easily managed by general practitioner, especially in muscles-related TMD types. (C) 2014 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

AB  - In this study, we utilize ground-penetrating radar and gradiometer survey to map buried architecture and investigate the political dimensions of the built environment at two Spanish colonial period archaeological sites in Peru's north coast region, Carrizales (C123) and Mocupe Viejo (74). Based on historical sources, we argue that both sites were founded during the Toledan reduccion movement - a large-scale attempt by Peru's viceregal government to forcibly resettle indigenous populations into planned towns in the 1570s ce. Coupled with excavations, geophysical survey has revealed diversity in how these planned towns were constructed. At Carrizales, domestic architectural features revealed through gradiometer survey and confirmed through excavations suggest that the town's layout broadly conformed to the prescriptions of reduccion plans, centring on a large plaza and following a rectilinear layout. Ground-penetrating radar results at the site were limited by high soil salinity. In contrast, at Mocupe Viejo, ground-penetrating radar, gradiometer survey, and excavations have recovered no evidence of a gridded street plan, and demonstrate that the church was located in an idiosyncratic position. Together, these results suggest that the resettlement process was contested and that plans were modified to serve more proximate political, ecclesiastical, and practical concerns, illustrating the limited reach of colonial state power in the sixteenth century.

AB  - In Huainan City, Anhui Province, China, ground subsidence persistently occurs due to underground coal mining, which has caused several environmental issues. A modified time-series Interfermetric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique is applied to obtain ground movement in Huainan over a period of approximately two years using 20 ascending Radarsat-2 images. In particular, distributed scatterers (DSs) are efficiently identified using classification information and statistical characteristics. Classified information is used to identify the specific DS classes and statistical characteristics are used to refine the DS candidates. To control error propagation and improve computational efficiency, the deformation rate and digital elevation model (DEM) error of persistent scatterers (PSs) are first retrieved using conventional persistent scatterer intermemetry (PSI). Then, a region-growing-based strategy is applied to extract the deformation rate of DSs. Land subsidence is detected in coal-mining areas of central Dingji, Guqiao, Zhangjiaji, Xinji I, and Xinji II, which suggests that the subsidence is primarily caused by underground mining. The fastest subsidence occurring in non-urban areas is particularly vulnerable to subsidence and collapsed lakes. It is also found that the collapsed lakes have expanded during the observation period, with an expanded mining area of 0.842 km(2) near Guqiao. A linear relationship between the observed subsidence and expansion of collapsed lakes was found, which indicates that the expansion of collapsed lakes hass resulted from subsidence due to underground coal mining.

AB  - A widely cited report by the federal Government Accountability Office found that charter schools enroll a significantly smaller percentage of students with disabilities than do traditional public schools. However, thus far no hard evidence exists to definitively explain or quantify the disparity between special education enrollment rates in charter and traditional public schools. This article uses student-level data from Denver, Colorado, to map the creation and growth of the special education gap in elementary and middle school grades. The gap begins because students with disabilities are less likely to apply to charter schools in gateway grades than are nondisabled students. However, the special education gap in Denver elementary schools more than doubles as students progress between kindergarten and the fifth grade. About half of the growth in the gap in elementary grades (46%) occurs because of classification differences across sectors. The remaining 54% of the growth in the gap in elementary grades is due to differences in student mobility across sectors. However, the gap does not primarily growand in fact tends to shrinkdue to the movement of students with disabilities across sectors and out of the city's school system. Rather, the impact of student mobility on the gap is driven primarily by nondisabled students: Regular enrollment students are more likely to enter into charter schools, thus disproportionately reducing the percentage of students with disabilities within the charter sector.

AB  - The management of the economy influences the government of territories. The global economy profoundly determines the spatial organization of production activities, trade flows and the movement of individuals. This, in turn, calls for a re-configuration of the institutional balances within the territory. To confirm this thesis, the author takes into account the transformations that are taking place in the administrative divisions of Sicily in relation to the changes occurring in the regional economy, as an emblematic case of the many institutional transformations currently taking place in Italy.

AB  - Mt. Vesuvius is one of the most studied volcanoes in the world and its proximity to an extremely populated area makes it also one of the most threatening. Violent Strombolian (VS) events have occurred in the most recent history of the volcano, and they are the type most likely to occur in case of reactivation of the volcano in the near future. In order to investigate the dynamics and hazard of this type of eruption, we performed new field and laboratory work and numerical simulations of plume dynamics, fallout and tephra dispersal associated with such eruptions. Attention was specifically focused on the 1906 eruption, a recent and well-studied VS event. Based on new field analyses and historical observations, we reconstructed the temporal evolution of eruption source conditions during the event. The reconstructed explosive phase of the eruption is inferred to have been 8 days long and characterized by two distinct stages: a former short and intense period with sustained convective plume fed by powerful lava fountains (20 h) followed by a prolonged and less intense period of ash emission (172 h). The total grain-size distributions for both phases, used as inputs to the model, were obtained by field work and laboratory analyses. Based on these new volcanological data and reconstruction of wind field direction and intensity, partially derived from historical sources, the 1906 event was numerically simulated and results compared to deposit distributions. The modelling outcomes for the ash emission phase provide a better agreement with the measured tephra mass load for a simulation run in which ash aggregation (described by the models of Cornell et al. J Volcanol Geotherm Res 17:89-109, 1983, and Biass et al. Nat Hazard Earth Syst Sci 14:2265-2287, 2014) is specifically taken into account, confirming the importance of this process during tephra dispersal. The aggregation model that best fits the simulated results to the measured ground loadings has 80 % of particles Phi >= 4 that aggregate uniformly in the range Phi=-1 to 3. Two additional simulations of a VS event were carried out by using meteorological data of two specific periods to exemplify weather's potential on impacts of such eruptions, particularly tephra loading, on the surrounding areas. The model outcomes clearly highlight the major effects of differences in local meteorology on plume dynamics and ash dispersal and the key role of wind shear in determining the cumulative thickness of ground deposits. Results also show that, due to the long duration of this kind of eruption and the large variability in zonal winds at this latitude, ash dispersal and fallout from VS events at Vesuvius represent a probable hazard for all of the territory near Vesuvius, including the city of Naples, where cumulative tephra loadings might reach critical thresholds for roof collapse and infrastructure damage.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to track the system mode and diagnose a hybrid system without building an entire diagnoser off-line. The method is supported by a hybrid automaton (HA) model that represents the hybrid system continuous and discrete behavioral dynamics. This model is built on request through parallel composition of the component HA models. Diagnosis is performed by interpreting the events and measurements issued by the physical system directly on the HA model. This interpretation allows us to construct the useful parts of the diagnoser developing only the branches that are required to explain the occurrence of incoming events. The resulting diagnoser adapts to the system operational life and is much less demanding in terms of memory storage than the entire diagnoser. In addition to this feature, the proposed framework subsumes previous works in that it copes with both structural and nonstructural faults. The method is validated by the application to a case study based on the sewer network of the city of Barcelona.

AB  - This work focuses on using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite data in order to help mitigate the seismic risk of Bucharest Metropolis, the capital of Romania. The city has more than 2.5 million inhabitants and it is considered after Istanbul the second-most earthquake-endangered metropolis in Europe.
   This study is part of an ongoing joint project between National Institute of R-D for Earth Physics (NIRDEP) and Terrasigna Ltd. NIRDEP is taking care of the seismic network and data processing for the whole Romania, having a consistent number of seismic digital stations also in Bucharest. Terrrasigna applied the PSI technique to extract the ground deformation in Bucharest during July 2011 - January 2013, from a long time-series of SLC TerraSAR-X images. Based on the ground deformation satellite map, we can identify some seismic risk (hazard and vulnerability) in Bucharest Metropolis. The map reveals local ups and downs on the city surface, which could have different causes.
   If there is a larger settlement and structural damage begins, even almost unnoticed and an earthquake of magnitude more than 7 would come, (3 of such events were in Romania in the XX-th century: in the year 1940 with magnitude M-w = 7.6; year 1977, with magnitude M-w = 7.4, with almost 1400 people dead only in Bucharest, year 1986, with magnitude M-w = 7.1,) damage of the building could occur.
   That is why it is very useful to know, maybe with years in advance that a large settlement occurred and the buildings there could be affected by a strong earthquake.

AB  - Palembang is the capital city of South Sumatra Province with a population of about 1.8 million people and its territory is divided into two parts by the Musi River. Currently these two parts have only been connected by a bridge, the Ampera Bridge, whose traffic is concentrated on the major roads connected by the Ampera Bridge. Congestion occurs almost evenly in all parts of Palembang particularly at peak hour. Palembang is one of the major cities in Indonesia which have congestion problems.
   A construction plan of additional bridges has been planned in the past ten years. However, its implementation is delayed mainly due to land acquisition. In the general spatial plan of Palembang in 2012, it was stated that until the year 2037 there would have been constructed six bridges, yet the implementation would be delayed due to social issues and land acquisition. This study analysed the traffic conditions of Palembang with or without the construction of a bridge for the medium-term plan that is up to the year 2027, planning to construct four additional bridges. Traffic on the road network of Palembang was modelled using a four-step transport model developed by JICA STRADA program (System for Traffic Demand Analysis) where the ratio of traffic volume of the survey results with modelling results for 2014 produced a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.839. The results indicate that the constructions of Musi III Bridge in 2022 and Musi VII Bridge in 2027 for the medium term are very needed to deploy traffic movement and significantly reduce the congestion in Palembang. If the constructions of both bridges are delayed, Palembang will suffer from the severe congestion in both 2022 and 2027. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Kastamonu province has two different climates, because of the mountains along the east-west direction. Therefore also it has a very rich nature in terms of forest. This diversity affects forest structure, production techniques, working time and the forest villagers associated with these forestry subjects. In this study, forest villagers populations in six districts of Kastamonu, which are under the influence of the Black Sea, has been studied. Changes between 1965 and 2013 in the demographic structure of forest villagers living in these districts and temporal changes on the space of the changes has been demonstrated by using some assessment methods of the population. As a result of this study, we found that Inebolu, located on the Black Sea-Ankara road route, has the lowest level of migration rate of forest villagers among the coastal districts. Forest villagers continue to live in settlements which close to the center providing social and economic needs, in the opposite case they move away from settlements. It has also been concluded that some villages are empty and will continue to be empty due to the rapid migration in forest villages. Dependent population now is living mostly in forest villages and moreover retired and dependent forest villagers living in the city is returning to the forest villages. According to results; serious problems about providing local forest workers will be occurred in the near future. We conclude that forest managers should work on the subject of supplying forest workers.

AB  - A study of aerial photographs from the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (adjacent to Michigan City, Indiana, United States of America) revealed that from 1938 to 2008 the Lakeshore's Mount Baldy dune advanced inland 135 m, at an average rate of 1.9 m/year, while the beach north of the dune receded 98 m, at an average rate of 1.4 m/year. The highest rates of Mount Baldy dune movement (3.3 m/year) occurred concurrently (1965-1973) with highest rates of beach erosion (7.2 m/year). The lowest rates of Mount Baldy dune movement (0.3 m/year) occurred in 1958-1965 period. The highest rates of beach accretion (3.8 m/year) occurred twice, in 1951-1958 and in 1993-1999 periods. Climate data (Lake Michigan levels, precipitation, air and surface water temperature, frequency and intensity of the storms, and duration of nearshore shelf ice) were analyzed to determine what factors control rates of sand transport and coastal dune movement. The most favorable conditions for sand transport and coastal dune movement occur when Lake Michigan's level is rising and staying above the long term average, storms are more frequent, precipitation amount and duration of shelf ice are below the average, and air and surface water temperatures are above the average. When analyzed separately the order of most to least significant factors in sand transport and coastal dune migration rates is: frequency and intensity of the storms, rising Lake Michigan level, warmer than average air and lake surface water temperatures, shorter than average duration of nearshore shelf ice, and lower than average precipitation.

AB  - Background
   The symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is currently being trialled as a biocontrol agent in several countries to reduce dengue transmission. Wolbachia can invade and spread to infect all individuals within wild mosquito populations, but requires a high rate of maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility and low fitness costs in the host in order to do so. Additionally, extensive differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level and human density amongst the sites where this bacterium has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of Wolbachia's invasive potential.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We examined key phenotypic effects of the wMel Wolbachia strain in laboratory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background to characterize its invasive potential. We show that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission and has no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Next, to understand the effects of different urban landscapes on the likelihood of mosquito survival, we performed mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. We characterized the mosquito populations in relation to the socio-demographic conditions at these sites, and at three other future release areas. We then constructed mathematical models using both the laboratory and field data, and used these to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. We predict successful invasion at all five field sites, however the conditions by which this occurs vary greatly between sites, and are strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Through analysis of laboratory, field and mathematical data, we show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place.

AB  - This article analyzes the October 1905 pogroms in the Russian Empire. It explores the reasons for the pogroms, the perpetrators, the victims, and the consequences for the Jewish population. The article shows the differences and peculiarities of the pogroms, which occurred in the cities and shtetls, rural areas, on the railroads, and in the ports. The article also explores the attitude and involvement of the higher and local authorities, police, and troops in the pogroms. Historians continue to debate whether these pogroms occurred spontaneously or were organized by the Tsarist authorities. This article provides considerable evidence that the October 1905 pogroms were not a spontaneous reaction of conservatives to the revolutionary events, but rather was the policy of the Russian government directed toward the suppression of the revolutionary movement.

AB  - Immunocontraceptive vaccines have shown some promise for fertility control of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in urban and suburban habitats where traditional methods of population control may not be applicable. Currently, the only contraceptive vaccine approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in white-tailed deer is GonaCon (TM) lmmunocontraceptive Vaccine, but it is registered for use via hand-injection only. It has been suggested that remote-delivery of immunocontraceptives would be more cost-effective than hand-injection, but there is the potential for incomplete injection from a syringe-dart. Therefore, the purpose of our research was to: (1) conduct a dart configuration assessment trial to determine the ideal syringe-dart configuration for remote-delivery of GonaCon to white-tailed deer and (2) use the determined syringe-dart configuration in a subsequent trial to evaluate the vaccine efficacy when administered to female white-tailed deer via hand-injection versus syringe-dart. We saw comparable results with regard to vaccine dispersal during the dart configuration assessment and the efficacy trial; syringe-dart injected deer presented vaccine deposits and reaction sites both subcutaneously and intramuscularly, whereas, hand-injected deer presented vaccine deposits and reaction sites only intramuscularly. One year after administration, 4 of 5 deer treated with syringe-darts were pregnant, compared to 3 of 6 deer that received hand-injections. Anti-GnRH titers were negatively related to pregnancy status. We did not observe a high level of vaccine efficacy with the syringe-dart delivery method we used. Therefore, we recommend further research of syringe-dart delivery of GonaCon with a larger sample size where the vaccine is deployed in a single bolus similar to a hand-injected presentation.

AB  - Ecologic and cross-sectional multilevel analyses suggest that characteristics of the places where people live influence their vulnerability to HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Using data from a predominately substance-misusing cohort of African-American adults relocating from US public housing complexes, this multilevel longitudinal study tested the hypothesis that participants who experienced greater post-relocation improvements in economic disadvantage, violent crime, and male: female sex ratios would experience greater reductions in perceived partner risk and in the odds of having a partner who had another partner (i.e., indirect concurrency). Baseline data were collected from 172 public housing residents before relocations occurred; three waves of post-relocation data were collected every 9 months. Participants who experienced greater improvements in community violence and in economic conditions experienced greater reductions in partner risk. Reduced community violence was associated with reduced indirect concurrency. Structural interventions that decrease exposure to violence and economic disadvantage may reduce vulnerability to HIV/STIs.

AB  - Objectives Lack of familiarity between teammates is linked to worsened safety in high risk settings. The emergency department (ED) is a high risk healthcare setting where unfamiliar teams are created by diversity in clinician shift schedules and flexibility in clinician movement across the department. We sought to characterise familiarity between clinician teammates in one urban teaching hospital ED over a 22 week study period.
   Methods We used a retrospective study design of shift scheduling data to calculate the mean weekly hours of familiarity between teammates at the dyadic level, and the proportion of clinicians with a minimum of 2, 5, 10 and 20 h of familiarity at any given hour during the study period.
   Results Mean weekly hours of familiarity between ED clinician dyads was 2 h (SD 1.5). At any given hour over the study period, the proportions of clinicians with a minimum of 2, 5, 10 and 20 h of familiarity were 80%, 51%, 27% and 0.8%, respectively.
   Conclusions In our study, few clinicians could be described as having a high level of familiarity with teammates. The limited familiarity between ED clinicians identified in this study may be a natural feature of ED care delivery in academic settings. We provide a template for measurement of ED team familiarity.

AB  - The patterns of ground movement were monitored within a large, deep-seated landslide complex at Ventnor in southern England, between May 1998 and June 2002 using automated crackmeters, settlement cells and vibrating wire piezometers. It was found that the landslide maintains a state of marginal instability, such that it is subject to continual very slow deformation. Movement is primarily on a low-angled basal shear surface at > 90 m depth. The movement record shows a series of distinct deformation patterns that vary as groundwater conditions change. Continuous slow deformation occurs across the landslide complex at rates of between 5 and 10 mm/year. The background pattern of movement does not appear to correlate with local porewater pressure. Periods of more rapid movement (reaching up to c. 34 mm/year during the monitoring period) were associated with a period of elevated groundwater, although the relationship between movement rate and porewater pressure was complex. The patterns of movement and the landslide geometry suggest that the likelihood of a rapid, catastrophic failure is low. Future episodes of faster movement are likely during periods when porewater pressures at the basal shear surface are elevated above a critical threshold. Whilst the resulting surface deformation damages the town, it is unlikely to occur rapidly without significant changes to the landslide hydrogeology or the stress state within the landslide.

AB  - This paper investigates how digital traces of people's movements and activities in the physical world (e.g., at college campuses and commutes) may be used to detect local, short-lived events in various urban spaces. Past work that use occupancy-related features can only identify high-intensity events (those that cause large-scale disruption in visit patterns). In this paper, we first show how longitudinal traces of the coordinated and group-based movement episodes obtained from individual-level movement data can be used to create a socio-physical network (with edges representing tie strengths among individuals based on their physical world movement & collocation behavior). We then investigate how two additional families of socio-physical features: (i) group-level interactions observed over shorter timescales and (ii) socio-physical network tie-strengths derived over longer timescales, can be used by state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods to detect a much wider set of both high & low intensity events. We utilize two distinct datasets-one capturing coarse-grained SMU campus-wide indoor location data from hundreds of students, and the other capturing commuting behavior by millions of users on Singapore's public transport network-to demonstrate the promise of our approaches: the addition of group and socio-physical tie-strength based features increases recall (the percentage of events detected) more than 2-folds (to 0.77 on the SMU campus and to 0.73 at sample MRT stations), compared to pure occupancy-based approaches.

AB  - In developing countries like India, the traffic on urban roads is highly heterogeneous in nature, with vehicles of widely varying static and dynamic characteristics. This type of traffic is characterized by lack of queue and lane discipline (lane-less movement) based on availability of spaces near intersections. Moreover, at intersections, straight-through, left-, and right-turning vehicles seek to occupy the same physical space. In such situations, the through vehicles are susceptible to delays in the absence of turn lanes for the left-turning and right-turning vehicles and vice versa. Models suitable for analysis of such traffic flow hardly exist, and most of the available models are limited in scope. In the current study, a microscopic traffic simulation model for signalized intersection is developed specifically for heterogeneous traffic. This model covers different vehicle types and allows for some special behavior, such as seepage of two-wheelers to fronts of queues. Detailed study of queue formation and dissipation were done microscopically under non-lane-based traffic conditions near intersection area. The model was calibrated and tested with data from Chennai city, India, and its predictions were found to be in close agreement with the field data. In addition, the model makes a significant contribution to the study of right-turn lane (RTL) on delays to vehicles. In general, RTL is found to be advantageous for most cases of approach volumes and right-turn proportions. The optimal lengths of RTL are suggested for various approach volumes and right-turn proportions.

AB  - Background and Objectives
   The dramatic range expansion of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti is associated with various anthropogenic transport activities, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms driving this geographic expansion. We longitudinally characterized infestation of different vehicle types (cars, boats, etc.) to estimate the frequency and intensity of mosquito introductions into novel locations (propagule pressure).
   Methods
   Exhaustive adult and immature Ae. aegypti collections were performed on six different vehicle types at five ports and two bus/taxi departure points in the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru during 2013. Aquatic vehicles included 32 large and 33 medium-sized barges, 53 water taxis, and 41 speed boats. Terrestrial vehicles sampled included 40 buses and 30 taxis traveling on the only highway in the region. Ae. aegypti adult infestation rates and immature indices were analyzed by vehicle type, location within vehicles, and sampling date.
   Results
   Large barges (71.9% infested) and medium barges (39.4% infested) accounted for most of the infestations. Notably, buses had an overall infestation rate of 12.5%. On large barges, the greatest number of Ae. aegypti adults were found in October, whereas most immatures were found in February followed by October. The vast majority of larvae (85.9%) and pupae (76.7%) collected in large barges were produced in puddles formed in cargo holds.
   Conclusions
   Because larges barges provide suitable mosquito habitats (due to dark, damp cargo storage spaces and ample oviposition sites), we conclude that they likely serve as significant contributors to mosquitoes' propagule pressure across long distances throughout the Peruvian Amazon. This information can help anticipate vector population mixing and future range expansions of dengue and other viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the arbovirus with the widest impact on human health. Although its dispersal is partially conditioned by environmental constraints that limit the distribution of its main vector (Aedes aegypti), DENV has been spreading geographically in recent times, but mostly afflicting tropical and subtropical regions. With no prophylactic vaccine or specific therapeutics available, vector control remains the best alternative to restrain its circulation. Moreover, the establishment of thriving vector populations in peri urban environments brings humans and viruses together, opening the possibility for the occurrence of unexpected outbreaks. Europe is no exception: such was the case of Madeira in 2012. In addition to its impact on the health of the local population, health services, and economy, this outbreak revealed how difficult it may be to control the circulation of pathogenic arboviruses, especially taking into consideration that Europe is already partially colonized by another DENV vector, Aedes albopictus.

AB  - Founded primarily by Jewish-American immigrants after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Efrat has emerged as one of the most highly recognizable settlements in the occupied territories. Drawing on archival materials, the periodical press, and interviews never before brought to light, this article both explores the untold history of this 'city on a hilltop' as the product of a quadrilateral relationship between American-Israelis, the Israeli government, the native Israeli settler movement, and local Palestinian communities, as well as reconstructing the discourses in the making of Efrat, which combine religio-political imperatives alongside a deeply Americanized vision of building new, utopian, suburbanized communities in the occupied territories, during its formative years between 1973 and 1987.

AB  - Fundamental change at every level of our society, and new approaches to problem solving are needed to address twenty-first-century "wicked problems" such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, depletion of natural resources, and the widening gap between rich and poor. Transition Design is a proposition for a new area of design practice, study, and research that advocates design-led societal transition toward more sustainable futures. This reconception of entire lifestyles will involve reimagining infrastructures including energy resources, the economy and food, healthcare, and education. Transition Design focuses on the need for "cosmopolitan localism," a lifestyle that is place-based and regional, yet global in its awareness and exchange of information and technology. Transition Designers would apply a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of social, economic, and natural systems and the Transition Design framework proposes four key areas in which narratives, knowledge, skills, and action can be developed.

AB  - The mistletoe flora of southern Western Australia was studied over a 30-year period with a particular emphasis on distributions, host relationships and fire. The study area encompassed Western Australia south of similar to 26 degrees S. It included all the South-west Botanical Province and southern components of the Eremaean Botanical Province, with the northern boundary corresponding with bioregional boundaries. Vegetation ranges from wet and dry sclerophyll forest through woodlands and heaths to deserts. The mistletoe flora comprises 21 taxa, 19 in the Loranthaceae and two in the Santalaceae. They infect 153 species in 25 genera and 15 families. The Fabaceae provides hosts to more taxa than any other family; however, the genus with most host species, Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), supports only two mistletoe species, one of which barely enters the study area. Melaleuca (also Myrtaceae) is host to seven species. The number of mistletoe species per bioregion ranges from 0 to 18, with 12 species in the seven bioregions of the South-west Botanical Province and 20 in the six bioregions of Eremaean Botanical Province that are within the study area. In both provinces, diversity is lower in coastal areas and higher in more arid, inland areas. Most mistletoe habitats in the study area are fire-prone. One species is probably capable of resprouting whereas all other taxa are obligate seeders. With no means of in situ seed storage, post-fire recovery depends on seed importation. Fire is the most pervasive (but not the only) threatening process operating today. However, fire management in more populous agricultural and urban areas safeguards many populations in the South-west Province.

TI  - Ordinary Ethics and the Emergence of Plebeian Democracy across the Global South Buenos Aires's La Salada Market
T2  - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - SAO-PAULO
AB  - This study of La Salada, renamed by Cuartel's residents as the "poor people's shopping mall," was founded in the early 1990s, at the height of neoliberalism, by several dozen undocumented Bolivian immigrants and Argentine street hawkers in Cuartel, a pauperized, stigmatized, and disenfranchised district near the city of Buenos Aires. By the early 2000s, La Salada occupied a central place in public life in Cuartel and beyond and was described by the European Union as "emblematic of counterfeit markets" and among the 10 worst of its kind. In studying this market and the network of satellite "Saladitas" that have proliferated in hundreds of neighborhoods across the country, my aim is to analyze the way the "structural poor" and the recently impoverished middle class-in the course of practicing noninstitutional politics, socioeconomic informality, and a-legality-transformed themselves into plebeian citizens. These practices have contributed to the emergence of a new form of life: plebeian democracy. In order to make sense of it, I have highlighted the ordinary ethics that accompanied these practices. In dialogue with James Holston's study of "insurgent citizenship," my study of plebeian citizenship provides an alternative account of the development of democratic life across the global south.

AB  - Landslide, debris flow and rockfall are the main geohazards in the Rjecina River catchment. The Grohovo landslide is located on the northeastern slope in the central part of the Rjecina river valley just downstream of the Valici dam. As the effects of intense rainfall or earthquake, two potential geohazard events could occur. One scenario is that the slope deposits of Grohovo landslide moving towards the channel of the Rjecina River will form a landslide-dam. Another scenario is that the slope deposits mixing with water will form a debris flow arriving at the City of Rijeka. In this paper, the formation of landslide-dam and the debris-flow are simulated by two integrated models using GIS to represent the dynamic process across 3D terrains. GIS-based revised Hovland's 3D limit equilibrium model is used to simulate the movement and stoppage of the slope deposits to form landslide-dam. The simulation result shows about 9 m landslide-dam formed. GIS-based depth-averaged 2D numerical model is used to predict the runout distance and inundated area of a debris flow. As a result, the simulated debris-flow takes about 16 min to travel about 6 km along the Rjecina River valley arriving at the City of Rijeka.

AB  - On October 8, 2011, a massive landslide caused severe damage to State Route 14 (SR 14) in Cedar Canyon, 5 km outside Cedar City, Utah, U.S.A. The landslide detached approximately 1.1 million m(3) of material from the south side of the canyon, displaced parts of the road, and covered a 365-m stretch of the road under more than 30-m thick debris. Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) drilled three borings through the landslide material, placed slope inclinometers in the borings, and conducted a geophysical survey. We made detailed field observations, mapped discontinuities, and collected bedrock and colluvial soil samples for laboratory testing. The results of the study show that the landslide is a combination of rotational and translational movement, with majority of the failure occurring along the contact between the colluvial soil and the underlying bedrock. The triggering mechanism was most likely a rain and snow storm prior to October 8. Remedial measures, used by UDOT, to repair landslide and SR14 include re-grading the landslide slope to 1.75H:1V, placing riprap at the bottom of the slope to allow drainage, and installing a retaining wall below the road on the west side of the landslide.

AB  - In this article, we examine articulations of mobile citizenship produced through the discursive practices of state agencies, drawing in particular on a study of the contested reconfiguration of outdoor citizenship in Norway. Whilst increased participation and diversity in outdoor activities is highly valued and encouraged because of its social benefits, moral landscapes of the outdoors may be part of settling and reinforcing social differences and existing power relations. The article identifies three discursive normativities through which state officials negotiate mobility and outdoor citizenship; knowledge, skills and socialisation; engaging (with) nature; deserving (in) the outdoors. These normativities serve as a basis for a critical discussion of different aspects of outdoor movement, and how social identities interact with the citizen responsibilities assigned to different forms of mobility, such as mountain biking, skiing and walking. The article demonstrates how and why certain outdoor practices, spaces and boundaries of citizenship are both fluid and critically negotiated by the state officials. By bringing together theories of moral landscapes, mobility and citizenship, the article contributes to understandings of the politics of mobility, and particularly the theorisation of how morality works in relation to different dimensions of mobility. It also highlights how the contestation of mobile citizenship is an issue in rural as well as urban realms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on minority ethnic ageing remains a neglected area within mainstream race and ethnicity studies as well as that of social gerontology. This paper examines the background and reasons for this, arguing that a focus on minority ethnic issues provides a reminder of the complexity of the lifecourse, and of the diversity of ageing as a cultural, economic and social construction. The discussion reviews definitions of ethnicity and their relevance to work in social gerontology. The paper provides an account of early studies of minority ethnic ageing, identifying the strengths and limitations of this research. Later work is then considered, notably that focusing on issues connected with the rise of transnational communities and the changing character of neighbourhoods in urban environments. The paper argues that developing research on minority ethnic ageing has become especially important for understanding the impact of globalisation on re-defining communities, relationships and identities, within and beyond nation states. Globalisation, it is suggested, can be seen as a product of the movement of ethnic groups; equally, ethnic groups are themselves transformed by the possibilities created by global change. The paper concludes with a number of suggestions for embedding work on ethnicity within research in social gerontology.

AB  - A more comprehensive understanding of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission dynamics could facilitate public health initiatives to reduce the prevalence of HCV in people who inject drugs. We aimed to determine how HCV sequences entered and spread throughout Scotland and to identify transmission hot spots. A Scottish data set with embedded demographic data was created by sequencing the NS5B of 125 genotype 1a (Gt1a) samples and 166 Gt3a samples and analyzed alongside sequences from public databases. Applying Bayesian inference methods, we reconstructed the global origin and local spatiotemporal dissemination of HCV in Scotland. Scottish sequences mainly formed discrete clusters interspersed between sequences from the rest of the world; the most recent common ancestors of these clusters dated to 1942 to 1952 (Gt1a) and 1926 to 1942 (Gt3a), coincident with global diversification and distribution. Extant Scottish sequences originated in Edinburgh (Gt1a) and Glasgow (Gt3a) in the 1970s, but both genotypes spread from Glasgow to other regions. The dominant Gt1a strain differed between Edinburgh (cluster 2 [C2]), Glasgow (C3), and Aberdeen (C4), whereas significant Gt3a strain specificity occurred only in Aberdeen. Specific clusters initially formed separate transmission zones in Glasgow that subsequently overlapped, occasioning city-wide cocirculation. Transmission hot spots were detected with 45% of samples from patients residing in just 9 of Glasgow's 57 postcode districts. HCV was introduced into Scotland in the 1940s, concomitant with its worldwide dispersal likely arising from global-scale historical events. Cluster-specific transmission hubs were identified in Glasgow, the key Scottish city implicated in HCV dissemination. This fine-scale spatiotemporal reconstruction improves understanding of HCV transmission dynamics in Scotland.
   IMPORTANCE
   HCV is a major health burden and the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Public health needle exchange and "treatment as prevention" strategies targeting HCV are designed to reduce prevalence of the virus in people who inject drugs (PWID), potentially mitigating the future burden of HCV-associated liver disease. Understanding HCV transmission dynamics could increase the effectiveness of such public health initiatives by identifying and targeting regions playing a central role in virus dispersal. In this study, we examined HCV transmission in Scotland by analyzing the genetic relatedness of strains from PWID alongside data inferring the year individuals became infected and residential information at a geographically finer-scale resolution than in previous studies. Clusters of Scotland-specific strains were identified with regional specificity, and mapping the spread of HCV allowed the identification of key areas central to HCV transmission in Scotland. This research provides a basis for identifying HCV transmission hot spots.

AB  - The growth of urban areas adjacent to forest areas, as well as international trade growth, has accelerated the demand for food. These areas of growth have led to the deforestation of tropical forests, a process that contributes negatively to climate change, and a decline in the provision of environmental services and biodiversity. This article seeks to propose and simulate a theoretical model of optimal control at the household level. This model is used to explain the dynamics of forest loss by expansion of the agricultural frontier. Under these conditions, based on tradable permanent crops, farmers decide whether to install new areas for cultivation or manage existing ones in a context of increasing transportation costs. We simulate a theoretical model using data on permanent crops in the high forest of Peru. The results of the model establish that there is a limit to the expansion of the agricultural frontier of the rainforest due to transportation costs. This limit can be surpassed in the context of the free movement of labor whenever these costs cause a decrease and/or increase in the price of land cultivation. Finally, the main policy recommendations of this study emphasize the subordination of transport policy to agroforestry and the conservation of forest ecosystems policies. Agroforestry design forest policies should consider the differential impact of the construction of highways and rural roads on the loss of tree cover as well as on sustainable food production, given that deforestation is not accelerated by the mere existence of roads but by the incentives that are presented to settlers to guide their efforts toward clearing new forest areas.

AB  - The Great Migration of African Americans from the South at the beginning of the twentieth century had an enormous impact on cities in the Midwest and North including Hartford, Connecticut. This study examines the movement of African Americans to Hartford at the neighborhood and street level. The new arrivals, many from Georgia recruited to work in the Connecticut River valley tobacco farms, joined long-established African American residents of Hartford. A geographic information system (GIS) analysis at the street level illustrates residential differences within the African American community based on place of birth, socioeconomic status, and voting. In the north end of Hartford migrants from Georgia and Eastern European immigrants, for a moment in historical time, shared residential space at the street level. However the Eastern European immigrants had higher occupation status and moved out of the North End neighborhoods, which became increasingly racially segregated as the Great Migration continued.

AB  - Kenya's invasion of southern Somalia, which began in October 2011, has turned into an occupation of attrition - while "blowback" from the invasion has consolidated in a series of deadly Al-Shabaab attacks within Kenya. This article reviews the background to the invasion, Operation Linda Nchi, and the prosecution of the war by Kenya's Defence Forces up to the capture of the city of Kismayo and the contest to control its lucrative port. The second section discusses Al-Shabaab's response, showing how the movement has reinvented itself to take the struggle into Kenya. We conclude that while the military defeat of Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia seems inevitable, such a victory may become irrelevant to Kenya's ability to make a political settlement with its Somali and wider Muslim communities at home.

AB  - The implementation of the sterile insect technique for area-wide vector control requires that natural population density be accurately estimated to determine both the appropriate time to treat and the adequate number of sterile males for release. Herein, we used mark-release-recapture (MRR) to derive seasonal abundance estimates of Aedes albopictus population sizes within a delimited geographical area in Reunion Island. Population size of Ae. albopictus was estimated through four mark-release-recapture experiments carried out separately in different seasons. Marked males and females were released each time, and recaptured using BG sentinel traps for six consecutive days. Data were used to estimate the population size using a conceptual model that incorporates the variation in daily mortality rates. The likely influence of environmental factors on the magnitude of catches and on population fluctuation was analyzed. A total of 2827 mosquitoes (1914 males and 913 females) were marked and released on four occasions during dry and wet seasons. After release, 138 males (7.21%) and 86 females (9.41%) of the marked specimens were recaptured in subsequent samplings. The effectiveness of the daily captures of wild and released mosquitoes was significantly influenced by meteorological conditions such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed and light intensity. The estimates of Ae. albopictus population size obtained with our model estimator ranged from 298 to 1238 males and 604 to 2208 females per ha, with seasonal variability - higher population size in the humid season. The presented results will be essential in designing more effective sterile male release strategies for long-term suppression of wild Ae. albopictus populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The residence time of bacterial cells in the atmosphere is predictable by numerical models. However, estimations of their aerial dispersion as living entities are limited by a lack of information concerning survival rates and behavior in relation to atmospheric water. Here we investigate the viability and ice nucleation (IN) activity of typical atmospheric ice nucleation active bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae and P. fluorescens) when airborne in a cloud simulation chamber (AIDA, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cell suspensions were sprayed into the chamber and aerosol samples were collected by impingement at designated times over a total duration of up to 18 h, and at some occasions after dissipation of a cloud formed by depressurization. Aerosol concentration was monitored simultaneously by online instruments. The cultivability of airborne cells decreased exponentially over time with a half-life time of 250 +/- 30 min (about 3.5 to 4.5 h). In contrast, IN activity remained unchanged for several hours after aerosolization, demonstrating that IN activity was maintained after cell death. Interestingly, the relative abundance of IN active cells still airborne in the chamber was strongly decreased after cloud formation and dissipation. This illustrates the preferential precipitation of IN active cells by wet processes. Our results indicate that from 10(6) cells aerosolized from a surface, one would survive the average duration of its atmospheric journey estimated at 3.4 days. Statistically, this corresponds to the emission of 1 cell that achieves dissemination every similar to 33 min m(-2) of cultivated crops fields, a strong source of airborne bacteria. Based on the observed survival rates, depending on wind speed, the trajectory endpoint could be situated several hundreds to thousands of kilometers from the emission source. These results should improve the representation of the aerial dissemination of bacteria in numeric models.

AB  - The pathways of information are changing, the physical world itself is becoming a type of information system. In what's called the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects-from roadways to pacemakers-are linked through wired and wireless networks, often using the same Internet Protocol (IP) that connects the Internet. When objects can both sense the environment and communicate, they become tools for understanding complexity and responding to it swiftly. The revolutionary part in all this is that these physical information systems are now beginning to be deployed, and some of them even work largely without human intervention. This paper has addressed the traffic congestion problem with the help of Internet of Things. Increase in the number of vehicles in cities caused by the population and development of economy, has stimulated traffic congestion problems. It is becoming more serious day after day in the present scenario of developing countries. The reason for the same could be categorized as mismanagement of vehicular movement, ineffective system for controlling the mobility of vehicles, uneven roads and traffic snarl-up. Unexpected vehicular queuing is a major concern leading to wasting time of passengers and thwarting ambulance to reach the destination in time. In addition to that, traffic congestion makes it difficult to forecast the travel time accurately causing drivers to allocate more time in travel than scheduled previously. To ease these mounting traffic problems a demonstration is made on the Proof of Concept (POC) using the smart city data set provided by Telecom Italia of Milan city, to verify that these concepts have the potential for real world application and could be used by the government sectors or private transport organizations to ameliorate the passenger's comfort on road which are as follows. A central node is developed which sets the speed limit and predicts a normalized speed separately for each locality from the available data set. For efficient control in mobility of vehicles an advanced dynamic digital board is introduced, which displays the speed limit set by the central node time to time. The normalized speed could be used to estimate the effective time taken between destinations precisely. By comparing normalized speed with real time values anomalies in the locality like congestion and presence of uneven roads is predicted. Accident detection model is integrated with the central node which sends a message to dynamic board indicating location of the accident along with the time taken. It even improves traffic flow around the accident occurred location. Central node together with navigation tools could provide rerouted path to the drivers during congestion or accident.

AB  - In the framework of a wider systematic survey aimed at studying non-indigenous species in Italian harbours and marinas, the ascophoran bryozoan Celleporaria brunnea was detected for the first time in the western Mediterranean Sea. The species is presumably native to the Pacific coasts of North America and is distributed from British Columbia to the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador). In the Mediterranean Sea, C. brunnea was first recorded in 2004 in the inner part of Izmir Bay near Alsancak harbour (Turkey) and later reported along the Lebanese coasts. The species was recently detected in Cascais marina in Portugal and in the Arcachon Basin (France), documenting the first records in the eastern Atlantic. The finding in the Italian harbours of La Spezia (Liguria), Olbia (Sardinia) and Lampedusa (off Sicily) marks its western and northernmost occurrence within the Mediterranean basin. Pathways of introduction into the western Mediterranean Sea are discussed, concluding that hull fouling is the most likely vector. The species may be expected to appear soon in other harbours of the Mediterranean basin.

AB  - This paper investigates the Gangeviertel movement in Hamburg and the place which the activists have (re) constructed since its occupation in 2009 through the lens of Foucault's (1986) concept of heterotopia. In the light of the recent debate about the role of cultural activism in the contemporary struggle about urban development, it explores the question which spatial practices and structures have evolved as oppositional to or in alignment with the neoliberal status quo of Hamburg's spatial policy. Based on a qualitative case-study approach, the research was carried out in 2013. By using the analytical categories built environment, social practice and neoliberal normalisation, it illustrates that the Gangeviertel is characterised by practices that position it simultaneously both in-and outside of the neoliberal logic.

AB  - Understanding taxi mobility has significant social and economic impacts on the urban areas. The goal of this paper is to visualize and analyze the spatio-temporal driving patterns for two income-level groups, i.e. high-income and low-income taxis, when they are not occupied. Specifically, we differentiate the cruising and stationary states of non-occupied taxis and focus on the analysis of the mobility patterns of these two states. This work introduces an approach to detect the stationary spots from a large amount of non-occupied trajectory data. The visualization and analysis procedure comprises of mainly the visual analysis of the cruising trips and the stationary spots by integrating data mining and visualization techniques. Temporal patterns of the cruising trips and stationary spots of the two groups are compared based on the line charts and time graphs. A density-based spatial clustering approach is applied to cluster and aggregate the stationary spots. A variety of visualization methods, e.g. map, pie charts, and space-time cube views, are used to show the spatial and temporal distribution of the cruising centers and the clustered and aggregated stationary spots. The floating car data collected from about 2000 taxis in 47 days in Shanghai, China, is taken as the test dataset. The visual analytic results demonstrate that there are distinctive cruising and stationary driving behaviors between the high-income and low-income taxi groups.

AB  - Quantitative dye-tracing methods were utilized in a portion of the greater Springfield, Missouri metropolitan area. These methods were used to evaluate factors influencing groundwater movement through the shallow karst system in the area. Fortuitous timing of these studies with a summer drought allowed for very low-flow conditions to be tested, and the results of these tests suggest that shallow groundwater in the study area occurs in fractures and along bedding planes, with a significant input component from flow along bedding planes or other sub-horizontal features. Based on one unique trace, it appears that recent dye traces may be affected by groundwater elevations, where crossover from one conduit system to another occurs under most water level conditions, but ceases under the lowest flow conditions.

TI  - THE 2014 SOUTH NAPA EARTHQUAKE AND ITS RELEVANCE FOR NEW ZEALAND
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE NEW ZEALAND SOCIETY FOR EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - The South Napa earthquake occurred on Sunday, 24 August 2014 at 3.20 am local time at a depth of 10.7 km, having MW 6.0 and causing significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in the City of Napa and generating strong ground shaking in a region well known for its wine production. Parallels exist between the damage in past New Zealand earthquakes, particularly to unreinforced masonry buildings, and the disruption in the Marlborough region following the recent 2013 MW 6.5 Seddon earthquake. Furthermore, the event was the largest to have occurred in Northern California since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake 25 years earlier, and hence was an important event for the local community of earthquake researchers and professionals regarding the use of a physical and virtual clearinghouse for data archiving of damage observations. Because numerous URM buildings in the City of Napa had been retrofitted, there was significant interest regarding the observed performance of different retrofitting methods.
   Following a brief overview of the earthquake affected area and previous earthquakes to have caused damage in the Napa Valley region, details are provided regarding the characteristics of the 2014 South Napa earthquake, the response to the earthquake including placarding procedures and barricading, and more specific details of observed building and non- structural damage. Aspects of business continuity following the South Napa earthquake are also considered. One conclusion is that in general the seismic retrofitting of URM buildings in the Napa region proved to be very successful, and provides an important benchmark as New Zealand begins to more actively undertake seismic assessment and retrofitting of its earthquake prone building stock. It is also concluded that there are sufficient similarities between New Zealand and California, and a rich network of contacts that has developed following the hosting of many US visitors to New Zealand in conjunction with the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes, that it is sensible for the New Zealand earthquake engineering community to maintain a close focus on ongoing earthquake preparedness and mitigation methods used and being developed in USA, and particularly in California.

AB  - In the context of the collapse of France in June 1940, the Franco regime saw the golden opportunity to fulfil the old yearning for occupying the international city of Tangier and incorporating it immediately into the Spanish Protectorate. Although the area of the Strait of Gibraltar was of priority concern for Great Britain, in those difficult hours other more vital interests were put before, so the occupation was accepted as a fait accompli and, by adopting an appeasing policy combined with an economic aid essential to Franco's Spain, Great Britain succeeded in concluding an Anglo-Spanish Great Britain succeeded in concluding an Anglo-Spanish agreement on Tangier which - although violated by the Spaniards on many occasions-preserved the enclave's special status of free trade, as well as the freedom of movement for the British community which was a great asset to the Allies, whose secret services had there a significant base to infiltrate in French Morocco controlled by Vichy. Tangier also became the main center of espionage and political propaganda of the Axis in North Africa, in particular of Germany, whose secret activities from her recovered Consulate General in Tangier were favoured by the Francoist Government. This paper analyses the multiple functions performed by the secret agents from both sides, as well as some noteworthy incidents of this clandestine activity, such as a bomb explosion in the harbor of Tangier in February 1942.

AB  - Rivers are naturally dynamic over time and space and respond to the variability of water and sediment inputs and to anthropogenic pressures that cause changes to the river's behaviour and form. This study describes the evolution of part of the Morava River and the Kenicky meander in the Litovelske Pomoravi protected area near the city of Olomouc. The research describes the historical development of the study area using aerial photos, UAV images and geodetic measurements. Long-term measurements and imaging using UAV technologies have allowed a large amount of information to be collected. This information was used to study the Kenicky meander and the Morava River. Significant lateral channel changes in the banks have occurred in the past and generated the Kenicky meander. A significant event occurred in the spring of 2012, when high water levels were caused a rupture of a meander-natural cutoff. The water level was monitored in the Kenicky wood accumulation, which formed in the Kenicky meander, before and after the rupture. Monitoring the movement of wood in the river basin is particularly important because the movement of ice in the winter can cause blockage of the channel and subsequent flooding of water over the banks and into the surrounding communities.

AB  - This article analyzes the quotidian ways that older Chicagoans remade and traversed physical boundaries between their homes and the city beyond. In so doing, it explores how changing engagements with the environment impact social personhood in later life. In a context in which personhood is equated with independence, elders relying on paid care workers to remain in their homes found themselves at the threshold of social death. To sustain their independence and personhood, older Chicagoans sought to prevent spatial and social transitions using a range of everyday tactics and material practices located around the doorways of their homes. These liminal practices simultaneously reasserted racial, class, and other social distinctions between elders, home care workers and others, helping elders continue to occupy familiar subject positions. For these older adults, homes and their thresholds became resources with which they resisted profound changes to their daily lives, subjectivities, and social personhood.

AB  - The street situation population has been shown as a growing urban phenomenon, becoming an object of interest to public managers and academics. This paper presents the results of a research aimed at understanding the context of street situation residents, under current provisory institutional shelter care, analyzing why the streets have become the home for some people; how the process of development and adaptation of daily activities in this new reality occurred; when and why they decided to leave the streets and how this process of production of a new daily life occurred since the institutional care; and how they organize and plan their departure from the host service. To this end, open interviews and production of narratives of life stories were conducted with seven residents of an institutional shelter care, along with participant observation for one year in the same service, where staff, residents and institutional dynamics were systematically observed. The results show that the users of this service have gone through different paths in life, with a trace in common: the growing weakening of bonds and purchasing power. The service seems to contribute to the movement of departure from the streets and provides immediate host, welcoming and functional autonomy. However, the departure movement from the shelter - that would provide other autonomies, development of social supports and integrated assistance - appears in the life stories as a difficult process with little institutional support. This work highlights the need to build debates and proposals on the homelessness process.

AB  - Evagorou (2011, p. 133) describes an experiment in Cyprus developing project Technoskepsi involving students aged 9-12 years and their teachers, in a primary school (K12). Using some computers with text editor, students built stories of their villages (neighborhoods) from some socio-scientific issues (SSI), investigating everyday experiences and images of the city, with internet aid and guided tours. In our case, we try to establish a dialogue between formal and non-formal education, guided by controversial socio-scientific issues (Reis & Galvao, 2008; Sadler, 2011). The city of Piuma, located on the coast of Espirito Santo state in Brazil, has about 18,000 inhabitants, whose region has an economy based on fishing and crafts. But every year this city suffers from the increasing population in carnival period, reaching about 30-40 thousand. This fact impacts the quality of life of the people of that city, for example, environmental sanitation, supply of drinking water and safe collection and selective waste. Also, after the Carnival period, we can see the increase in cases of sexually transmitted diseases and teen pregnancy. Based on the pedagogy of projects of Hernandez (1998), built a school project production of amateur documentaries, called Project "CurtaCiencia", involving high school students in Piuma city. Four documentaries were built using movie maker, based on the following guiding questions (issues): (a) Waste accumulation: lack of education or destination need?; (b) Use of drugs in adolescence: a social or educational issue?; (c) Carnival and health: and after the party?; and (d) Shells with craft tales: occupation or increased income?. So the aim of this research was to analyze the pedagogical potential of this school project, seeking to identify the dialogues produced between formal and non-formal education. This qualitative research, case study, was conducted from observations and interviews, analyzed based on Bardin (2011, p. 47), and focus group interviews were analyzed based on Gatti (2005, p. 11). The research was conducted from November 2013 to June 2014, the Piuma campus of Federal Institute of Espirito Santo State (Brazil), with participation of thirteen students from the technical course integrated into the high school and teachers, all volunteers, was carried out in five steps: [Step I]: selective test for selection of high school students; [Step II]: formation of the work team with training workshops - photography production, brainstorming, documentaries scripts, and Movie Maker; [Step III]: Understanding the controversial socio-scientific issues to form working groups (WG); [Step IV]: Building documentaries with workshops, research themes, interviews and photographs; and [Step V]: Final meeting. Presentation of documentaries for the school community. The pedagogical and philosophical analysis was performed based on the aspects of non-formal education and the movement of Science, Technology, Environment and Society (STES) and scientific literacy. This study had the main authors: Attico Chassot, Glen Aikenhead, Maria Evagorou, Anna Maria Pessoa de Carvalho, Decio Auler, Wildson Luiz Pereira dos Santos, Fernando Hernandez and Maria da Gloria Gohn. Thus, the school project provided an opportunity for students to reflect on the social, economic, technological, cultural, environmental, in addition to scientific issues, guided by a controversial social-scientific theme of the city of Piuma of Brazil.

AB  - Rainfall water plays the basic role in mass movements activation in Polish Carpathians. Its infiltration has impact on seepage processes and changes of pore water pressures and thus affect the strength parameters of soils inside the slopes. Investigated colluviums built from flysch layers of weathered claystones and sandstones were difficult for in situ and laboratory tests. High quality core drillings, sampling, geophysical investigations, laboratory tests and instrumentation provided data for slope stability analysis. Monitoring played a special role in the project. Recognition of weather and groundwater conditions influence on movement's activation was realized using inclinometer, piezometer, pore pressure and meteorological monitoring instrumentation. In 2010 new automatic, on-line early warning system was installed at Szymbark landslide near the city of Gorlice. Measurements in standard system allowed observation of landslide behavior after intensive precipitations in Polish Carpathians in June 2006 and May-June 2010. Measurements in on-line system started during intensive rainfalls and flood in June 2010. The results confirm the relationship between rainfalls, changes of pore pressure values and displacements activation. The highest rainfalls were followed by intense increase and decrease of pore pressures. The movements usually occurred after precipitations of 200-250 mm, lasted one or a few days depending on the initial saturation conditions. These processes caused reactivation of existing landslides or forming a new ones. Research proved that monitoring of rainfalls, pore pressures and displacements could help in recognition of movement activation triggers for selected landslides. It may be also useful in landslide prediction, remediation works and early warning.

AB  - Critics of human rights are hesitant to reject them outright for fear of undermining the work they may do in resisting oppression. This pragmatic justification is central to celebrations of human rights as well, but is it more than a failure to move beyond liberal hegemony? I argue that human rights have radical potential because the act of claiming such rights uses the ambiguous but universal identity of 'humanity' to make claims on the established terms of legitimate authority. The potential of human rights to fight for social change is examined by looking at the movement for a human right to housing in the USA. I explore how homeless individuals, public housing tenants and low-income urban residents realise their human right to housing through eviction defences, the occupation of 'people-less' homes, and attempts to remake the structure of home ownership through community land trusts.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the impact of cognitive impairments on driving in adults with ADHD. The present study compared the performance of adults with and without ADHD in a driving simulator on two different routes: an urban route which we hypothesised would exacerbate weak impulse control in ADHD and a motorway route, to challenge deficits in sustained attention.
   Methods: Adults with (n = 22, 16 males) and without (n = 21, 18 males) ADHD completed a simulated driving session while eye movement data were recorded simultaneously. Participants also completed the Manchester Driving Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS). Measures of driving performance included average speed, proportion distance travelled over speed limit (speeding) and lane deviation. These variables and the eye movement measures (spread of fixations, mean fixation duration) were compared between groups and routes. Also, driving behaviours, including responses to programmed events, were categorised and the frequencies within categories were compared between groups. Finally, speech analysis was performed to compare emotional verbal expressions during driving between groups.
   Results: ADHD participants reported significantly more Violations and Lapses on the DBQ than control participants and significantly more accidents. Average speed and speeding were also higher but did not interact with route type. ADHD participants showed poorer vehicle control, greater levels of frustration with other road users (including greater frequencies of negative comments) and a trend for less safe driving when changing lanes/overtaking on the motorway. These effects were predicted by hyperactive/impulsive CAARS scores. They were also more likely to cause a crash/near miss when an event occurred on the urban route.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that difficulty regulating and controlling impulsive behavior, reflected in speeding, frustration with other road users, less safety when changing lanes on the motorway and a greater likelihood of an accident following an unexpected event, underlie impaired driving in ADHD. Hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms correlated with these indices. Deficits in sustained attention seemed to play a lesser role in this particular study, although further research is needed to determine whether effects on attention emerge over longer periods of time and/or are influenced by the novelty of the simulator environment.

AB  - To capitalize on the range of opportunities for economic revitalization in emerging tropical economies, Wet Grounds, Emerging Landscapes of Storage, investigates the urban development patterns that are characteristic of tropical latitudes and identifies those which support the growth of hydraulic accumulation methods throughout the region. Utilizing the Chao Phraya River Plain in Thailand IFig.11 as a testing ground and looking to storage as both an ecological and economic strategy, this design research project outlines a two-prong water storage strategy. Primarily, the strategy aims to expand methods of retention, distribution, and circulation of rainwater. Secondly, the strategy develops ways to manage water flows often caused by urbanization, occurring in the manufacturing corridors of river deltas. These two aims are achieved while developing ways of managing water through agricultural and industrial systems that enable the economic diversification of local markets [Fig, 21. Wet Grounds reveals an opportunity to foster new urbanization networks in Thailand. Given a landscape facing industrial growth and climate complexities, different water storage infrastructures will work to support emerging industries and farms. 'Within this developing field of hydrologic infrastructure, distinctive industrial nodes provide the flexible and logistical capacity of landscapes of hydraulic accumulation as a process for capital generation [Fig. 31. Wet grounds emphasizes the need to build a contemporary climatic and spatial strategy that utilizes rainwater storage to support responsible water management for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses at the regional level.

AB  - In a context of increasing interest in energy efficiency, the attention to the environmental quality is bringing the city of the future to be structured on energy smart grids for electricity, heat and natural gas production and distribution. The Multifunctional Environmental Energy Tower intends to be considered as a node in the future Smart Grid of the borough "Rome EUR", to decrease the primary energy consumption from fossil fuels, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to maximize the energy production from renewable sources, as required by the European Union objectives at 2020. Renewable energy generation systems are integrated in a single vertically developed building, where energy is mainly produced from waste in integration with thermal and electrical energy storage systems, to create an intelligent tower combining and meeting together energy demand and supply.
   This integrated system allows to overcome some problems related to the renewable energy sources usage: their non-programmability, the land occupation and consumption, the social acceptance and the imbalances in the electricity grid. The designed building produces electricity for the grid, ensuring the air conditioning for Acea's company utilities and to feed the existing heating district network located in "Torrino-Mezzocammino" district within "Rome Eur" borough.
   The architectural components were designed to link the architectural view and the functional aspects, because its location within the roman roads net developing from the "Grande Raccordo Anulare" (GRA) the tower is configured as a totem of energy efficiency and technological innovation.

T2  - RURAL PROTEST GROUPS AND POPULIST POLITICAL PARTIES
LA  - English
CP  - Seminar on Rural Protest Groups and Populist Political Parties - Exploring Objectives, Activities and Relationships
AB  - It is possible to distinguish three waves of populism in the Netherlands. The first occurred between 1960 and 1990, involving parties with some populist elements but which did not articulate a populist ideology. Only one, the Farmers' Party, had roots in a rural protest movement, but it disappeared in the early 1980s. In the second wave in the 1990s, two parties that did articulate a populist ideology entered the scene: Liveable Netherlands and the Socialist Party (SP). While the former disintegrated within a decade, the latter has been quite successful and stable. In the third wave, after 2000, three right-wing populist parties were founded, List Pim Fortuyn, Proud of the Netherlands and the Freedom Party (PVV). While the first two disintegrated and disappeared within a few years, the third has been quite successful in electoral terms. None of these third-wave parties had roots in a social protest movement, whether urban or rural. In general, the parties were founded by political entrepreneurs, except for the SP, founded in 1971, which had a background in communism. However, the different rates of success can be attributed more to their ideological mix and organisation rather than their genesis. The SP shed its populist Marxist-Leninism and evolved into a leftwing social-democratic party with populist elements while building a very solid and disciplined organisation. The PVV has combined populism with nationalism, anti-Islamism and a conservative welfare statism. It lacks a formal organisation, however, which has created some problems in the past and might do so even more in the future.

AB  - The design by the architect Alvarez Castelao for the Biological and beological Sciences building in the city of Oviedo marks for many the peak of his career, combining in it all he learnt in almost thirty years of work The image of Castelao's maturity in the conception of this design is the result of many year; of implementation of his solid ideas, which are consistent with the architecture inherited from the modern movement. His gentle treatment of space and attention to detail are captured in this work through the special observation of the concatenation of the generating idea and the realization of it. He designed this space of remarkable quality and functionality knowing full well that a building with such a complete architectural scheme may evoke feelings which could go beyond the perception of space itself.
   The prominent geometry of the building strikes at first sight, presenting a configuration clearly differentiated by two complementary parts of entirely different geometry. The building opens up to the street as a large L-shaped block of departments, with an imposing front but perfectly integrated in the city. The classrooms occupy a lower and central configuration, and merge with the garden in the inner part of the block. By doing so, the architect ably meets the condition of open block imposed by the planning of this area, and at the same time he separates the different uses of the building adapting each of the parts to their respective needs.
   In an apparently simple sketch, Castelao exposes a complex building where the joint of the two pieces and their position it relation to each other are loaded with symbolism and functionality. These two pieces should be better understood as complementary rather than antagonistic, since each would lose pail of its meanings without the other one, and so the project would be incomplete. Both buildings are identified with different references, scales, geometries, distributions and tours. Both of them are consistent with their own applications. Both of them relate to different ideas and create a set of geometries associated to two different worlds. This reflection becomes the seed starting point, and therefore the blossom idea of the project. The classroom building faces the block of departments, two opposing volumes with two opposing values, organic and mineral, the purposes of the building (biology and geology).
   In order to duly analyze the building, it is necessary to start doing it from an urban per spective, then think about the generating idea and conclude studying the building in its constructive detail. This analysis will reveal interconnections, acknowledging a high quality building which worths respect, despite the unfortunate changes in it over the past years.

AB  - This paper describes the slide mechanism of the Chaancun Landslide, which is the second largest landslide to have occurred in northeast China. The damage caused by the landslide poses a threat to a road with heavy traffic, endangers local residents, has created the potential for a reservoir dam-break, and may trigger other secondary disasters. The landslide has caused $7.35 million of losses, and potential future losses remain large. It is therefore important to analyze the slide mechanism of the Chaancun Landslide and propose a treatment as soon as possible. By analyzing the engineering geological conditions, the slide mechanism based on the formation process, the stability of the slope, monitoring data, and numerical simulation analysis was studied. The results revealed that the Chaancun Landslide was triggered by the excavation of the slope toe. The landslide was a partial revival of an ancient landslide and was a thrust load-caused landslide.

LA  - English
CP  - Traffic and Granular Flow
AB  - The paper deals with development of both macroscopic and microscopic approaches to the mathematical modeling of multilane vehicular traffic on city roads and highways. The macroscopic model considers synchronized traffic flow, uses the continuum approach and is based on the original quasi-gas-dynamic (QGD) system of equations. The distinguishing feature of the model is the variable transverse velocity reflecting the speed of lane changing. The numerical implementation is explicit, the similarity with kinetically consistent finite difference schemes is used. The microscopic model is based on the cellular automata theory and presents generalization of Nagel-Schreckenberg model to the multilane case. The computational domain is the 2D lattice where two directions correspond to the road length and width. The number of cells in the transverse direction corresponds to the number of lanes. Each cell of the lattice can be either empty or occupied by one vehicle. Such a model allows vehicles to change lanes and to overtake one another. The algorithm of cell state update is formed by two components: lane change (if it is necessary and possible), movement along the road by the rules of N-S model.

TI  - Improved Algorithms for the Evacuation Route Planning Problem
T2  - COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS, (COCOA 2015)
LA  - English
CP  - 9th Annual International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications (COCOA)
AB  - Emergency evacuation is the process of movement of people away from the threat or actual occurrence of hazards such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires and bombs. In this paper, we focus on evacuation from a building, but the ideas can be applied to city and region evacuation. We define the problem and show how it can be modeled using graphs. The resulting optimization problem can be formulated as an integer linear program. Though this can be solved exactly, this approach does not scale well for graphs with thousands of nodes and several hundred thousands of edges. This is impractical for large graphs.
   We study a special case of this problem, where there is only a single source and a single sink. For this case, we give an improved algorithm Single Source Single Sink Evacuation Route Planner (SSEP), whose evacuation time is always at most that of a famous algorithm Capacity Constrained Route Planner (CCRP), and whose running time is strictly less than that of CCRP. We prove this mathematically and give supporting results by extensive experiments. We also study randomized behavior model of people and give some interesting results.

AB  - Considering the world status of China, one would be concerned that Hong Kong is left with 32 more years, by 2047, to demonstrate how one country, two systems works, and to make the case that, by the time the 50-year period of no change promise for the Special Administrative Region expires, its people deserve a fair review of the arrangement of their future. Having endured 18 years of increasingly unpopular and ineffective government since 1997, citizens find little patience to delay full recognition of the root causes and engagement with the long-standing problems that weigh dangerously on the tipping point. In anticipation of the promised move to a fair and democratic political system, the community realises that they are now at a crossroads of whether to trust, to evade, to fight for, or to accept what will be allowed and given by the Beijing authority. Ordinary people have awakened to see a Hong Kong they never imagined plausible, in an endless process of Kafkaesque metamorphosis, whereby the core values and way of life are subject to the ultimate twist of logic, reason and normality. At this crucial juncture of history came the Umbrella Movement of 2014, the collective action of civil disobedience against the status quo that shocked the world. The 79-day occupy action has transformed the city, which can no longer be the same again. It would be pertinent to identify the cultural-political factors that precipitated the public discourse, to re-shuffle the power hierarchy, and to shape the social body that engenders the deep crisis of subjectivity among the local people.

AB  - This paper presents the results of research that aimed to understand the institutionalization of the first ethnic schools in Parana, its form of organization of the curriculum and how articulated the historical process of the country in the early of the First Republic. The ethnic schools taught language and the preservation of their culture. On the other hand, the immigration process accelerated the colonization movement in Parana, with occupation of empty spaces propitious to the development of agriculture, trade and industry and the substitution of slave labor by wage labor. Thus, there was encouraging the development of cities, which stimulated trade and encouraged the setting up of infrastructure. In this historical context seek to understand the importance of the role and influence of ethnic schools for the educational organization in Parana until their extinction with the nationalization policy which caused changes in the organization of these didactic and educational institutions. The theoretical-methodological axis allows to reconstruct a totalitarian history, analyzing the determinants of economic, political and social. To understand the institutionalization of ethnic schools in Parana, started from the analysis of this situation, as well as surveying and cataloging of primary and secondary sources, in selected public institutions, museums and private collections.

AB  - In January and February 2013, heavy rainfall during local summer storms triggered a large number of landslides in the Andes Main and Frontal ranges of central Chile and Argentina (32 degrees-34 degrees S). Most of the mass movements classify as debris flows, while rockfalls and debris avalanches also occurred. The major debris flows occurred in the Maipo and Aconcagua valleys (Chile) and along the Mendoza River valley (Argentina). The debris flows caused serious disruption to the international highway connecting both countries and local roads and produced a large impact on the population of major cities downstream, mainly due to potable water supply cutoffs. Debris flow deposits have silt and clay particles usually ranging between 10 and 20% by weight, which favors the movement of viscous flows in short, steep lateral gullies. Most of the flows tended to channelize, and the materials were deposited in alluvial fans and cones in areas with previous records of such events. This indicates that they constitute a significant hazard that may not have been properly considered in road infrastructure and potable water supply strategies for the region. This potential hazard may become more serious due to climate change in the near future.

KW  - PHILOSOPHY
AB  - Early Christianity is often regarded as an entirely lower-class phenomenon, and thus characterised by a low educational and cultural level. This view is false for several reasons. (1) When dealing with the ancient world, inferences cannot be made from the social class to which one belongs to one's educational and cultural level. (2) We may confidently state that in the early Christian urban congregations more than.. per cent of the members could read and write at an acceptable level. (3) Socialisation within the early congregations occurred mainly through education and literature. No religious figure before (or after) Jesus Christ became so quickly and comprehensively the subject of written texts! (4) The early Christians emerged as a creative and thoughtful literary movement. They read the Old Testament in a new context, they created new literary genres (gospels) and reformed existing genres (the Pauline letters, miracle stories, parables). (5) From the very beginning, the amazing literary production of early Christianity was based on a historic strategy that both made history and wrote history. (6) Moreover, early Christians were largely bilingual, and able to accept sophisticated texts, read them with understanding, and pass them along to others. (7) Even in its early stages, those who joined the new Christian movement entered an educated world of language and thought. (8) We should thus presuppose a relatively high intellectual level in the early Christian congregations, for a comparison with Greco-Roman religion, local cults, the mystery religions, and the Caesar cult indicates that early Christianity was a religion with a very high literary production that included critical reflection and refraction.

AB  - The need for urban growth and development has been driving man to occupy areas once considered improper or of low interest, due to the presence of low-resistance and highly compressive soft soil. Nowadays it is possible to improve soil by installing prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) with geosynthetics. These drains can also be assisted by applying vacuum, equivalent to the pressure of an embankment up to 4m high, but with less need for earth movement to mobilize and demobilize the temporary overload. This technology is being applied in a highway construction in an alluvial soft soil deposit extending for over 100 km, currently in progress in Latin America. Several undisturbed samples were extracted and tested in laboratory to determine soil compressibility and consolidation time. To assess the efficiency of the methods employed for sampling and molding specimens, quality indexes of consolidation tests carried out in the highway construction site are presented. Given the variable nature of this soil formation, back analyses were carried out to assess the compressibility and consolidation time of the alluvial soft soil.

TI  - Face Stability Evaluation of a TBM-Driven Tunnel in Heterogeneous Soil Using a Probabilistic Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS
LA  - English
AB  - The stability condition of the tunnel face is of great importance in both conventional and modern [tunnel-boring machine (TBM)] methods of construction. Inadequate and excessive amounts of support pressure toward the face lead to surface settlement and blowout, respectively, whereas blowout occurs only in cases of pressurized shield implementation. In this research, the stability condition of a tunnel face excavated by an earth pressure balanced shield (EPBS) in Line 3 of the Tehran subway in Iran was investigated. Considering the sensitivity of urban facilities to ground movement, and to reduce uncertainty, data simulation by Monte Carlo technique was applied. Random data generated through a simulation process were used in an analytical method to calculate the factor of safety and its probability of being less than a predetermined value for a certain amount of applied support pressure. The soil was modeled by finite-element software, and the amount of face pressure at which the face collapses was calculated. These procedures were followed for face stability evaluation in nine design sections along the tunnel path. Comparisons of the results are discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Taking space has been a common feature of recent social movements worldwide, and was a defining act of the Occupy movement. This article examines the taking of two spaces by Occupy London in October 2011, and argues that there was a tension between taking space as a moment of rupture, lived space-times of intensity that provide an opening to new possibilities, and everyday life, the routines and rhythms through which social life is reproduced. My argument builds on the work of Lefebvre, bringing together his conceptualisation of moments and everyday life, and his radical theory of the production of space. I argue that examining the tensions over taking space provides a useful angle to explore some of the challenges faced by the Occupy movement, such as an unequal division of labour on camp, and may help in negotiating them.
   Resumen La toma de espacios ha sido una caracteristica comun de los movimientos sociales recientes en el mundo, y fue un acto definitivo del movimiento Occupy. Este articulo investiga la toma de dos espacios por Occupy London en Octubre del 2011, y sostiene que hubo una tension entre la toma del espacio como un momento de ruptura, espacios-tiempos vivos de intensidad que dan una apertura a nuevas posibilidades, y la vida cotidiana, las rutinas y ritmos por los cuales la vida social se reproduce. Mi argumento amplia el trabajo de Lefebvre, combinando su conceptualizacion de momentos y la vida cotidiana, y su teoria radical de la produccion del espacio. Sostengo que el estudiar las tensiones de la toma del espacio crea un util punto de vista para la investigacion de algunos de los desafios que el movimiento Occupy enfrenta, tales como la division de trabajo desigual en los campamentos, y que, por ende, puede ayudar a negociarlos.

The improvement of teachers' cultural level made untenable the contradiction between the rhetoric exaltation of the role of the teacher and the real conditions of the profession, which also contributed to the pedagogical press. In the new century, an increasingly combative association movement developed which obtained important results, but was undermined by deep internal divisions, between men and women, urban and rural teachers, catholic and secular teachers. Teachers were accused of defending corporative interests and neglecting the school system needs, and then called to order by the Gentile's education reform, one of the first acts of Fascist rule.

AB  - Mangalore, which is known as port city of Karnataka is on a fast track in terms of development due to establishment of new Mangalore. But because of the construction of port structures such as breakwater, many changes in the coastal processes have been taken place in the vicinity of the port. Sediment Trend Analysis (STA) is a technique by which net patterns of sediment transport can be identified from the relative spatial changes in grain size distributions of all naturally occurring sediments. Changes in the grain size parameters (mean grain size, sorting and skewness) of neighbouring sediment samples are compared to derive particular trend cases such as either total deposition or partial deposition. Long term changes in the sediment trend patterns are inferred with help of applying Sediment Trend Analysis for the samples collected during the years 1997, 1999, 2000, 2013 and 2014. Algorithms developed for preparing Sediment Trend Matrices and plotting Sediment Transport Paths (STP) are used in this analysis. The results showed the change in net sediment movement direction over a decade and the probable sources remain the same. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rethinking Noriko: marriage narrative as historical allegory in Ozu Yasujiro's The Moon Has Risen and other Occupation-era films
T2  - SCREEN
LA  - English
AB  - As a nonwestern filmmaker, Ozu Yasujiro has mostly been discussed in the context of his position in-between Japanese tradition and western modernity. This essay attempts to move beyond this dichotomy by analyzing Ozu's script for Tsuki wa nobori nu/The Moon Has Risen (1947), along with his other Occupation-era films, to consider the role of marriage narrative in allegorizing the historical context of the postwar Japan. While acknowledging the significance of the traditional elements in his Occupation-era films, this essay looks at the way tradition is linked to the reality of postwar Japan. Narratives about marriage, a ritual whose varying practices divide generations, presents a model of this imbricated historical consciousness through the interaction among characters with different spatial and temporal affinities. In The Moon Has Risen, a romantic relationship between two characters is constituted by a memory of the shared past, and with this memory in mind, the young generation initiates movement from Nara, a traditional city, to Tokyo, the place for life in the present. In this regard, the marriage narrative in Ozu's films becomes an allegorical vehicle that provides historical continuity from the wartime past to the present and future of the postwar Japan.

AB  - Despite our commonsense understanding of territory as a bounded region, some political aspects of territory can be better described as effects of physical spatial networks. To illustrate the point, we study territorial practices of power in Baghdad before and during the Iraq War that started in 2003. We use various techniques and measures of spatial networks provided by 'space syntax', because they have proven useful for describing the spatiality of social processes. We use Baghdad as a case study, because the territorial practices of power by the Ba'th regime favoring a Sunni minority and undermining a Shiite majority had existed in this city for decades before the Iraq war. These practices were upset and significant territorial changes occurred during the sectarian war in 2006 and 2007 at the time of US-led occupation of Iraq. We study the relationships between territorial practices and physical spatial networks before the war and during the war. Based on our findings, we conclude that spatial network dependency of territory and territoriality may exist under a dominant political system or even during a war when a dominant political system remains unclear. However, more studies are needed to generalize the findings of our study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The definition and implementation of pedestrian simulation models requires empirical evidences, acquired by means of experiments and on-field observations, for sake of model calibration and validation. This paper describes an observation carried out in a urban commercial-touristic walkway (Vittorio Emanuele II Gallery, Milan, in collaboration with the Municipality of Milano). Although the analysis considered traditional metrics for describing pedestrian flow, such as the level of service, the main aim of this work was to quantify and characterize the presence, impact and behavior of groups in the observed population. In particular, we had confirmatory results on the frequency of groups in the observed situation, but we also achieved innovative results on trajectories and walking speeds: the walking path of individuals was 4% longer than the average path of groups, but the average walking speed of group members was 37% lower than the one of single pedestrians. Finally, a metric for characterizing group dispersion was defined and applied to the observed scenario: relatively large groups (size three and four) occupy more space in their movement when compared to couples. The achieved results represent useful empirical data for the calibration and validation of models for the simulation of pedestrians and crowd dynamics, but also for the development of automated techniques for data collection and analysis employing computer vision techniques.

AB  - AimForest fragmentation is often accompanied by an increase in hunting intensity. Both factors are known drivers of species extirpations, but understanding of their independent effects is poor. Our goal was to partition the effects of hunting and fragmentation on bird species extirpations and to identify bird traits that make species more vulnerable to these two stressors.
   LocationMenglun, Yunnan, SW China
   MethodsWe studied the landscape within 10km radius of Menglun town, where forests have become highly fragmented by monoculture rubber plantations. We compiled data on birds recorded between 1954 and 1983 before forest loss and compared it with a checklist prepared between 2011 and 2014. We used countryside and matrix-calibrated species-area models (SAMs) to estimate the observed slope of forest bird extirpations in Menglun and compared it with the slope expected in the absence of hunting. We also investigated six ecological traits to determine those that best explained bird extirpation probability (EP).
   ResultsWe found that 34% of the bird fauna had been extirpated from the study landscape, and the estimated slopes of countryside and matrix-calibrated SAMs for forest birds were around 1.4 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the 0.35 expected without hunting. Bird EP was strongly associated with size, and understorey insectivores that are known to be susceptible to fragmentation were less susceptible to hunting than frugivores. Given evidence of past and present hunting activity in the area, and the lack of support for alternative explanations, we suggest that hunting increased forest bird extirpations by around 1.3- to 1.6-fold.
   ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of using species-area relationships to separate area effects from the impacts of hunting. Our results suggest that hunting substantially increases species extirpations in tropical fragmented landscapes and conservation interventions that only target deforestation will therefore be inadequate.

AB  - In this paper an attempt is made to unravel the run-out characteristics of a mass movement in the Sichuan Province, SW China by means of 1D numerical modelling and calibration on the topography of run-out profiles. The Dagou mass movement started as a rockslide with an initial volume of 480,000 m(3), which transformed into a debris flow, increasing in volume due to entrainment of loose material in the upper part of the travelling track. The rapid mass movement had a run-out distance of 1380 m and a run-out time of about 50 s.
   Numerical calculations were conducted with the depth average shallow water equation to explain the variation in thickness of the debris flow deposits along the run-out track. For the calibration of the first run-out phase, three rheological models were applied, namely the Bingham, Voellmy and Quadratic rheology. Calibration was done on 1) the run-out distance, 2) the run-out time and 3) the goodness of fit with the thickness of the deposits along the track. In addition the erosion constant in the entrainment equation was calibrated on the observed versus calculated run-out volumes. Sensitivity analyses of the resistance parameters for the different rheologies showed that the viscosity, the basal friction, the turbulence term and the resistance factor are the most sensitive ones. It appeared that the variation in thickness along the run-out track can be explained by entrainment of material in the upper part of the track and a change in parametric values during the run-out process. The three rheologies produced a reasonable fit with the observed geometry of the run-out profile, run-out time and run-out volume. It was argued that the Voellmy rheology seems to give the most appropriate explanation for the difference in resistance along the run-out path. The main problem in the simulation was to stop the debris flow on a slope with a gradient around 22 degrees.
   A reactivation of the mass movement by frictional sliding of the material halfway the run-out track was simulated. It occurred 30 min after the first run-out phase due to an increase in pore pressure. The sliding material changed into a slow flowing mass that reached a newly built up area after about 1 h and moved into Wangong Town over a distance of 80 m. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The landslide section on the road between Balchik and Albena is in the area of Sviloza Factory. The landslide length (along the movement of the earth masses) is more than 350 m and its width is more than 400 m. The total area threatened by landslide phenomena is more than 300 decares. The landslide section threatens a district from the town of Balchik which is densely populated with country houses. The landslide depth in its upper part is from 24 to 28 m and in its lower part at the sea it is from 45 to 50 m. The slide has no shallow sections. The total volume of the landslide soil masses is approx. 3 - 3.5 million m(3). The rock mass movement was recorded as early as 1994 and during the construction of the retaining and drainage structures in 1998 displacements of 37 mm occurred in its upper part at a rate of movement 0.02 mm/day, and 3402 mm in the lower part at a rate of movement 4.84 mm/day.
   The retaining and drainage structure consists of two octagonal shafts filled with slurry walls, 80 cm thick and 26 m deep, driven at 1.5 m in the underlying marls below the sliding surface. Six rope anchors, each 35 m long, have been built in the upper end of the walls. The design load of the anchors is 750 kN. Horizontal boreholes with lengths of 40 m each have been drilled in the lower end of the shafts. The resistance capacity of each shaft is more than 15000 kN.
   After building the main structure in the middle of the landslide section, additional loadcarrying structures of anchor piles and slurry walls were constructed on the sides. After executing the structures, the landslide processes stopped towards 2015. The dynamometers placed on the anchors were strained to 700 kN which after some time exhibited a force of 5700 kN.
   The construction of such structures has proven their efficiency for deep and voluminous landslides.

AB  - Strong earthquake has been a significant triggering factor of landslides in hilly and mountainous areas. Damages caused by earthquake-induced landslides are sometimes larger than damages related to the shaking of the earthquake itself. During the last decades, a number of reports have been published to show serious damages caused by landslides after a series of disastrous earthquake events in mountainous regions. A lot of researches on landslides induced by earthquakes have been intensively carried out by various institutions. In 2012, the Japan Landslide Society published a book "Earthquake-induced landslides" in Japanese and further organized an International Symposium on Earthquake-induced Landslides in Kiryu City in Japan. Nowadays earthquake is still unavoidable and unpredictable. The study of earthquake-induced landslides has a major importance for better understanding of the causal mechanisms and the relationship among the landslide type, size, occurrence location and geomorphology. This paper presents an overview of current issues and recent advances concerning earthquake-induced landslides. It includes (i) movement types, characteristics and processes; (ii) causal mechanisms; (iii) physical and numerical modeling; (iv) secondary disasters; (v) risk assessment and management. It is urgently needed to develop practical methods for risk evaluation and hazard zoning on the basis of recent knowledge with appropriate mitigation strategy in order to avoid catastrophic damages by earthquake-induced landslides.

AB  - This article provides an analysis of Occupy Judaism, an explicitly religious expression of Jewish protest, which occurred simultaneously with Occupy Wall Street, the direct-democracy movement of 2011. Occupy Judaism, like Occupy Wall Street, took place both in physical spaces of protest in New York City and digitally, through mobilizing and circulating debate. The article focuses on the words and actions of Daniel Sieradski, the public face and one of the key founders of Occupy Judaism, supplemented by the experiences of others in Occupy Judaism, Occupy Wall Street, and Occupy Faith (a Protestant clergy-led initiative). We investigate what qualified as religion in the public sphere of Occupy Wall Street, the implications of activities that blurred the lines between religious and secular in the context of public protest, and the relationship of these place-based activities to digital practice. The article emphasizes the importance of ethnographically investigating both physical protest and digital debate, which in this case created the potential for Jewish leftist religion to occupy a new space in the public sphere for a short time in 2011. Attention to the mediation of religion in the public sphere has implications for rethinking what constitutes the political, the religious, and the secular, as well as how digital practices may be implicated in debates over these terms.

AB  - Numerical simulations were carried out to study the smoke behaviors induced by fires in inclined tunnels with different slopes and the upstream maximum temperatures along the tunnel centerline were specifically focused. The simulation results show that the longitudinal centerline peak temperature occurs at the downstream region of fire source rather than right above the fire source. Two typical behaviors were found during the quasi-steady state: the upstream smoke layer interface is almost parallel to horizontal level while the downstream smoke layer interface is parallel to the inclined tunnel ceiling. The upstream maximum temperature under the ceiling remain approximately constant near the fire sources and then drop progressively with increasing distance to fire source due to the existence of vortexes, which is fairly different from the downstream maximum temperature distribution. Hence, an empirical correlation is developed by taking into account the tunnel slope, heat release rate and the upstream maximum temperature and using dimensional analysis. The correlation indicates that the dimensionless upstream maximum temperature decreases as the distance from fire source increases and it is proportional to 0.56 power of the dimensionless heat release rate and its relationship with tunnel slope is nonlinear and non-monotonous.

AB  - Land access is an accepted corollary to food sovereignty, long promoted by the transnational agrarian movement La Via Campesina (LVC). LVC's land access politics have evolved with increased incorporation of diverse perspectives, but remain largely focused on achieving 'integral agrarian reform' in the global South. Here, I take a case where food sovereignty activists ('Occupy the Farm' (OTF)) occupied land owned by a public university in California, the USA, in order to broaden food sovereignty's land access considerations beyond the South, and to analyze conditions where political actions (including occupations) can help achieve changes in land access regimes. The OTF action was successful in challenging cultural norms about property and achieving access, partly due to the occupation having foregrounded multiple appealing narratives that invited participation and wider support. These narratives included agroecology versus biotechnologies; community/public access versus privatization; participatory versus bureaucratic governance structure; and green space/food production versus urban development. The article tests the use of the 'land sovereignty' frame in expanding food sovereignty's land politics, to encompass land contestation contexts globally and deal with the particular conditions surrounding lands. The case indicates that land occupations in the North are potentially useful-but uncertain, and very context-dependent-tactics to promote land and food sovereignty.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to review the literature on human thermal comfort in the built environment. First an overview about the subject area is presented. This is followed by a review of papers published in the last 10 years that examine the various sub-areas of research related to human thermal comfort. Some remarkable works about both the Fanger's and adaptive thermal comfort models are also discussed. This review does not contain simulation works and/or experimental studies without subjective results of people. As a result of the literature review, 466 articles were classified and grouped to form the body of this article. The article examines standards, indoor experiments in controlled environments (climate chamber) and semi-controlled environments, indoor field studies in educational, office, residential and other building types, productivity, human physiological models, outdoor and semi-outdoor field studies. Several research topics are also addressed involving naturally ventilated, air-conditioned and mixed-mode buildings, personalized conditioning systems and the influence of personal (age, weight, gender, thermal history) and environmental (controls, layout, air movement, humidity, among others) variables on thermal comfort.

AB  - In the region of the Vale because of its natural relief, flood is recorded along the basin of the Itajai River since 1850. Floods are natural phenomena that are often devastating bringing great damage to man and nature. Flee the human capacity, to prevent such phenomena occur. However, it is possible to develop preventive measures to minimize these impacts. Basically there are two types of preventive measures: structural (dams, dikes, river enlargements, reforestation, etc.) and non-structural areas of zoning-based vulnerability and monitoring and warning systems. Monitoring and warning systems are essential to minimize the human and material damage, particularly in urban areas, as they allow the community to be informed (warned) in advance of an extreme event with danger of causing a natural disaster. Thus, the monitoring and warning system enables decisions to be made before the event occurs. In this sense, was created in 1984 through the project Crisis, the monitoring system and alert the Itajai Valley since then operated by Alert System Operation Center of the Regional University of Blumenau (CEOPS / FURB). The monitoring system of Vale held every time the collection and shipment of hydrometeorological data in seventeen points of the basin, allowing perform the hydrometeorological monitoring activities in real-time in bowl. In addition to the telemetric network, make up this system, hydrological forecasting models, cali-brated to various parts of the basin, these models help in the decision making process for a flood event. The transfer of information generated in an early warning system are of fundamental importance both to the defense organization, and the community in general. Observing this need, it is proposed to develop a tool alerts so that the information can be transferred in less time possible clearly. If a community is in flood risk areas, the system will facilitate the realization of a register of interested via mobile devices or through a Web service. Initially, this system will be based on devices with Android operating system from Google. This is currently the most popular platform for mobile devices around the world. The objective of this paper is to present a software tool for mobile device applied to the warning system aiming to disseminate real-time information generated by CEOPS thus enabling information and flood warnings to people quickly and easily through text messages. In order to inform people there will be automated routines running every hour so that people can be informed in real time. This information will be available through a Web Service that returns the data from the CEOPS servers.

AB  - The public marginalization of LGBT framework in recent decades was gradually replaced by an empowering situation through the agency of activist groups and the consequent conquest of rights in different areas. However, the reality is far from ideal, which can be determined by the occurrence of institutional homophobia when organizations flout individuals based on the judgment on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Thus, whereas the activity of PR can contribute to the improvement of this scenario, this paper aims to analyze how the healthcare professional can help in the management of relations with the LGBT audience in organizations. To achieve it, we carried out a literature search and then a documentary research on LGBT Rights Reference Center and Confronting Homophobia in the state of Paraiba, to check the cases of institutional homophobia that occurred in the state capital, Joao Pessoa, between the years 2011 and 2013. Finally, a field research was undertaken with the civil society organizations that defend this public in the city in order to know their actions in combating this type of crime. We verified the occurrence of a significant number of complaints in the period analyzed, and the lack of knowledge of NGOs with regard to the performance with the business to ensure the inclusion of LGBT in the actions of local organizations, as well as the policy options of public relations professional to modify this context.

AB  - "Societal teleconnections" - analogous to physical teleconnections such as El Nio - are human-created linkages that link activities, trends, and disruptions across large distances, such that locations spatially separated from the locus of an event can experience a variety of impacts from it nevertheless. In the climate change context, such societal teleconnections add a layer of risk that is currently neither fully appreciated in most impacts or vulnerability assessments nor in on-the-ground adaptation planning. Conceptually, societal teleconnections arise from the interactions among actors, and the institutions that guide their actions, affecting the movement of various substances through different structures and processes. Empirically, they arise out of societal interactions, including globalization, to create, amplify, and sometimes attenuate climate change vulnerabilities and impacts in regions far from those where a climatic extreme or change occurs. This paper introduces a simple but systematic way to conceptualize societal teleconnections and then highlights and explores eight unique but interrelated types of societal teleconnections with selected examples: (1) trade and economic exchange, (2) insurance and reinsurance, (3) energy systems, (4) food systems; (5) human health, (6) population migration, (7) communication, and (8) strategic alliances and military interactions. The paper encourages further research to better understand the causal chains behind socially teleconnected impacts, and to identify ways to routinely integrate their consideration in impacts/vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning to limit the risk of costly impacts.

AB  - The Penal Law, elected as a privileged instrument to deal with the irregular immigration on the part of countries in which such phenomenon is more evident - in the present research, the case of European Union is highlighted -, which experiences a moment of expansion, that derives from a "mix phobia" or fear of getting mixed originated from the construction of illegal immigrants as "subjects of risk". This stereotype comes from some main factors like: the crisis on the Estate model of welfare, which transforms the immigrants into "parasites" of the social benefits designated to the autochthons, the influence of the mass media on creating the social panic regarding some topics related to security, and the reflexes of the discourse of the media in politics, particularly after the terrorist attacks occurred in large urban centers in the beginning of the millennium. It allows the affirmation that the Penal Law, that expands itself in terms of quantity to respond effectively to the new social problems of today - among which, the matter of irregular immigration assumes more and more relevance - faces a backward movement in terms of quality, once it assumes trends strongly connected to a model of Penal Law of author, based on punitive measures highly reprimanding and segregationist towards the immigrants, leaving as evidence by the diffusion of penal types that argue in favor of the exclusion (deportation) of this target audience instead of its integration, as well as by the lack of solidarity.

TI  - Performance Measures for Optimizing Diverging Interchanges and Outcome Assessment with Drone Video
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Diverging diamond interchanges (DDIs) are an emerging interchange configuration that eliminates the need for left-turn phases in conventional diamonds and may be less expensive to construct than some alternative geometries. This paper examines signal timing for DDIs. DDI signal timing typically has used a two-phase configuration that reflects the two competing movements at the crossover points at each intersection of the DDI. This configuration inherently contains some inefficiency: (a) there is potential for internal queuing under two-phase configuration and (b) it is possible for the inflow demand to exceed outflow capacity of the interchange. This paper uses high-resolution event data to develop performance measures for evaluating operations at a DDI in Salt Lake City, Utah. Alternatives to the existing signal timing within the two-phase configuration are modeled and tested with a field deployment. The field deployment demonstrated the ability to prioritize ramp or through vehicles within the two-phase configuration. Additionally, a new three-phase configuration was developed and deployed to address the internal queuing that occurs with two-phase timing. With this new configuration, the flows from one DDI intersection to the other are balanced, and progression within the DDI is improved. With the implementation of the three-phase configuration, the percentage of vehicles arriving on green at the heaviest internal movement within the DDI increased from 53% to 92%. To illustrate these performance measures and improved DDI operation qualitatively, a video from a tethered umnanned aerial vehicle demonstrated the vehicle arrival characteristics by overlaying vehicle detection and signal state graphics on the video.

AB  - Land scarcity made the Indonesian government decided to develop low cost flats to solve the problem for housing the urban poor rather than ground bound single housing (Kementrian PU, 2012). Not all houses offered to the relocated households have shown to be widely accepted (ADB 2003). They were difficult to expand as changing family circumstances dictated. Adaptations to meet the changed users' requirements involve demolition and result in waste generation which is detrimental to sustainable development (Friedman, 2007). Through activity based analysis, this research aimed to evaluate adaptability of space due to sustainable living in the low cost housing in Indonesia. For this, 300 families of all 14 low cost rental apartment locations were investigated as the total of apartment units in Surabaya was 3459, therefore 21-27 units of each location were taken as sample. Result shows that for functionality, all unit parts of low cost rental apartment units in Surabaya, except the balcony, were provided only between 50% and 55% of the standard. For adaptability, only by the installation of a mezzanine, that fully covering the area of multi-functional space can fulfil the use of space except Tanah-Merah as this upward adaptation could double the area of existing space. The changing capacity for corridor occupation is found to be 1.11, while for the installation of half area mezzanine is 1.5, and for the changing of balcony to a bedroom is 1.16 on average. However, Penjar-3 and I.T.S. could not allow their top spaces as liveable space because their unit height is just 2.65m. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Darwin Harbour, Northern Territory, Australia, is a semi diurnal macro-tidal embayment that is situated in a cyclone prone area. The tidal variations range up to 8 m with a mean tidal range of 3.7 m. The coastal area consists of mangrove fringes, sandy beaches, tidal flats, rocky shore platforms and coastal cliffs. The main morphological changes are movement of the sandbars and erosion of beaches and coastal cliffs. Sea level rise due to climate change and more intense cyclones and storm surges may exacerbate these processes with detrimental impacts on the coast and the adjacent city, particularly when occurring at high tide. To assist with coastal erosion management, a greater understanding of morphological changes is required. A two-dimensional depth averaged finite-element hydrodynamic model (RMA-2), coupled with a sediment transport model (RMA-11) from Resource Modelling Associates, have been used to deduce the sources and spatial patterns of sand erosion and deposition in the harbour. Geochemical analysis is also used to characterize the sand source(s). This paper presents hydrodynamic simulations focusing on culturally and recreationally significant beaches in Fannie Bay. Simulations indicate that the Cullen Bay sandbar is an indirect sand source replenishing Fannie Bay beaches. Respective geochemical results also show similar Rare Earth Element contents of the sand in the area. Considering the fast pace of development in and around Darwin Harbour, this study is essential in providing a fundamental understanding of coastal processes and to assist coastal and shoreline management in a tropical estuary.

AB  - A cyanobacteria-induced black bloom in Taihu Lake, 2007, subjected nearly one million Wuxi City residents to a drinking water crisis. This black bloom attracted wide attention in China and the rest of the world. However, black bloom is a highly weather-dependent event, and its rapid movement in lakes makes it difficult to predict where it will occur. Therefore, jar-tests and simulated flow experiments were performed to investigate the flocculation, deposition, and resuspension of black-bloom-induced black matter. At a dosage of 0.2 g L-1 chitosan + 1 g L-1 diatomite, 90% of the turbidity was removed within 1 h in jar-tests and in low flow speed simulated experiments. However, the black matter/clay flocs did not fully sink, and stratification of turbidity apparently occurred in the lower part of the tank during the simulated flow experiments. The resuspension experiments under simulated flow speeds showed that at a wind speed of 1-6 m s(-1) in Taihu Lake produced currents that did not greatly affect floc resuspension, but a wind speed of 3-4 m s(-1) produced waves that could induce floc resuspension. Quartz sand was sprayed over the flocs to verify its effect on inhibiting resuspension. A shear stress of 0.37 N m(-2) did not induce floc resuspension, which indicated that a wind speed of 6 m s(-1) would not induce floc resuspension in Taihu Lake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work focuses on a study of the Yanbu suture zone and related ophiolites using aeromagnetic and seismological data. The interpretation of aeromagnetic data indicates that NW-SE- and NE-SW-trending structural faults dominate the study area. These faults coincide with narrow and elongated magnetic highs, possibly caused by intrusions emplaced along the faults. The NE trend is dissected by cross-cutting NW-trending faults in some places. The NE-oriented suture zone is marked by short-wavelength high magnetic anomalies associated with ultramafic rocks (ophiolites) and is divided by the NW-oriented left-lateral Najid faulting (Qazaz shear zone) into two shifted alignments. This implies that deep-seated regional trends govern to a large extent the location and extension of the ophiolite exposures. There is a clear correlation between land earthquakes and the interpreted magnetic structures, where the majority of earthquake epicenters lie on or close to the interpreted major faults. A clear concentration of earthquakes is observed where the NE-trending faults cross the Red Sea NNW-trending faults. Here, two separate aftershock clusters occur to the north of Yanbu City, indicating the reactivation of the pre-existing Precambrian NE-trending transform fault,which crosses two parallel NNW-trending faults that have been injected by Cenozoic volcanics during the Cenozoic rifting of the Red Sea. These results indicate that the seismotectonics of the study area is strongly related to the geodynamic rifting processes acting in the Red Sea, where the relative movement between African and Arabian plates resulted in several series of normal and transform faults that run parallel and cross the Red Sea, respectively.

AB  - The largest epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Korea since the first record in 1911 occurred between November 2010 and April 2011. The outbreak was confirmed in 153 farms, and more than three million animals were destroyed. This study presents the temporal and spatial distribution patterns, epidemiological investigation and the control measures for the 2010/2011 epidemic in Korea. The index case of this 2010/2011 FMD epidemic was reported in a pig-farming complex with five piggeries in Andong, GyeongBuk Province, on 28 November 2010, and the outbreak lasted 145days. The largest number of new detection of the infected farms per day was recorded in mid-January. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the FMD virus had spread from farm to farm through routine movements associated with animal husbandry operations. In contrast to FMD epidemics in other countries in which movement of the infected animals largely contributed to the spread of the disease, human behaviours were major factors in the spread of the FMD virus in the Korean epidemic. The 2010/2011 epidemic was first confirmed in a local small and medium city where share of smallholder producers is higher than that of other provinces. Although Korea had a well-developed emergent response system with the experience of controlling infection and re-obtaining FMD-free status after the previous epidemics, Korea was prompted to revise their contingency plan by tailoring it to its unique livestock environment. Practical contingency plans tailored to Korea for control of FMD can be fully effective when farmers, livestock-related agencies, veterinary service providers and the general public work together.

AB  - It is well known that a counterclockwise rotation occurred in the Miocene in northeast Japan. However, the detailed timing and mechanism of the rotation has been debated. Moreover, there has been no research about the relationship between rotational tectonics and the evolution of sedimentary basins. We carried out paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses in Nishiwaga Town, Iwate Prefecture, northeast Japan, where the stratigraphy and sedimentary basin formation have previously been clarified. We found that there was a counterclockwise rotational movement of about 45 degrees at about 15 Ma. From our results and previous studies on the tectonics and sedimentary basin development, we are able to ascertain the following tectonic history and sedimentary basin evolution in this area: (i) before the rotational movement, sandstone and mudstone were deposited in a tranquil environment with no volcanic activity coupled with slow tectonic subsidence; (ii) between 16.4-15.1 Ma and 14 Ma, a counterclockwise rotation occurred with rapid tectonic subsidence and continuous explosive volcanism; (iii) at about 14Ma, the counterclockwise rotation ended and there was a reduction in both subsidence and volcanism. This result shows the impact that rotational tectonics can have on sedimentary basin formation.

AB  - The air quality impact of an airport due to both ground sources and air traffic emissions within the troposphere boundary layer is a relevant topic at a local scale, especially where the airport is surrounded by urbanized areas. The work analyses the emissions from the Amerigo Vespucci airport in Florence, Italy. The comparison between the present and the future layout of the airport, which is under project, is addressed, providing a possible tool to guide local air pollution prevention strategies within the framework of the strategic transport infrastructures development.
   The emission scenarios of the present and future airport layouts were estimated with EDMS 5.1.3, the software package issued by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) which is an US-EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) preferred model for airport emissions evaluation. The total yearly emissions of NOx, CO, SOx, VOCs and PM10 have been assessed, divided into the main phases of the LTO (landing and takeoff) cycle, provided for each aircraft. The results show that the takeoff phase is mainly responsible for NOx, SOx and PM10 contributions.
   The AERMOD dispersion model was run over one year to evaluate the concentrations of those pollutants, modelled as chemically inert. The maximum concentrations occur close to the gate and the ground movement areas. However, the air quality standards ruled by Directive 50/2008/EU are never reached except for NOx, which shows an overall maximum of the annual average of about 40 mu g/m(3), close to the standard for the vegetation health (50 mu g/m(3)).

AB  - In the last few years, matters regarding landscape architecture (and the intervention in the landscape and protection of it) have given rise to considerable interest both within administrations and professionals in the fields of architecture and engineering, and also among the general population. Continuous urban expansion in territories poses a problem for its integration with the landscape, and highlights the need to preserve landscapes of cultural value, to recover others transformed by industrial activities, and to regulate the use of natural areas of landscape quality. However, nowadays, few countries have specific regulations that may serve as a reference for these kinds of projects. There are only twelve countries among more than 160 members of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Committee that have passed standards regarding the landscape. The absence of standardization is harmful in two ways: in the environmental sense (ecosystems and biodiversity) and in the social sense (culture, history, and the economy). On the other hand, there exists an extensive professional sector dedicated to the landscape, yet the lack of professionalization in its activities hinders free movement in searches for work abroad. For that reason, the purpose of this article is to study the standardization of the landscape and landscaping at an international level, providing a global vision of international regulations. Thirty-one state-of-the-art normative documents related to landscape have been found. This study deals with the current standards and the specifications developed by the national committees of standardization (ISO members) throughout the world. The normative documents identified during research and the public bodies that issue them are shown, and the structure and content of each one are analyzed. That is to say, first, the texts found may be grouped into two main approaches: standards/countries that focus more on landscape or nature conservation vs. those that focus more on planning. On the other hand, the documents are grouped according to four main themes: terminology and definitions of the landscape, the landscaping profession, rules for intervention in the landscape, and landscape protection measures. The standardization applied to the landscape is translated into the definition of a series of guidelines for action that allows minimization of the impact of our actions on the landscape, and that favors a better use of resources. The standardization of the landscape could be especially useful to those countries that, due to their high scenic quality landscapes, would obtain great benefits if they developed landscape norms. Nevertheless, standardization could favor any country since those with high landscape quality will do all they can to maintain said quality, and those countries that have landscapes in danger of deterioration, landscapes that are already deteriorated, or low quality landscapes will advocate for policies that contribute to the recovery of natural spaces.

AB  - The Valmarecchia area (RN, Italy), located between the Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, displays peculiar geological features, being characterized by rocky slabs lying on gentle slopes. The main fortified villages of the area, remarkable for historical and artistic assets, were built in the medieval period on these slabs for defense purposes. The area is affected by widespread landslide phenomena, involving both the rocky slabs and the underlying clayey shales. The main phenomena acting on the slabs are lateral spreading, with associated rock falls and topples. In this area, a multidisciplinary project, involving different expertise, like geology, geodesy, geomorphology, hydrogeology, soil and rocks mechanics is ongoing. In this particular context, in order to achieve a clear recognition of the instability phenomena, it is necessary to understand the movement patterns and the eventual differential displacement occurring in the slabs. Monitoring activities, joined with geological and geomorphological interpretation, are one of the fundamental step for a deep understanding of the movements and for the risk management purposes. In many cases, the monitoring system is missing or only poor data are available, therefore an approach for the Permanent Scatterers (PS) data analysis has been used, combining analysis on the PS velocity, on the direction of the movement and statistical consideration on the time series trend. Some preliminary results regarding the rock slab on which the town of Verucchio (RN, Italy) is located are here presented.

AB  - The eighteenth century was a period of important changes. The demographic increase experienced since the beginning of the century and illustrated policies carried out -the loss of crops, fences and land shoulder-, produced a restructuring of economic activities that originated a sectoral movement of its agents. The unpublished document presented here, the extraordinary military enlistment in 1795 in the town of Valencia de Alcantara, highlights these and other changes that occurred in the final moments of the Old Regime, facts that seem extensible to other places of the antique Province of Extremadura.

AB  - Mitigating the threat of habitat loss requires actions such as restoring and creating new habitat. In order to effectively achieve this, species habitat requirements and use patterns need to be understood. While many studies have been conducted on the habitat choice of species, these generally focused on habitat use during periods of high activity and detection probability without considering seasonal shifts in habitat use. Understanding habitat selection by frogs during the winter season of low activity may be crucial since it may differ from that used during the summer and may be overlooked as important for population success. We describe the microhabitat use of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) using radio tracking methods during winter when detection is low and knowledge is limited. We followed 26 individuals between May and July, 2011 to determine whether they selected specific overwintering microhabitats and related this to levels of individual exposure to predators, distance from the edge of the water and temperature of microhabitats. We found that overwintering bell frogs inhabited reeds and rock gabions more frequently than expected and that females used a reduced subset of microhabitats compared to males. Additionally, microhabitats used were more likely to conceal an individual from view, and the majority of overwintering sites were located within 5m of the edge of the water which may be important for reducing the risk of predation and desiccation. Rock gabions had significantly warmer (1.2 degrees C-1.8 degrees C) mean temperatures than the other microhabitats used. The information presented here can be used in habitat creation and reintroduction programmes to provide habitat which is suitable during both the breeding and non-breeding season for the conservation of other populations.

TI  - Modern and Unique Architecture: A Perspective from the Wind Tunnel
T2  - AEI 2015: BIRTH AND LIFE OF THE INTEGRATED BUILDING
LA  - English
CP  - AEI Conference on Birth and Life of the Integrated Building
AB  - The architecture of a building characterizes its aerodynamic behavior, which drives the steady and fluctuating forces resulting from wind loading. This in turn defines the level of structural resistance required for cladding, components, and the main wind force resisting system (MWFRS) of a building or other structure. For tall buildings, the wind loads developed by the exterior geometry can contribute to unfavorable occupancy conditions, such as high accelerations due to across-wind response (i.e., vortex shedding). Much is known about the aerodynamics of 'classic' prismatic geometries (i.e., square, rectangular), and data for these types of shapes comprise the backbone of most wind design standards (i.e., ASCE 7). With a growing focus being placed on distinct, or 'landmark' buildings and structures, the bounds of architectural design are being pushed considerably, resulting in structures characterized by unique exterior geometry and equally unique aerodynamics. Distinctive shapes or features may result in unexpected wind pressure distributions, excessive vibration of components, or Aeolian noise. The emergence of versatile high-strength, but more flexible, building materials has contributed to the variety of architectural features observed on modern structures. The movement towards sustainability has led to features such as solar panels, green roofs or walls, and more energy-efficient curtainwall systems being integrated into many new buildings. Each of these aspects of modern and unique architecture have likely posed challenges to architectural and structural teams at some point in the design process, the wind tunnel testing component included. This paper provides a background on the development of wind loading provisions specified in design standards and codes, and discusses some of the situations encountered when assessing the wind loading and response of unique structures using the wind tunnel approach. A brief background on building aerodynamics and the wind tunnel testing procedure is provided. Approaches to assessing the wind loads and response of various architectural features, including parapets, spires and long-span roofs, are summarized. Additional considerations such as pedestrian level wind speeds, applications of sustainable design, and urban planning are briefly discussed.

AB  - This paper investigates the efficacy of Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) to monitor the critical landslides in Nainital township and adjoining areas of state of Uttarakhand, India which has problems due to inadequate drainage management system, seismically active Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) passing from the area, unwanted construction on highly unstable slopes and low insitu strength of rocks. In this research work, 13 descending ENVISAT ASAR C-Band images of Nainital acquired between October 2008 to August 2010 are processed to study the PS-InSAR time series analysis for measuring surface displacement. The case study indicates that StaMPS efficiently extracted sufficient number of PS pixels and detected the slow movement occurring in some regions. In the study area, few critical zones are also identified where time series 1D-Line of Sight (LOS) displacement map shows the maximum deformation (away from the satellite) of about 17 mm/year.

AB  - The paper discusses the relations between Church and State in the early years of the Brazilian military dictatorship, a time of consolidation of a new historical bloc within the Church and of great hegemonic dispute within the Armed Forces. A case which occurred in the steel town of Volta Redonda (RJ) in 1967, in which four young men connected to the local Catholic movement had been imprisoned by the Army for distributing pamphlets critical of the government, gave rise to a series of conflicts between the local bishop and the military authorities. A pragmatic reconstruction of the facts resulting from this case is given priority here in order to discuss the disputes of power that took place between progressive sectors of the Church and the authoritarian State, as well as their respective strategies for gaining hegemony.

AB  - We investigated the effects of sex, age, season and competitive context on the intergroup agonistic behaviour of free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris). Data were collected in different places to record competitive cooperative behaviour during intergroup conflicts. Observations of 21 free-ranging dogs belonging to four neighbouring groups were made in Katwa town, India. Throughout the 12-month study period, 85 % of all intergroup agonistic interactions recorded were aggressive and 15 % submissive. Intergroup aggressive interactions were more frequent during the late monsoon months when the females were in oestrus, while submissive interactions reached a peak during the winter months when the females were lactating. Adult dogs, particularly males, displayed a higher rate of aggressive behaviour than other age classes, whereas juvenile dogs, particularly males, displayed the highest rate of submissive behaviour. Male dogs were observed to perform more agonistic behaviours in mating contexts and at the boundaries of their territories, whereas female dogs displayed more agonistic behaviours in feeding contexts and in the vicinity of the den. Both aggressive and submissive patterns displayed by the dogs varied with the competitive contexts. The most frequently observed category of aggressive behaviour was 'barking, growling and snarling' and submissive behavioural patterns were displayed frequently by 'lips retracted in a submissive grin'. The striking feature of this study was that in most cases, more than one dog participated in aggressive conflicts. Such cooperative defense predominantly occurred at the boundaries of territory. Group home range size was largest during the late monsoon months and during the winter months.

AB  - Objective. To provide an overview of comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) development and implementation in Suriname in peer-reviewed literature.
   Methods. Building on work funded by the Teasdale-Corti Global Health Research Partnership Program/People's Health Movement, the authors searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and POPLINE for articles focused on CPHC within the Surinamese context. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and then jointly reviewed the selected abstracts. The final selection was completed using a data extraction form.
   Results. The initial search resulted in 1 556 abstracts. The initial review identified 58 articles. Only three of the 58 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final review. The three selected articles provided partial overviews of CPHC in Suriname and examples of its implementation, with a focus on the service delivery network in the interior of the country, which was designed to improve rural access to basic health care services by training community members as service providers. They also included examples of how preparations for health reform in Suriname in the late 1990s and early 2000s, influenced by global neoliberal reforms, led to expectations that disparities in health status, design of health system components, and service provision related to differences in power and historical context (e.g., the influence of medical professionals, political parties/ethnic groups, and wealthier populations concentrated in urban areas) would be addressed.
   Conclusions. Given the focus on primary health care in the Americas and the notable developments that have occurred in Surinamese health policy and health care, particularly in health care reform, the paucity of published research on CPHC in Suriname was an unexpected finding that may be partly due to prioritizing research on disease control rather than health policy and systems research. The limited amount of scientific literature on this topic 1) prevents clear understanding of CPHC development and implementation in Suriname and 2) underscores the need to strengthen the national health research system to better inform policies for moving the country toward universal health access and coverage to improve the health of all of its citizens.

AB  - Shifting seasons greatly influence the use and management practices in residential built environments which subsequently affect the level of exposure to various pollutants indoors. The levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were monitored in fifteen households of Lahore, Pakistan during different seasons. DustTrak aerosol monitors (model 8520, TSI Inc.) were run simultaneously in the kitchens and living rooms of the selected sites for seventy two hours each. To aid analysis, houses were categorized in three groups according to floor area. For non-smoking houses there was little variation between 24 h average PM2.5 concentrations in kitchens (270 to 295 mu g/m(3)) although there was an increase in concentrations in living rooms as floor area increased. Across all houses the average PM2.5 concentration was observed to vary during the seasons. In the kitchens the average PM levels were 326 mu g/m(3) during the spring falling to 133 mu g/m(3) in summer, 180 mu g/m(3) in monsoon, 395 mu g/m(3) in autumn and 448 mu g/m(3) during the winter. Similarly, in the living rooms, the mean PM levels observed were 190 mu g/m(3) in spring, 101 mu g/m(3) in summer, 158 mu g/m(3) in monsoon, 458 mu g/m(3) in autumn and 590 mu g/m(3) in winter. Factors contributing towards these levels were cooking (involving frequent frying), floor sweeping, and also movement of the occupants. Smoking at two sites and use of gas heaters during the winter were also identified as contributing sources. Apart from these sources, ventilation was identified to be the most singular attributing factor to the above mentioned variations in PM levels. Ventilation during the warm season ranged from 3.51 air changes per hour (ACH) to 7.68 ACH. On the contrary, ventilation decreased during the autumn and winter season (2.5 to 5.64 ACH) and this resulted in an accumulation of PM indoors. The levels of fine particulate matter were observed to be 3 to 23 times higher than the WHO established standard of 25 mu g/m(3).

AB  - Within the PanGeo project (financed by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Program), the Geological Survey of Italy (ISPRA) and the Urban Planning Department of the City of Roma developed a geodatabase and map of the geological hazards for the territory of Roma, integrating remotely sensed data (PSInSAR-Permanent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) and in situ geological information. Numerous thematic layers, maps and inventories of hazards (e.g., landslides, sinkholes, cavities), geological and hydrogeological data added to historical and recent urbanization information were compared to the permanent scatterer (PS) data from the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1/2, 1992-2000) and ENVISAT (2002-2005) descending scenes, in order to produce a ground stability layer (GSL). Based on the PS data, most of the territory appears stable (almost 70 % of PS velocities are within +/- 1 mm/year). About 14 % of the PSs show positive line-of-sight (LOS) velocities (measured along the LOS of the satellite) between 1 and 3 mm/year and more than 2 % exceed 3 mm/year; more than 11 % of PSs show negative LOS velocities between -1 and -3 mm/year, while about 3 % exceed -3 mm/year (with tens of the PSs showing velocities over -20 mm/year). The GSL is comprised of polygons or multi-polygons (multipart polygons grouping individual polygons under a single identifier geohazard) enclosing areas where geohazards have been pointed out by PS data and/or in situ surveys (observed instabilities), and by polygons enclosing areas potentially affected by geohazards, based on the available knowledge of the territory (potential instabilities). In Roma's GSL, 18 multi-polygons (covering ca. 600 km(2)) related to observed instabilities have been outlined, where ground movements could be detected through InSAR data or where landslides and sinkholes are known to have occurred. Other 13 multi-polygons (covering nearly 900 km(2)) concern areas where the potential occurrence of geohazards was inferred by combining geological and/or geothematic data (potential instabilities). The geohazards mapped in Roma have been: landslides, collapsible grounds, compressible grounds, groundwater abstraction, mining, man-made ground, tectonic movements, and volcanic inflation/deflation. The lattermost is the likely cause of the significant uplift observed in the Alban Hills area. However, this paper focuses on two more currently impending hazards: subsidence and sinkholes. In general, sinkhole-prone areas (areas of dense underground cavities) are hard to discern from satellite data, but can be revealed by ruling out other potential causes of observed ground movement based on in situ data. Subsiding zones are effectively detected by the available PSInSAR dataset over a total extent of about 60 km(2), mostly overlapping the recent alluvial areas of the Tiber and its tributaries. PSs show a very different behaviour inside and outside the historical centre. Inside, loading by anthropogenic construction and man-made ground since ancient times has led to an almost complete consolidation of the recent river deposits, marked by modest to absent subsidence. In contrast, outside, subsidence clearly stands out, with negative LOS velocities that, although generally within several mm/year, can locally exceed -25 mm/year. PS data have provided motion information at both a regional and local scale (up to the scale of a single building).
   Closer to the sea, in the Tiber delta area, velocities increase, especially above recently reclaimed marsh areas, rich in peat and organic clays. Velocities can change significantly over short distances, as in the international airport area, reflecting the local stratigraphic setting. The same occurs in the two subsiding areas located within the Alban Hills volcanic complex, which is generally affected by ground uplift. As a whole, PSInSAR ground motion velocities offer a significant contribution to susceptibility and hazard recognition studies. In particular, such a method provides a fast and effective tool available to local authorities to monitor ground and building behaviour, possibly allowing for timely prevention activities, especially when coupled with appropriate in situ knowledge.

AB  - Problem/Condition: In 2009, before passage of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), approximately 20% of women aged 18-64 years had no health insurance coverage. In addition, many women experienced transitions in coverage around the time of pregnancy. Having no health insurance coverage or experiencing gaps or shifts in coverage can be a barrier to receiving preventive health services and treatment for health problems that could affect pregnancy and newborn health. With the passage of ACA, women who were previously uninsured or had insurance that provided inadequate coverage might have better access to health services and better coverage, including additional preventive services with no cost sharing. Because certain elements of ACA (e.g., no lifetime dollar limits, dependent coverage to age 26, and provision of preventive services without cost sharing) were implemented as early as September 2010, data from 2009 can be used as a baseline to measure the incremental impact of ACA on the continuity of health care coverage for women around the time of pregnancy.
   Reporting Period Covered: 2009.
   Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants in selected U.S. states and New York City, New York. PRAMS uses mixed-mode data collection, in which up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and those who do not respond are contacted for telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage. Annual PRAMS data sets are created and used to produce statewide estimates of preconception and perinatal health behaviors and experiences in selected states and New York City.
   This report summarizes data from 29 states that conducted PRAMS in 2009, before the passage of ACA, and achieved an overall weighted response rate of >= 65%. Data on the prevalence of health insurance coverage stability (stable coverage, unstable coverage, and uninsured) across three time periods (the month before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and at the time of delivery) are reported by state and selected maternal characteristics. Women with stable coverage had the same type of health insurance (private or Medicaid) for all three time periods. Women with unstable coverage experienced a change in health insurance coverage between any of the three time periods. This includes movement from having no insurance coverage to gaining coverage, movement from one type of coverage to another, and loss of coverage. Women in the uninsured group had no insurance coverage during any of the three time periods. Estimates for health insurance stability across the three time periods and estimates of coverage during each time period are presented by state. Patterns of movement between the different types of health insurance coverage among women with unstable coverage are described by state and selected maternal characteristics.
   Results: In 2009, 30.1% of women who had a live birth experienced changes in health insurance coverage in the period between the month before pregnancy and the time of delivery, either because they lacked coverage at some point or because they moved between different types of coverage. Most women had stable coverage across the three time periods, reporting either private coverage (52.8%) or Medicaid coverage (16.1%) throughout. A small percentage of women (1.1%) reported having no health insurance coverage at any point.
   Overall, Medicaid coverage increased from 16.6% in the month before pregnancy to 43.9% at delivery. Private coverage decreased from 59.9% in the month before pregnancy to 54.6% at delivery. The percentage of women who were uninsured decreased from 23.4% in the month before pregnancy to 1.5% at the time of delivery.
   Among those who experienced changes in coverage, 74.4% reported having no insurance the month before pregnancy, 23.9% reported having private insurance, and 1.8% reported having Medicaid. Among those who started out uninsured before pregnancy, 70.2% reported Medicaid coverage, and 4.1% reported private coverage at the time of delivery. Among those who started out with private coverage, 21.3% reported Medicaid coverage at delivery, and 1.4% reported being uninsured. As a result of these transitions in health insurance coverage, 92.4% of all women who experienced a change in health insurance around the time of pregnancy reported Medicaid coverage at delivery. No women with unstable coverage who started out without insurance in the month before pregnancy reported being uninsured at the time of delivery.
   Women who reported unstable coverage were more likely to be young (aged <35 years), be a minority (black, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native), have a high school education or less, be unmarried, have incomes <= 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), or have an unintended pregnancy compared with women with stable private coverage. Compared with women with stable Medicaid coverage, women with unstable coverage were more likely to be Hispanic but less likely to be teenagers (aged <= 19 years), be black, have a high school education or less, have incomes <= 200% of the FPL, or have an unintended pregnancy. Women with unstable coverage were more likely than women in either stable coverage group (private or Medicaid) to report entering prenatal care after the first trimester.
   Interpretation: In 2009, nearly one third of women reported lacking health insurance or transitioning between types of health insurance coverage around the time of pregnancy. The majority of women who changed health insurance status obtained coverage for prenatal care, delivery, or both through Medicaid. Health insurance coverage during pregnancy can help facilitate access to health care and allow for the identification and treatment of health-related issues; however, prenatal coverage might be too late to prevent the consequences of preexisting conditions and preconception exposures that could affect maternal and infant health. Continuous access to health insurance and health care for women of reproductive age could improve maternal and infant health by providing the opportunity to manage or treat conditions that are present before and between pregnancies.
   Public Health Action: PRAMS data can be used to identify patterns of health insurance coverage among women around the time of pregnancy. Removing barriers to obtaining health insurance for women who lack coverage, particularly before pregnancy, could improve the health of women and their infants. The findings in this report can be used by public health professionals, policy analysts, and others to monitor health insurance coverage for women around the time of pregnancy. In particular, 2009 state-specific data can serve as baseline information to assess and monitor changes in health insurance coverage since the passage of ACA.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing trees are often used in disturbed areas to promote soil development and to prepare the ground for more demanding tree species. However, their effect on the establishment of climax tree species has seldom been tested. We mapped the occurrence of volunteer seedlings of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and English oak (Quercus robur) in patches reclaimed by planting alder (Alnus glutinosa and Alnus incana) and in unreclaimed forest patches (dominated by Salix caprea, Betula pendula and Populus tremula). Both communities were about 30 years old and occurred on one large spoil heap from coal mining near the town of Sokolov (Czech Republic). At the same time, we mapped mature beech and oak trees in the surrounding area. We planted oak and beech seedling in an alder plantation, an unreclaimed forest stand and a grass-covered area without trees, and recorded their growth for two consecutive years. The closest mature beech grew 1km from the heap whereas seed-producing oaks occurred in its close vicinity and on the heap itself in a 30 to 40-year-old oak plantation. In both species, seedling density decreased with increasing distance from mature trees. Unreclaimed sites supported significantly higher seedling densities than reclaimed ones. Seedlings in the unreclaimed forest stand grew significantly better than in the other two habitats. Oak seedlings exhibited significantly higher mycorrhizal colonization in unreclaimed forest stands than in the other habitats. Unreclaimed forest stands are better habitat for the establishment of climax trees, than the reclaimed alder plantation. Using of spontaneous woody vegetation as nursing cover for climax trees can be recommended in restoration practice. Risk and benefits of nitrogen-fixing trees should be carefully considered.

TI  - Faith without Works is Dead: Sacred Space and Civil Society in Late Imperial Moscow and Tver
T2  - JAHRBUCHER FUR GESCHICHTE OSTEUROPAS
LA  - English
AB  - This article proposes a reevalua.don of the Russian Orthodox parish clergy in the early twentieth century as influential organizers of free associations, mutual aid societies, and; other manifestations of late Imperial Russia's nascent civil society. The parish clergy occupied one of Imperial Russia's five estates, which also included the nobility, merchantry, peasantry, and townspeople. The clerical estate was arguably the most segregated from the rest of society. Ordained clergymen were restricted from most non-liturgical employment, rendering them and; the estate they supported vulnerable to poverty. The state bestowed privileges of free association on the clerical estate in order to. encourage the practice of mutual aid to support the pastorate. The 'estate isolation' of the parish clergy was tempered by their material dependence on the voluntary contributions of parishioners.
   This article argues that the parish clergy, however, promoted mutual aid beyond narrow estate interest as a religious practice among the laity in order to forge partnerships with lay associations. In some dioceses, the clergy organized social support networks for the laity as extensions of the sacred space that they administered in the parish churches. These networks empowered communities to collaborate across boundaries of space and estate in support of common causes. This article examines the organizational work of the parish clergy in the dioceses of Moscow and Tver' during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It first traces the development of clerical-estate associations since 1823, when they first received legal sanction. It examines the expansion and development of clerical mutual aid until the 1905 Revolution, when parishioners engaged in boycotts of church collections, demanding that more Church resources be used for parish needs, rather than to support the clerical estate. These temporary boycotts lent urgency to a movement already in force among the parish clergy to instill the practice of mutual aid into the religious lives of the Orthodox laity. The article next examines evidence from Moscow and Tver' that this movement created parish-based mutual aid networks for the laity, which collaborated with those of the clergy. Finally, the article examines the robust war-relief efforts of the clerical and lay mutual aid networks of Moscow and Tver' after 1914. These impressive efforts during the first years of the First World War provide compelling evidence for the successful development of a, working relationship between the two communities in the sphere of mutual aid over the, previous decades. The ultimate breakdown of this relationship and fragmentation of the Orthodox social networks must largely be attributed to the proximate cause of protracted industrial warfare, rather than to irreconcilable divisions in Russian society.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate and predict land movement by integrating geodetic, geophysical and meteorological data in a landslide area. Specifically, electrical resistivity tomography surveying, Global Navigation Satellite System and terrestrial laser scanning techniques were integrated to monitor a landslide. The study area lies to the southeast of the town of Ta kent in southern Turkey, close to Balcflar in the Central Taurus mountain chain. Landslides result in considerable damage to structures, farmland and the environment in this area; therefore, it is important to characterise the size, extent and timing of past land movements in order to mitigate damage from future landslides. Analysis presented in this paper shows that the greatest land movements in the region occur in spring, when average motions can be up to 1.5 m per month. It is demonstrated that integrated techniques provide a better means for monitoring landslide processes and gathering data for predictions of future movements. Mapping landslide movements by integrating geophysical and geodetic observations can provide a meaningful evaluation of a landslide and its dynamics.

AB  - Home networks currently dominated by human-object or human-human information production, exchange, processing, and paradigms are transitioning to machine to machine (M2M) due to the sudden introduction of embedded devices. Recently, due to the spread of IT equipment, more M2M-related devices are being used, and M2M-based projects are underway in various fields such as M2M-based u-city, u-port, u-work, u-traffic, etc. M2M has been applied in various fields, and u-healthcare is attracting attention in the M2M medical field. U-healthcare refers to technology in which ordinary patients can receive prescription services from experts by continuously monitoring changes in their health status during daily life at home based on wired and wireless communications infrastructures. In this paper, we propose an M2M-based smart health service for human UI/UX using motion recognition. Non-IP protocol, not TCP/IP protocol, has been used in sensor networks applied to M2M-based u-healthcare. However, sensors should be connected to the Internet in order to expand the use of services and facilitate management of the M2M-based sensor network. Therefore, we designed an M2M-based smart health service considering network mobility since data measured by the sensors should be transferred over the Internet. Unlike existing healthcare platforms, M2M-based smart health services have been developed for motion recognition as well as bio-information. Smart health services for motion recognition can sense four kinds of emotions, anger, sadness, neutrality, and joy, as well as stress using sensors. Further, they can measure the state of the individual by recognizing a user's respiratory and heart rates using an ECG sensor. In the existing medical environment, most medical information systems managing patient data use a centralized server structure. Using a fixed network, it is easy to collect and process limited data, but there are limits to processing a large amount of data collected from M2M devices in real-time. Generally, M2M communication used in u-healthcare consists of many networked devices and gateways. An M2M network may use standardized wireless technology based on the requirements of a particular device. Network mobility occurs when the connecting point changes according to the movement of any network, and the terminal can be connected without changing its address. If the terminal within the network communicates with any corresponding node, communication between the terminal and corresponding node should be continuously serviced without discontinuation.

AB  - Irrigation, fertilization, and cultivation managements play important roles in crop production in the North China Plain (NCP). This study aims to compare crop yields, and water and N use efficiencies (WOE and NUE) in a wheat-maize cropping system under different integrated management practices and recommend the best management practices (BMPs). A two-year experiment involving four integrated management practices was conducted in Tai'an City, Shandong Province in the NCP. These management practices were designed as follows: (1) traditional farming practice (FP); (2) optimized combination of cropping and fertilization (OPT-1); (3) practice for high yield (HY), which does not consider the cost of resource inputs to maximize grain yield; and (4) further optimized combination of cropping and fertilization (OPT-2), which is based on the HY practice. Soil water movement, nitrate transport, and crop growth were all simulated using the soil water, heat, carbon, and N simulation (WHCNS) model. Results indicated that simulated soil water content and nitrate concentration at different depths in soil profiles, leaf area index, dry matter weight, and grain yield were all in good agreement with the field-measured data. Simulation results indicated that the amounts and dates of irrigation and fertilization, planting method, planting density, and sowing date had obvious effects on grain yield, water drainage, total N loss, WUE, and NUE. The annual average total N loss under the OPT-I practice decreased by about 28.6% compared with the FP practice, whereas the annual average grain yield and NUE increased by 27.7% and 25.7%, respectively. The largest annual average grain yield and total N loss occurred in the HY practice (23,590 kg ha(-1) and 240.6 kg N ha(-1), respectively). Although the annual average grain yield of the OPT-2 practice was 15.4% lower than that of HY practice, the NUE was 19.2% higher in OPT-2 than in HY. The annual average nitrate leaching under the OPT-2 practice was the lowest and reached 25.5%-60.0% compared with those under other practices. Among the four practices, the OPT-2 practice achieved the most preferable results; the lowest N loss and the highest NUE were obtained at the expense of a slight decrease in grain yield. Therefore, the OPT-2 practice was the BMPs among the four practices and should be recommended to maximize the economic and environmental benefits in the study region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study has been done to evaluate the lithotectonic, geomorphic, hydrological and climatic factors responsible for the Tirah Line landslide, as well as, the anthropogenic factors that have augmented the damage potential of the slide. The town of Dharamsala and its suburbs in the Kangra valley provide a type example where unplanned development and urbanization has added to the hazard from landslides beside other factors. A devastating landslide occurred on 7(th) August, 2013 near Tirah Line locality of Dharamsala cantonment area, district Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, and damaged more than 25 houses completely. An estimated 0.1 sq.km of area of unconsolidated mass slid SSE down the terminal part of a thick alluvial fan on the left bank of the local drainage. The slide occurred after continuous heavy to very heavy rainfall for 4 days in August 2013 in the region when all the drainage remained in bankful position. Factors involved in slide were steep slope, continuous infiltration of water soak pits (sewage system) located up slopes, continuous heavy to very heavy rainfall and toe erosion by local drainage. The slide was moved in multiple phases due to continuous rainfall in the area.

AB  - Recent years have seen an explosion of the recruitment of Central American Temporary Foreign Workers (TFWs) by agricultural operations and other businesses in Quebec small towns. The mobility of one group (the TFWs) underpins the ability of another group (Quebec small-town residents) to avoid migration by contributing to the continued viability of economic activity in Quebec small towns. In this article, we examine the "fragile entanglement of physical movement, representations, and practices" (Cresswell, 2010, p. 18) as evidenced in Central American TFWs' experiences interacting with local community members as well as the response of local businesses, local social and community services, and local churches to the presence of TFWs in their communities. Drawing on data from focus groups with TFWs (n=31) and interviews with employers (n=17), advocates (n=13) and government actors (n=10), we come to the conclusion that Quebec small towns have been transformed by the cyclical mobility of TFWs but that the possibilities for diminishing the unequal power relationships and allowing for long-term integration and community development are limited so long as both the TFW Program continues to constrain the social, employment and geographic mobility of TFWs and Quebec refuses to consider all occupational levels for permanent residency under the Quebec Experience Program.

AB  - We have studied the earthquake occurred in vicinity of Luojiabu, southwest of Tianshui city, Gansu Province, where the M = 8 Lixian earthquake occurred on July 21, 1654. In geotectonic setting, this earthquake happened in the middle-northern segment of South-North Seismic Belt, which generates numerous strong earthquakes and consequently makes this area one of the most seismically hazardous regions in China. However, causative structure and mechanism of Lixian earthquake is still in debate. Combined with active fault mapping, deep geophysical data, globe position system vector field and the distribution of landslides along the fault, we discuss that the mechanism of Lixian earthquake and try to estimate the seismically hazardous in this region. Fault descriptions are based on field observations aided by satellite image from Google earth collected along the fault zone. Our primary purpose is to document features bearing on the recency and kinematics of Quaternary movement along the fault. The observations are largely synthesized on a set of maps. The maps show active fault traces and are annotated to indicate the location of features indicative of the sense, style and amount of offset of geomorphic features. We also map the distribution of Quaternary deposits in the vicinity of fault. Combined with the electrical structure profile derived by 2D inversion of the MT data, we analyzed seismogenic structures of Lixian 1654 earthquake.
   On July 21, 1654, the Lixian M=8 earthquake occurred at the east part of Lixian County, Gansu Province, China, in the middle-northern segment of the South-North Seismic Belt. In this region the tectonic activities and deformation are closely related to the north-eastward growth of Tibetan Plateau. Their complicated structural geometries were controlled by the Eastern Kunlun fault, Northern Marginal fault of West-Qinling, and a series of north-east trending faults. The Lixian-Luojiabu fault is a northeast trending sinistral strike-slip active fault and is 150 km long consisted by three sub-segments aligned in right-step-echelon. The fault cuts the T-1, terrace (lowest terrace in this area) deposits which contain the red ceramic fragments marking the Yangshao layer. On the terrace surface, the height of fault scarp is about 1. 5 m. Along the Lixian-Luojiabu fault, the sinistral displacement of gullies about 3 similar to 10 m and the height of fault scarps about 4. 5 similar to 8 m are found in a number of locations. And the Knickpoints about 3. 5 similar to 3. 9 m high are found 16 m away from the fault scarps. According to knickpoint recession rates at the same environment, these knickpoints may be formed as a 1654 earthquake in Lixian. A large number of landslides are distributed in a belt along Lixian-Yanguan-Luojiabu-Tianshui towns line, and its major axis direction is consistent with the trending of the Lixian-Luojiabu fault. Rear walls and side walls of the landslides are steep, with the outcrops of Late Quaternary loess and little vegetation cover. The Lixian-Luojiabu active fault is the seismogenic fault of the Lixian M=8 earthquake in 1654. The south-eastward sliding of the Lixian Sub-block, which is surrounded by the Northern Marginal fault of West-Qinling, Lixian-Luojiabu fault, and the Minxian-Dangchang fault, led to the occurring of the Lixian M=8 earthquake in 1654. Differences in electrical structure for the crust on the two sides of Lixian Luojiabu fault reveals the structural condition for strong earthquake generation. Lixian-Luojiabu fault is a sinistral strike-slip active fault, which generated M=8 Lixian earthquake on July 21, 1654. This earthquake produced 7 similar to 10 m horizontal offset and with 3 similar to 4 m fault scarps along the Lixian-Luojiabu fault. Tectonically, it took place on the middle-northern segment of the South-North Seismic Belt where a series of M> 5 had already occurred. Based on analysis of activity of other faults, GPS vector field and deep structural condition, the Lixian-Luojiabu fault activities and deformation are closely related to the north-eastward growth of Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Lanekoron 1756 and the Beginnings of Polish Frankism: an Attempt at a New Outlook
T2  - KWARTALNIK HISTORII ZYDOW-JEWISH HISTORY QUARTERLY
LA  - English
KW  - Sabbataism
KW  - Frankism
KW  - heresy
AB  - So far the history of Frankism has been presented as the story of Jakub Frank, a charismatic self-styled Messianic leader and his Polish followers. Frank was in Poland around the end of 1755 and early 1756 and less than two months later was expelled from the country, converted to Islam and did not participate in the developments that were crucial for the formation of his movement. The incident in the Lanckoron inn itself, regardless of what actually happened there, in no way explains the course of subsequent events. With that approach, the subsequent developments, which resulted in the formation of a powerful Messianic movement, public debates on faith with rabbis and ultimately the conversion of hundreds of Jewish Messianists to Catholic faith appear incomprehensible.
   The presentation of the origins of Frankism in literature is quite coherent if not necessarily consistent with historical sources. According to this presentation, Yaakow Josef ben Leib, known as Frenk and later as Frank, was asked to come to Poland in December 1755 in order to boost the morale and to integrate the local followers of Sabbatai Zvi. After touring small towns in Podolia and Volhynia, on 27 January 1756 he was allegedly caught practicing sectarian rites during a fair in Lanckoron and got arrested. This was when Bishop Mikolaj Dqbowslci took the stage, having decided that he was competent to resolve disputes concerning faith, Jewish faith included. He ordered the detainees to be brought to his town and began an inquiry into the incident and the religious disputes between the Jews going on at the time. This culminated in the famous dispute with the rabbis in November 1757, the condemnation of Talmud and its symbolic burning in the marketplace in Kamieniec Podolski.
   There are three fundamental questions which have to be clarified, and which I will discuss in the article.
   Were the developments in Lanckoron chance occurrence that had unforeseen consequences or was it a demonstration by the sectarians gathered in the inn that was planned in advance and was part of a long-term plan? In other words, does Frankism, whose recorded history began on 27 January 1756 in the Lanckoron inn, have its prehistory?
   What was Frank's actual role in these developments, was he engaged in the preparations for them or exert a significant influence on the course of events? There is one more issue related to Frank: were the events in Lanckoron during the international fair of a purely Polish nature? Was Frank seen as a Polish Jew and did he consider himself to be one and were Polish Jews the only participants in the unrest or were Jews from other countries involved as well, and if so, what goals were they pursuing?
   Why did the shouting match in the Lanckoroli inn produce such serious consequences and lead to a public dispute between the sectarians and the rabbis before a bishop's court, meaning an open religious schism within the Jewish community? In light of our knowledge of the political system of the Republic as it then was, it would be difficult to foresee such consequences of a pub quarrel. What happened in that inn and in the next several days then?

AB  - Landslides are a common type of mass movement that occur in large numbers and have significant effects on topography. In Turkey, landslides rank second after earthquakes among natural disasters that cause widespread loss of life and property. This study investigates the monitoring of the Taskent Landslide (Konya, Turkey), which has considerably affected the local topography. The landslide in Taskent had an adverse effect on transportation to nearby towns and villages. Initial studies were conducted using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurement scale; these studies are currently ongoing. Since 2011, studies using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), which is one of the latest ground-positioning technologies, have also been launched. This article presents the results of the TLS and GNSS approaches used to monitor, characterise and model an active landslide. It includes the comparison and analysis of a point cloud, three-dimensional model, profile and change in volume mass acquired in different time periods in one landslide area. The point cloud data, obtained from two different time periods using the TLS technique, and supported by the results of GNSS analysis, were analysed via different methods. The TLS revealed that up to 4 m of material was displaced at the site of the landslide, and it revealed detailed information about how the landslide occurred. The volume of the mass that moved as a result of the landslide was determined, and movements that occurred in the geological structure were monitored. These studies showed that the TLS point cloud method can be effectively used in the monitoring of landslides that occur in areas that are large, difficult to reach, rugged or mountainous.

AB  - The seasonal variations of refractivity gradients from 104 to 3000 m above ground level in the troposphere layer are presented based on observations from the radiosonde station located in Ngaoundere (13.5A degrees E, 7.3A degrees N), a middle belt savannah region of Cameroon. Six years (2006-2011) of data from in situ measurements made by Agency for the Safety of Air Navigation in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA) of the temperature, moisture, and pressure are used to determine the surface duct conditions over Ngaoundere region. Each time that a negative gradient from the Abel-retrieved refractivity profiles is seen, it implies the presence of a duct in this study. The occurrence of ducts strongly depends on the local climate and synoptic weather conditions which have an appreciable influence on the refractivity vertical profile, especially the seasonal north-south movement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which provides wet and dry seasons to the region. Monthly and seasonal variations of ducts were also determined from the measured data. The highest and the lowest occurrence rate of surface ducts were observed during the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. September appears as the month when most of the ducts occur at the rate of at least one duct per day. The median duct thickness and duct strength are high and strong during the wet season, whereas they are low and weak during the dry season. When the data are separated into stable and unstable atmospheric conditions, we noticed that surface duct characteristics show some seasonal differences. Surface ducts are found to be more frequent in a stable atmosphere than in an unstable atmosphere. Statistical results are discussed alongside with local meteorological conditions and weather systems affecting the town of Ngaoundere. Besides, comments are made on their prospective significance in the region.

AB  - This paper will focus on the importance of roads in the development of a region, particularly Eastern Croatia with the special emphasis on Pozega-Slavonia County. The main characteristic of the construction of roads is connecting people from different parts of the county in order to ensure their participation in all aspects of life together with free movement of goods and passengers.
   County and local roads are of great importance as a part of the road network in the distribution of traffic at a lower level. Modernization in all aspects of life requires modernization and development of transport infrastructure, which leads to faster and better flow of transport services. Based on the provisions of the Road Act public roads are divided into: motorways, state roads, county roads and local roads. County roads are public roads connecting county seat with towns and municipalities. Local roads are public roads connecting the towns or a municipality with settlements of more than 50 residents within the town or municipality.
   County Roads Administration is an institution for management, construction, reconstruction and maintenance of county and local roads. One of the main activities of County Roads Administration is the construction of roads. In the process of performing its basic activity the County Roads Administration faces issues with the ongoing implementation of the actions required for the settlement of property rights relations. Settlement of property rights relations is the key part in the procedure of road construction. The issue of resolving property rights relations arises from complex property relations of real estate that are necessary for the construction of a particular road.
   The aim of this paper is to show the way and phases in the process of resolving property relations concerning real estates planned to become an integral part of the road, the conclusion of contracts with property owners as well as the expropriation procedure that occurs if the owners disagree with the donation or sale of their property.

AB  - Background: Working in health care carries the risk of transmission of infected blood to patients by hospital workers and to other health personnel in the form of occupational infections. Conscientious application of the standard precautions is the main method used to avoid needle stick injuries, contamination of skin and mucous membranes, cuts with sharp tools, and inadequate disposal and recapping of needles. The aim of this work was to investigate in Friuli Venezia Giulia, a region in north-east Italy, the enhancement carried out to prevent situations of biologic risk for health care workers, and to verify the related laboratory analyses.
   Methods: Biological accidents occurring during the years 2012-2013 in the departments of oncology and pediatric-obstetric surgery, and in the intensive care unit at Burlo Garofolo Children's Hospital in Trieste (a large town in Friuli Venezia Giulia) were reviewed, and a new panel of tests was introduced for patients and health care workers, to also detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and aspartate transaminase and immunoglobulin G. All tests were submitted for external quality assessment.
   Results: In total, 230 nosocomial events were reported by health care workers in the above-mentioned hospital departments in 2012-2013. There were 158 accidents in 2012, including 55 accidental needle stick injuries (34.81%), 59 blood splashes (37.34%), and 44 cuts with infected instruments (27.84%). The risk of sustaining a cut was related to movement error during surgery when the appropriate procedure was not followed or when devices were being assembled and passed between doctors and nurses. Most accidents happened among physicians compared to nurses; the high percentage of needle stick injuries (34.81%) versus nurses (25.94%) were due to incorrect recapping of needles after use. No cases of health care workers being infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV were identified. In 2013, the number of biological accidents decreased to 61, comprising two needle stick injuries (3.27%), 35 blood splashes (57.37%), and 25 cuts with contaminated instruments (40.98%). The number of subcutaneous abscesses with scarring resulting from cuts with sharp instruments decreased from three in 2012 (one of which was the subject of medicolegal proceedings) to none in 2013. Although our study population was relatively small, we did detect a statistically significant decrease in the number of needle stick injuries (P<0.05, chi(2) test).
   Conclusion: In this early experience at a maternal and child health institution in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, application of a safety protocol, centralized organization of HIV tests, improved external quality assessment, and introduction of internal quality control for immunoglobulin G contributed to a decrease in the number of work-related biological accidents and their complications, which have the potential to result in medicolegal problems.

TI  - Glagolitic Culture during the First Decades of the 20th Century in Ante Nizic's Entries

AB  - Entries of Father Ante Nizic's (1873-1963), Glagolitic priest of the Archdiocese of Zadar and, from 1920, a third order Glagolitic Franciscan monk, arc based on five of his notebooks, in which he wrote down all sorts of things: his account of current expenses, various records, personal encounters, his thoughts and troubles, future plans, received and sent writings, letters and so on. These notes were created occasionally from 1904 when he began his ministry in the village of Nadin until 1935 when he went to the USA.
   The paper has focused on the entries on Glagolitic culture during Ante Nizic's time For him, the Glagolitisin was a life ideal, through which he was able to most easily reach people spiritually, culturally, educationally and politically. Thus he advocated the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic language wherever hc performed his ministry. This pastoral effort on his native island of Ugljan, much more intensely than in parishes on thc Dalmatian mainland, turned into a struggle for Croatian national expression, which he encouraged by, among other things, spreadirm the Croatian press, buying the Croatian books and constant exposure of the Croatian national three-coloured flag on the parish church. By doing all this, hc was faithfully on thc line with Prodan's ideology of Dalmatian Party of Rights and Mahnie's Croatian Catholic Movement. Thus he sometimes used to attack priests if they showed negligence towards Old Slavonic culture, and he was particularly annoyed by Archbishop Vicko Puliie's cautious attitude towards the Old Church Slavonic language, confronting him, in such instances, with the local Glagolitic tradition, testimonies from the Church's history and benevolent ecclesiastical authorities such as Popes Innocent IV, Leo XIII and Benedict XV.
   His idealistic stance towards the Glagolitic script, i. e. the Roman-Slavic rite and Old Church Slavonic language made him enter a third order Franciscan monastic community at the age of 47, where he immediately became one of the most persistent advocates of monastic formation in Glagolitic spirit. His joining the Tertiary Franciscans was certainly helped by Italian occupation of his native land after which he was, same as many priests, denounced as a Croatian nationalist. Until 1935, his longest ministry was in Zagreb, where the Glagolitic Tertiary Franciscans were given the permanent ownership of the church and surrounding land at Ksaver due to the maintenance of the live Old Slavonic word in liturgy and their commitment to its preservation. Nizic had always put the Old Slavonic culture ahead of all other forms of spirituality. His entries show that he completely ignored various manifestations that were played out with the Old Church Slavonic language after 1918 when there appeared many advocates of unconditional introduction of the Old Slavonic language in the Roman Catholic 1 iturgy, hut who never used any Old Slavonic word in their activities and ministries.
   Nizic's entries have illuminated Archbishop Dvomilc's role in revitalization of Glagolitic parishes in the Archdiocese of Zadar, shown the strength of Croatian national spirit on the island of Ugljan after Italy had entered the war against Austria-IIungary, allowed a synchronistic view on Latin-language and Old Slavonic language parishes of the Archdiocese of Zadar in the 201h century, provided a list of names of the Old Slavonic Academy supporters from Dalmatia, highlighted the attempt to create a practical Old Slavonic-Latin dictionary bascd on the Parrcic Missal and failed arrival of the Glagolitic Tertiary Franciscans in the town of Rah and in Slovenia.
   Father Ante Nilie's entries arc testimonies of a staunch Glagolitic spirit of the Croatian priests from the old Glagolitic areas which, despite an attempt at instrumentalization of the Old Slavonic liturgy during the first Yugoslavia, managed to maintain their fidelity to Rome. Their steadfast spirit persists even after the conciliar decision to make Latin and Old Church Slavonic languages equal with national languages in liturgy.

AB  - Background
   Cycling is an attractive form of transport. It is beneficial to the individual as a form of physical activity that may fit more readily into an individual's daily routine, such as for cycling to work and to the shops, than other physical activities such as visiting a gym. Cycling is also beneficial to the wider community and the environment as a result of fewer motorised journeys. Cyclists are seen as vulnerable road users who are frequently in close proximity to larger and faster motorised vehicles. Cycling infrastructure aims to make cycling both more convenient and safer for cyclists. This review is needed to guide transport planning.
   Objectives
   To:
   1. evaluate the effects of different types of cycling infrastructure on reducing cycling injuries in cyclists, by type of infrastructure;
   2. evaluate the effects of cycling infrastructure on reducing the severity of cycling injuries in cyclists;
   3. evaluate the effects of cycling infrastructure on reducing cycling injuries in cyclists with respect to age, sex and social group.
   Search methods
   We ran the most recent search on 2nd March 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase Classic + Embase(OvidSP), PubMed and 10 other databases. We searched websites, handsearched conference proceedings, screened reference lists of included studies and previously published reviews and contacted relevant organisations.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies which evaluated the effect of cycling infrastructure (such as cycle lanes, tracks or paths, speed management, roundabout design) on cyclist injury or collision rates. Studies had to include a comparator, that is, either no infrastructure or a different type of infrastructure. We excluded studies that assessed collisions that occurred as a result of competitive cycling.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors examined the titles and abstracts of papers obtained from searches to determine eligibility. Two review authors extracted data from the included trials and assessed the risk of bias. We carried out a meta-analysis using the random-effects model where at least three studies reported the same intervention and outcome. Where there were sufficient studies, as a secondary analysis we accounted for changes in cyclist exposure in the calculation of the rate ratios. We rated the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' according to the GRADE approach for the installation of cycle routes and networks.
   Main results
   We identified 21 studies for inclusion in the review: 20 controlled before-after (CBA) studies and one interrupted time series (ITS) study. These evaluated a range of infrastructure including cycle lanes, advanced stop lines, use of colour, cycle tracks, cycle paths, management of the road network, speed management, cycle routes and networks, roundabout design and packages of measures. No studies reported medically-attended or self-reported injuries. There was no evidence that cycle lanes reduce the rate of cycle collisions (rate ratio 1.21, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.08). Taking into account cycle flow, there was no difference in collisions for cyclists using cycle routes and networks compared with cyclists not using cycle routes and networks (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.05). There was statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies (I-2 = 75%, Chi(2) = 8.00 df = 2, P = 0.02) for the analysis adjusted for cycle flow. We judged the quality of the evidence regarding cycle routes and networks as very low and we are very uncertain about the estimate. These analyses are based on findings from CBA studies.
   From data presented narratively, the use of 20 mph speed restrictions in urban areas may be effective at reducing cyclist collisions. Redesigning specific parts of cycle routes that may be particularly busy or complex in terms of traffic movement may be beneficial to cyclists in terms of reducing the risk of collision. Generally, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts may increase the number of cycle collisions. In particular, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts with cycle lanes marked as part of the circulating carriageway increased cycle collisions. However, the conversion of intersections with and without signals to roundabouts with cycle paths may reduce the odds of collision. Both continuing a cycle lane across the mouth of a side road with a give way line onto the main road, and cycle tracks, may increase the risk of injury collisions in cyclists. However, these conclusions are uncertain, being based on a narrative review of findings from included studies. There is a lack of evidence that cycle paths or advanced stop lines either reduce or increase injury collisions in cyclists. There is also insufficient evidence to draw any robust conclusions concerning the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions in terms of severity of injury, sex, age, and level of social deprivation of the casualty.
   In terms of quality of the evidence, there was little matching of intervention and control sites. In many studies, the comparability of the control area to the intervention site was unclear and few studies provided information on other cycling infrastructures that may be in place in the control and intervention areas. The majority of studies analysed data routinely collected by organisations external to the study team, thus reducing the risk of bias in terms of systematic differences in assessing outcomes between the control and intervention groups. Some authors did not take regression-to-mean effects into account when examining changes in collisions. Longer data collection periods pre-and post-installation would allow for regression-to-mean effects and also seasonal and time trends in traffic volume to be observed. Few studies adjusted cycle collision rates for exposure.
   Authors' conclusions
   Generally, there is a lack of high quality evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions as to the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions. There is a lack of rigorous evaluation of cycling infrastructure.
