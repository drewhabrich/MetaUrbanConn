AB  - Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.

AB  - This paper examines the structure of a Lepidoptera assemblage in an urban environment in South Africa. The Lepidoptera inhabit fungus-induced galls on Acacia karroo. Habitat patches supporting the moth assemblage were sampled from rural, urban-reserve, suburban and city sites and the habitat quality at each of these sites was quantified. Gall occupancy, larval density and species richness were lowest at the most disturbed, city sites. Non-parametric multivariate techniques showed that the moth-assemblage structure did not differ significantly at rural and urban-reserve sites. Assemblage structure at the suburban sites was variable and appeared to be transitional in structure between the city assemblage and the rural and urban-reserve assemblages. Habitat quality variables however were weakly correlated with moth-assemblage structure. The contribution of urban reserves to the local sustainability of this Lepidoptera assemblage emphasizes the importance of maintaining 'green' areas in and around cities.

AB  - The landscape of rural America is changing. Wildlife habitats are being converted to agricultural uses, corridors (linear patches that differ from their surroundings) are removed to expand fields, and urban development spreads across farms, forests, and prairies. The result is a fragmented landscape with fewer, smaller, less-connected patches of wildlife habitat and increasingly-degraded water quality that stresses aquatic ecosystems. The landscape's capacity to sustain a diversity of plant, animal, and aquatic species is declining at an decelerating rate. The loss of biodiversity has become a national concern. Land use planners are increasingly advocating the use of conservation corridors, including riparian buffers, windbreaks/shelterbelts, filter strips, field borders, and grassed waterways to improve water quality and wildlife habitat Since many of the ecological functions of conservation corridors operate more efficiently at scales larger than an individual corridor, planning at the watershed scale offers the best opportunity to optimize these functions.

AB  - There is little information on the spatiotemporal pattern of dispersal of juvenile cougars (Felis concolor) and no data on disperser use of habitat corridors.  I investigated dispersal of radio-tagged juvenile cougars (8 M, 1 F) in a California landscape containing 3 corridors (1.5, 4.0, and 6.0 km long) and several habitat peninsulas created by urban growth.  Dispersal was usually initiated by the mother abandoning the cub near an edge of her home range.  The cub stayed within 300 m of that site for 13-19 days and then dispersed in the direction opposite that taken by the mother.  Mean age at dispersal was 18 months (range 13-21 months).  Each disperser traveled from its natal range to the farthest part of the urban-wildland edge.  Dispersing males occupied a series of small (<30% the area used by ad M in the same time span), temporary (10-298 days) home ranges, usually near the urban-wildland interface, and often with its longest border along that edge.  Each of the 3 corridors was used by 1-3 dispersers, 5 of the 9 dispersers found and successfully used corridors, and 2 dispersers entered but failed to traverse corridors.  Dispersing cougars will use corridors that are located along natural travel routes, have ample woody cover, include an underpass integrated with roadside fencing at high-speed road crossings, lack artificial outdoor lighting, and have <1 dwelling unit/16 ha.

AB  - The effect of urban development on butterfly species' richness and species' incidence is tested for the Greater Manchester conurbation and two sample areas, mapped at finer scales, within the southern part of the conurbation. The tests include measures of bias for recording effort (number of visits). Species' richness is found to increase with percentage urban cover for Greater Manchester (tetrad scale) and decrease with urban cover for the two sample areas in South West Manchester (1 km scale) and the Mersey Valley (100 m scale). For Greater Manchester, the increase in species' richness with increased urban cover is largely explained by lower species' richness at higher altitude in the Pennines bounding the conurbation. For the two sample areas, decreasing species' richness associated with increasing urban cover corresponds with reductions in the areas of a number of semi-natural habitats, hostplants and nectar sources. Despite these statistically significant correlations, the impact of urban cover on species' richness is weak. The maximum loss rate identified anywhere within the region is 0.81 species per 10% change in urban cover for South West Manchester. This finding may reflect on the generally low species diversity of the region. However, these results could be influenced by recording and sampling artefacts, particularly the failure of mapping programmes to distinguish vagrant individuals from breeding populations and a bias of records to vagrants. This is supported by the higher correlations between species' incidence and nectar sources than between species' incidence and their hostplants. Adult butterflies are opportunistic nectar users and nectar sources are more widely spread and thus less influenced by urban development than are specific butterfly hostplants. The finding may also reflect on the capacity of most of the butterfly species to breed successfully on tiny areas of hostplant existing within extensively built-up areas. Moreover, the capacity of butterfly species to persist by using small fragments of hostplants would be enhanced by vagrancy. If this is indeed the case, it is a finding that would support the value of small patches in butterfly metapopulations, albeit ones comprising incomplete complements of resources required during the life cycle. The incidence of most species decreases with increase in urban cover. Multivariate analyses indicate that this is owing to corresponding declines in hostplant-habitats and nectar sources. Five species increase with urban cover, but none attain formal significance. Associations among hostplants and habitat variables in a principal components analysis suggest that, in three cases (Pieris brassicae, P. rapae, Celastrina argiolus), this is owing to increasing areas of their hostplants within urban environments.

AB  - 1. We used a factorial experimental design to test whether habitat fragmentation (two different fragment sizes) and connectivity (presence and absence of corridors between small fragments) affected population growth rate and two conventional measures of the demographic structure (proportion of reproductive adults and sex ratio) in 12 enclosed populations of root voles.
   2. Because the matriline has been suggested to be a functional entity affecting the demography of Microtus populations, we employed a study protocol (including laboratory-raised founder animals and intensive live trapping combined with fluorescent powder techniques), which enabled us to track the matrilineal genealogy in the populations. Thus, the effect of habitat structure on the matrilineal structure of the populations, quantified by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, could be tested for the first time.
   3. Population growth rate was density dependent, but neither this population parameter nor sex ratio and proportion of reproductive adults differed between the habitat treatments. This was unexpected since the presumed determinants of Microtus demography, such as individual space use, dispersal distances and spatiosocial organization had earlier been found to differ between the treatments.
   4. The matrilineal structure (diversity) of the populations changed in response to the experimental habitat manipulations. In corridor-connected systems, some matrilines became numerically dominant, which lead to reduced matrilineal diversity compared to systems with isolated habitat fragments. We hypothesize that some matrilines were able to colonize and exploit corridor-connected fragments better than other matrilines. Matrilineal diversity was not related to any other demographic attribute (growth rate, sex ratio and functional stage structure) at the population level.
   5. Our results suggest that fragmentation-induced changes of individual and matrilineal level attributes do not necessarily propagate into population level differences in vital rates. The notion that matrilines may be a functional entity in Microtus populations could not be supported.
   6. Our experimental results suggest that population genetics, more than population demography, may be sensitive to habitat fragmentation and connectivity, within the specific temporal and spatial extent explored. In particular, the effect of corridors on matrilineal diversity imply that population genetic studies based on mtDNA markers should consider habitat connectivity when analysing genetic diversity.

AB  - Bird communities on the 20 fragmented woodlots in a suburban area were surveyed in the Tokorozawa City, Central Japan, to analyze the factors that influenced the distribution of birds. Our results showed that woodlot area is an important predictor of the number of individuals and the species richness of birds in each woodlot. Based on the species composition of birds in wintering season, the fragmented woodlots were classified into four types by TWINSPAN: those are core woodlots, woodlots surrounding core ones, isolated and small woodlots, and isolated and middle-sized woodlots. By canonical discriminant analysis, it was indicated that the connectivity between woodlots and the vegetation structure are also important factors influencing bird communities. The necessity of controlling these factors for avian conservation was pointed out.

AB  - Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep netting, Malaise traps and visual sampling at a national botanic garden, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the taxonomic impediment is great. The aims were to compare two sites, one of native vegetation and the other of mainly exotic plants, to determine the possible localized extent of biodiversity change across the land mosaic, and to test and compare methodologies and indicator taxa and to make recommendations for ecological landscaping of a botanic garden. Species richness and evenness varied considerably with sampling technique used. From results of a single replicate of data from all trapping methods including 821 arthropod species and 3831 individuals, a number of conclusions could be drawn. Trapping procedures such as sweep netting and pitfall traps, which focus on species with restricted mobility and/or host plant requirements, indicated greatest differences in diversity between two closely located sites. Taxa varied in sensitivity to microlandscape, again depending on the extent of their mobility. Cicindelid and carabid beetles were particularly good indicators of habitat disturbance and type. The management recommendations are that in a species-rich urban botanic garden such as this, as many ecotopes as possible should be preserved or created. These should vary in topography, landscape characteristics and vegetation composition, with as much connectivity as possible. This is a feasible blanket approach to give home to a large number of nameless species and morphs. Patches of different ecotopes should not be separated by more than a few metres by expanses of mown lawn which isolates much of the fauna.

AB  - A regional greenway network is proposed to reconnect ecologically the fragmented landscapes of south Florida. The natural landscapes of the region have been progressively fragmented on account of agricultural and urban development. It is proposed that the regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees, which was originally developed to facilitate agriculture and urbanization, be ecologically reclaimed and managed to become a network of environmental restoration and cultural opportunity for south Florida. The existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees is restrictively underutilized. Tn general, the value of utility and transportation corridors as natural and cultural resources has not been fully appreciated in south Florida. Their value as resources lies in the ample opportunity they offer for landscape revegetation, wetland reclamation, habitat restoration, and community education and recreation, In particular, the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees represents an extensive resource that can naturally and culturally link the fragmented landscapes of south Florida while maintaining flood control and water conservation.
   A tripartite method, based on the ecological principles of island biogeography theory and landscape network theory, is used to consider the geographical, morphological, and topological impact on natural diversity and cultural use. Respectively, the effects of network corridor area, network corridor width, and network connectivity and circuitry are described, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential effect on natural diversity and cultural use along the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees. Results indicate that the proposed regional greenway network is characterized by a large area, broad extent, morphological diversity, and topological connectivity. Variation in greenway structure and function along the regional network can accommodate a multitude of environmental concerns and cultural needs faced by the region. The regional greenway network affords ample flexibility, with three types of corridors (line, strip, and stream) within four types of context (urban, suburban, rural, and natural). Recommendations are made to appraise opportunities further at the regional level, conduct ecological corridor research at the landscape scale, and develop a greenway prototype at a specific community site.

AB  - A spatial distribution model has been developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model has been validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios, Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared with the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity. The model was applied to an area on the edge of Guelph scheduled for development. The predicted land use patterns of various planning scenarios were generated and analysed. The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.

KW  - MOVEMENT
AB  - It is often assumed that the globalization of the world economy will drive societies and societal change in a broadly similar direction, leading to convergence in the process of urbanization. The observed diversity between places is the result of the engagement of the macroeconomic process with local social and political structures. Inner-city decline in many older metropolitan centers of the USA and the United Kingdom has occurred through economic restructuring and job loss, with smaller urban centers and amenity-rich areas benefiting concomitantly. Demographic processes have accentuated this decline: most notably suburbanization, counterurbanization, inner-city renewal programs, and urban resettlement to new towns. Since the early 1980s, however, selected inner cities have been the focus of reinvestment, and a return of population through so-called 'gentrification'. In the United Kingdom, in particular, public policy has played an important role in the reinvigoration of inner cities.
   The substantial literature on UK and US cities is reviewed insofar as it might shed light on convergent processes in Latin American inner cities. In fact, the evidence suggests little convergence. The demography is different, with relatively low levels of visible population decline; and the economy of the inner city remains vibrant, focusing upon services and small-scale artisan activities, with no corresponding decline in heavy industry. Although large-scale redevelopment projects in and around the downtown were common during the 1940s to the 1960s, the demise of authoritarian and dirigiste-type leaders, 1980s austerity, and a growing democratic base, have imposed severe limitations on the extent of large-scale urban redevelopment and reinvestment. Cultural and aesthetic influences also militate against a demand from the middle-income and upper-income groups to gentrify the inner city; nor is the 'rent-gap' sufficient to stimulate private-sector supply of new or refurbished homes a likely option in the city center. Policy prescriptions in Latin America should take account of this divergence and fundamental differences in kind, and should aim to develop existing opportunities and land uses for an incumbent working-class population, rather than seeking to attract new uses and better-off populations into the core.

AB  - The National Parks Board of Singapore has plans to link up all urban parks and native habitats through a park-connector network. Although this connector network has already been implemented, it will take about 30 years to complete. We surveyed birds in 10 linear areas in Singapore. Of these linear areas, two were already completed park connectors, six were parks, and two were located in rainforest edges. We assessed and compared bird communities among these 10 sites. We also determined how the characteristics of these linear areas affect bird diversity and abundance. One of the established park connectors, the Ulu Pandan Canal, attracted 67 bird species, and its bird community was similar to a linear park (Kent Ridge Park). The other recently completed connector, the Jurong Canal, had only 37 bird species. Based on characteristics (percentage of area covered by built environment, open space, vegetation and water) within and surrounding the sites, we found that with increases in built areas, higher abundance of human-associated bird species (e.g. House Swift, Apus nipalensis and Common Myna, Acridotheres javanicus) was found at the sites. Similarly, the increase in vegetation cover (both native and managed) increased the abundance of parkland and rainforest-associated bird species (e.g. Greater Green Leafbird, Chloropsis sonnerati and Short-tailed Babbler, Malacocincla malaccensis). For completed connectors, landscape and management planners should preserve the existing diversity of habitats surrounding the connectors. Similar steps should be taken for the design of future park connectors. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on the avian ecology and management of a 43.5 ha remnant hind-dune and estuary ecosystem in suburban Wollongong (population 200 000). In total, 62 land-bird species and 24 water-bird species were present between July 1984 and February 1987 (32 months). During area searches (n = 12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory. Resident species ranged in abundance from the Eastern Whipbird Psophodes olivaceus (maximum population eight birds) to the New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (maximum population 200 birds). Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialists, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself, (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals.

AB  - Hong Kong's urban environment has an extremely high development density pervasively filled by buildings and roads. Little ground-level space is left for amenity planting within and without town lots, resulting in a cramped city matrix with inadequate green cover. The community desires for more and better trees for cityscape enhancement and environmental amelioration. A city-wide roadside-tree census was conducted recently together with a survey of potential planting sites (PPS) with a view to augmenting tree biomass and diversity in the long run. Sites with a suitable plantable corridor were evaluated in detail in the field to glean data on growing-space geometry (configuration and dimensions) and qualitative attributes (adjacent land use, building setback, unpaved soil, and air quality). Some 1094 PPS with a total capacity for 12 063 trees had been studied. Most PPS are spatially scattered and small, each with <14 trees capacity. A suite of III species had been selected for suitable dimensional and amenity attributes to fit the harsh and tight roadside sites, and to avoid the currently rampant discordance between trees and habitats. Environmental conditions within and in the vicinity of individual PPS, with an emphasis on plantable-space geometry, were matched with species characters. A strategy was adopted to maximize final biomass, floristic variety and ornamental functions especially attractive flowers and seasonal changes. A 5 year master planting plan was designed with site-specific species recommendations and a schedule giving priority to tree-deficient and readily-available localities. The landscape in 398 more streets will be improved with congruous trees. A similar green-planning strategy could be applied to other cities with a congested urban morphology.

AB  - Eradication of exotic species has been proposed to protect the integrity of nature reserves, but this can be a futile attack on symptoms without curing the causes of site invasibility-the susceptibility of a site to invasion by exotic species. More exotic bird and mammal species are found in California nature reserves that are surrounded by agriculture and human settlement, and that have suffered reduced richness of native mammal species. The chaparral ecotope contains 37 of the 41 exotic bird and mammal species in California, many of which are confined to large urban centers or residences. Farmland and settlements in the grassland ecotope support 17 of the wider-ranging exotic species. Site invasibility did not decrease with habitat area, but habitat fragmentation might lower biotic resistance in reserves by reducing mammal species richness and abundance after restricting dispersal. Reserve integrity can be best protected by landscape management that promotes native mammal species richness in and around reserves.

AB  - (1) The presence and absence of 22 plant species of various growth forms and habitat associations were analysed in 423 habitat fragments totalling 10.4 km(2) in a 268 km(2) urban and suburban region, in Birmingham, UK. (2) Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the effects of patch geometry and quality on the species distributions. Measures of geometry were area, shape (S-factor), distance from open countryside and various measures of isolation from other patches. Potential habitat for each species was determined quantitatively, and the distribution of each species was considered within a subset of patches containing potentially suitable habitat types. There was found to be a significant positive correlation between the density of patches available to a species and the proportion of these patches which were occupied. (3) Logistic analyses and incidence functions revealed that, for many of the species, occupancy increased with site age, area, habitat number and similarity of adjacent habitats, while increasing distance to the nearest recorded population of the same species decreased the likelihood that a species would be found in a patch. (4) Patterns of occupancy are consistent with increased extinction from small sites, and colonisation of nearby habitats, coupled with an important role for site history. We conclude that spatial dynamics at the scale of the landscape are of importance to the long-term persistence of many plant species in fragmented landscapes, and must be seriously considered in conservation planning and management. These results have direct implications for the siting and connectivity of urban habitat reserves.

AB  - To understand the complex mechanisms behind the recent biodiversity decline, it is necessary to complement traditional biological and ecological studies with studies of the economic, historic, and social contexts related to biodiversity loss, We used the completeness of the woodpecker guild as a biodiversity indicator to test the hypothesis that forest biodiversity in Europe is inversely related to the degree of urban-economic development. We related woodpecker diversity to several socioeconomic indices in 20 central European countries where the basic physiogeographic conditions are similar. As predicted, woodpecker diversity was low in highly developed countries with a long history of intensive land use, whereas in less-developed, peripheral countries, the woodpecker diversity was much higher and no species had been lost. The negative correlation between the degree of urbanization and woodpecker diversity was interpreted as a causal link between neotechnological landscape degradation and the decline of biodiversity. We discuss, and reject, alternative hypotheses related to the slow postglacial dispersal of species and climatic differences between western and eastern Europe that might explain the observed pattern of woodpecker diversity. The relative importance of particular woodpecker species for the level of woodpecker diversity shows that species depending on naturally dynamic temperature forests are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic changes. Finally, we stress the importance of bolistic studies on biodiversity, including ecological, geographical, and social issues, and we encourage specialists and practitioners from different disciplines to examine the European east-west gradient to learn how to avoid the same biodiversity loss in the East that has afflicted the West.

AB  - Lepidoptera populations were monitored during 29 years by a light-trap in urban Brno. Compared with other sites in the Czech Republic (Prague-Ruzyne, Ceske Budejovice, Cernis) urban Brno was extraordinarily rich in species, richer than the other Czech sites studied and richer than many British sites in an urban to natural gradient. Variability of the more common species at Brno was as high as that at the ruderal/deteriorated agricultural setting at Ceske Budejovice, and generally higher than that in the wet forest environment at Cernis and much higher than in the park-like/suburban/agricultural setting of Prague. Voltinism had no effect on variability from year to year. Most of the more common species in Brno clearly increased in abundance over the years, unlike those at the other sites. Much of the large diversity at Brno, however, was because of a large number of accidental species, vagrants from elsewhere. When considering only the more common species (greater-than-or-equal-to 5 individuals per year), however, Brno is among the most species-poor sites. The common species at Brno were mostly tramp species that could take advantage of whatever food and habitat the city had to offer.
   Because of strong correlations in abundance between species at one site with conspecifics at other sites over distances of 150-200 km, the abundances in these populations are apparently strongly affected by large-scale processes such as weather, overriding in part large differences between the habitats or by large-scale dispersal of individuals between sites. Significant correlations also existed between conspecifics in these sites in variability as well as in trends in time, with the curious exception of Cernis, the only reasonably natural habitat, suggesting that these parameters are strongly affected by local habitat characteristics.

AB  - The early 1970s was a period of immense social upheaval, with new social movements dominating the urban social landscape.  Social scientists were dealing with a crisis of relevance and David Harvey's Social Justice and the City was one response to this crisis.  Despite the growth of the contemporary women's movement in the early 1970s, women are practically invisible in the book.  This invisibility was typical of much academic writing at the time, and was being addressed by feminist scholars in their critiques of traditional Marxist theory.  Within a broader societal context, women began to problematize the public-private divide, which ushered in a shift toward representations of women as individuals rather than auxiliaries to men.  Women redefined ''political'' in a bid to make cities (and North America) more women-friendly.  Feminists took supposedly ''private'' issues and placed them squarely on the municipal agenda.  This point is illustrated with the example of Toronto feminists' activism around male violence against women.  In the last 20 years, feminists have gained momentum from the assumption of the universality of women's oppression.  In the 1990s, social scientists are facing a crisis of representation regarding the viability of universal truths and totalizing discourses.  This necessitates a revision of urban social justice that is sensitive to difference and diversity.

AB  - Attempts to generate a ''climate-responsive'' northern urban form are part of a relatively recent phenomenon and field of investigation. In conjunction with the international ''winter cities'' movement, the need has been established for explicit, systematic inquiry directed toward national and local action to improve the comfort and lifestyles of all northern inhabitants. It is important to recognize that winter-induced discomforts exist and that they must be acknowledged in planning theory and practice.
   For northern cities to function more satisfactorily, the negative impacts of winter must be reduced while its beneficial characteristics are enhanced. While not all summer activities can or should be abandoned during winter, proper micro-climatic control is essential if human life is to be retained outside. The outdoor season should be extended since so much indoor isolation occurs. The main principles to be incorporated in exemplary ''winter city'' design should be contact with nature, year-round usability, user participation, cultural continuity, and the creation of comfortable micro-climatic conditions throughout much of the city's open spaces. All valuable sources of inspiration must be harnessed in the attempt to mediate between organic regionalism and internationalism, on the one hand, and romanticism and pragmatic realism, on the other. Creating optimum conditions for human well-being, habitation, work and intellectual development in each of the four seasons is vital under harsh environments. Adopting a climate-sensitive approach to planning policy and urban design can render everyday life less stressful, especially during the lengthy winter periods found in many northern latitude and high altitude settings.

AB  - A cornerstone of apartheid was the enforcement of urban residential segregation. From the mid 1970s, however, the racial composition of the Johannesburg inner city, historically a white group area, altered dramatically. The paper illustrates that the national context in the 1970s made it increasingly difficult for the state to carry out its urban apartheid policy. The economic crisis increased the state housing shortage in the respective black group areas, thereby forcing people to migrate into the Johannesburg inner city where there was an abundance of accommodation. The political crisis and changing class composition of Afrikaners brought about hesitancy and division within the National Party as the more pragmatic verligtes battled against the conservative, verkrampte wing. This facilitated the movement of 'non-white' families into the Johannesburg inner city.

AB  - The ability to maintain small populations in quasi-natural settings is an issue of considerable importance in biodiversity conservation. The genetic structure of urban common frog (Rana temporaria) populations was determined by allozyme electrophoresis and used to evaluate the effects of restricted intersite migration. Despite the lack of any absolute barrier to movement between ponds, substantial genetic differentiation was found between sites separated by an average of only 2.3 km. Genetic distances between these town ponds correlated positively with geographical distances and were almost twice as great as those found between rural sites separated by an average of 41 km. Measures of genetic diversity and fitness were always lowest in the town, where the degree of subpopulation differentiation (F-ST = 0.388) was high. Population decline was not evident in the town, but molecular and fitness data indicated the presence of genetic drift and inbreeding depression. The long-term survival of artificially restricted populations, particularly of relatively sedentary species, may require molecular monitoring, if genetic diversity is not to be lost by chance when facets of the species niche prove to be poorly understood.

AB  - Since the inauguration of reform in 1978, a large number of Chinese peasants were released from agricultural production and became ''surplus labor.'' Because a large proportion of rural-urban population mobility assumes the form of temporary movement, attention to such movement is therefore essential to any assessment of social, economic and political changes in urban and rural China and of the overall urbanization process. The present study uses the 1 percent sample of the 1990 census data of China to study long-term rural to urban temporary economic migrants, the provincial pattern and variation of these migrants, and their economic activities represented by the occupational attainments in cities in comparison with urban residents.

AB  - Major approaches to ecological design were reviewed and compared. Naturalistic, ecosystem science, and landscape ecology approaches were applied to the development of an ecological framework for the planning, design and management of urban river greenways. The framework also incorporated ecological knowledge related to the planning and design process, design and management of natural areas, and theory and methodology from landscape ecology. It provides a systematic procedure for facilitating the protection, ecological enhancement, and linkage of present and potential natural areas in urban river greenways. One component of the framework, the assessment, has been described in detail and applied to the South Saskatchewan River Valley in Saskatoon, Canada. The framework is not case-specific and its main value is to provide an integrated approach to the ecological planning, design, and management of urban river greenways.

AB  - The tremendous abundance of labour in rural areas is one of the most perplexing issues currently facing policy-makers in the People's Republic of China. Central and municipal authorities fear that large-scale labour movement out of rural China will have politically and socially destabilising effects on the cities and towns to which workers migrate. Recognising that there may be positive economic aspects associated with rural labour outflow this research seeks to shed light on the transfer process with an emphasis on identifying,the factors which motivate the observed frequent movement of migrants between their origin and destination points. Using household data collected in rural China, we investigate both out migration and return migration decisions. We demonstrate that observed migration patterns are the outcome of informed, rational responses to an environment filled with uncertainty and incomplete markets. To the extent that policymakers wish to minimise the more transient component of rural out-migration, attention must be paid to the underlying rural and urban institutions which give rise to the observed migration patterns.

AB  - Within the southeastern region of Queensland, Australia, native forest cover (bushland) has been greatly reduced and fragmented, and clearing is still occurring. Many of the region's bird species are being increasingly restricted to isolated habitat remnants. However, little is known about the habitat value of these remnants and whether their value is influenced by their degree of connection. We investigated bird use of riparian corridors in pastoral and urban surroundings and riparian linear remnants within an urban context. We compared the avifauna of these remnants with dryland and riparian sites within continuous bushland. We also assessed their use by previously derived response-guilds of birds to bushland clearing. We counted 3567 individuals of 102 bird species. Riparian bushland supported more species and had greater bird abundances than dryland bushland. Corridors and linear remnants supported densities of many bushland-dependent species similar to those in bushland; this varied with species' patterns of large-scale migration and residency. Bushland-dependent winter migrants used both corridors and linear remnants extensively. Bushland-dependent residents were most abundant in continuous bushland and least abundant in linear remnants, possibly reflecting the constraints of central place foraging. Effects of isolation were only evident in resident bushland-dependent species. Local habitat variables were significantly associated with variation in abundance of some types of birds within corridors and linear remnants; however, the differences in bird abundances attributable to spatial characteristics were greater than those attributable to habitat characteristics. The effects of bushland fragmentation and isolation were mediated by the extent to which species are dependent upon bushland and their patterns of large-scale migration or residency. Local habitat, and possibly more importantly altitude, may influence site use by winter migrants and generalist species.

AB  - Up to now Carabus coriaceus, the largest carabid species in the Netherlands, was only known from the areas near the large rivers and the southern provinces of the country. In 1992 this species was also discovered near Steenwijkerwold and Oldeberkoop. Two years later an accurate inventory showed that this beetle occurs commonly in the surroundings of these small towns. Forest edges and open parts in the forest are the most preferred habitats of this species. Wet places are avoided. Only 2.2% of the beetles catched in a fenced circle on the border of a forest and a heathland were captured in the semicircle with heath, the rest in the semicircle in the forest. Carabus coriaceus uses linear landscape elements to disperse. The sex ratio (m/f) of the sampled populations was 2:1. In the circle no difference in activity was measured between m and f.

AB  - Little is known about the global molecular epidemiology of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We studied 51 clinical and environmental (pigeon excreta) isolates from two cities in Brazil (Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro) by analyzing their carbon assimilation patterns, electrophoretic karyotypes, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) with the C, neoformans repetitive element-1 (CNRE-1), and URA5 Sequences, Results were compared to those previously obtained for isolates from New York City by the same DNA typing methods, Computer-assisted analysis of RFLPs and contour-clamped homogeneous electrophoresis (CHEF) patterns and URA5 sequences was performed to generate dendrograms. Some environmental and clinical isolates were found to be indistinguishable by CHEF, CNRE-1 RFLP, and URA5 sequence analyses, Similarly, some isolates from Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte were indistinguishable by the three DNA typing techniques, Overall, Brazilian isolates appeared to be less heterogeneous by DNA analysis than isolates from other regions, Several Brazilian isolates were highly related to New York City isolates, Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained for the Brazilian isolates and those obtained for New York City isolates was congruent with the dendrogram generated from the CNRE-1 RFLP data, In summary our results indicate (i) that the discriminatory power of the DNA typing method differs for Brazilian and New York City strains, with the order being CNRE-1 RFLP analysis > URA5 sequence analysis > CHEF analysis and CHEF analysis > URA5 sequence analysis > CNRE-1 RFLP analysis, respectively; (ii) that there are differences in local genetic diversity for Brazilian and New York City isolates; (iii) that there is additional evidence linking clinical isolates to those in pigeon excreta; and (iv) that Some isolates from Brazil and New York City are closely related, consistent with the global dispersal of certain pathogenic strains.

AB  - The coastal lowlands of the Western Cape (CLWC) form part of the fynbos biome, an area renowned for its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The vegetation of the CLWC has been severely reduced and fragmented, and is currently impacted on by agricultural, pastoral, coastal resort and urban development, as well as alien plant spread. Furthermore, most of the vegetation communities are under-represented within existing protected areas. In response to this urgent need for increased conservation efforts, an initiative to establish a UNESCO-MAB biosphere reserve in the area has been launched. The aim of this project was to use biological criteria to identify areas that could potentially contain the core areas and buffer zones of a biosphere reserve. A reserve selection algorithm was chosen which provides a flexible tool for selecting representative areas for protection. The algorithm is a step-wise heuristic, which has rules for including mandatory polygons, forcing adjacency, including desirable (e.g. Red Data Book plant species) and excluding undesirable features (e.g. bisection by major roads). Farm boundaries (cadastral units) were used as selection units, resulting in a total of 1717 parcels. The selection process was conducted three times with target areas set at 10%, 25% and 50% of the original extent of each vegetation type within the study area. Areas of 62 834 ha, 121 199 ha and 242 397 ha, respectively, or 36% 49% and 76% of the available land in the study area being selected. It is recommended that the area identified as the 50% target area be considered the future site of core areas and buffer zones for the proposed biosphere reserve. The algorithm successfully maintained a high degree of connectivity between selected areas. This is important considering the high levels of plant beta diversity associated with edaphic gradients. Rather than presenting a definitive reserve system, this study provides a tool allowing biological criteria to be included explicitly within the negotiation process. As the biosphere reserve is assembled, priorities can be re-assessed.

AB  - We conducted 2 mark-recapture experiments in urban landscapes to examine the dispersal behavior of the eucalyptus longhorned borer, Phoracantha semipunctata (F.), a crepuscular beetle whose larvae bore into woody tissues of stressed or weakened eucalypts and fallen branches. Temporal changes in attractiveness of trees to beetles resulted in a correlation between beetle abundance and sample date, a mark-recapture study revealed that rates of beetle recapture declined with increasing air temperature, suggesting that beetles were less Likely to disperse long distances on cool evenings. Dispersal behavior was not influenced by body size of either sex; however, larger males were more likely to gain mates than were smaller males. Estimated population size averaged approximate to 328 beetles per night. In another mark-recapture experiment. P. semipunctata were captured on 6 piles of eucalypt logs, 3 positioned inside a eucalypt grove and 3 outside. Males captured on the outside log piles were larger than those captured inside, suggesting that larger males were more likely to disperse longer distances than smaller males. Low 24-h recapture rates (<35%) of adult P. semipunctata in both experiments suggested that P. semipunctata dispersed actively in urban landscapes. These beetles may show little site fidelity because they must alternately search for vigorous eucalypts in newer on which they feed and for stressed larval hosts that are unpredictably distributed in time and space.

AB  - Dispersal of Akodon azarae, the pampean grassland mouse, was studied during different phases of the annual cycle of population abundance in longitudinal habitats in agroecosystems. Dispersal rates were higher in the increasing and declining phases than at times of low and peak densities. The pattern of variation in dispersal rates may have been caused by both population dynamics and structure, as well by changes in habitat variables that influence rodent survival and reproduction. Low dispersal rates in spring were related to reproductive activity, which restricts females' movements and causes large movements of males within their home ranges. In autumn, with increasing density, dispersal should be a good strategy for individuals that did not gain access to vacant sites. In contrast, in early winter, when density is high and there are no vacant sites, the costs of dispersal (mortality and competition) are not compensated for by enhanced chances of reproduction. Finally, dispersal increases after the high mortality experienced by the population in winter, when individuals leave their home ranges, probably because of the impoverishment of the habitat during this period reported in earlier works. Dispersal plays a significant role in the population dynamics of A. azarae and contributes to the persistence of local populations through recolonization.

AB  - The invasion by non-native plant species of an urban remnant of a species-rich Themeda triandra grassland in southeastern Australia was quantified and related to abiotic influences. Richness and cover of non-native species were highest at the edges of the remnant and declined to relatively uniform levels within the remnant. Native species richness and cover were lowest at the edge adjoining a roadside but then showed little relation to distance from edge. Roadside edge quadrats were floristically distinct from most other quadrats when ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis.
   Soil phosphorus was significantly higher at the roadside edge but did not vary within the remnant itself. All other abiotic factors measured (NH4, NO3, S, pH and % organic carbon) showed little variation across the remnant. Non-native species richness and cover were strongly correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Native species were negatively correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Canonical Correspondence Analysis identified the perennial non-native grasses of high biomass as species most dependent on high soil nutrient levels. Such species may be resource-limited in undisturbed soils.
   Three classes of non-native plants have invaded this species-rich grassland. (1) generalist species (greater than or equal to 50 % frequency), mostly therophytes with non-specialized habitat or germination requirements; (2) resource-limited species comprising perennial species of high biomass that are dependent on nutrient increases and/or soil disturbances before they can invade the community and; (3) species of intermediate frequency (1-30 %), of low to high biomass potential, that appear to have non-specialized habitat requirements but are currently limited by seed dispersal, seedling establishment or the current site management. Native species richness and cover are most negatively affected by increases in non-native cover. Declines are largely evident once the non-native cover exceeds 40 %.
   Widespread, generalist non-native species are numerous in intact sites and will have to be considered a permanent part of the flora of remnant grasslands. Management must aim to minimize increases in cover of any non-native species or the disturbances that favour the establishment of competitive nonnative grasses if the native grassland flora is to be conserved in small, fragmented remnants.

TI  - Reconstruction and the self-help housing movement: The French experience
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The destruction during the Second World War made the city a crisis of looming proportions throughout Europe. In the case of France, over three-quarters of the country was struck by the war. Cities and towns were in ruins. Over 2 million buildings, a quarter of the housing stock, was destroyed or damaged (Croize, 1991, pp. 253-257). A million families were left homeless. Millions of others lived in temporary shelters and run-down apartments without access to basic services. This tragic situation made the housing crisis-that is finding a place of live-one of the most serious and explosive post-war domestic issues in France, as it was all over Europe. One way the crisis was addressed was far men and women to build their own homes, or to simply occupy vacant buildings. This paper looks at the role of the organised self-help housing movement within the massive effort of reconstruction and building after the Second World War, from 1945-1954. The movement comprised three phases: the squatter movement; the mouvement Castors or Beavers movement, which became a limited effort at auto-construction; and lastly, the housing campaign launched by the Abbe Pierre.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a field experiment to identify factors regulating local variations in population sizes of a common insectivore. A low density population of hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus was artificially increased in numbers while simultaneously a high density population was reduced. Subsequent dispersal, mortality and natality were monitored in complete censuses of the total populations, and compared to a control population of transplanted hedgehogs at unchanged density. Predation on hedgehogs was principally by badgers Meles meles which forage for substantially similar foods to hedgehogs, and was significantly higher in the expanded population during the first 2 wk after transplant than in the control, which nevertheless suffered a high overall mortality. Dispersal of male hedgehogs in particular from the expanded population contributed to reducing the density close to its original level within 1 month of transplant, after which the population remained relatively stable for a further 2 months of monitoring. Surviving hedgehogs at this site maintained closer proximity to residential buildings. which were avoided by badgers, than those at the control site, rates of weight gain by males were also superior to those in the control population. The artificially reduced population in an urban area containing no badgers was partially replenished within 1 month. through a decreased loss rate and an increased gain rate, initially of adults and later in the year of juveniles born after the transplant. The hedgehogs here showed seasonal variation in dispersion between fields, which were associated with the breeding cycle and the distribution of earthworm prey. Hedgehogs utilized mown grass fields in relation to the availability of earthworms Lumbricus spp., which was itself dependent on the age of fields. The study demonstrates that predation can influence the abundance of hedgehogs as well as their distribution in a heterogeneous environment. Residential and urban patches of land appear to represent a niche largely free from badger activity, where hedgehog populations maintain a high equilibrium density despite predation by domestic dogs which can contribute to a rapid population turn-over.

TI  - DISTRIBUTION AND DISPERSAL OF UROPHORA-CARDUI (DIPTERA, TEPHRITIDAE) IN FINLAND IN 1985-1991
T2  - ENTOMOLOGICA FENNICA
LA  - English
AB  - Urophora cardui (Linnaeus) was reported for the first time from Finland in 198 1, from the city of Helsinki. During the years 1985-1991 the distribution and dispersal of the species was monitored by searching for galls which the fly larvae cause on stems of the thistle Cirsium arvense. In 1986 galls were observed at a distance of 18-36 km from the center of Helsinki, and by 1991 the distance had increased to 37-55 km along the main roads. Annual dispersal of the fly was found to correlate strongly with the warmth of summers: after a cold summer the area occupied by the fly actually decreased, but in a warm summer new galls were found up to 16 km further from city center than the year before.

AB  - The activity patterns of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) living and breeding in urban areas of Oxford, and the interactions between individuals, were analysed from detailed radio-tracking data on 17 adults. Foxes were nocturnal and active during the night for a mean of 6 h 52 min +/- 10 min, irrespective of the time of year. The number of active/resting periods increased in autumn and winter, and in winter and spring the night was characteristically divided into several short cycles of activity of 2-2 1/2 h each, interspersed with similar periods of rest. The foxes occupied mutually exclusive group ranges and group members remained within 50 m of each other for up to one-third of the time spent active at night. The implications of fox spatial relationships for rabies transmission are discussed.

AB  - Network research about employment outcomes has rarely focused on women. In this paper, we use the Los Angeles Survey of Urban Inequality (LASUI) to examine the role of social networks on the constraints and opportunities which women face in labor force participation. We examine the effects of a woman's general network structure on her employment status, rather than focusing on the characteristics of the specific network tie that connected her to a job. Using an innovative, yet simple, measure to capture network diversity, we test network explanations of why women are in the paid labor force, controlling for background, structural, and family composition variables. In general, we find that the greater the quality and diversity of the social resources that are available through a woman's social network, the more likely she is to be working for pay. We also find evidence that suggests disadvantaged women with children must also rely on their social support networks for childcare to enter the labor market. In addition, we explore the connection between the methods successful job searchers used to find work and the overall structure of their networks through descriptive statistics.

AB  - Information circulation and availability have always been fundamental to the development of cities even when their employment base depended on manufacturing.  With the rise of the informational city, and the global economy, the creation and exchange of highly specialized information has become vital for a metropolitan center's success.  This paper, accordingly, examines the contemporary production and exchange of higher-order information that occurs among and between American cities and reveals how ongoing globalization has affected the position of these cities in the system of information exchange.  The paper introduces a conceptual framework combining processes of uncertainty, deregulation, globalization, demassification, and vertical disintegration and deploys that framework in an empirical analysis.  An analysis of 1990 flow data provided by Federal Express Corporation measures flows among 47 major U.S. centers and selected foreign places and reveals a three-tiered hierarchical system, with New York at the top.  Domestic information flows are modelled using a competing-destinations model.  The role of population size is paramount and the distance parameter is relatively weak.  Centers whose domestic information flows are underestimated by the competing-destinations model, e.g., New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Dallas, had large absolute volumes of international exports, whereas centers that are overpredicted had lower volumes, e.g., Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Rochester.  Using the expansion method, the distance exponent associated with domestic flows of information is found to vary with the level of international information movement in a positive and significant fashion.  Command-and-control and related producer services have continued to concentrate in select cities throughout the 1980s and to strengthen the hierarchical structure based on information flows.  The largest volume of international flows is destined for Europe (Brussels and London), Canada, and Asia (Hong Kong and Tokyo), with New York accounting for 36 percent of all international origins.

KW  - SHORE
AB  - The sublittoral benthic vegetation of the eastern Basque coast was studied along 55 km of coast. Information concerning the abundance of macrophytes and the physical environmental characteristics (type and slope of substratum, level of sedimentation, sediment nature and depth) was obtained from a network of 376 quadrats. The predominance of a habitat type (slightly sloping regular bedrock, little-moderate sand sedimentation levels and a depth range of 4-9 m) permits the development of a very homogeneous vegetation constituted mainly of Gelidium sesquipedale beds. Sedimentation, probably in relation to wave exposure, was the environmental factor showing the widest range of variation, and appeared to determine to the vegetation gradient detected by the correspondence analysis which shows algal distribution as a continuum. Along an increasing sedimentation gradient, the following trends have been detected: (1) Algal cover decrease due to the vertical layering reduction. (2) Changes in the relative abundance among species: Gelidium sesquipedale and Mesophyllum lichenoides were negatively associated with sediment; Pterosiphonia complanata and Cystoseira baccata were well adapted to sedimentation, showing an optimum development at moderate to high levels; Halopitys incurvus and Chondracanthus acicularis achieved their optimum development at high to very high sedimentation levels in shallow waters. (3) Vegetation heterogeneity, diversity and epiphytism increase. In addition, pollution, causing an increase of allochthonous sediments and turbidity, was the other environmental factor affecting the structure and composition of the vegetation. This fact was reflected by the presence of a residual Gelidium sesquipedale vegetation smothered by silt close to an urban effluent, and a vegetation of Cladostephus spongiosus - Chondria coerulescens - Pterosiphonia pennata in the vicinity of several ports. Multivariate analyses have proven to be a useful tool to detect marine vegetation structure, showing that in the study area discrete communities are not distinguishable.

AB  - This paper highlights the interrelatedness of gender and household organization in a central aspect of developmental change: rural-urban migration. It demonstrates the significance of intra-household dynamics for understanding the gender selectivity of population movement and shows in turn how this contributes to household diversity among low-income groups in both rural and urban areas. It also shows that although most women have little choice in determining decisions over their own or others' migration (or household arrangements), the "feminization" of household headship which so often results from demographic mobility is not necessarily negative for women. The paper concludes that governments and agencies could do more for gender equality by acknowledging the potentially transformative role olf interventions aimed not only at, but inside, households, and by adopting more flexible positions towards household diversity.

AB  - We determined polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in emergent mayflies (Hexagenia bilineata) from a 1250-km reach of the upper Mississippi River (UMR). Total PCB concentrations (sum of 125 congeners) ranged from 0.21 to 4.1 mu g/g of dry weight (1.2-29 mu g/g of lipid weight). Concentrations were highest in pools near the Twin Cities and the Quad Cities metropolitan areas. Longitudinal movement of PCBs was extensive downstream from the Twin Cities (175-320 km) but was not apparent downstream from the Quad Cities. The PCB composition of mayflies was relatively homogeneous throughout most of the river. However, the congener composition in mayflies from two distant locations differed markedly from the other samples and contained a greater abundance of lower molecular weight congeners. Recent PCB discharges from point and nonpoint sources may account for these differences. Emergent mayflies seem to be a useful indicator of PCB contamination of the UMR.

KW  - VELOCITY
AB  - Since about 1940, when they were first released in the New York City area, house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) have multiplied explosively and colonized much of eastern North America. We take advantage of the richly detailed documentation of this biological invasion to construct a mathematical model that predicts the rate of population spread on the basis of readily measurable demographic parameters. We seek to improve on previous models by predicting a rate of spread that accelerates following an initial period of slower growth, a pattern of spread followed by house finches as well as a variety of other invading species. We postulate that an Allee effect-disproportionately lowered fecundity below a critical threshold density of abundance-is the mechanism leading to a slower rate of spread in the early stages of the invasion. Our integrodifference equation model also emphasizes the link between long-distance dispersal and the rate of population spread.

Of 382 public events in police records for one year in a small U.S. city, 45% convey a message, 14% involve social conflict, and 13% are standard protest event forms. Local newspapers covered 32% of all events, favoring events that were large, involved conflict, were sponsored by business groups, and occurred in central locations. The more Liberal paper also favored rallies and events sponsored by national social movement organizations (SMOs) or recreational groups. Discussion centers on the ways these factors shape the content of the public sphere.

AB  - With a simple model, I show that comparisons of invasibility between legions are impossible to make unless one can control for all of the variables besides invasibility that influence exotic richness, including the rates of immigration of species and the characteristics of the invading species themselves. Using data from the literature for 184 sites around the world, I found that nature reserves had one-half of the exotic fraction of sites outside reserves, and island sites had nearly three: times the exotic fraction of mainland sites. However, the exotic fraction and the number of exotics were also dependent on site area, and this had to be taken into account to make valid comparisons between sites. The number of native species was used as a surrogate fur site area and habitat diversity. Nearly 70% of the variation in the number of exotic species was accounted for by a multiple regression containing the following predictors: the number of native species, whether the site was an island or on the mainland, and whether or not it was a nature reserve.
   After controlling for scale, there were significant differences among biomes, but not continents in their level of invasion. Multiple biome regions and temperate agricultural or urban sites were among the most invaded biomes, and deserts and savannas were among the least. However, there was considerable within-group variation in the mean degree of invasion. Scale-controlled analysis also showed that the New World is significantly more invaded than the Old World, but only when sire native richness (probably a surrogate fur habitat diversity) is factored our. Contrary to expectation, communities richer in native species had more, not fewer, exotics. For mainland sites, the degree of invasion increased with latitude, but there was no such relationship for islands. Although islands are more invaded than mainland sites, this is apparently not because of low native species richness, as the islands in this data set were no less rich in native species than were mainland sites of similar area. The number of exotic species in nature reserves increases with the number of visitors. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about relative invasibility, invasion potential, or the roles of dispersal and disturbance from any of these results. Most of the observed patterns here and in the literature could potentially be explained by differences between regions in species properties, ecosystem properties, or propagule pressure.

AB  - A regional survey of the forests in north-eastern New South Wales recorded eight species of nocturnal forest birds and nine species of arboreal marsupials from 291 sites. These forests are an important source of diversity for nocturnal bird and mammal species compared with the two other regions in south-eastern Australia (south-eastern New South Wales and the Central Highlands of Victoria) where similar studies have been undertaken.
   Three major environmental gradients accounting for the distribution of these species in north-eastern New South Wales were identified. The dominant gradient contrasted higher-elevation forests in the western half of the region with lower-elevation forests nearer the coast. The second gradient contrasted wet forest types having a dense mesic understorey with dry forest types having an open or sparse understorey. The third gradient represented logging intensity. Characteristic assemblages of species were associated with each end of these three gradients. A core group of species occurred across a wide range of environmental conditions, including logged and unlogged forest.
   Most species occurred with similar frequency in logged and unlogged forest. However, limitations in the design of this study, which reflect regional land-use patterns, restrict the untangling of interactions between forest type, elevation and management history. The more disturbed, lower-elevation forests appeared to be the most species-rich environments but the greatest numbers of animals were recorded in the highland forests of the region. The greater glider (Petauroides volans), whose stronghold is the higher-elevation forests, was identified as the species most sensitive to heavy logging, although numbers of this species were similar in selectively logged and unlogged forests.
   Many of the species recorded in this study are known to use hollows in large old trees for breeding and diurnal shelter. Management attention needs to be directed towards establishing the threshold levels of retention for hollow-bearing trees and for patches of undisturbed vegetation. The establishment of a comprehensive network of retained undisturbed vegetation along most gully systems in the region would seem to be a prudent course of action to maintain biological diversity. As more of the landscape in the region becomes altered by intensive logging or clearing for agricultural and urban land uses, it will be necessary to carefully plan and refine management prescriptions to maintain wildlife habitat components.

AB  - 1. Observations on the behaviour and movements of 11 foxes from seven neighbouring groups in an urban area of Bristol were combined with post-mortem data on levels of bite wounding throughout the entire Bristol fox population to quantify the importance of encounters in the maintenance of group cohesion and territory, and to address the social subordination hypothesis (Christian 1970) regarding dispersal behaviour.
   2. Inter-group encounters were uncommon and almost always aggressive, and occurred significantly more often in the winter months, when resident males trespassed into neighbouring ranges. Each fox had on average 0.77 inter-group encounters each day in winter, compared with 0.05 0.23 in spring, summer and autumn.
   3. Foxes from neighbouring groups practised avoidance at close quarters, which suggests that direct encounters are a relatively unimportant means of territory defence.
   4. Intra-group encounters were predominantly non-aggressive and constant in frequency throughout the year. A daily average of 2.08 intra-group encounters was recorded for each individual. Radio-collared adults rarely lay up together during the day.
   5. Foxes from mated pairs came within 50 m of each other with a significantly greater frequency than was predicted from a simulation model based on statistical distributions formed by real movement parameters. This suggests that direct encounters are important in intra-group communication.
   6. The highest incidence of fresh bite wounds on adult males occurred in winter and spring, coincident with the dispersal and mating periods. Total fighting injuries on animals in their first year also increased in the dispersal period from a low level in the summer. These observations are consistent with the predictions of the social subordination hypothesis.

AB  - We tested whether dispersal of juvenile lemmings occurs at high population densities and whether predation risk affects movements of juveniles. The study was conducted in July and August 1996 on the Kent Peninsula, Northwest Territories, during a peak in the lemming cycle. We fitted 43 juvenile collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) of the summer generations on a control plot and a predator-exclosure plot with radio transmitters and examined their home ranges and movement patterns We tested the following hypotheses: (i) extensive juvenile dispersal will occur at high population densities, (ii) male juveniles will move greater distances than females, and (iii) juveniles will move greater distances in the absence of predators. We rejected all these hypotheses. All juvenile collared lemmings remained in the vicinity of their original home ranges. Home-range sizes of all juveniles were similar, the mean size being 100 m(2). Mean and maximum distances moved were similar among all juveniles. However, juveniles moved less frequently on the control plot than on the exclosure plot. Juvenile collared lemmings do not disperse at high densities. The lack of dispersal may have been the result of avoidance of confrontations with other lemmings, and may also have been related to delayed breeding, since most juveniles and subadults did not mature in late summer. Differential predation risk or predation mortality may have had no effect on the distances moved by juveniles or may have been masked by strong density effects on both plots.

AB  - This article examines the different failure modes of concrete sidewalks through an extensive field survey of sidewalk inventories in major cities in the Canadian Prairies. The major form of sidewalk damage is longitudinal cracks. There was no correlation of either the liquid limit or the plastic limit of the soil beneath the sidewalk with the type of sidewalk damage observed in each city. However, the extent of longitudinal sidewalk damage increases when the sidewalks are founded on soils with high plasticity index. Two failure modes (hogging and sagging) are closely examined through the analysis of observed vertical surface movements to explain the occurrence of longitudinal cracks. It is concluded that the rigid body movements (both uniform vertical movement and tilt) are mainly a consequence of frost penetration beneath the sidewalk. Uniform vertical movement is not very sensitive to moisture changes in the soil underneath the sidewalk. The dominant mode of deformation for sidewalks is bogging. The seasonal temperatures have considerable impact on the interaction of the sidewalk with the underlying soil, but an indirect estimate of the flexural strain or differential movement ratio is not sufficient to determine if they are large enough to exceed the tensile strain of concrete.

KW  - WOMEN
AB  - Analyses of gender and space have been brought short by our awareness of the sterility of the familiar public-private binary, our difficulty gaining purchase upon local spatial practices through feminist abstractions insisting upon the importance of global 'location' and our growing realization that women are often implicated in the very gender ideologies that constrain them. In this paper, focusing upon historical changes in Muslim women's access to and occupation of different kinds of space in the Sahelian city of Maradi, Niger, the author shifts attention away from the spaces themselves and towards women's active movement through and transformation of the spaces of the body, the home, and the city. Women define themselves, their social status, and their economic possibilities by acquiring and transforming what the author calls 'internal spaces' and by entering into previously inaccessible 'external spaces'. More concretely, they locate themselves socially and economically through the decoration of their rooms in their marital homes, through the acquisition of urban property, and through the adoption of veiling. By renegotiating their spatial position women reconfigure their economic and social options. In so doing they subtly and unconsciously alter the character of the urban terrain, the nature of local marriage, and the configuration of local gender relations. Women's attempts to reposition themselves have had complex and contradictory implications. They nevertheless make clear that gender analyses fixing upon reified spaces or scales are inadequate and that common Western assumptions about Muslim women's experience of internal spaces and veiling need to be rethought.

AB  - This study documents the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a well known invader of urban and agricultural ecosystems, in a riparian corridor near San Luis Obispo, California. Sampling of the ant community was done using pitfall traps placed along transects that crossed three vegetation types found at the study site: (1) riparian woodland dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and willow (Salix: spp.) (2) Hard chaparral dominated by scrub oak (Q. dumosa) and silk-tassel bush (Garrya sl.) (3) Coastal scrub dominated by black sage (Salvia mellifera), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and Yucca (Yucca whipplei). Linepithema humile has become well established throughout the lower reaches of the study site except in the chaparral vegetation. Ten species of native ants were found in the study area, but there was little to no correlation or cooccurrence between L. humile and native ant species. Total species diversity in areas where L. humile occurred was significantly less than in areas where L. humile was absent. These results suggest that invasion by L. humile is restricted by habitat type, and has significant negative impacts on native ant diversity.

LA  - English
AB  - In this paper I apply aspects of sociospatial theory to the revolutionary context of urban Nepal during the democratic uprisings of 1990.  The urban spaces of Kathmandu and Patan were two of the most important sites within which power was contested, and terrains upon which space itself was contested.  As I will show, the location of struggle emerged from conscious movement choices (as to tactics, efficacy of mobilization, etc) and influenced the character of collective action.  An analysis of the spatial mediation of social movement agency provides us with what I term the 'terrain of resistance'-the specific geographical, historical, political, economic, ecological, and cultural context of movement agency.  Such analysis can provide us with important insights into why movements occur where they do, the spatiocultural specificity of movement practice, and the language by which people articulate their discontent, understood through the 'cultural expressions of resistance'.

AB  - Prevention approaches for reproductive health have evolved from an emphasis on individually focused models of behavior change to a recognition that risk reduction occurs within a context of social norms. Prevention programs can be improved by understanding how social structure influences sexual behavior and using that understanding to develop strategies for positive change. In a dynamic, urban context, communities are better conceptualized as informal networks of ties. These network structures may help to protect, or conversely, expose members to reproductive risk behaviors. Using data from a study of social and sexual networks conducted in northern Thailand, this article describes partner relations and social structure in the modern, urban context, and illustrates the links between individual, relational and structural properties and reproductive risk behaviors. Triangulation of ethnographic, survey and social network data collection and analytic tools provide an opportunity to interpret individual behaviors, meanings of relationships and struct ural properties of networks. Intervention approaches should build on existing networks, and address the complex meanings of romantic and sexual partnerships. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - River corridor landscapes in the Great Plains of North America have been transformed by human activities, including land clearing for agriculture, channelization for navigation, and the building of bridges, cities, and reservoirs. Modification of streamflow, a key process in determining floodplain structure and function, has had serious consequences. Flow regulation by dams and water diversions has altered floodplain biodiversity and the composition and structure of floodplain vegetation. Data from the Platte and Missouri rivers indicate that rivers respond differently to regulation. Populus forest has expanded rapidly into Platte River channels, while it has failed to regenerate in gaps between reservoirs along the upper Missouri River, This divergent response is the result of different geomorphologies and water use patterns. The Platte River is a braided stream with a significant portion of its flow diverted for cropland irrigation. The Missouri is a meandering stream with low irrigation usage. Restoration of these corridor landscapes will require contrasting methods.

AB  - As pan of ongoing cooperation between the City of Phoenix and Arizona State University, a charrette was organized. Planners, landscape architects, environmental scientists, and architects explored concepts for development within a 110-square-mile (285km(2)) portion of Phoenix. The charrette was the summation of over a year of environment studies of the planning area. This part of northern Phoenix occupies a largely undeveloped upper Sonoran desert landscape experiencing intense development pressure. Four charrette teams addressed desert preservation, rural desert development, suburban desert development, and growth corridors. This article focuses on some of the strategies proposed by the suburban desert development team. One of these called for an alternative pattern of development aligned with natural drainage corridors. Several concepts from the charrette and findings from the environmental research were adopted by the City in the revised general plan for the area.

AB  - The rehabilitation of urban stream channels and riparian areas involves a potentially large number of design alternatives. When substantial modifications are planned, water surface profile models (e.g., HEC-2) provide a means for a thorough and efficient evaluation of many design variations. The rehabilitation of a reach of Paradise Creek, Idaho, utilized the HEC-2 model to verify the appropriateness of a new channel geometry and explore the consequences of variable floodplain geometries and excavation depths. The desirability of habitat diversity, coupled with the constraints of minimized earthwork costs and adequate flow capacity, framed the floodplain design question. The final design geometry was iteratively approached using the HEC-2 model to mimic the existing channel capacity. This modeling framework produces as output computed water surface elevations for the design channel and floodplain under any discharge. Hence, the method provides the means for demonstrating that rehabilitation designs will (or will not) cause increases in flood elevations, an assessment that is generally required for project approval.

CP  - Conference on Transportation, Land Use, and Air Quality
AB  - Exposure to air pollution has become an exceedingly inescapable part of urban living. The presence of pollutants in urban air is reported to cause adverse effects on human health, as as damage to structures and materials. Their presence can also be an aesthetic nuisance around urban centres.
   Modelling of urban air pollution is an important facet of pollution control and abatement. Models explain the occurrence, Intensity, and movement of pollutants. Current techniques used for modelling urban air pollution use dispersion characteristics to predict pollutant levels at locations away from defined sources. They work well in relatively simple situations with few sources in consideration. However, these models cannot handle the mathematics in an airshed with many point and non-point sources of urban air pollutants, This is because many simplifying assumptions have to be made, which limit the accuracy of predictions.
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling is a technique that offers many advantages in modelling non-linear type processes Such as those that govern complex urban air pollution situations. This technique uses historical data sets and can recognize the patterns that occur between different pollutants the urban airshed. ANN modelling is a "black-box" method, where equations describing the complex situations are not known or required. The model simply extrapolates patterns, and "learns" based on historical data, much the same,way: the human mind learns. Therefore, ANN may be suitable for air pollution modelling of situations where the governing equations are too complex or expensive to derive. This paper describes the use of ANN to predict behavior of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within a defined region of the City of Edmonton, Alberta.

AB  - Extending the microfoundations of the neoinstitutionalist approach to change, this paper examines the role of institutional entrepreneurs in creating the juvenile court al the turn of the century. Previous work suggests that the court established by Chicago activists became the prototype for other cities and slates. We argue that the juvenile court's founding period exhibited considerable diversity, and we highlight Judge Ben B. Lindsey's institution building efforts in Denver, Colorado. Lindsey's project is contrasted to the Chicago court; particular attention is given to Lindsey's constitution of the delinquent subject, his call for a highly differentiated juvenile court, and his expansive conception of the court's responsibilities. This initial diversity subsequently gave way to a more uniform court, and we briefly discuss the dynamics fueling this convergence.

LA  - English
AB  - Birch pollen concentrations recorded by volumetric sampling for a three year period on the rural Baltic island, Gotland, are presented and compared with the birch pollen records for the same period in Stockholm.  Since the incidence of birch pollen allergy among the farmers on the island was found to be lower than on the mainland it was generally believed that the airborne birch pollen concentration on Gotland was relatively low.  Although birch is only scattered on the island, the Betula pollen concentrations in the years investigated appear to be as high as or higher than those in Stockholm, where birch is one of the main elements of the urban vegetation.  The reasons for the abundance of birch pollen in the air of Gotland in relation to the low figure of sensitisation to birch pollen are discussed.

AB  - The relationship between fleshy-fruited indigenous species and adventive weeds in the diet of 500 mist-netted birds was studied in forest remnants of differing size and degree of modification. Fruit abundance peaked in March and April, and most fruit was either red/orange or purple/black. The physical parameters of adventive and indigenous fruits were not significantly different. Six of the 15 passerine species netted are frugivores, and of those netted 77% had eaten fruit. They were divisible into three groups: endemic (bellbirds, Anthornis melanura; tuis, Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), non-endemic but indigenous (silvereyes, Zosterops lateralis), and adventive (blackbirds, Turdus merula; song thrushes, T. philomelos; starlings, Sturnus vulgaris).
   Bird diets varied between the groups and according to fruit availability as determined by sires and seasons. Endemic birds ate the least adventive fruit; bellbirds ate mainly Podocarpus hallii and Coprosma robusta fruits at all sites. Tuis had a varied diet, including some adventive fruits. Silvereyes ate the widest range of indigenous and adventive fruits. Blackbirds and, to a smaller extent, song thrushes ate many of the same indigenous fruits as the other bird groups, but their diet included more adventive fruits, e.g., Berberis glaucocarpa. Starlings were caught only when they fed on Sambucus nigra, but they also ate a few indigenous fruits. There was little seasonal variation in bird numbers caught. Adventive species extended the seasonal availability of fruits into winter, particularly in the forest remnant closest to a town, which had the highest proportion of adventive fruits.
   Several weed species distributed mainly by non-endemic and adventive birds are forming new secondary vegetation. Some have large fruit crops which generally offer little food for endemic birds. Where fruiting weeds pre-empt sites that may have been occupied by native species, they create an inferior habitat for endemic birds. However, the non-endemic and adventive birds also disperse indigenous fruits into early successional vegetation, and the importance of their seed rain for conservation of biodiversity will therefore depend on the site.

AB  - Theory: The adoption of local gay rights ordinances and policies is approached from two bread theoretical frameworks-the urbanism/diversity approach and alternative perspectives rooted in social movement theory.
   Hypotheses: The adoption of gay rights ordinances/policies is a function of: (1) the level of urbanization and social diversity; (2) the social and political resources of the gay and lesbian population; (3) the political opportunity structure in the community; and (4) the balance between traditionalist and liberal religious groups.
   Method: Multivariate logistic regression analysis is used on a data set comprising 126 cities and counties with gay rights ordinances/policies and 125 localities chosen at random.
   Results: Consistent with urbanism theory, population size is the single largest factor differentiating the two types of communities. In addition to urbanism, the prospects for including sexual orientation as a protected category are influenced by the extent of political and organizational mobilization among the gay and lesbian community, the political opportunity structure in the locality, and the presence of morally-traditional religious groups. These findings reinforce the value of incorporating cultural themes and social movement theory in the study of policy outcomes.

AB  - In 1987-1988 seasonal dynamics, species composition and the mutual interaction of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the system of six self-purification reservoirs of the sewage treatment plant of the town Skalica (West Slovakia) were monitored.  During movement through the system, the wastewater self-purification process gradually resulted in the change of water quality.  Following differences of plankton association in the reservoirs were found:  1.  The N1-N2 reservoirs, the closest to the tributary from the sewage treatment plant, were characterized by a low diversity of plankton association and extremely high values of chlorophyll a in the spring (2.576 mug.1(-1)) (Fig. 3).  In phytoplankton Euglenophyta predominated.  In net zooplankton Rotatoria with a high abundance prevailed at the beginning of the vegetation period.  Cladocera and Copepoda were less frequent, therefore the zooplankton biomass reached low values.  2.  In the N3-N4 reservoirs with partly pre-purified water the plankton association was more abundant.  Contrary to the first two reservoirs, Cyanophyta and particularly Chlorophyta occurred.  Chlorophyll a values in spring were high, in autumn they markedly decreased and remained low till the end of the vegetation period.  Net zooplankton achieved the highest species diversity of different groups.  Cladocera dominated and together with Copepoda contributed a great deal to the increase of zooplankton biomass.  Rotatoria abundance was higher in the spring time only.  3.  The N5-N6 reservoirs with fish culture represented a typical fish pond plankton assemblage.  All groups of Cyanophyta and Algae with most abundant Chlorococcales were present in phytoplankton.  The values of chlorophyll a remained even during the whole vegetation period, with a maximum in spring and autumn.  Net zooplankton species diversity was rather poor.  Rotatoria and Copepoda were dominating species.  In Cladocera only small species, which resisted the predatory pressure of fish, occurred.  Biomass values were low when compared to abundance.  The development of phytoplankton was negatively influenced by three main factors:  shading by duckweed (Lemna), consumption by Cladocera, and lower availability of nutrients caused by their uptake by filamentous algae and macrophytes.  The values of chlorophyll a in the year 1988 decreased when compared with the preceding year.

KW  - UNDERCLASS
AB  - For almost ten years there has been growing concern about the concentration of poverty among African-Americans living in the inner cities of America's metropolitan areas. Along with this concern a debate has emerged between Douglas Massey and co-authors, and William Julius Wilson as to what the root cause of this concentration is, as well as its impact on the African-American community. Most of the evidence directed toward answering these questions has come from the analysis of large data sets; With data from a five-year ethnographic study of three inner-city areas in Los Angeles, New York and Detroit, this paper presents evidence of how the dynamic associated with the increasing trend toward concentration gets worked out in everyday life. It demonstrates that the process of concentration is more complicated than simply the job loss explanation advanced by Wilson, or segregation effects argued by Massey et al. Further, it provides evidence that while social isolation does occur as a result of the concentration dynamic, it is the isolation from the working class (as opposed to the middle class) that has the most profound negative impact on the poor. Finally, the paper provides evidence that as social isolation has increased between the African-American poor and the other social strata within the African-American community, it has not precipitated generalized feelings of hopelessness among the poor as Wilson and Massey suggest.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH

AB  - This paper analyses the historical movement of the formation of capitalist housing production in the city of Rio de Janeiro.  Using the concept of form of production, the author identifies three major stages:  a long period in which land ownership predominated in productive relations, followed by a transition period in which small capital organized simple housing production, and a third period in which real estate incorporation capital emerged. Each form of production left its mark on the constructed space, in the architectural types and the occupation of urban space. The discussion proposed in the article centres on the impasses, obstacles and instability in the establishment and spread of relations in capitalist housing production, as consequences of the very contradictions inherent in the reproduction of capital in this sector.

T2  - MEDITERRANEAN PEOPLES IN TRANSITION: THIRTEENTH TO EARLY TENTH CENTURIES BCE
LA  - English
CP  - International Symposium on Mediterranean Peoples in Transition - 13th to Early 10th Centuries BCE
AB  - Newly-excavated material and an analysis of the data from the previously excavated royal palace (in particular Area AA) now present a better picture of the last Canaanite city at Megiddo (Stratum VIIA). This was the most prosperous Canaanite city and probably served as headquarters for the Egyptian 20th Dynasty in Canaan. The city met its demise in a violent destruction which, on the basis of the material evidence, could not have occurred before ca. 1130 BCE. The strategic position of Megiddo near the main highway running the length of the country and the difficulties inherent in the alternative coastal road near Mt. Carmel suggest firm Egyptian and Canaanite control of all substantial commercial or military movement from the north to southern Canaan prior to ca. 1130 BCE. The above conclusion also indicates that the land battle with the Sea Peoples reported by Ramses III took place to the north of Megiddo and that any substantial immigration of the Sea Peoples to the regions south of Mt. Carmel apparently took place after ca. 1130 BCE. Hence, all settlements and material remains attributed to the Philistines, such as monochrome and bichrome Philistine pottery, must be dated to the last quarter of the 12th century BCE or later. This corresponds with what we know from Lachish, where the last prosperous Egyptian-oriented Canaanite city (Level VI) was violently destroyed not earlier than the mid-12th century BCE or shortly thereafter. The absence of Philistine remains at Lachish apparently indicates that Philistine settlement on the coastal plain occurred at a later date. The similar pattern at the last Canaanite city of Megiddo and at Lachish is of much interest. It seems possible that both cities were destroyed by the Sea Peoples, who brought about the collapse of the Egyptian domination of the country, paving the way for their settlement activity on the coastal plain.

AB  - In southern Ontario Glossy Buckthorn, Rhamnus frangula, became established in three urban centres, London, Ottawa and Guelph, at the turn of the century.  By 1930, it had still only been found in these three urban centres, and by 1950 it had not extended beyond 40 km from any of them.  By 1970, it had spread to sites up to 150 km distant but still appeared to have a sparse and largely urban distribution in the southern part of the province.  Currently Rhamnus frangula occurs throughout much of southern Ontario and is locally common.  In some sites it comprises more than 90% of the green biomass over areas of several acres and it has become a major component of regionally and provincially significant plant communities.  Berries of Rhamnus frangula are eaten by American Robins, Bohemian Waxwings, Cedar Waxwings, Rose-breasted Grosbeaks and Starlings.  The shrub probably has a number of different avian and mammalian dispersal agents.  Over the next 10-20 years, it is expected that R. frangula will become abundant and dominant in open and semi-open wetlands over most of the southern part of the province.  While small scale management technology is available, the problem is one that requires a consideration of management on a large scale.

AB  - Two discourses inform the discussion of teacher participation: one is administrative, the other participatory; the first is dominant, whereas the latter is incipient. This article applies a critical perspective to review the administrative discourse, surfacing issues it fails to address and suggesting alternatives that lead us down the critical path. The administrative discourse draws from theories of human relations management culture, and community building, obscuring hierarchies and power differences. In urban settings, the hierarchies that need to be addressed exist not only within the system and school, but between the school and the neighborhood The alternative, participatory discourse must expand and deepen the concept and practice of democratic participation, addressing not only teachers bur students, communities, and system change. Drawing insights from the literature on worker democracy, feminism, new movements, and critical educational theory, the article presents the main issues that need to be addressed to apply teacher participation to urban educational reform These include extending the scope of participation, creating new structures, building supports and networks, and promoting democratic communities across diversity.

AB  - The mobilization of the countryside has direct consequences for political discourse about national values and in times of social crisis, the 'conservatism' of the countryside has the potential to assume an aggressive, offensive posture. When rural mobilization is accompanied by religious revival, group loyalty and so-called 'traditional' values are sacralized. When rural mobilization, ethnic mobilization, and religious revival occur simultaneously, it signifies that the society is undergoing profound destabilization. Examining the case of Serbia, this article argues that while Serbia is, in cultural and social terms, predominantly rural in character, Titoist Communism imposed the values of the city on that culture, while the 1987 coup by Slobodan Milosevic represented, among other things, the triumph of the countryside over the city in Serbia.
   This article begins by characterizing the countryside in cultural terms, provides documentation of the importance of rural traditions in Serbian society, documents the rural character of the Serbian national movement, connecting its ideology and behaviour with populist appeals, and examines the contribution made by the Serbian Orthodox Church to the mobilization of the Serbian countryside.

Results of an investigation concerning questions of population structure, habitat preferences and dispersal on goods stations in Mainz and Frankfurt/M., Germany, are shown. 400 individuals of Oedipoda caerulescens L. (Saltatoria: Acrididae), and Sphingonotus caerulans L. (Saltatoria: Acrididae) were marked. Both species occur on the same habitats, on thinly scattered vegetation and open ground, no significant difference between chosen habitats could be detected. The mobility of the males was in both species distinctly higher than the mobility of the females. The highest migration distance was 210 m in two days, observed on a female of S. caerulans. Both species were dominant on both areas, whereas common Caelifera and Ensifera represent only a small percentage of the total counting.

KW  - BIRTH
AB  - This study compares the growth and maturity status of Sereer girls (Senegal) temporarily migrating to an urban setting during the dry season to work as maids in the capital city, Dakar, with girls remaining in rural communities. A total of 343 girls, aged 12.5-14.5 were surveyed: 222 lived year-round in several villages (sedentes) and 121 girls worked in Dakar for 8 months of the year (migrants). All girls were born and reared under the same conditions and in the same rural communities in Senegal. Growth and nutritional status were assessed with anthropometry, and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Sexual maturation was assessed by stage of breast development and occurrence of menarche. A questionnaire on housing conditions, food consumption patterns, nature of work, health status, and reasons for leaving the villages was administered to 57 urban girls. Overall, the girls were small relative to NCHS/WHO reference values: 30-40% were lower than -2 z-scores of age-specific medians. They also had less subcutaneous fat. Only nine girls had attained menarche and 30% were prepubertal in breast development. The migrants had a significantly higher body mass and BMI and thicker skinfolds than sedentes, but there was no difference in stature. The migrants were also more sexually mature than the sedentes, Comparison of anthropometric status 2 years before migration, in 1995, showed no differences between migrant and sedentes girls. Within migrant girls, those with two or more stays in Dakar were taller and heavier than newcomers. These results suggest that seasonal movement to the city results in improved nutritional status, as reflected in larger body mass and increased fatness. These factors appear to be associated with better living conditions in the city. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - 1. Contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals determine how fast a disease will spread. However, they are difficult to measure in the wild, and most models of disease spread have been forced to use estimated or derived values.
   2. In this paper, a mathematical relationship between fox home range size and population density is derived from the literature and combined with behavioural data on movement patterns and encounters from urban Bristol, UK to formulate a predictive model of intergroup contact probabilities over a range of population densities.
   3. This contact probability-population density relationship is used to formulate a revised version of the rabies model of Smith & Harris (1991), which is the model used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the basis of its rabies control policy for an outbreak of the disease in an urban area of Britain.
   4. The original and revised versions of the model are compared in terms of their predictions for the rate of rabies spread and their implications for rabies control in specific urban areas.
   5. An equivalent probability of successful rabies control is achieved by 5-15% lower fox control for the revised model compared with the original one. The greatest differences between the probability of successful rabies control for a given level of fox control under the two versions of the model occur in winter.
   6. The revised model predicts that the rate of rabies spread will be slower than predicted by the original model. This is due to the lower inter-group contact probabilities used in the revised model, Thus, there will be a greater chance of containment and elimination of the disease within a specified control area than was suggested by the original model.
   7. The heterogeneous nature of the urban landscape probably results in a lower frequency of contacts than would be observed between foxes living at the same densities in rural environments.

AB  - Despite the fact that indigenous Australians are known to be frequently mobile over the short term, statistical information regarding this population movement is grossly deficient. This has implications for the efficient and equitable delivery of services because such mobility impacts on the level and composition of service demand over time and space. This paper examines various means by which short-term population movement can be quantified to yield aggregate indicators of demographic impact. First, census data are used to establish the rate and pattern of inter-regional, short-term displacement. This reveals regional urban centres as net recipients of temporary residents while most rural areas experience temporary absenteeism. Secondly, results from household surveys are reported stressing the importance of including visitors to households in the estimation of service populations. Thirdly, administrative data on occupancy in urban hostels are used to derive indicators of the duration of movement. In conclusion, a number of policy and research implications are examined.

AB  - The dispersal of free-ranging dogs, Canis familiaris, from the town of Katwa, West Bengal, India, was studied from January 1993 to December 1996. Between January 1993 and September 1996, 315 pups were observed from 64 litters. Pups were born between October and March each year, with a peak between November and January. The mortality rate was 68% during the first 4 months, with 102 individuals surviving to the juvenile stage (4 to 12 months). In case of juveniles, the rate of dispersal was 39.29%, whereas, in case of adults it was 23.33%. Mean (+/-S.D.) home range size for the non-dispersing dogs was 4.8 (+/-1.7) ha and for the dispersing dogs was 8.4 (+/-1.7) ha. Moreover, there were significant seasonal variations in the home range sizes of both non-dispersing and dispersing dogs. Juvenile males were the predominant dispersers. Dispersal occurred in all seasons and dispersal rates did not differ between seasons. However, during late monsoon (September to November), dispersal was greater (P < 0.05) among males than females. The mean (+/-S.D.) dispersal distance of 1.702 (+/-0.425) km was relatively small, and did not differ between males and females. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Non profit incorporation among movements of the poor: Pathways and consequences for homeless social movement organizations
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - Social movement scholars have begun to note the widespread use of nonprofit incorporation by social movement organizations (SMOs) in the United States. They argue that nonprofit incorporation is a voluntary act that ultimately leads to moderation in goals and tactics. I examine this argument with ethnographic data on fifteen homeless SMOs that operated in eight U.S. cities. I identify six pathways to adoption or nonadoption of nonprofit form and find that moderation, when it occurs, is not a function of nonprofit incorporation per se but of the particular pathway by which an SMO came to adopt nonprofit form. I discuss the implications of these findings for SMOs in general and for understanding the broader debates about organizational autonomy and external control of SMOs.

CP  - Conference 29 of the International-Erosion-Control-Association on Winning Solutions for Risky Problems
AB  - Portland's Brookside Wetland and Stream Enhancement project is intended to exemplify a multi-objective approach to urban stream corridor management by providing numerous environmental benefits on one site. These include improvements such as augmented flood storage (the overriding objective of the project), streambank erosion control, and improved habitat conditions for fish.
   This paper focuses on the rehabilitation efforts undertaken along the approximately 0.8 kilometers (1/2 mile) of Johnson Creek traversing the project site. Before rehabilitation, the meandering channel was entrenched into a generally level floodplain as much as 4.5 meters (15 feet) and had rapidly eroding banks in many places. The channel also provided relatively limited habitat opportunities for salmonid fishes (which survive in small numbers in the creek), for which most inchannel habitat rehabilitation work was targeted.
   An important aspect of the project was the regrading of oversteepened channel banks to a lower, stable angle. Established streamside trees were preserved wherever possible and many additional riparian trees and shrubs will be planted this year and in 1998. Since soils are highly erodible, regraded channel banks were lined with coir matting to protect them until herbaceous vegetation can take hold. Biotechnical bank stabilization along eroding outer bend banks relied on vegetated geogrid treatments. These were constructed over a hardened bank toe comprised of large boulders and interspersed root wads. A unique bank cover/log crib revetment was also installed along a constructed channel cutoff. This provides a long section of artificial undercut bank, an extremely valuable type of fish habitat. Other improvements to fish habitat included the placement of large woody debris and boulders in the low-flow channel. All treatments will enhance channel complexity, providing both winter and summer holding habitat for fish.
   Excavation, grading, and the construction of streambank stabilization and instream habitat structures occurred during the summer of 1997. The author's experience in providing construction oversight highlighted a number of issues pertaining to the on-the-ground implementation of the project. Some of these are discussed in this paper.

LA  - English
KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - This article traces the development of the visiting teacher movement, from 1906 to 1940, with particular attention paid to the disjuncture between professional discourse and actual practices. Three main points are argued. First, early visiting teacher work drew from multiple sources, including social settlements, juvenile courts, private philanthropies, and women's clubs. The discussion of the origins of visiting teachers in multiple urban settings attested to the diversity of their work in communities and in schools. Second most visiting teachers' work remained essentially unchanged, despite their later participation in child guidance clinics. Even though visiting teachers worked in conjunction with psychiatrists and psychologists, their practices still relied upon traditional approaches used in the first part of the century. Third, the medical and psychiatric discourses surrounding visiting teacher work in the 1920s and 1930s assumed a powerful life of its own. In a most curious manner; these languages formed a critique of teachers' social relations with students and of their classroom practices generally. Subsequently, many teacher education programs initiated mental hygiene and psychology courses for their student teachers. The aide concludes with lessons educators and policy makers might take from the visiting teacher movement, especially those related to the current school-linked social services model.

TI  - URBAN THEORY AND THE TREATMENT OF DIFFERENCES - ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES, SOCIAL-SCIENCES AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF SPECIFICS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - On the whole, the main administrative approaches to social needs have been congruent with generalizing and universalistic models prevailing in the tradition of the social sciences. As is clear with the categories that have been constructed for dealing with urban problems. this congruence can be related to the reductive nature of administrative approaches -their difficulty in handling the specifics of social groups and places. In the administrative interpretation, generalizing/unitary attitudes have historical links with the centralistic and self-referential quality of the systems for addressing needs which are typical of administrative tradition. One conspicuous aspect of the changes in cultural attitudes accompanying recent decentralization trends in industrialized countries has been the drift towards the recognition of the 'specifics' - a new emphasis on local diversity, and on the necessity of properly treating social and territorial variances. This has offered new opportunities for the representation of these differences. This paper points out the practical implications of the movement, and looks at the resistances which are grounded in theoretical constructions. On the basis of the common theoretical difficulty in dealing with 'structural' issues, new convergences may occur between social sciences and administrative approaches, and this could support the reproduction of administrative mishandling of the differences.

AB  - Medical geography is slowly including more social and cultural theory in its analysis of health issues. Yet there is still room for theoretical growth in the discipline, in areas such as historical inquiry, metaphoric landscapes of disease, and the role of disease and its interpretations in the production of place. With the example of four smallpox epidemics in nineteenth century San Francisco, application of these concepts is illustrated. Each successive epidemic in San Francisco brought stronger association of the disease with Chinatown, until an almost complete metonymy of place and disease had occurred by the last decades of the century. The articulation of biased medical theory onto a landscape of xenophobia engendered this metaphorical transformation of Chinatown into a pustule of contagion threatening to infect the rest of the urban body. A less metaphoric mapping of smallpox focused on the sewer. According to 19th-century miasmatic theories of epidemiology, sewers were the most dangerous urban topographical feature. In an increasingly class-stratified city, they undercut attempts of the upper classes to escape disease by carrying smallpox-causing miasmas across class and ethnic boundaries. A reinvigorated sanitation movement was the result. Both reactions to smallpox epidemics had significant influence in shaping San Francisco's landscape, real and symbolic.

Thousands of A. suspensa were trapped year-round in urban areas where loquat, Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl.; Cattley guava, Psidium littorale Raddi var. longipes (0. Berg) Fosb.; Surinam cherry, Eugenia uniflora L.; calamondin, xCitrofortunella mitis (Blanco) J. Ingram & H. E. Moore; and kumquat, Fortunella japonica (Thunb.) Swingle occurred continuously. A. suspensa bred on loquat during December-April, then on Surinam cherry in the spring, and Cattley guava in July-September. Meanwhile, a low level of movement of A. suspensa from urban areas into adjacent commercial citrus groves was detected. Only 14 A. suspensa adults were found in semiurban areas and 12 adults in the commercial citrus groves. Host fruit were also examined in the study and showed that orange and grapefruit were minor hosts of A. suspensa.

T2  - GEO-ENGINEERING FOR UNDERGROUND FACILITIES
LA  - English
CP  - 3rd National Conference of the Geo-Institute
AB  - Underground construction for large urban developments is often driven by a number critical issues including space needs, site limitations, and functionality requirements specific to the principal occupant. In Madison, Wisconsin, above ground space limitations associated with a downtown located on an isthmus between 2 lakes, and local ordinances prohibiting the construction of buildings which rise above the tops of the columns of the state capitol has resulted in the inclusion of substantial plans for underground parking on a number of the major downtown developments. For its new office building, the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) developed plans which included 5 levels of underground parking. The required excavation for the parking structure was completed within 1.5 to 3 meters of 2 major city streets, within 1 to 1.5 meters of the local historical landmark St. Raphael Cathedral, and extended to a depth of 15.2 meters below street level. The engineer-contractor team of Woodward-Clyde and Edward E. Gillen Company proposed a soil nail retention system to retain the bulk of this excavation. Where the excavation was to be completed in close proximity to St. Raphael Cathedral, a pile and lagging system with multiple tieback levels was used to retain the cut and eliminated the need for underpinning. Optical survey monitoring during construction of the soil nail wall indicated no substantial ground movement, consistent with observations made by Denby and others that soil nail walls constructed in self-supporting soils typically exhibit negligible movement. Lateral movements associated with the tieback wall were within the envelope of lateral movement predicted using 1-dimensional finite element modeling. The temporary retention system was completed ahead of schedule and within budget, and provides an excellent example of contractor-engineer team work and soil nailing practice in the upper midwest.

AB  - Including ecological information within the planning process is problematic. Individual species response to landscape change will be complex and is often difficult to express in terms of cost or benefit. Pressure on land, particularly in densely populated countries such as the UK, means that land-use needs to be planned in all areas, urban and rural. Designing landscapes to conserve biodiversity is challenging, and a holistic perspective must be retained at all times. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is described which integrates ecological models of species occurrence with spatial data on known landscapes. The use of the tool is illustrated with a series of models of woodland birds within the fragmented landscape of East Anglia, England. Scenarios of woodland loss or gain can be visualised quickly through the creation of altered landscapes; the bird models can then be re-run and the predicted impact on species distributions displayed. The tool is generic, in that any species can be modelled at any scale if ecological models are available to describe its distribution in terms of landscape variables. It is argued that it remains the job of the ecologist to make knowledge about species distributions accessible to the planning process. The key to this is that mathematical models must be expressed spatially in a format suitable for scenario-testing. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This work presents an assessment of the principal geological-geotechnical environmental problems registered in the region of Fortaleza in north east Brazil. Fortaleza is the most important city in Ceara State and has over 2.5 million inhabitants distributed within its 300 km(2). Seventy percent of the population lives in the 35 km long, 8.5 km wide coastal zone. Geologically the region is composed of sandy unconsolidated materials (dunes and beaches) which cover the sedimentary rocks of Tertiary age; The remainder is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks covered by transported and residual unconsolidated materials of between 0.5 and 20 m thick. The principal environmental problems found in the coastal zone are accelerated erosion in the coastal and continental areas, sedimentation of the rivers and marine zone, pollution of ground water by uncontrolled landfill and cesspools, degradation due to the exploitation of sand, aggregate and clay for urban construction, dune movement and flood and sea water intrusion. Some of environmental problems occurring elsewhere include saline soils and ground waters, mass movements and flooding due to high rainfall intensity.

TI  - Urban traffic distribution and elevator capacity in super high buildings
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH SOCIETY OF JAPAN
LA  - Japanese
AB  - In recent years, very high buildings have been extensively constructed to utilize the narrow urban grand space. Most of those buildings are used for offices, and some for hotels or hospitals. But, there are some plans to build a super high building to form a "compact city" which brings residence, office, and some urban facilities close together. It is expected that the people in the building can satisfy their daily needs at hand so that the amount of traffic should be reduced. In this "city type" building, the trips occur for a variety of reasons, for example, employment, school, shopping etc., which are of different types compared to those in traditional buildings.
   In this paper, we will discuss those traffic problems in the city type buildings. When we consider the traffic problem in a high building, the major difficulty appears in the vertical movement. Insufficient elevator area causes the complaint of the passengers for long waiting time, on the other hand, wide;elevator area causes the dissatisfaction of the owner of the building having small area left for rent. For simplicity, we assume that the rest of the floor area not used for elevator are all used for residence; where people distribute uniformly. And, as for the traffic distribution, we adopt the "gravity model" in the theory of urban transportation distribution theory, in other words, a trip occurs by the interaction of a pair of people in the building, and the trip occurrence probability for the pair is equal to a constant multiplied by the deterrence factor. The deterrence factor is based on the distance between the origin and destination.
   We derive the equation to determine the elevator area distribution in the following way. The transportation capacity c per unit area of elevator passage is assumed to be constant irrespective of the building height. The number of trips passing through a floor is the sum of the trip occurrence probabilities for such pairs that one located above the floor and the other located below. The product of the capacity c and the elevator area on the floor should be equal to this amount. The equation is derived from the condition that this relation should be satisfied at each floor in the building.
   When the size of the building and the deterrences factor are given, the equation can be solved numerically to obtain the elevator area distribution. We solve the equations for several cases and consider the relation between the population P in the building and the number of trips T travelling through the elevator area. When the deterrence factor is small and the number of trips per person is at a high level, then population P or amount of trips per person T/P can be raised only at a very slow rate by enlarging the height of the building. If one expects to get substantial gain in T/P or P by constructing a higher building, the deterrence factor should be made large by carefully designing the facility layout in the building. We also draw the graphs which show the suitable population size and amount of trips for the building of each height.

AB  - A number of trends in recent immigration to Canada are discussed: the scale of contemporary movement; the transformation of national origins over the past generation; the diversity of entry classes and the lack of any singular immigrant condition; the remarkable contraction of immigrant destinations to a few large cities; the contribution of immigration to population growth and housing demand in these metropolitan areas; and the distinctive geography of the various entry classes, with higher-status arrivals disproportionately located in Vancouver. The remainder of the paper considers and rejects two common myths in the discussion of immigration: first, the myth of an immigrant underclass, and second, the myth of an immigrant overclass. Using research from Vancouver associated with the Metropolis Project the first myth is challenged from an analysis of Census data that emphasizes the social context of immigrant life and upward mobility; the second myth is shaken by a qualitative methodology that reveals the unexpectedly fragile experience of a number of business immigrants.

TI  - Peasant movements - The political and social basis of regional variation in land occupations in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Land occupations led by Brazil's most dynamic social movement the Landless Workers Movement (MST) began as a regional phenomenon. The south-east and the north-east regions were initially the centres of land occupations. The successful occupations in these areas were influenced by the origins of the movement, their proximity to urban areas with sympathetic support networks, concentrations of landless workers and the availability of vast areas of uncultivated land initial land settlements led to successful occupations in adjoining areas. Conditions which led to successful organising were later systematised by the MST leaders into a national strategy. Subsequently this strategy directed social intervention in other regions and created the basis for the extension of land occupations in regions beyond their original areas of strength. The extension of successful land occupations to new areas has been based on the 'transplantation' of leaders and the recruitment of local cadres who have assimilated the lessons of earlier experience. The MST has been transformed from a regional to a national movement. In the process, the MST has moved from a sectoral 'agrarian reform' social movement to a political movement with a national political agenda.

AB  - Situated at 137kms east of Algiers in a montaneous area, Azazga city (20 000inhabitants) is built on an average slope of 6%. This locality is affected by an ancient landslide which has caused a lot of damage in the public buildings and habitations. From the geological point of view, the town is built on series of rock -rubbllesclayous gritty whose thickness varies betwen 10m and 30m and resting on an ancient substratum constituted of an intercalation of scistous marls and of rare reefs of limestone and sandstone of local appellation " flysch cretace ". The rock rubble is sufficiently permeable to contain a nappe of water quasi- permanent that the inhabitants exploit. The movement of the grounds always occur in winters and are triggered off by heavy rains. We can cite for example the first three days of february 1973 during which it rained 110mm when this is the monthley average pluviometry.

AB  - The Consolidated Edison Company of NY Inc. (Con Edison) System Operation Computer Control System (SOCCS) monitors and assists in the control of electric power transmission and distribution in the New York City area. SOCCS gathers data from monitored points, compares them againt expected normal values, and generates alarms and events when deviations occur. The SOCCS Alarm Advisor (SAA) is an on-line real-time system that assists system operators by identifying and suppressing so-called nuisance alarms, by analysing the electrical network's status and by recommending appropriate restoration procedures. SAA processes up to 200 alarms in a 2 s scan, using physical,functional and temporal models to locate problem areas and to propagate the effects through a causal network. SAA became operational in June 1989 operators with timely reports on system conditions and operations. In March 1990, SAA was recognized by AAAI as an innovative application of AI and was further honoured by being mentioned in the keynote address of that year's convention. This paper presents the design, costs and benefits of SAA as well as an update on the results from the last two years of on-line experience.

AB  - We examined individual and population responses of the rock mouse, Peromyscus difficilis, to experimental changes in food abundance. Two food addition experiments lasting 4 months were carried out during breeding and non-breeding seasons to test the hypothesis that females are more responsive to food resources than are males, especially during reproduction. On two grids, we added food on relatively widely spaced point sources to compare effects within grids on fed and unfed mice. We also compared populations on two treatment grids and a control grid. Food addition resulted in increased immigration, earlier breeding, and increased reproduction in contrast to the control grid. Improvement of sum mer survival was evident only when analysis was undertaken at a fine scale; fed individuals showed longer residence times. Females gained weight and had improved reproduction, and improved survival, during both wet and dry seasons. Males responded less consistently than did females.

AB  - The City of Austin, Texas, is one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. It is also in one of the most biologically diverse terrestrial ecosystems in the world: the Ba[cones Canyonlands. Five cave invertebrates and two species of birds that inhabit the area are listed as threatened or endangered, two species of plants are candidates for listing, several others are considered rare and of concern, and a species of the salamander has also been proposed for listing. A habitat conservation plan, of ''national significance...'' according to Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbit (Haurwitz 1996), has been under development for the last several years to conserve those endangered species through a 2400-ha system of preserves and to allow development to continue in more than 162,000 ha of surrounding area. The preserve system, comprising several units ranging in size from less than a hundred to several thousand hectares, would be bordered in many instances by developed areas. Development and maintenance of the infrastructure necessary for new and existing development, both commercial and residential, could have negated the biological Value of the preserves (e.g., power-line corridors, water-treatment pipelines and facilities). The challenge of bringing this plan to fruition illustrates the complex biological, technical, and sociological context within which habitat conservation planning may occur. Resolving resource use conflicts of this nature have several commonalities that over-arch these contexts. If recognized and addressed, one may move easily and foster positive results. These commonalities can be expressed as principles such as: relying on scientists to recognize, but not solve problems; acting before a scientific consensus is achieved; including human motivation and responses as part of the system to be studied and managed; and confronting uncertainty.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION ON A CLOSED LANDFILL - RAPID ADDITION OF NEW SPECIES BY BIRD DISPERSAL
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Urban areas often contain sizeable pockets of degraded land, such as inactive landfills, that could be reclaimed as wildlife habitat and as connecting links to enhance remnant natural areas. In the northeastern U.S., many such lands fail to undergo natural succession to woodland, instead retaining a weedy, herbaceous cover for many years. We hypothesize that seed dispersal is a limiting factor, and that a form of secondary succession could be stimulated by introducing clusters of trees and shrubs to attract avian seed disperses.  As a direct test we censused a 1. 5 -ha experimental plantation on the Fresh Kills Landfill (Staten Island, New York) one year after installation in search of evidence that the plantation was spreading or increasing in diversity. The 17 planted species, many from coastal scrub forests native to this region, were surviving well but contributed almost no seedlings to the area, in part because only 20 % of the installed trees or shrubs were reproductive. Of the 1079 woody seedlings found, 95 % came from sources outside the plantation; most (71 % ) were from fleshy-fruited, bird-dispersed plants from nearby woodland fringes Although the restoration planting itself bad not begun to produce seedlings, it did function as a site for attracting dispersers, who enriched the young community with 20 new species. One-fourth of all new recruits were from nine additional wind-dispersed species. Locations with a high ratio of trees to shrubs had proportionately more recruits, indicating that plant size contributed to disperser attraction. The density of new recruits of each species was dependent on distance from the nearest potential seed source. Introducing native species with the capacity to attract avian dispersers may be the key to success of many restoration programs.

AB  - In this paper I discuss the four Women and Labour conferences which were held in Australian capital cities over the seven years between 1978 and 1984. I explore the ways in which the history of Australian feminist activism during this period could be written, questioning in particular the claim that the Women and Labour conferences have been central to the history of Australian feminism. I discuss the ways in which a historical sense could be established, using writings about the conferences as historical 'evidence', that race and ethnic divisions between women had not been important to the 'women's movement' until 1984. In other words, I challenge the construction of this conference as a turning point - not only in the feminist politicization of immigrant and Aboriginal women, but also in the politicization of all feminists about race acid ethnic divisions. More broadly, I am interested in how a history would be written if it aimed to get to the 'truth' about racism and about the feminist activism of immigrant women. How would the apparent lack of written 'evidence' - at least until 1984 - of immigrant women's feminist activism, and of the awareness of Australian feminists about issues of racism, be written into this history! In addition, I suggest that it is important to the writing of feminist history in Australia that published documentation has been mostly produced by angle women, and is thus partial and mediated by the lived, embodied experiences of angle women. Finally, my intention is to interrogate commonly understood narratives about Australian feminist history, to challenge their seamlessness, and to suggest the importance of recognizing the tension within feminist discourses between difference as benign diversity and difference as disruption.

AB  - The localities of 53 species alien to the flora of the Czech Republic were collated from their introduction to the present. The information on the distribution of particular species was obtained by using herbaria (contributing 37.4 % of the total number of localities), floristic periodicals (53.4 %) and unpublished data (9.1 %). In total, 32,277 localities were recorded. If given in the original source, information was recorded on the (i) the year of the record, and (ii) the type of the habitat. The classification of habitats yielded 14 types, divided into two main groups, (1)man-made, heavily disturbed habitats, and (2) less disturbed sites of a more natural origin. Aliens occur most frequently in cities and villages (25.6 % of the total number of localities), and riparian habitats (22.4 %). From the viewpoint of management, these habitats represent further potential sources for their spread into the landscape. The contribution of other habitat types never exceeds 10 %. The representation of forests is rather high (9.2 %;;, including forest margins). The majority of "seminatural" habitats, namely scrub and grasslands, prove to be rather resistant. The representation of particular habitas has been changing remarkably in the course of the 20th century, the most conspicuous trend being a decrease in relative representation of urban habitats acid an increasing role of habitats facilitating dispersal (including roads, railways and paths). These trends can be interpreted as a consequence of changes of intensity and type of disturbances affecting the landscape during this period. Every habitat, including forest interiors, has at least some well established invaders.

KW  - POLICY
AB  - This paper models the impacts of public decision making through a new analytic framework based on the integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and an extended shift-share analysis. The research is set within the context of Erickson's new model on the suburban economy, allowing study of the spatial economic impacts of new town development in Hong Kong for the period 1966-86. Development patterns for the period 1986-2006 are analyzed using the same approach with three different development scenarios. It was found that Hong Kong's public housing-led new town development strategy has stimulated occurrence of the first spillover/specialization stage in the Erickson model, although the second dispersal/diversification stage has yet to be achieved. In the absence of a concomitant policy to disperse employment, new town development in Hong Kong has resulted in a mismatch between place of residence and place of work, leading to a polarization between white-collar jobs concentrated in the older urban areas and blue-collar jobs in the newer towns. Results indicate that the second stage of Erickson's model may be achieved if Hong Kong maintains its current growth momentum. However, the current concentrated development strategy of the Hong Kong government may jeopardize the development of self-contained/self-balanced new towns, possibly leading to further overcrowding in central urban areas. Such a concentrated strategy may also deter the further integration of Hong Kong with the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in China.

AB  - This paper presents periodicities in geophysical measurements made during recent activity in Campi Flegrei caldera.  This caldera, located west of Naples in southern Italy, is well known for the slow vertical ground movement, known as bradyseism.  The maximum rate of movement occurs near the city of Pozzuoli, near the caldera center.  A monitoring system of geophysical instruments has been in operation since 1970 to record activity in Campi Flegrei.
   We analyze the time series and frequency spectra of vertical ground movement, seismicity and gravity changes associated with a strong episode of unrest occurred between 1982 and 1984.  Our purpose is to investigate the influence of the Earth tide on some aspects of the unrest.  Our results reveal periodicities coincident with some tides, which range from semidiurnal to annual components.  Some of these periodicities has already been identified during an earlier episode of activity in Campi Flegrei.

AB  - Anthropogenic alteration of the landscape is a long-term disturbance both in duration and consequences. This study addresses land-cover responses to a history of human land use in northeastern Puerto Rico. Analysis of aerial photographs indicated that the pattern of land use in the municipality of Luquillo changed dramatically between 1936 and 1988. In 1936, sugar cane and pasture were the dominant land uses, occupying about one third of the study area each, while dense forest was rare. Pasture still occupied about a quarter of the area by 1988, but the area of sugar cane had declined to zero. Most sugar cane land was transformed to pasture after abandonment, while much of the pasture at higher elevations reverted to forest. More than half the study area in 1988 was occupied by dense forest, and the degree of forest regeneration was greatest adjacent to the Luquillo Experimental Forest and around parches that were dense forest remnants in 1936. The overall trend was from high-intensity agriculture to dense forest, bur urban areas increased more than 2000 percent between 1936 and 1988 and are presently encroaching on forested areas. It is unclear from one study whether the same pattern would hold true at other sites in the tropics, but our study indicates the importance of preserving remnants of mature forest as sources of forest regeneration. In addition, the nature of the patches in the Luquillo landscape has changed as the land use has changed. In 1936, dense forest was highly fragmented, the patches were small and many of them had linear configurations (riparian corridors and hedgerows). By 1988, the average parch size of dense forest had increased greatly, although with one exception the parches were still small relative to other land-cover types.

AB  - One-third of humans are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Sequence analysis of two megabases in 26 structural genes or loci in strains recovered globally discovered a striking reduction of silent nucleotide substitutions compared with other human bacterial pathogens. The lack of neutral mutations in structural genes indicates that M. tuberculosis is evolutionarily young and has recently spread globally. Species diversity is largely caused by rapidly evolving insertion sequences, which means that mobile element movement is a fundamental process generating genomic variation in this pathogen. Three genetic groups of M. tuberculosis were identified based on two polymorphisms that occur at high frequency in the genes encoding catalase-peroxidase and the A subunit of gyrase. Group 1 organisms are evolutionarily old and allied with M. bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis. A subset of several distinct insertion sequence IS6110 subtypes of this genetic group have IS6110 integrated at the identical chromosomal insertion site, located between dnaA and dnaN in the region containing the origin of replication. Remarkably, study of approximate to 6,000 isolates from patients in Houston and the New York City area discovered that 47 of 48 relatively large case clusters were caused by genotypic group 1 and 2 but not group 3 organisms. The observation that the newly emergent group 3 organisms are associated with sporadic rather than clustered cases suggests that the pathogen is evolving toward a state of reduced transmissability or virulence.

TI  - A METHOD FOR PREDICTING THE FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION OF AIR-POLLUTION FROM VEHICLE TRAFFIC, BASIC METEOROLOGY, AND HISTORICAL CONCENTRATIONS TO ASSIST URBAN-PLANNING
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Mathematical models can play an important role in assessing the air quality implications of urban planning by linking the emissions that result from specific land uses to ambient concentrations of those pollutants.  Where motor vehicles are a dominant source of air pollutant concentrations, it is necessary to predict the dispersal of air pollutants from road networks under average emission and meteorological conditions.  It can also be important to identify extremes or worst case conditions that may occur in any given year, particularly where these extremes relate to health guidelines used for urban planning.  This paper examines an approach that can satisfy these requirements for providing air quality advice to the planning of urban areas.  A hybrid approach is outlined which combines a deterministic model with statistical techniques for estimating the freqency distribution of concentrations from the model output and the analysis of historical pollutant concentrations.  The particular method described is a very simple but useful implementation of the general hybrid approach.  The deterministic model component requires only basic traffic and meteorological measurements to infer estimates of mean annual concentrations.  The statistical component allows inference of the frequency distribution of concentrations about this mean, including extreme values such as the maximum.  Results are illustrated for 24-h average measurements of carbon monoxide over annual periods in Canberra, although the method can be applied to predict seasonal values of shorter term concentrations.  The hybrid approach can also be applied with more detailed deterministic models, should there be adequate meteorological and other information to drive them.

TI  - NEW HEALTH PROMOTION MOVEMENT - A CRITICAL-EXAMINATION
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION QUARTERLY
LA  - English
KW  - COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT
KW  - SOCIAL SUPPORT
AB  - In the last decade, a revolution has been occurring in the field of health promotion.  Guided to a large extent by position papers disseminated by the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe Health Promotion Office, and furthered by the Ottawa Charter, the Epp Report in Canada, the Healthy Cities project, as well as by other efforts, this new health promotion movement has introduced new ideas, new language, and new concepts about what constitutes health and how health promotion efforts should be configured to achieve health.
   Punctuated by the terms like empowerment and community participation, this movement has generated a whole new discourse about the theory and practice of health promotion.  This paper explores the multiple meanings that surround these terms, and the implications for practice, by addressing questions like:  What does health mean in this new context?  What is empowerment?  What does participation look like?  Has the tyranny of the professional been replaced by the tyranny of the community?  Has anything changed about the practice of health promotion other than the language?
   Finally, it is argued that an acknowledgment of the multidimensionality of these concepts may facilitate their translation from rhetoric into health promotion practice.

KW  - DECLINE
AB  - Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) were introduced into California about 100 years ago and are common in permanent and semipermanent aquatic habitats, except those at high elevations and in some desert areas. In the Great Central Valley of California, urban and agricultural development has led to increased hydroperiods in areas that historically supported only ephemeral sources of water. This has increased breeding opportunities for bullfrogs and expanded their dispersal into grassland and vernal pool ecosystems. Because of their voracious feeding habits, the diet of bullfrogs has been well studied, and bullfrogs have been implicated in local declines of some native species. Little is known, however, about prey selection by bullfrogs in ephemeral ecosystems such as vernal pools. We studied aquatic prey availability and the diet of juvenile bullfrogs at a constructed vernal pool wetland mitigation site in Sacramento County, California from February to June, 1998. Early in the spring, bullfrogs were widely distributed on the study site, but as pools with shorter hydroperiods dried, they dispersed away from the site or moved to larger, deeper pools. In pools occupied by bullfrogs, aquatic macroinvertebrate samples were dominated by crustaceans and coleopterans early in the spring, and by hemipterans later in the spring and early summer. The majority of the juvenile bullfrogs' diets consisted of aquatic macroinvertebrates, but terrestrial coleopterans, hymenopterans, dipterans, odonates, and arachnids were also preyed upon. Aquatic prey selection was non-random, with crustaceans and beetles over-represented and hemipterans under-represented in the diet compared to their abundance in the pools.

KW  - BREATH
AB  - Objectives.  Analysis of data from the New York City Fire Department showed that residential fuel oil releases frequently occur in quantities ranging from 5 to 1000 gal, primarily from storage tank leaks, and overfill.  A risk assessment was conducted to determine whether Number 2 fuel oil basement spills pose a significant risk to human health.
   Methods.  Exposure was derived from a simulated field study spill of Number 2 fuel oil in a townhouse basement to develop emission rates for the indicator constituent xylene. Distribution of xylene throughout the townhouse was determined using a multizone contaminant dispersal model.
   Results.  Spills of 85 and 21 gal resulted in xylene exposure estimates as high as 20 and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively.
   Conclusions.  A spill of about 21 gal or more of Number 2 fuel oil would present a human health risk for central nervous and reproductive systems for 8 days or longer.  Tank inspection and supervised delivery would provide effective prevention at minimal expense.

AB  - The article scrutinizes the claim of a universal movement to towards a free society as reflected in social mobility. Data on intergenerational, career and connubial mobility in the Dutch province of Utrecht from 1850-1940 are taken from the nationwide Historical Sample of the Netherlands. Total mobility did increase, for all three types of mobility, and both for the cities and the countryside. This was due to changes in the occupational structure. Relative mobility-or ''openness of society'' did not increase. This is demonstrated by the use of two types of loglinear models, those of constant social fluidity on the one hand and the scaled association models on the other hand, The observed increase in openness in the Netherlands between 1954 and 1992 is thus not the tail of long movement. The article is an example of the recent merger of historical and the sociological research traditions on mobility and stratification, allowing for further progress in describing the long sweeps in the openness of the Western world.

AB  - The increasing presence of students of diverse racial/ethnic and international origins in colleges and universities in the USA has prompted efforts to revise and create courses and curricula to respond to 'diversity' and introduce multicultural perspectives. In this Arena symposium we address current practices and the prospects for multicultural teaching in geography. Lee's introduction reviews the development of the diversity movement and the arguments advanced for and against multicultural education. Size then focuses on the representation of minorities within geographic institutions in the US;I, nle papers that follow present the perspectives of both administrators and teaching faculty, recognising that change requires support and engagement across these levels. Corey examines how institutional priorities and programme developments in a large state university shape openings for interdisciplinary offerings to which geographers can contribute. McConnell reports the outcomes of his participation in a project to transform a course on the geography of the United States to one that addresses American pluralism. Darden advocates a particular 'social reconstructionist' vision in his development of an upper-level urban geography course. Berry takes Itp the pedagogical challenge of incorporating diverse voices into courses that highlight race, gender and ethnicity. In presenting their work, the authors hope to encourage other geographers to share approaches to curricular transformation and to strengthen efforts to diversify the make-up of the profession.

TI  - Dispersal of mercury-contaminated sediments by geomorphic processes, Sixmile Canyon, Nevada, USA: Implications to site characterization and remediation of fluvial environments
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA  - English
AB  - The discovery of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859 resulted in the construction of more than 30 stamp-mills along Sixmile Canyon and its tributaries to process the gold and silver ore. Extraction of the precious metals from the ore was accomplished using a crude mercury (Hg) amalgamation process. As a result, a substantial quantity of Hg was released along with tailings materials to this tributary of the Carson River. During the past 134 years, Hg-contaminated sediments have been eroded from the mill sites and transported downstream by fluvial processes, thereby expanding the influence of Hg pollution. Geomorphic and geochemical data have been combined in this study to document the distribution, quantity, and physical dispersal of Hg-contaminated materials from Sixmile Canyon to the Carson River. These data show that the influx of Hg to the Carson River has varied through time as a function of the erosional and depositional processes operating on the Sixmile Canyon Alluvial Fan located between the canyon and the Carson River channel; relatively high influx rates to the river occurred immediately after mining began and from approximately 1933 to 1948. Hg-polluted sediments are located within discrete areas of the fan and comprise about 21% of the total active and relict fan surface. Mass balance calculations estimate that about 31,500 kg of Hg, 18,200 oz of Au, and 1,205,800 oz of Ag are contained within 710,700 m(3) of contaminated materials. If site remediation is conducted, extraction of Au and Ag, which is worth about $ 12 million at current market prices, would greatly defray the costs of clean-up activities. The study also illustrates that the effects of Hg may be temporally and spatially displaced from the period and location of milling activities. Thus, we conclude that to accurately assess the site for remediation, an understanding of the spatial and temporal variations in geomorphic dispersal processes is required.

AB  - Road traffic modelling and simulation is currently well provided with a variety of packages dealing with the minute detail of road layouts from single isolated junction models to complete network simulations. There has also been much work in developing assignment models to optimise traffic signal sequences. The same is not true in the pedestrian modelling arena. With the exception of models dealing with railway and airport concourses and models of pedestrian movements around sports stadia there is very little support for the planner or designer of the pedestrian urban environment. The system discussed in this paper provides some insights as to the reasons for this and describes a highly parallel microscopic model called PEDFLOW (PEDestrian now) which attempts to remedy the situation. The model operates on a grid size that is equivalent to the space occupied by a person at rest. The major difference between vehicular and pedestrian movement is that the former really has only one degree of freedom, forwards, whereas a pedestrian has unlimited two-dimensional degrees of freedom. Vehicular travel is governed by a large number of laws and regulations that make it much easier to model. Within the pedestrian urban environment there are Very few laws and regulations and those that do apply are related to interactions with vehicles. The design of PEDFLOW is discussed and it is shown how the complex behavioural rules governing pedestrian movement are captured. The parallel architecture underlying the model is described and it shows how the maximum possible parallelism is achieved among all the moving pedestrians at any one time. The performance of the model is then presented and uses to which the model is being put are then briefly presented.

AB  - We have monitored water level of a hot spring in Ito City, radon concentration of hot spring water in Naka-Izu and temperature of fumarolic gas from Izu-Oshima Volcano.  These parameters have changed prior to and during the seismic and volcanic activities starting on June 30, 1989, off the eastern coast of the Izu Peninsula.  We summarized our observations together with other reported hydrological changes.  The observed changes are classified into two types.  One type is a co-seismic change which occurred at the times of bigger earthquakes among swarm activities.  These changes were observed at several hot springs in the area 20-30 km away from the Teisi erupting center.  The other type is precursory changes observed in the area close to the erupting center and at the Izu-Oshima Volcano 40 km away.  The upward movement of magma due to possibly a dyke intrusion may disturb violently the hydrological systems in Ito City and Usami Town.  Precursory changes in temperature of a fumarolic gas emitted from a well in the Izu-Oshima Volcano imply a possible linkage between Izu-Oshima and Teisi magma systems.

AB  - Heavy metal accumulation by Typha latifolia under both controlled laboratory and in-situ field conditions is reported and interpreted in terms of the possible pollutant removal capacity of this species, when planted in a constructed urban wetland. Greenhouse metal dosing results are also reported for Juncus effusus to provide a comparison in terms of individual tissue uptake. The highest metal concentrations are achieved by Typha root tissue with Cd and Zn demonstrating temporal exponential increases and these metals also showing the highest uptake ability in Juncus root material. The root to stem transfer efficiency for different metals is similar for Juncus and greater than the corresponding root to rhizome and root to leaf movement in Typha. Typha metal tissue level comparisons between the dosing experiment and the field study indicate that the uptake limit for Cu, Pb and Zn in both rhizome and leaf is probably achieved at the urban sites. Metal load tissue distributions identify the Typha rhizome as the major metal bioaccumulation area with significantly lower loads occurring in leaf and root tissue, the latter having the lowest overall loadings. The resulting implications for the successful management of Typha when used for the control of metal polluted stormwater inputs are discussed.

AB  - Certain aspects of the biblical story of the Cities of the Plain have in recent years become widely accepted. Among them is the placing of those cities in the southern basin of the Dead Sea, the assumption that those cities are now covered by Dead Sea water and, in particular, the belief that their destruction was due to catastrophic geological causes, such as an earthquake. The Bible emphasizes the agricultural richness of the Jordan plain prior to the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah and its catastrophic transformation into a wasteland. Thus, stripped of ethical and religious overtones, the scenario is that of a rapid climatic change that converted a densely inhabited and richly watered area into an infertile salt playa. The region northeast and southeast of Jericho, which today is quite barren as a result of the upward movement of salty ground water but which contains some of the World's earliest known agricultural settlements, fits such a picture. Dating the Sodom event to approximately the 2 3rd-21 st centuries B.C. supports the idea that a major climatic change that occurred between the Early and Middle Bronze Ages and which resulted in profound transformations in the Middle East such as the collapse of the Ancient Kingdom of Egypt, the invasion of the Fertile Crescent by the Semitic desert nomads, and the collapse of Early Bronze Age civilization in Palestine - is also responsible for the Sodom story. Although the data are far from complete, desiccation during this period is indicated by palynological evidence pointing to the decimation of forests in Northern Israel, paleobotanical evidence from Southern Israel, the deposition of salt layers in the Dead Sea, the abandonment of almost all settlements in the Negev Desert of Southern Israel, the Jordan valley and Southern Jordan, except those which were associated with perennial springs, and further afield the drastic lowering of the level of Lake Moeris in Lower Egypt. This scenario does not exclude the possibility that a major earthquake - which may have occurred during this period - was considered to be the cause of the final physical destruction of the Cities of the Plain, delivering a coup de grace to a collapsing society, and which became through the mists of time and legend, the only agent of destruction.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE JAPANESE INLAND SEA
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - 1. The Japanese Inland Sea has five main features: (i) it is a typical enclosed sea with numerous islands, (ii) it has a rich history and culture, (iii) it serves as an important east-west maritime route, (iv) it possesses abundant fishing resources, and (v) it has experienced much coastal landfill and the expansion of heavy chemical industries in the post-war period.
   2. It is important that efforts are now made to implement sustainable development, the internationally-accepted common guideline for environmental conservation, in the Inland Sea area. The concept of sustainable development can be summarized into the following five points: (i) conserving the ecosystem and planetary life-support systems, protecting all plant and animal species, and maintaining genetic diversity; (ii) satisfying the basic needs of the populace; (iii) securing equality between different regions and between generations; (iv) ensuring people's participation; (v) applying the principle of integration.
   3. Has past management and development in the Inland Sea created problems for the conservation of the ecosystem and protection of species' diversity? Was it based on the basic needs of the local populace? Was the participation of residents guaranteed? Were inequalities among different areas, such as overcrowding and depopulation, eased? Was equality between generations ensured? Were all plans and their implementation integrated according to the idea of sustainable development? The answers to these questions suggest the following requirements: (i) effecting strict environmental assessments, with priority on the conservation of the ecosystem; (ii) guaranteeing consideration of local citizens' needs, and concrete procedures for resident participation in managing the environment, including planning and decision making, for the integration of development and conservation; (iii) controlling the movement of population to the cities and promoting locally-generated development; (iv) integrating laws and administration according to the principle of sustainable development, and removing various contradictions.

AB  - Between 1986 and 1995, a total of 23,543 yellow fever (YF) cases and 6,421 deaths were officially reported to the WHO, thereby reflecting a dramatic increase in the disease compared to previous reporting intervals. Africa accounted for 91% of the reported cases. Recent epidemics have occurred in Nigeria (1986-1991), Cameroon (1990), Ghana (1993-1994), Liberia (1995), Gabon (1994), Senegal (1995), and Benin (1996). In 1992, an epidemic was recognized in East Africa (Kenya) for the first time in 26 years. Outbreaks in Africa and increased virus activity in a longitudinal study site in Senegal are temporally linked to the El Nino phenomenon and associated periods of excessive rainfall. In South America, YF occurs in the Amazon region and contiguous areas; between 1986 and 1995, a total of 2,002 cases and 1,302 deaths were officially reported. In 1996, two unvaccinated travelers acquired YF in Brazil and died of the disease in the United States and Switzerland. These events emphasize the laxity of regulations regarding immunization for international travel and the potential for long-distance movement of viremic individuals. During most of the era of modern air travel, YF has been confined to inaccessible regions of the Amazon basin and rural Africa, not engaged in commerce or tourism. This historical barrier to the spread of YF has been fundamentally altered. Aeries aegypti reinvaded the South American continent within the last 20 years, increasing the risk of urban YF in densely populated coastal regions and cities having frequent contacts with areas also infested by A aegypti in Asia, Australia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and North America. Economic development in South America and Africa, particularly the construction of roads and internal air services, together with increased epidemic transmission amplifies the risk of spread. However, immunity to dengue and other flaviviruses, as well as low vector competence in some receptive areas may mitigate the potential for virus introduction and spread. Moreover, it is likely that an urban outbreak in South America or a key center in West Africa would come to light quite rapidly, with international declaration of a clear and present danger and appropriate quarantine measures. Although vaccination of at-risk populations in endemic areas of South America and Africa has been shown to be affordable and cost-effective, many countries have low vaccine coverage rates. The changes in YF epidemiology and the lack of effective vaccine coverage represent a call for urgent action.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - This article examines the labour disturbances which occurred in Freetown, Sierra Leone (Figure 1), between 1938 and 1939. Contrary to the prevailing interpretation that the colonial state in Africa was faced with an alternative of either forcefully pushing the working class out of the city or moving towards some form of corporatism, this article argues that such an option was only feasible in situations where labour was relatively quiescent or where a casual labour problem existed. In Freetown, where a stable labour force existed, the choice was between accepting a militant labour movement over whom officials had little or no control, or creating a labour movement that would eschew militant protest and follow the path dictated from above. The existence of a militant organization committed to continous agitation and the use of strike weapons to force employers to acknowledge the presence of a working class were critical factors in shaping official response to labour disturbances in the British colonies.

KW  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Remnant patches of a forest corridor were examined along the Iowa and Cedar Rivers, Iowa. A fractal dimension was found for these patches which was incorporated with the perimeter:area ratio in an index of shape. This index was then regressed on 5 hydrogeomorphic variables hypothesized to represent processes which might control patch dimensions, plus a variable to represent human impact. The hydrogeomorphic variables were derived from topographic maps; the impact variable used was the proportion of perimeter that was occupied by a road, railroad, transmission line, urban or other built area, or a straight line judged to be agricultural. Three variables remained significant in a reduced model: human impact, valley width, and stream sinuosity, but together the three accounted for only 24% of the variance in patch shape. The fractal perimeter:area ratio increased with human impact, probably because of reduced area, and decreased with valley width, which allowed more extensive forest on wide floodplains, and with sinuosity, which resulted in small patches isolated on the interior of meanders. These results indicate that in this landscape the hydrogeomorphic structures play a role, but that human impact is more significant in its effect on the shape of remnant forest patches. Other structures, such as the regional topography, may account for the unexplained variance. The index of shape used here may be useful as an independent variable in studies of ecological processes affected by patch shape and form and as a guide conservation.

AB  - An international workshop held at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (4-6 Sept. 1991) on the ''origin, occurrence and behaviour of sediments in sewer systems'' has shown that much progress has been made in the last 5 years in the general understanding of sewer sediments. Comprehensive research programmes, including field surveys, have indicated that solids found in sewers, either in suspension or in deposition, cannot be considered as having a unique entity. On the basis of sewerage and sources, a categorization can be made between three broad types of solids: sewer grits, sanitary solids and (runoff-generated) fine material. Although some other categorizations are also possible, it is apparent that each of these three types has very specific physico-chemical characteristics and this has important implications both from the environmental and the operational points of view. The diversity of the types of sewer solids is not infinite (from place to place, sediments will differ only within relatively narrow bands), nonetheless the differences are the main reason why the development of a ''universal'' sewer sediment transport model is a remote prospect. For some elementary processes, such as the movement of non-cohesive grit in drainage conduits, detailed engineering solutions are beginning to emerge. It is also apparent that bed shear stress is a more appropriate parameter than flow velocity for defining erosive or depositional criteria in sewers. There is no doubt that in the future, the various problems of sewer sediments, washout of pollutants during storm overflows, reduction of hydraulic capacity, recurrent costs for cleaning sewerage lines and tanks, will have to be considered intrinsically in all urban drainage applications (design and analysis). It is also likely that wastewater treatment technology (and terminology) will intrude more and more in the apparent unchanging traditions of sewer network operation.

KW  - AREAS
AB  - Recent demographic studies document movement of poor people from both urban and rural places to depressed rural communities. Such migration redistributes poverty to rural areas and further concentrates it within them. This article presents a case study of one depressed community in New York that became a migration destination for urban poor people, causing dramatic increases in poverty rate, welfare rolls, and service needs. On-site research showed that the community's attraction was inexpensive rental housing that had become available after loss of manufacturing jobs prompted a middle-class exodus. The lack of jobs was not a deterrent for low-income inmigrants, though, because many of them had limited job skills and other employment barriers and would have had difficulty getting or holding a job anyway. Similar processes of economic decline, population loss, and poverty inmigration appear to be occurring elsewhere also. The article identifies community-level impacts and policy implications; it concludes with suggestions for further research needs.

CP  - 77th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - A mathematical model is proposed to describe how vacant and occupied taxis will cruise in a road network to search for customers and provide transportation services. The model assumes that a taxi driver, once having picked up a customer, will move to the customer's destination by the shortest path: and that a taxi driver, once having dropped a customer, will try to minimize individual expected search time required to meet the next customer. The probability that a vacant taxi meets a customer in a particular zone is specified by a legit model by assuming that the expected search time in each zone is an identically distributed random variable due to variations in perceptions and the random arrival of customers. The whole movement of all empty and occupied taxis is formulated as an optimization model, from which a gravity-type distribution of empty taxis is derived. Consequently, the taxi movement model can be salved efficiently by the established iterative balancing method and can be incorporated into any standard transportation planning packages.

AB  - In natural ground water systems, both chlorine and bromine occur primarily as monovalent anions, chloride and bromide. Although dissolution or precipitation of halite, biological activity in the root zone, anion sorption, and exchange can affect chloride/bromide ratios in some settings, movement of the ions in potable ground water is most often conservative. Atmospheric precipitation will generally have mass ratios between 50 and 150; shallow ground water, between 100 and 200; domestic sewage, between 300 and 600; water affected by dissolution of halite, between 1000 and 10,000; and summer runoff from urban streets, between 10 and 100. These, and other distinctive elemental ratios, are useful in the reconstruction of the origin and movement of ground water, as illustrated by case studies investigating sources of salinity in ground water from Alberta, Kansas, and Arizona, and infiltration rates and pathways at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

AB  - Knowledge of deer responses to hunting pressure may affect the duration, intensity, and framework of hunt programs designed to maximize population reductions. We investigated the effects of archery hunting on deer movement and activity patterns in an urban-residential landscape. We compared deer activity, home-range size, shifts in diel core-area use, and fidelity to home ranges between hunted and unhunted deer before and during a 9-week archery hunt. We monitored 28 radiocollared does for a 24-hour period each week from April 1995 to December 1996. During the hunt, 4 of 5 hunted deer and 4 of 4 unhunted deer remained within their annual home range. Home-range size for hunted and unhunted deer was similar between the prehunt and hunt periods. However, clay home-range size expanded at least 3-fold for 2 of 5 hunted deer during the hunt compared to the prehunt period, presumably from increased human activity associated with hunting. We detected changes in deer movement patterns during the hunt within 2 weeks of the 9-week hunt. Significant shifts (<10% overlap) in core-area use between the prehunt and hunt period occurred for 4 of 5 hunted deer during the day and 3 of 5 hunted deer during the night. There were no significant shifts in core-area use for unhunted deer between the prehunt and hunt periods. Three of 4 unhunted deer did not shift either their day or night core-area use between the prehunt and hunt periods. Collared deer killed during the hunt used the hunt zone more often during the prehunt period than collared deer surviving the hunt. Day use of the hunt zone by hunted deer was less during the hunt period than during the prehunt period. Night use of the hunt zone was similar between the prehunt and hunt periods. Archery hunting had no effect on home-range size. Although most deer exhibited a strong fidelity to annual home ranges throughout the 9-week hunt, deer shifted core-area use within home ranges. We suggest that a series of short, intense hunt periods, separated by periods of no hunting, may decrease deer responses to hunting pressure and increase vulnerability during the hunt.

AB  - The distribution of PAHs in soil, leaf litter, vegetation, soil fauna, and litter fauna in a roadside environment in Brisbane, Australia, was measured using gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Sixteen common environmental PAHs were found to be widely distributed with leaf litter exhibiting the highest concentrations (1254 ng/g total wet wt). The carcinogenic PAHs benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, and indeno(1,2,3-c, d)pyrene constituted about half the total. Lipid content was positively correlated with total PAH content in the soil and leaf litter as was organic carbon content with leaf litter alone. The PAH content of leaf litter, soil, and vegetation declined exponentially with distance from the roadway, soil depth, and vegetation height, respectively. This decline was not related to the physicochemical characteristics of the compounds, suggesting that dispersal occurred as particulates with sorbed PAHs. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Plot sampling and hydraulic modeling were combined to investigate establishment and survival of plains cottonwood along Boulder Creek, an urban stream on the Colorado Plains. We tested the hypothesis that establishment is limited to bare, moist surfaces produced by spring flooding in the current year. No cottonwood germination was observed in 1989 when peak flow was low. A moderate peak of 11.9 m(3)/s in 1990 resulted in cottonwood establishment on surfaces inundated by discharges less than 15 m(3)/s. Surviving sapling cottonwoods established before 1989 occurred on surfaces inundated by discharges of 15-31 m(3)/s and dated to years with peak flows over 15 m(3)/s. Since 1969, establishment of cottonwood has been limited to a floodplain 21 m wide. Flow regulation and channel stabilization upstream and downstream of the study area have reduced the channel movement and overbank flooding that otherwise would have created bare, moist sites suitable for cottonwood establishment across a wider area. GIS analysis of aerial photographs shows that between 1937 and 1992 the channel has not moved and forest has encroached upon formerly open areas near the channel. A terrace, 317 m wide, is now dominated by trees that can reproduce in the absence of disturbance, especially the exotic crack willow.

AB  - The distribution and movement of arsenic was investigated on the Aberjona watershed in eastern Massachusetts for the purpose of identifying where and by what processes present and past human exposures to this element could have occurred. II was found that although most of the arsenic was originally released in the headwaters of the watershed, extensive migration had occurred, and the potential for human exposure existed far from designated hazardous waste sites. Both surface water and groundwater were found to be important transport pathways; arsenic moved between these two media at several locations in the watershed, with hydrology and concomitant redox, sorption, and alkylation processes determining the observed patterns of arsenic movement. These findings demonstrate that risk assessments or remedial investigations restricted to designated sites or properties in a watershed may yield both an inaccurate picture of the overall risks presented by a chemical and a less-than-optimum focus for remedial efforts. Since total recovery of the arsenic on this watershed is probably not feasible, cost-effective management will also depend on an adequate understanding of arsenic biogeochemistry and hydrologic transport processes al the watershed scale. Because the Aberjona Watershed is typical of many urban, industrialized areas, these results suggest that the whole watershed often defines the appropriate unit for investigation of chemical contamination in the environment.

AB  - The Eurodollar market, which was established in the City of London in the 1950s, can be considered the progenitor of the global financial system which exists today, for it marked the beginning of a movement away from the restrictions placed by the Bretton Woods system on international capital movements, and a return to the liberal internationalism and laissez-faire order of the private and central bankers that ended with the collapse of the gold standard in 1931. Explanations as to why this development should have taken place in London rely, for the most part, on two contending theses: (1) that it was the direct consequence of the market mechanism inevitably overcoming official obstruction, or 'friction'; (2) that deliberate state action created the conditions which allowed the market to evolve and operate. Adherents of the former claim that the Eurodollar was the innovation of the City's merchant and overseas bankers, looking to finance the rapid increase in international trade that took place at the end of the 1950s, in a world still constrained by the restrictions imposed as a consequence of placing the international economy on a war footing in 1939. Adherents of the latter claim that it was a direct consequence of deliberate action taken by the British state to re-establish the City of London as the world's foremost international financial. centre. This article, which is based on archival evidence and interviews with state and private sector figures involved in the development of the Euromarkets, argues that the City's position at the centre of the Eurocurrency system was a direct consequence of it having evolved within an institutional framework established over 100 years earlier. This seeks to challenge simple state/market dichotomies and suggests that the origins of the Euromarkets can be better understood with reference to the 'governance of regulatory space' - whether by states, markets or various associational forms. Only by examining the historical occupation of 'regulatory space' can we have a more realistic view of how financial innovation evolves.

AB  - 1. The invasion of fynbos shrublands by woody weed species can reduce the water yield from catchment areas dramatically. We modelled the consequences of uncontrolled invasion on water yield using a geographical information system (Arc/Info).
   2. Five important processes were recognized: the occurrence of fire; the spread and establishment of alien plants after fire; rainfall-to-run-off ratios; growth and changes in biomass between fires; and effects of these changes on streamflow.
   3. The simulations of water yield were modelled with the Arc/Info GRID module using a 200 x 200-m grid. It was assumed that the interval between fires was 15 years and that proliferation and dispersal of alien plants took place only after fires.
   4. Between fires, the model simulated the growth of the vegetation and its effects on streamflow, using relationships between rainfall and run-off, and run-off and aboveground biomass.
   5. Results for the Kogelberg area in the Western Cape Province showed that alien plants invaded about 40% of the grid cells within 50 years. Cover of alien plants increased from an initial estimate of 2.4% to 62.4% after 100 years.
   6. Invasion of catchment areas would result in an average decrease of 347 m(3) of water per hectare per year over 100 years, resulting in average losses of more than 30% of the water supply to the city of Cape Town. In individual years, where large areas would be covered by mature trees, losses would be much greater.
   7. In addition, invasion of fynbos by alien plants will cause the extinction of many plant species, increase the intensity of fires, destabilize catchment areas with resultant erosion and diminished water quality, and decrease the aesthetic appeal of mountain areas.
   8. Control of alien weed species is necessary to avert the above impacts, and the costs of control operations could be justified by the savings achieved in maintaining adequate water run-off from stable catchments in the long term.

AB  - A population of 48 European brown hares, caught south of the township of Heimerzheim (North Rhine-West phalia), was investigated regarding its generic diversity and structure. Analyses were performed on 4 microsatellite DNA loci as well as on the mitochondrial control region. The sampling area is divided into two regions (region A and B) by a motorway (Autobahn 61). In region A 22 hares were caught, whereas 26 hares came from region B. Regarding the distribution of haplotypes both groups are genetically structured and differ significantly from each other (Phi(ST) = 0,428, p less than or equal to 0.0001). There is only a very low maternal gene flow (N-m = 0,7). In terms of the microsatellite allele distribution, no differences were detectable between the two groups (G(ST) = 0,004). While mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally only, microsatellite DNA is inherited maternally and paternally in equal parts. Since female hares can be excluded from the gene flow due to the distribution of haplotypes, only males are responsible for the microsatellite allele exchange between the two subpopulations. The reason for these findings may on the one hand be a highly philopatric behaviour of females. On the other hand, a higher degree of dispersal or a larger home range size of males could also explain our results.

TI  - Residential mobility in Moscow during the transition

AB  - Earlier work documented an increase in residential mobility in Russian cities in the early years of the economic transition - 1992 and 1993. This paper extends this work for Moscow by confirming the higher mobility rates in 1994, indicating that the early surge in mobility was not a brief one-off phenomenon produced by pent-up demand. The paper also documents that a large share of the movers are one family nuclei from a multi-nuclei household. By 1994, the majority of movers were acquiring their new housing through market methods; waiting list procedures for state housing accounted for only about one-fifth of new occupant households. The determinants of mobility among market movers are consistent with economic theory, being a blend of dissatisfaction with the current unit (overcrowding) and ability to pay, as indicated by current income and assets. Overall, the results show a clear movement of the Moscow housing sector toward operating along market principles.

AB  - During February 1992, a series of relatively warm storms passed eastward across southern California, yielding intense precipitation that triggered widespread mass movement, flooding, property damage, and loss of life. These storms were triggered by an intense low pressure system (976 mb) off northern California which deepened as its eastward progress was initially blocked by a high pressure ridge (1040 mb) across western North America. Between February 10 and 13, large areas of Ventura and Los Angeles counties experienced cumulative precipitation of 200-400 mm with intensities reaching 40-50 mm hr(-1). Mass movement, mainly as soil slips that transformed downslope into debris flows, occurred where cumulative precipitation exceeded 300 mm and when sustained intensities exceeded 25 mm hr(-1). Stream response was rapid, particularly in urban areas where impermeable surfaces and storm drains fed concrete stream channels. The canalized upper Los Angeles River and Arroyo Simi exceeded all previous discharges for over 43 and 36 years of record, respectively. Other streams, from the large Santa Clara River to modest Malibu Creek, yielded recurrence intervals for the peak discharge of between 8 and 24 years, but the rapidity of flooding everywhere was remarkable. Whereas main trunk streams, canalized or not, responded predictably, the storm series emphasized the problems of poorly controlled development of potentially unstable hillsides and floodable lowlands and indicated a need to reassess the assumptions upon which such development is permitted.

AB  - Debris flows constitute a major threat for several urban settlements located on the fans of mountain catchments and for other infrastructures that interact with these fans, particularly highways and motorways. Often structural measures such as the construction and maintenance of deposition basins, check dams, channel linings are both too expensive and not capable of completely guaranteeing the safety for inhabitants of villages and users of infrastructures affected by debris flows. Therefore the search of functional, reliable and possibly not expensive warning systems should be pursued to increase the available tools to face this often devastating kind of phenomenon. In this paper the use of seismic detectors for the determination of a debris flow occurrence in a torrent before its arrival on the fan will be discussed, together with their potential use as monitoring and warning systems. In 1995 a set of four seismic detectors was placed at a distance of about one hundred meters from each other along a straight channel reach of a debris flow prone torrent located on the Eastern Italian Alps. The purpose, in a first phase of the research, was mainly to verify which information could be obtained through this type of device on the occasion of a debris flow occurrence. On 5 July 1995, 22 June and 8 July 1996 three debris flows were recorded by this seismic network: the data that have been collected will be presented and conveniently processed for their interpretation. The results that have been obtained show that the passage of a debris flow in a torrent can be clearly identified using seismic devices placed at a safe distance from the channel bed and that in some cases a velocity estimation of the flowing mass is also possible through the processing of the seismic data.

T2  - SPINE
LA  - English
AB  - A stratified random sample of 195 subjects was selected from the membership of an urban transit union in California, two thirds consisting of motor coach operators and one third serving as a nondriving comparison group.  Based on an orthopaedic medical history and physical examination, 80.5% of drivers were found to be experiencing back or neck pain at the time of examination, in contrast with 50.7 percent of nondrivers, itself a sizable percentage.  For both groups, most pain was mild, (53.9 and 29.9%, respectively). The amount of severe pain was essentially the same in the two groups (10.2% and 9.0%).  Both groups were most subject to low back pain.  Drivers were most distinctive for movement-related pain in the cervical spine. They were also more subject in any part of the spine to postural pain.  The latter finding suggests the need to introduce ergonomic and scheduling changes in the work of operating a motor coach.  Drivers more than nondrivers struggled against their pain by doing exercise, seeking professional treatment, and taking medications, indicating that spinal disorders constitute a prominent health concern for workers in this occupation.

TI  - FIRE EFFECTS ON CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL SYSTEMS - AN OVERVIEW
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Chaparral is a shrubby, sclerophyllous vegetation type that is common in middle elevations throughout much of California.  It occupies 3.4 Mha throughout the state in some of the steepest terrain and adjacent to some of the most populated urban areas.  Although chaparral has little direct commodity value, it does have great value in slope stabilization, watershed cover, wildlife habitat, and nutrient cycling.  Combined effects of the summer-dry climate and the high flammability of chaparral vegetation render it extremely susceptible to periodic crown fires.  Fires in the urban interface not only impact the chaparral ecosystem, but may burn homes, and also can affect regional air and water quality.  Wildfires remove plant crown cover and may alter vegetation composition.  Many chaparral plant species are well adapted to regenerate after fire, either through the ability to sprout vegetatively, or through fire-related cues that enhance germination.  Fire also alters animal habitat and affects species composition and population levels.  Perhaps most dramatic are the postfire effects on water and sediment movement.  Flooding and debris flows which are common in years after fires may cause substantial loss of soil and nutrients and major damage to homes and other structures.

AB  - Irrigation with treated municipal wastewater has been conducted at the Mas Nou Golf Course since September 1989, in the framework of a jointly sponsored demonstration project.  The results obtained during the first 18 months have provided useful criteria for ensuring a satisfactory public health protection and adequate aesthetics of the golf course facilities.  The established disinfection strategy together with the natural microbial inactivation taking place at the two landscape impoundments can provide an irrigation water with consistently less than 10 cfu/100 mL of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci.  Sudden episodes of algae removal from suspension have been experienced in the first impoundment.  However, no aesthetic deterioration or mosquito development has occurred in either of the two impoundments.  Preliminary studies of the microbial content of aerosols have shown that by an adequate disinfection of the secondary effluent and the operation of the water jets only during low wind periods it is possible to prevent microbial dispersion by aerosols.  The operation and maintenance cost of irrigation with reclaimed municipal wastewater is close to 56 ptas/m3, including pumping costs.  An effort to improve the quality of water supply, by preventing the introduction of seawater or brackish water into the sewerage network, as well as improving efficiency and reliability of wastewater treatment processes and operation and management of irrigation systems will greatly contribute to expand the water resources available at many coastal resort towns in the Mediterranean.

AB  - In this paper, a 'weak' test of the capital-switching argument developed by David Harvey is offered. With data on construction investment activity for the USA and on various alternative investments, a temporal analysis was used to assess whether evidence exists for the movement of capital from the primary to the secondary circuit. The investigation is focused specifically on the building boom of the 1980s, as that expansion has been the focus of recent theoretical and empirical work centered on the relation between urbanization and the restructuring of capital. Little support was found for the claim that capital switching has occurred, but the data do point to a delinking of real-estate investment from nonspeculative investment criteria and use-value considerations.

AB  - In the 1930s, idealistic reformers attempted to create a vast public housing program using modern architectural design. Instead they created a distinctive look that would later stigmatize its occupants. After the passage of the Housing Act of 1949, visionaries attempted to rebuild American cities by placing the poor in high-rise buildings, an experiment that was soon deemed a disaster. Today some believe that placing the poor in environments inhabited by wealthier groups will help to address the problems of poverty.
   By focusing on three periods of the low-income housing movement, this article examines how visionary idealism has led to disillusionment with housing programs. In the future, supporters of good low-income housing should present housing programs not as panaceas for deep-rooted social problems, but rather as important elements in social welfare policy. Advocates of housing should fight for programs that will produce as many units of housing as possible.

AB  - The market for rural products and services is urban-based and increasingly comprises numerous segmented markets (or "niches") of specialty goods and set vices. Rural entrepreneurs need to develop a "culture" of market research to identify market niches, rather than the traditional rural culture of the efficient production of undifferentiated primary goads. This change may be facilitated with training or, sometimes, it may occur via the in-migration of individuals with an interest in niche market entrepreneurship The unique characteristic of the territory may Ee captured by "certificates of area of origin", generally requiring regulatory enforcement.
   A series of case studies illustrate the range of niche products and services produced in contrasting rural areas and exemplify the role of entrepreneurship and movement skills required Private enterprise actions need support from the public sector. Six areas of policy response ape identified.

AB  - Retired, national YWCA leaders engaged in shared storytelling in order to explore organizational learning that occurred during 1946-1970, a critical period of organizational history for the YWCA of the USA. Adopting an organizational mission to eliminate racism by any means necessary (1970) was a culmination of individual and collective learning regarding social justice that resulted in organizational change. Themes that emerged in the shared storytelling were complemented by a search of organizational documents and studies. Describes individual and collective learning in the YWCA and its members between 1946-1970, and reports on the first phase of a study which will be conducted in five urban centres in the USA. Concludes that shared storytelling illustrates the potential and the challenge of organizational and social change when a movement commits itself to justice.

AB  - Detailed field, petrographic, and isotopic studies provide new constraints on the nature and timing of deformation in part of the Blue Ridge thrust complex in northwestern North Carolina. The Linville Falls, Stone Mountain, and Long Ridge faults, and other smaller-scale shear zones in the Beech Mountain thrust sheet show evidence of episodes of alternating ductile and brittle deformation. The resulting fault rocks include ultramylonite, ultracataclasite, and pseudotachylyte(?). Fluid phases were involved in the formation of the major shear zones and were responsible for Rb-Sr isotopic re-equilibration in strongly deformed tectonites. Our multidisciplinary study supports earlier suggestions that the latest major movement of the Blue Ridge thrust complex in the southern Appalachians occurred under mid- to upper-greenschist facies conditions during the Alleghanian orogeny around 300 Ma.

AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the relation of Mississippi Valley-type mineralization to wall-rock alteration and brecciation in the Mascot-Jefferson City district, the largest part of the East Tennessee Mississippi Valley-type ore field.  The main question of interest was whether the Mississippi Valley-type-forming brines created or greatly enlarged the breccia system that hosts the ore or whether the breccia system was a preexisting paleoaquifer that simply controlled movement of the mineralizing brines.  A secondary, and closely related, question was whether brine-wall rock interaction deposited Mississippi Valley-type ore.
   The breccia system that hosts the East Tennessee ore field began as karst breccias which formed in the upper part of the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician Knox Group during Middle Ordovician emergence.  Brecciation, which was most common at the paleosurface and in a limestone-rich zone about 200 m below the surface, took place when limestone solution caused collapse of primary dolostone layers.  Mississippi Valley-type mineralization, consisting of sphalerite and sparry dolomite, fills interstices in the breccias that formed in the limestone-rich part of the Knox Group.  Ore is associated with ''recrystalline dolomite'' that replaced limestone and there is an inverse correlation between the original limestone and sphalerite abundance suggesting that the ore-forming fluids reacted strongly with limestone wall rock, possibly dissolving it where alteration was most intense.
   The assessment of a relation between alteration and Mississippi Valley-type mineralization was based on 3,533 surface drill holes covering the 110-km2 Mascot-Jefferson City district, each of which provided stratigraphic data and quantified estimates of mineralization intensity and alteration intensity.  These data show clearly that as much as 50 percent of the limestone in the mineralized breccia section was lost over enormous areas that extend far beyond significant mineralization.  The intensity of this effect clearly decreases downdip (toward the east), away from the probable source of meteoric karst-forming waters.  These relations, combined with isotopic analyses and reaction path calculations, suggest that breccia formation and limestone dissolution took place during the original karst breccia formation.  In contrast, later Mississippi Valley-type mineralization was associated with replacement of limestone by recrystalline dolomite.  The main effect of dolomitization on the chemistry of the Mississippi Valley-type brines, an increase in their Ca/Mg ratio, would not cause sulfide precipitation.  Thus, it appears unlikely that Mississippi Valley-type-forming brines created much of their ore-hosting breccias or that water-rock interaction was a major cause of Mississippi Valley-type ore deposition.

AB  - Older people became a highly visible force in the American politics of the I930s The Townsend organisation mobilised one tenth of the U.S. elderly population prior to their direct representation in the polity as an interest group. This article utilises several theoretical social movement models to analyse how and why mobilisation occurred. It demonstrates that many factors, including phenomena associated with the social dimension of age, influenced the mechanisms of mobilisation and the movement's shape. Characteristics of this cohort of older people, including its size, life expectancy, spatial distribution, shared traditions, and symbolic frameworks were conducive to club formation and mobilisation. The period event of the Depression also triggered collective action, by exacerbating trends of changing old-age institutional supports. But the organisation expanded most where it channelled inducements to participants and evoked the cohorts' symbolic frameworks and ideals. Mobilisation also occurred within a political environment, the national stage of U.S. politics, where non-represented interest groups (such as elderly people) find it difficult to receive benefits.

CP  - Conference on Cities, Enterprises and Society at the Eve of the 21st Century
AB  - In contrast to a common hypothesis, renewed population growth in the central urban areas, the regained attractivity of the near suburbs and the significant drop in new construction activity have not slowed down the spread of population over the French territory in the last decade. Centrifugal forces remain predominant over centripetal forces. Where residential mobility in general has diminished for all age groups and for all socioprofessional categories, the scarcity situation on the real-estate market and the slowing-down of the 'de-cohabitation' of young people have not increased the occupancy rate of housing. In Paris, because they want more living space, families with children continue to leave the central zones in favour of the periphery, whereas young unmarried couples without children locate in the centre of the agglomeration. Still this movement is socially differentiated. For the well-to-do, the relative share of centrifugal movements has diminished, whereas the low income classes are increasingly obliged to move away from the centre. Rather than a 'retour au centre' one should speak for the Paris region (Ile-de-France) of a slowing down of the departure toward the periphery. But this does not challenge the general process of the spreading out of housing across a region where over 90% of the population is urban according to the definition of INSEE, the French national statistical office.

AB  - Early Intervention Alcohol/Drug Education Programs were developed by a community agency to prevent and eliminate alcohol/drug use in secondary-school pupils. No model had been planned to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs. Cognitive and affective measures were chosen to gather a full range of data. Subsequent data analyses were performed to determine the suitability of the instrumentation and to determine program outcomes.
   Analyses of the data revealed that significant growth occurred in knowledge, coupled with limited proficiency of the concepts which were taught in the program. Self-reported attitudes and usage showed movement in a negative direction and significant differences in snuff and cocaine usage and willingness to drive under the influence of alcohol between urban and rural subjects.
   Recommendations were made to modify the cognitive instrument, use only one affective instrument, and test for predictive validity of a measure of self concept.

AB  - The Brachionichthyidae (handfishes) is a little known lophiiform family endemic to SE Australia. Some of the inshore species have extremely restricted distributions, a feature that makes their populations highly vulnerable to disturbance. The spotted handfish (Brachionichthys hirsutus) is endemic to a small area of SE Tasmania and was common throughout the lower Derwent estuary and adjoining bays Drier to the mid 1980's. It has since suffered a serious decline in distribution and abundance. In June 1996, a study of B. hirsutus commenced to establish a biological profile for developing appropriate conservation strategies for the species. B, hirsutus is a small, benthic, slow moving, species that is easily approached and measured underwater. Individuals may be identified by their unique markings, which enables individual growth trajectories and movement patterns to be mapped. Growth rates of female B. hirsutus suggest that maturity is reached after 2-3 years at a size of 75-80 mm. Small numbers (80-250) of large eggs are deposited in an interconnected egg mass that is structurally unique amongst antennarioids and is wrapped around a vertical object on the bottom. The female guards the eggs which take 7-8 weeks to hatch. Handfish lack a dispersive larval stage and hatch as well-formed juveniles (6-7 mm in length) that settle immediately to the bottom. Consequently, the ability for handfish to repopulate areas from which they have been removed is expected to be low. The cause of the decline in B. hirsutus has yet to be determined. Suggested reasons include predation or habitat disturbance by a recently introduced asteroid and/or habitat modification through rural, industrial and urban development.

AB  - Introduction The epidemiological role of Aedes albopictus has been investigated in the State of S. Paulo by the study of its biological and ecological characteristics. The biting activity of Ae.albopictus taking stationary and moving collectors as parameters, is determined.
   Material and Method The study area was a small farm located in the periurban lone of Tremembe city, Vale do Paraiba, State of S. Paulo, Brazil. Aedes albopictus was caught by using two human-bait modalities. One lasted 24 hours as the collectors remained sitting in only one place and in the other the collectors visited 48 different points for five minutes each over a total period of four hours In the morning and the afternoon. Both catches,were made once a month for the period of a year (1989/90).
   Results The 24 catches undertaken yielded 637 females of Ae.albopictus, of which 54 (8.4%) and 583 (91.6%) corresponded respectively to fixed and moving human-bait conditions. An analysis of the data was mane to discover rite influence of host movement as attracting stimulus for Ae.albopictus. The biting activity took place during the day with peaks at 6:00 a.m., 1:00-2:00 p.m and the highest between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. The majority of the adults,were collected during the summer and autumn and the moving catches were positive for Ae.albopictus throughout the year Rainfall and rising temperature were correlated to the abundance of this species.
   Conclusion This study has shown the complex influence of the endogenous and exogenous factors minting to the blood feeding habit of Ae.albopictus. However it seems clear that its biting behavior depends on two distinct flights. On one, the blood feeding is obtained by the flight direct to the host, over a small supposedly short distance, and another less significant apetente flight,when collectors were in a stationary position. The biting activity rook place during the day and may occur all year round.

AB  - On January 17, 1995, a severe earthquake struck Kobe City and surrounding regions. The earthquake catered extensive damage to building, lifeline systems transportation, and port facilities, including large-scale earth structures, e.g., man-made islands.
   All the piers on the man-made islands were damaged. The damage to the piers was mostly due to the lateral displacement of concrete caissons during the severe ground shaking Consequently, the apron fell down in the cave produced by the movement of the caisson. The lateral displacement of the concrete caissons was about 7 m at maximum, and the settlement of the apron pall was about 3 m at maximum. The settlement of breakwaters was in a range between 1 and 2 m. Some of the breakwaters sank into the sea.
   Liquefaction occurred in a wide area of Port Island, but we observed that most failures of the piers were not necessarily due to the liquefaction of the reclaimed materials.

AB  - The characteristically short, intense rainstorms of Singapore occur throughout the year. The impact of such rainstorms on runoff and sediment generation from bare and grass-covered slopes of urban Singapore is examined through observations made on an experimental plot for a representative sample of natural rainstorms. While the responses of the bare surfaces to the incoming rainfall are instantaneous and significant (runoff: up to 91 per cent of total rainfall), irrespective of the dimension of the rainfall, the grass-covered slopes respond more slowly and gently (runoff: 4.8 per cent-17 per cent of the total rainfall). The sediment generating potential under the two types of landcover is closely linked to the short-term intensities of the incoming rainfall, particularly on bare surfaces where high-intensity rainstorms of less than 10 minute duration are capable of generating measurable sediment and runoff. The sediment discharge from the bare surfaces during the long construction period is not only controlled by the episodic heavy storms, but also to a considerable extent by the more frequent, low-magnitude rainstorms, which contribute to a more sustained sediment movement. With a higher frequency of occurrence, such short-duration, high-intensity rainstorms have a significant impact on the sediment and runoff generation potential of the extensive bare surfaces at the construction sites in urban Singapore.

AB  - Decadal exposure to emissions from a non-ferrous smelter has damaged the forest ecosystems surrounding the city of Monchegorsk located on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. We use the methods of tree-ring analysis to study the areal extent and timing of recent growth reductions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the region surrounding the smelter in Monchegorsk. Reduced growth of Scots pine was observed up to 30 km south-west of the smelter. This directional gradient of forest damage is related to the dispersal of pollutants,which is influenced by the prevailing northern winds and local topographic features. Old Scots pines (age 200 years +) appealed to be more sensitive than younger ones: growth reductions of old trees had started earlier and reductions were observed farther from the smelter than for younger trees.
   The findings are compared to a classification which describes the state of forest ecosystems based on the occurrence of certain plant species, the classification matched well with the observed growth trends.
   Pollution-induced changes in the climatic signal in tree-rings are also studied. The strong dependence of growth on mid-summer temperatures, typical for Scots pine on high latitudes, proved to be insensitive to effects of pollution. Changes in the climate-growth relationship rook place decades after growth trends had started to decline.

AB  - This review takes stock of contemporary social science research on homelessness. Research on homelessness in the 1980s has been prompted by the increased numbers and visibility of homeless persons including men, women, and families, as well as young people without families. Most empirical research employs a working definition of homelessness as the condition of those people who are without a permanent place to live. However, a wide range in perspectives differ over what homelessness is. In part, this reflects recognition of some the dynamics of homelessness that include intermittent movement in and out of homeless situations. But it also reflects changes in social values over what constitutes adequate housing. Research shows that the population of homeless persons is diverse, although most homeless persons are young and single. Many have severe chronic problems including mental illness, alcoholism, physical disabilities, and poor health. A significant number have criminal histories. Many were raised in foster care situations. All suffer from economic deprivation, and many have experienced long-term unemployment. Considerable disagreement exists over the number of homeless persons, in part because the scarcity of resources to address this problem politicizes the debate. There is also strong disagreement over the root causes of homelessness.
   Debate over the causes of homelessness is caught up in whether the focus of research should be on structural forces that permit homelessness to occur or the immediate reasons why people become homeless. Research now suggests that the extreme situation of homelessness may be more accurately portrayed as the result of the convergence of many factors that drive this phenomenon, including housing market dynamics, housing and welfare policy, economic restructuring and the labor market, and personal disabilities. Policies designed to ameliorate homelessness have been inadequate to stem the tidal forces that produce such severe destitution, and this trend is likely to continue. Future important directions include addressing the role of employment and social ties in producing homelessness, comparing the economic and social situation of homeless and non-homeless persons, evaluating programs designed to aid homeless persons, and developing international comparisons of homelessness.

TI  - FROM DISCONTENT TO PROTEST - INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL CAUSES OF THE 1989 PRODEMOCRACY MOVEMENT IN CHINA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Based on a secondary analysis of a survey involving more than 2,500 urban working residents in China, this study tests several individual-level causes of protest behavior suggested by the research on protest in the West. The timing of the survey, just three months before the I989 massive upheaval in China, makes the study especially valuable. Results from path analysis show that age, education, and Communist Party membership have both direct and indirect impacts on protest, in an expected way. Income has only an indirect effect, whereas the impact of gender is not significant because the direct and indirect effects counter each other. Occupation does not make a difference. In addition, discontent with economic reforms, distrust in the government, aspirations for Western democracy, and disillusionment with Communist ideology all significantly enhance protest behavior. Postmaterialist values, which contribute positively to political protest in the West, play a suppressor role in China's context, which offers interesting implications for comparative research on public opinion and political behavior.

AB  - Ludwigia peruviana is an aquatic shrubby species introduced from the Americas and spreading to wetlands in coastal south-eastern Australia. It has become dominant, replacing much of the former vegetation in the Botany Wetlands, a series of shallow urban swamps and lakes near Sydney, Australia. Studies of L. peruviana were essential to the development of a management plan for the Botany Wetlands. Ecological studies were conducted in situ and supplemented by a series of germination and growth experiments in controlled environments. Flowering peaked in early autumn. Seed production for 1990-91 was similar to 450000 seeds m(-2) and there was also similar to 65000 seeds m(-2) in the soil seed bank and similar to 300000 seeds m(-2) in old fruits that remained on the stems over winter. The seeds are similar to 0.8 mm long, weigh similar to 0.05 mg, are hydrophobic, usually germinate while afloat, and are easily dispersed by water, machinery and birds. Viability of fresh seed was 99% (tetrazolium dye test), and similar to 20% of seeds were dormant. Dormancy appeared to break down within two years. Propagation and dispersal may also occur by means of stem pieces that produce new shoots. New plants from seed, seedlings or stem fragments may become established on strand lines or form floating islands that may eventually become stranded. Management needs to focus on control of the seedlings and soil seed bank.

TI  - The consequences of international migration for the status of women: A Turkish study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA  - English
KW  - HISTORY
KW  - TURKEY
AB  - As part of a larger inquiry into the consequences of international migration for those who remain in the country of origin, 234 adults in four Turkish provinces were interviewed concerning matters (mostly opinions) pertaining to the status of women. Three migrant-status categories were defined; (a) Returned migrants, (b) Non-migrant close kin or friends of migrants, and, as a control group, (c) All others. Controlling for age, sex, urban-rural residence, and schooling, group (a) was the most likely to express ''non-traditional'' views, and group (c) the least. Group (b) was in between.
   Of the two possible explanations for such a pattern - recruitment and socialization - we found recruitment highly significant. The evidence for socialization, however, was decidedly mixed. Some of the considerable diversity of viewpoints pertaining to the status of women found in this inquiry are doubtless causally associated with the experience of migration, whether direct or indirect. But there is also evidence here of a society in the process of rapid change; and it is these more general social changes, not migration as such, that would appear to be more likely to affect the status of women.
   There is little support for the contention that the type of international migration that has involved so many Turks these past three decades - migration that has for the most part been temporary and economically motivated and has consisted of movement from relatively poor agricultural or but slightly industrialized areas to rich, highly industrialized ones characterized by marked differences in language, religion, and overall culture - is going to result in moving the status of women from a more to a less ''traditional'' plane.

AB  - Four cylindrical sinkholes occurred between April 1988 and June 1989 in a residential area located 27 km south of Kuwait City.  The physiographic and geological conditions of their development and the methods of survey followed to detect potential subsurface cavities in the area are discussed.  The major sinkhole is 15 m in diameter and 31 m deep; the others are a few metres in size.  A mechanism of migrating sinkholes is suggested, where the upper clastic sediments have been moved down into cavities of the underlying Dammam Limestone.  Such movement could have been triggered by garden irrigation and urbanization.  A conceptual model is introduced to explain the mechanism of this subsidence.  Microgravity techniques were applied using a La Coste Model-D gravimeter to detect areas of subsurface weakness.  Negative anomalies in the order of 80 microgals were recorded and considered to indicate underground cavities or zones of contrasted mass-deficiencies representing high risk areas.  Moderate anomalies were also recorded and attributed to poor compaction of the ground prior to construction.

LA  - English
CP  - 4th International Symposium on Rockbursts and Seismicity in Mines
AB  - Rock masses in deep-level mines are subject to high stresses, which can result in unexpected failure of rock into mined-out openings. Historically, various independent methods have been used to discern the causes of rock bursts and to evaluate stress conditions in rock masses susceptible to violent failure. Personnel from two research centers of the former U.S. Bureau of Mines, Spokane and Twin Cities, investigated a rock burst that occurred in May of 1994 in a rock mass between the 4400 and the 4600 levels of the Sunshine Mine, Kellogg, ID. The team evaluated the current state of stress in the pillar and the most likely cause of the rock burst by studying the seismic history of the pillar, examining the geology, analyzing the available in situ stress data, calculating possible fault-plane solutions for the burst, and performing a seismic velocity tomographic survey. The results of the study showed that post-rock-burst seismicity was concentrated about 15 to 30 m west of and about 15 m above the rock-burst location. The pillar is composed of a very hard sericitic-to-vitreous quartzite of a type rarely found in the mine, but that is often found in other district mines having a history of seismic activity. In situ stress analysis of the pillar and the surrounding rock mass showed a probable stress rotation from northwest-southeast to east-west. Of four fault plane solutions, the most probable was either a left-lateral, strike-slip movement with a compressive principal stress oriented nearly north-south, or a right-lateral, strike-slip movement oriented east-west. Finally, tomographic images showed low-velocity areas (interpreted as areas of low stress) associated with the crosscuts and haulageways, and high-velocity areas (interpreted as areas of high stress) associated with the rock-burst location. High velocities were also found in a planar area oriented in an elongate northeast-southwest direction.

AB  - Chamaecrista chamaecristoides (Colladon) I. & B. is a tropical shrubby legume endemic to the Mexican coastal sand dunes of the Gulf of Mexico and to a lesser extent, of the Pacific coast. It grows mainly on mobile dunes, and it is the first colonizer. In this study we present information regarding the plant's geographical distribution, range of habitats, physiological ecology, population biology, reproduction, its role in geomorphology and interactions with other species. Ch. chamaecristoides is very tolerant to drought and low nutrient availability in the soil. Biomass accumulation and relative growth rates increase significantly when seedlings are covered by sand. The legume may be considered as a nurse plant that modifies environmental conditions and facilitates the successional process. Temperature fluctuations in the shade of adult plants decrease noticeably when compared with bare sand temperatures. Further, bacterial and mycorrhizal associations are abundant. All these characteristics probably play an important role in dune dynamics since late colonizers are only able to arrive after Ch. chamaecristoides has reached a rather high (2x2m) plant cover. The plant's hard coated seeds germinate gradually throughout the year, after seeds have been exposed to naturally occurring temperature fluctuations on the sand surface. Seedling mortality is very high during the first three months, and only 5% reach adult stage. Winter storms are a major cause of death, since drought and sand movement become drastic during these months (November to March). We found that seedling size plays an important role in survival and reproduction. Larger seedlings are the ones with higher survival rates and reproduce earlier. Ch. chamaecristoides plants decrease sand movement and hold the substrate together, promoting dune stabilization. This is important to humans, since mobile dunes continuously encroach nearby roads, cities and crop fields. There is no practical experience in dune stabilization with this species.

AB  - The Xinmincun Formation forms the uppermost unit of a thick Neoproterozoic section which accumulated near the east margin of the North China Block and is overlain by two thin nearshore to continental formations below fossiliferous Lower Cambrian sediments. Although tectonically deformed, sedimentary structures are preserved undeformed on cleavage-parallel surfaces, and an 80 m section has been reconstructed by correlation across minor folds and faults in the Golden Stone beach area, 50 km NE of the city of Dalian, southern Liaoning province.
   The measured section shows 65 m of storm-dominated deposits, consisting of alternations of micrites and sharp-based graded intraclastic grainstone beds (tempestites), some with rudaceous, commonly erosional or guttered, bases. The top 15 m of section shows three alternations of similar subtidal lithofacies with partly to completely dolomitized peritidal deposits (laminated, sometimes fenestral and desiccated, micrite beds, and intraclastic rudite and grainstone beds). Tempestite beds become thinner and less abundant upwards towards a muddy upper shoreface zone. This environment was characterized in part by the occurrence of micrite with thin or streaky lamination (probable storm-resuspended sediment), interbedded tempestites, numerous erosion surfaces, and evidence of liquidization and sediment slumping into hollows.
   Molar tooth structures are widespread in micrite beds of the Xinmincun Formation and are present in lesser abundance in tempestites and liquefied channel-fills. Originally the structures were sub-vertical cracks, 1-20 cm long, tapering upwards and downwards. Subsequently they became filled with microspar cement and buckled rigidly during compaction of surrounding sediment during burial. Evidence of repeated episodes of cracking, presence of brecciated cracks and localization of cracking within beds, together with variable degree of development and variation of preferential alignment in plan indicates a mechanical origin. Crack generation may have been by seismic surface waves generated by movement along faults defining either the basin's margins or its internal structure, or possibly by wave action during storms. A seismic origin for molar tooth structure is consistent with other Neoproterozoic occurrences. Their preferential occurrence in Precambrian deposits arises from the relative rigidity of micritic sediment at this time related to lack of bioturbation, incipient cementation and possibly microbial binding.

AB  - Five models for predicting rates of aeolian sand transport were evaluated using empirical data obtained from field experiments conducted in April, 1994 at a beach on Inch Spit, Co. Kerry, Republic of Ireland. Measurements were made of vertical wind profiles (to derive shear velocity estimates), beach slope, and rates of sand transport. Sediment samples were taken to assess characteristics of grain size and surface moisture content. Estimates of threshold shear velocity were derived using grain size data. After parsing the field data on the basis of the quality of shear velocity estimation and the occurrence of blowing sand, 51 data sets describing rates of sand transport and environmental conditions were retained. Mean grain diameter was 0.17 mm. Surface slopes ranged from 0.02 on the foreshore to about 0.11 near the dune toe. Mean shear velocities ranged from 0.23 m s(-1) (just above the observed transport threshold) to 0.65 m s(-1). Rates of transport ranged from 0.02 kg m(-1) h(-1) to more than 80 kg m(-1) h(-1). These data were used as input to the models of Bagnold [Bagnold, R.A., 1936. The Movement of Desert Sand. Proc. R. Soc. London, A157, 594-620], Kawamura [Kawamura, R., 1951. Study of Sand Movement by Wind. Translated (1965) as University of California Hydraulics Engineering Laboratory Report HEL 2-8, Berkeley], Zingg [Zingg, A.W., 1953. Wind tunnel studies of the movement of sedimentary material. Proc. 5th Hydraulics Conf. Bull. 34, Iowa City, Inst. of Hydraulics, pp. 111-135], Kadib [Kadib, A.A., 1965. A function for sand movement by wind. University of California Hydraulics Engineering Laboratory Report HEL 2-8, Berkeley], and Lettau and Lettau [Lettau, K. and Lettau, H., 1977. Experimental and Micrometeorological Field Studies of Dune Migration. In: K. Lettau and H. Lettau (Eds.), Exploring the World's Driest Climate. University of Wisconsin-Madison, IES Report 101, pp. 110-147]. Correction factors to adjust predictions of the rate of transport to account for the effects of slope and moisture content were calculated using the models of Bagnold [Bagnold, R.A., 1973. The nature of saltation and 'bed-load' transport in water. Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A, 332, 473-504] and Belly [Belly, P.-Y., 1964. Sand movement by wind. U.S. Army Corps Eng. CERC. Tech. Mem. 1, Washington D.C., 38 pp.], respectively. None of the models was able to produce a strong correspondence between measured and predicted rates of transport. Best results were obtained using the Bagnold and Zingg models, and the Kadib model was the least viable of this group. The influence of sediment moisture content appeared to be the critical factor in degrading model viability. Overall, none of the models is adequate for general applications to coastal-aeolian environments where moisture content complications tend to override the predictive competence of the simple transport formulations.

AB  - Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) mosquitoes colonized from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, were fed on blood suspensions containing either Barmah Forest (BF) virus, dengue virus type 1 (DEN-1), dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2), dengue virus type 3 (DEN-3), or dengue virus type 1 (DEN-4). Ae notoscriptus was shown to be moderately susceptible to oral infection with BF virus, ID50 = 10(3.3) CCID50 per mosquito, with titers in infected mosquitoes peaking 10 d after infection. BF virus transmission occurred between days 5 and 12, with an average rate of 45% (range, 40-50%). For DEN 1-4, Ae. notoscriptus showed low level susceptibility to oral infection, with maximum head and thorax squash infection rates of 8, 5, 13, and 3%, respectively. Rates of infection were notably higher in a north Queensland strain of Aedes aegypti (L.) used as a positive control, with maximum thorax squash infection rates of 58, 68, 78, and 60% for DEN 1-4, respectively. On the basis of these ;data, it is concluded that Ae. notoscriptus could act as an efficient vector of BF in urban environments, but it is unlikely to be an important vector of DEN.

AB  - Objective. To compare malnutrition rates between migrant and non-migrant children. Material and methods. One-hundred and sixty children 1-6 years old were selected at random from schools located in highly marginated areas. Excluded were infants with congenital malformations or under nutritional intervention. Migration was defined as any geographical movement during the last 6 years. Malnutrition was assessed through the weight/height and height/ age indicators, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Results. Fifty-nine percent of the infants belonged to families whose father had a non-qualified occupation, 27.5% of them did not finish elementary school. Fifty-three referred migration; malnutrition rate was 51.3% among migrant infants and 28.8%, among non-migrant infants (OR 2.6, Cl95%= 1.2, 5.2, p= 0.006). Migrant children registered a mean Z score of -2.4+/-.40 and non-migrant children, -2.3+/-.33, based on the indicator height for age. Conclusions. Chronic malnutrition among migrant infants justifies a nutritional intervention, they constitute a specific group at risk. Migration should be considered for health planning.

AB  - Rainfall at the site of Union City, California, during early Holocene time appears to have been about half that of today, 470 mm/yr, We base this conclusion on detailed descriptions and particle-size analyses of 12 soil profiles and 1:20 scale logs of the fluvial stratigraphy in two 100-m-long, 5-m-deep excavations dug perpendicular to the axis of an alluvial fan along the Hayward fault. Subsidence and right-lateral movement along the fault allowed an offset stream to produce a nearly continuous alluvial record documented by 35 C-14 ages on detrital charcoal. Bk (calcitic) horizons in paleosols developed in the fan suggest that a relatively dry climatic period occurred from 10 to 7 ha (calendar-corrected ages). The pedogenic calcite exists primarily as vertically oriented filaments and fine, cavernous nodules formed at ped intersections. Soils and paleosols formed before 10 ha or since 7 ha did not have Bk horizons. Bk horizons that were buried suddenly at 7 ka were overlain by leached zones averaging 41 +/- 3 cm thick-about half the current depth of leaching.

AB  - Aerodynamic size of fungus spores determines particle motion including settling under gravity, resuspension, and transport by air movement, and where fungus allergens are deposited in the human respiratory tract. Field investigation was conducted to evaluate size characteristics of ambient fungus spores in Taipei city by Andersen six-stage viable sampler in summer and winter seasons. It was found that the highest number of concentrations occurred at nighttime, with a concentration value above 1,700 CFU m(-3), but decreased to a level of 450-600 CFU m(-3) at daytime. Moreover, large numbers of fungus spores isolated were found to be in the size range of 2.1-3.3 mu m with a geometric mean diameter in the size range of 1.96-3.40 mu m. The significant concentration variations between daytime and nighttime samples were demonstrated because of a large number increase in the size range of 1.1-3.3 mu m. In addition, size distributions of the yeasts were found to be remarkably different from those of Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. The observations of size differences among the important fungus allergens demonstrated that there might also be significant differences in their behavior and respiratory deposition.

AB  - The paper describes physical model studies of the 1988 failure of Unit B-19 waste landfill at the Kettleman Hills Landfill, Kettleman City, California. Six 1/150 scale models were tested under 1-g (g = gravity) conditions. Aims of the study were to confirm the mode of failure and to provide a better understanding of the sliding mechanism. Results showed that the failure conditions (e.g., slide direction, magnitude, and surface cracking, etc.) of the models agreed very well with those of the actual landfill. The study indicated that the sliding of model fills occurred as a coherent mass, with slip surfaces located at the interface within the underlying liner system. Internal shears and surface cracks were formed in the slide mass due to the noncircular configuration of the slip surface. Displacement paths suggested the sliding of model landfill was essentially a translational movement of a three-block system. The models accurately reproduced the 1988 Kettleman Hills Landfill failure and provided information that enabled development of an analysis method for evaluating the three-dimensional stability of waste landfills against sliding along an underlying liner system (Chang 1992).

AB  - One hundred and thirty carcasses of the red fox were collected in Tochigi Prefecture, by the Tochigi Prefectural Museum, from 1981 to 1991.  The young/adult ratio of sample was 1.60, which suggests that the hunting pressure has been relatively low in this area.  Six percent of the animals were 5 years or older which compares to those taken in Hokkaido, but is higher than those in Europe and North America.  The sex ratio for all specimens had a tendency towards male bias (0.587), but this bias was higher for the adult (0.605) than for the young (0.576).  Among young (0 year-old) foxes, more individuals were killed on roads than by trapping or shooting (P<0.02, chi-square test).  This mortality pattern was caused by high mortality of young males (P<0.02).  The proportions of adults killed by the three mortality factors were similar, though only one of the 14 foxes older than 4 years old was shot, probably due to age-linked activity patterns.  Most road-kills of young foxes occurred in May when juveniles began exploiting and in November when sub-adults began dispersal.  The ratios of road-kills for the whole sample and for adults alone were 42% and 34%, respectively.  These high rates of road-kills suggest that the mortality pattern in Tochigi has been affected by factors characteristic of urban environments.

AB  - Data produced by the Moroccan national seismological network and marine seismic reflection profiles an used to investigate the most seismically active region in Morocco, located on the Mediterranean coast at the intersection of the Rif mountain belt and the submarine Alboran Ridge. This region, in the vicinity of the city of Al-Hoceima, marks an east-west transition in the marine and land deformation styles of the distributed plate boundary between Africa and Iberia, and was the site of an M-w = 6.0 earthquake on 26 May 1994.
   The epicenter of the Al-Hoceima earthquake is relocated onshore, refining the initial submarine location close to the Alboran Ridge. The spatial distribution of foreshocks and aftershocks shows a NE-SW trend that continues partly offshore and is subparallel to the earlier, yet still prominent, Miocene geologic structural trend. The predominantly strike-slip focal mechanism for the Al-Hoceima event is characteristic of earthquakes in the region. Marine seismic reflection profiles that intersect the offshore region of seismicity image active high-angle faults with possible strike-slip components. The seismicity trend is not directly related to the submarine Alboran Ridge or the geomorphologically prominent Nekor fault. Deformation appears to be occurring on a number of subsidiary strike-slip faults that together compose a NE-SW zone of distributed shear.
   The distributed strike-slip and documented normal faulting taking place in the eastern Rif mountains, although characteristic of the Rif region, are in contrast to the thrusting style of deformation that occurs farther to the east in the Algerian Tell Atlas. This may be related to the reported lateral variations and evolution of the convergent plate boundary in these regions during the Neogene and Quaternary times.

AB  - An autochthonous case of human onchocerciasis was reported 13 years ago in the town of Minacu, northern Goias (Brazil), but a subsequent survey of the population using the traditional technique of examining skin biopsies with the light microscope failed to detect other cases. Recent surveys using more sensitive diagnostic techniques (serodiagnosis, DNA probes, Mazzotti test) that are detailed in this paper revealed the presence of other cases of the disease in Minacu, the nearby town of Formoso and at the Buracao gold mine near Parana. The data show that transmission of the disease has occurred to local people living in town and on farms and that gold miners (garimpeiros) are a likely source of infection.

AB  - This article investigates the issue of HIV and mobile populations in the Mekong Region countries (Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam), with particular regard to cross-border migrants (both legal and undocumented), internal migrants, sex workers, and mobile occupational groups such as truck drivers; fishermen, seafarers and cross-border traders. Economic opening in the region is occurring rapidly as some Mekong States move from centrally planned to market economies and some locations undergo unprecedented economic growth. The uneven nature of economic development has resulted in imbalances between rural and urban, agricultural and industrial areas, and in most places the health and education systems are inadequate for the needs of these new residents. Much of the movement between countries is illegal (i.e., by persons without necessary travel documents).
   At the same time, HIV/AIDS is highly prevalent in much of the region, particularly in Myanmar and Thailand. Responses to the epidemic range from extremely limited approaches in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar to wide-ranging and sophisticated strategies in Thailand. In recent years China has begun to devote increased efforts to HIV/AIDS research and interventions in its huge "floating population" and to the provinces bordering the other South-East Asian countries. However, there is as yet little systematic focus on migration and HIV/AIDS at a national level, and no significant regional cooperation on the issue.
   Nevertheless, several region-wide research/interventions have been created by aid organizations, NGOs and academic institutions in recent years, and these show considerable potential as models. AIDS Control and Prevention Project's (AIDSCAP) cross-border "hotspot" studies have included river trade routes on the Thai-Lao border and fishing ports in Thailand and Cambodia. The Asian Research Centre for Migration (ARCM)'s project on Trans-national Population Movement and HIV/AIDS, based at Thailand's Chulalongkhorn University, has studied groups and issues such as migrant fishermen in six countries, Burmese migrant women in Thailand, various migrant populations in the Thai-Myanmar border regions, and the impact of transport and infrastructure development on the spread of HIV/AIDS along six main inter-country routes. Finally, the Coordination of Action Research on AIDS and Mobility (CARAM), which began as a partnership between the Malaysian NGO Tenaganita and the Free University of Amsterdam,(2) now involves eight South-East Asian countries in a range of self-selected research and action projects by NGOs.
   There are also a number of research and interventions in individual countries in the Mekong region, the greatest efforts currently being mounted by China and Thailand. In the past decade, the latter country has seen the entry of large numbers of undocumented economic migrants, the most numerous being illegal immigrants from Myanmar (currently estimated at close to a million persons) and over-staying Chinese nationals (about 100,000 persons). Perhaps one million guest workers enter Thailand each year. At the same time, Thailand displays the most diversity in research approaches and the highest level of research capacity among the Mekong countries, not surprisingly given the comparative length of the epidemic and the relatively high level of economic development and social openness. Research into a broad range of migrant labour issues and worker legal status appears to have some influence on government policy direction.

TI  - THE WATER-TABLE IN THE TOKYO DISTRICT
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The aim of this study was to reveal the mechanisms of occurrence, movement, and distribution of unconfined water under the Tokyo District, Japan's largest city, and the outlying areas, where its people live and do business. As many as 15 simultaneous investigations were made to determine the exact level of the groundwater table and the long-term fluctuations of the water level. The work was aided by automatic recorders, aquifer testing, geological observations, and topographical and other related studies undertaken from 1966 to the present. Unconfined groundwater systems in the Tokyo area are controlled by the geology and topography of a diluvial upland and alluvial lowland. The former is represented by a deposit referred to as the Kanto loam, which is a volcanic ejecta originating from the volcanos of Fuji and Hakone. An aquifer, representing the unconfined water beneath the upland, is probably related to terrace gravels widely distributed throughout the upland area. It should be noted that in some sections of the area, the Kanto loam forms groundwater mounds, and shallow well zones have been presently confirmed which have been there since ancient times and are used as a partial source for household water supplies. This means that the unconfined water now available seems to come from several formations and is related to the topography and geology of that particular area. The massive movement of people to the suburbs of the western part of Tokyo began in the latter half of the 20th century. During this urbanization, there was a tremendous need for housing and subsequent need for additional and dependable water supplies. This need was met by the introduction of advanced equipment and technical knowledge. Changes in the hydrological environment caused by the urbanization of the area are, at present, so serious that immediate action needs to be taken for a more permanent and stable supply of groundwater. This can only be achieved by adequate maintenance of the surrounding environment as well as conservation of the underground water resources. This article discusses quantitatively the analytical reports of the changes found as a result of a hydrological survey of that environment.

AB  - A regional isopach map of the Cardium Formation north of Township 65 indicates that this formation thins northwestward against the southern flank of the Peace River Arch.  This may be evidence of syndepositional uplift of the Arch during Turonian time.  Cardium isopachs also have a strong northwest-southeast trend that parallels the Fox Creek Escarpment and a series of basement structures.  Detailed log correlation in northeast British Columbia shows that two phases of localized fault movement have occurred.  The first phase (late Turonian) offsets the E3 and lower markers in the Cardium, but does not affect the top of the Cardium (E7 surface).  The second phase (mid-late Coniacian) offsets the E7 surface and overlying markers in the Muskiki Formation, but does not affect the Marshybank Formation, of early Santonian age.  These faults do not appear to reflect any of the regional structural trends associated with the Peace River Arch.

AB  - Pre-oviposition ejaculation as a mating tactic of sneaker males in the rose bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus, was studied under natural and artificial conditions. In a small pond in Yao city, Osaka, Japan, the operational sex ratio of males and females was found to be approximately 3.5:1 and the proportion of males to the mussels, which serve as spawning beds for the rose bitterling, was approximately 2:1. Competitively subordinate rose bitterling males which spawned into the mussels participated in mating by sneaking, because not all males could occupy territories around the mussels. The sneaker males often released sperm not only after but also before egg-laying (this ejaculation movement by the male before egg-laying is termed 'pre-oviposition ejaculation'). In pair spawning with sneaker, the sneakers frequently performed preoviposition oviposition ejaculations, which territorial males never performed. In the field, pre-oviposition ejaculations by sneakers coincided with the leading of females by territorial males. Under artificial conditions, I demonstrated by using electrophoretic paternal analyses that the pre-oviposition ejaculations by the sneakers were more effective than the post-oviposition ejaculations by the territorial males. In addition, there were negative size-dependences in ejaculation achievement rate and fertilization success of the sneaker males.

AB  - During and after the very wet 1991/1992 winter experienced in Jordan, significant slope failures occurred along several sections of the new Irbid-Amman highway in Jordan. The topography over most of the route is hilly, and significant amounts of cut and fill were used to construct the highway. One such slope failure lies at 44+800 km on the highway south of Jerash City at a distance of about 5.0 km from Wadi Zerqa bridge. A landslide occurred downslope of the highway embankment resulting in a collapse of the most of the gabbion wall supporting the embankment. This paper deals with the overall stability of the slope at 44+800 km. It presents the geological and geotechnical studies carried out at this site, identifies the causes and mechanism of instability, and presents appropriate remedial measures. The study concluded that the landslide movement occurred within the colluvium material. It resulted primarily from excess piezometric pressures generated within the slope as a direct consequence of inadequate drainage. It is recommended to reconstruct the entire gabbion wall with its foundation seated on the sandstone that underlies the colluvium and to install a surface drainage system at the site.

AB  - In this paper, the temporal and spatial expansion of the Egyptian goose in the Netherlands are described and analysed. The species bred near The Hague for the first time in 1967. In 1983 a second settlement developed in Drenthe. Both settlements expanded. Together, they contained about 1340 breeding pairs in 1994. For both settlements a linear relationship exists between the square root of the area occupied and time. In both cases, population growth is exponential. The bird behaves as a resident species. Thus, in winter numbers in The Netherlands also increase exponentially. The Egyptian goose seems to be sensitive to severe winters, which cause a high mortality. The observed velocity of range expansion is compared with the velocity as calculated with the expansion model of Van den Bosch et al. (1990). The observed velocity was about 3.0km per year, which is about 20% lower than expected, but not significantly different. Population growth was estimated using a projection matrix. In the first 10 years after its settlement near The Hague, the actual population growth was larger than the calculated growth. There is evidence for good breeding success during the first years due to mild winters between 1972 and 1978. In the second settlement, Drenthe, the same rapid population growth occurred. Here, a low but regular influx of birds from a nearby city park was probably the main factor. In the near future, further temporal and spatial expansion can be expected, in the direction of Germany and Denmark in the east and Belgium and France in the south. Towards the east the severity of the winters might limit further range expansion, possibly coinciding with the 0 degrees isotherm in January.

AB  - The problem of land degradation in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is not a new phenomenon, but during the last decade it has grown to be a serious threat to the delicate desert ecosystems, and also to the urban and industrial areas, due to an increase in sand movement. The area under investigation is situated on the Gulf coast north of Jubail and is approximately 20 km in width centered along the coastline. The total area is almost 1000 km(2). Eight vegetation types were classified according to the dominant and co-dominant species. A comparative study of the vegetation in a fenced, non-grazed area and in an open grazed area showed that the impact of grazing and recreational activities have largely reduced the value of the rangelands. The reduction in species diversity and density leads to an increase in wind and sand dynamics. Exposed roots, giant ripples, changes in the extension of inland sabkhas and new active dunes could be observed in many parts of the study area. It could be proved that most inland sabkhas in the area are pure deflational features with considerable dynamic due to the reduction in vegetation cover during the recent years. The monitoring of vegetation density was carried out during helicopter flights with the help of GPS and a video camera. Image processing on a personal computer allowed accurate calculations of vegetation density. Observations on active dune fields in the area showed that the size of the dune fields almost doubled in 15 months. Tests in small enclosures showed that there is a potential for natural recovery even in severely damaged areas. In just one year without grazing and with average precipitation there is a significant difference in vegetation cover. Strict grazing management and camping regulations are required to prevent further degradation and allow the recovery of damaged ecosystems. Community involvement and education is necessary for the development of an understanding of regulations and the need for preservation. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Pesticides used in urban environments can be transported in runoff to downstream waters and cause adverse environmental consequences. This experiment assessed the effects of post-application irrigation depth (0, 6.4, and 12.7 mm) and formulation (liquid and granular) on concentration and transport of diazinon (a pesticide commonly used for lawn insect control) in runoff from "tall" fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plots. The post-application irrigation was applied using rainfall simulators immediately following diazinon application. The rainfall simulators were again used approximately 2 h after diazinon application to apply the equivalent of a heavy rainfall (64 mm/h for approximately 1.5 h) to generate runoff Runoff was sampled and analyzed for diazinon using the enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay method. Post-application irrigation depth had no effect on diazinon concentration but increased diazinon mass transported off the plot by increasing plot runoff Flow-weighted mean runoff diazinon concentration for the liquid formulation of diazinon was roughly double that of the granular formulation (0.59 vs 0.29 mg/L), attributed to the higher solubility of the liquid formulation relative to the granular formulation. The results indicate that post-application irrigation can increase runoff losses of diazinon for heavy rainfall occurring soon. after application, but that these losses can be reduced by use of the granular formulation.

AB  - Malignant neoplasms confer a special significance to the relationship between terminally ill patients and their immediate environment and directly influence the patient's place of death. This study analyzed the factors that influenced the place of death of cancer patients in Majorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). A survey was carried out among 335 surviving relatives who acted as primary care-givers. Information from interviews and data from medical records showed that 46% of the deaths occurred at home. The patients' place of residence (two of three patients from rural areas died at home and two of three patients from urban areas died in the hospital) and their sociocultural level (a higher proportion of deaths occurred in the hospital among patients of lower socioeconomic levels) were the family and social factors that had the greatest influence in determining the place of death. The opinions of those interviewed, the majority of whom were women (female/male ratio, 3.5:1), as to the admission and discharge of the deceased from the hospital and the impact on the family of the patient's death were analyzed. There were marked differences in the overall perception of the terminal phase of illness in hospital-centered and home-centered groups. The relatives of those who died at home were significantly less distressed.

AB  - Objective: To measure the influence of age on measures of nocturnal activity and immobility in 100 healthy subjects aged 50 to 98 years.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Urban population in Leiden. Recordings were performed at home while the subjects maintained their habitual 24-hour pattern of activities.
   Participants: 100 subjects without a history of major medical disorders and a normal neurological examination and performance-oriented assessment of gait (Tinetti).
   Measurements: Motor activity was recorded during six successive nights with a wrist-worn activity monitor. The occurrence of supra-threshold motor activity was recorded over 15-second epochs. A questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep habits and the occurrence of sleep disturbances. Four mean measures reflecting activity or immobility during the nocturnal period were calculated for each subject.
   Results: Only one out of four measures, (ie, the nocturnal proportion of time with movement, increased with age for females. For males, no age effects emerged. The mean duration of nocturnal immobility periods was higher in females than in males. Also, for females, the use of hypnotics increased with successive decades. Sex and the use of hypnotics were significantly related to the mean duration of immobility periods.
   Conclusion: If care is taken not to confound aging with illness, measures of nocturnal activity and immobility reveal only marginal effects of aging.

AB  - An integrated approach to real-time prediction of point rainfall is presented. This is based on the assumption that hourly rainfall at a station can be predicted by a Multivariate AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (MARIMA) process. The real-time calibration of the multivariate model is performed by combining radar maps and data from rain gages. Accordingly, radar maps provide the basic information for a storm tracking procedure which enables to detect the direction and the speed of storm movement. Storm tracking is used to select those stations which are characterized by the highest Lagrangian cross-correlation of observed precipitation, and which are therefore best suitable for application of the multivariate model. The parameters of the multivariate model are finally estimated using only observed rainfall at the selected stations throughout the current event. Preliminary results of an application to some events which occurred in northern Italy show that the combined use of radar and rain gages allows for an increased efficiency of the MARIMA model performances, as compared with empirical selection of stations to be considered by the multivariate model. The multivariate approach performs better also when it is compared with simple nowcasting procedures based on rain gage data or on radar data used separately. Finally, some considerations are issued in view of a systematic use of this technique to nowcast rainfall intensity in small urban or natural catchments, with a response time of less than 1 or 2 h.

AB  - This review is intended to bring together and summarize the various research and surveillance projects which have been undertaken by AEA Technology concerning the radioactivity in the environment which resulted from the Chernobyl accident in April 1986. Another review on the same topic was prepared by Cambray et al,1 which covered the first few months after the accident occurred. The present review consists primarily of an updating and extension of the previous one, up to 1989. It includes details of the radioactivity released to the atmosphere during the accident. The work reported includes: measurements of concentrations of radionuclides in airborne particulate and deposited materials, their interpretation in terms of atmospheric residence times of Chernobyl material and resuspension; measurements of the accumulated deposits of Chernobyl radionuclides in soils and their uptake by plants, including studies in upland areas particularly affected by high deposits and studies in lowland areas supporting a variety of crops and pastures; a review of radionuclides in European food imports, and the periodic measurements in a group of human volunteers; measurements of the dietary intake of radiocaesium in the same group of volunteers; measurements of the movement of radiocaesium from Chernobyl through the catchments of lakes and rivers in Cumbria and Wales; and measurements of the deposition of Chernobyl radiocaesium on to urban surfaces such as bricks and roof tiles in the United Kingdom and in Sweden, and its subsequent retention by those surfaces.

AB  - This article examines 993 violent incidents involving faculty, students, and staff that occurred at a highly ranked teaching and research university and its affiliated medical center. Violent incidents were included in the sample if they involved faculty, students, or staff regardless of their specific location or context (ie, whether they occurred on campus and/or off-campus and whether they occurred within the context of work or some other activity). The theoretical goal of the project was to compare work-related incidents with non-work-related incidents of interpersonal violence occurring in a single, multifunctioning, and professionally hierarchical organization. Data were collected over a 7-year period from three police departments (city, county: and university), university records, and criminal history records obtained from the state police. The coding protocol was developed to capture crime-scene information pertinent to each of the incidents. This included information about the victim, the perpetrator, the relationship between the victim and perpetrator and the violent incident. The data were examined using nonparametric statistics and logistic regression to model predictive differences between the workplace and non-workplace incidents. The results suggest that the workplace incidents of violence differ from the non-workplace incidents according to their time victim age, degree of victim injury, and whether the workplace is a medical location. The authors conclude that these differences are better explained by the movement of people in and out of the workplace who bring societal violence with them rather than by a category or type of workplace violence.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of topical versus retrobulbar anesthesia for cataract surgery performed by a surgeon newly converting to the top cal technique.
   Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt lake City. Utah, USA.
   Methods: Ninety patients were prospectively assigned by permuted block restricted randomization to receive topical (Group 1, n = 45) or retrobulbar (Group 2; n = 45) anesthesia. Group 1 received topical bupivacaine 0.75% and intravenous midazolam and fentanyl for anesthesia. Group 2 received intravenous methohexital followed by retrobulbar block with an equal mixture of lidocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.75% plus hyaluronidase 150 units. A visual pain analog scale was used to assess the degree of pain during anesthesia administration and surgery and postoperatively. The degree to which eye movement, touch, and light caused patient discomfort was assessed. intraoperative conditions and complications were recorded.
   Results: Intraoperative operating conditions were significantly better in Group 2 (P = .05). There was a small but statistically significant difference in the degree of discomfort during anesthesia administration and surgery (P < .05). There was no difference in postoperative discomfort. Chemosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and eyelid hemorrhage occurred only in Group 2, in which there was one retrobulbar hemorrhage. Although eyelid squeezing and ocular motility were present more frequently in Group 1, neither was a problem to the surgeon.
   Conclusion: Cataract surgery was safely performed by a surgeon converting to topical anesthesia. After a distinct learning curve, the procedure was performed with minimal patient discomfort. Surgical training and patient preparation are the key to safe use of topical anesthesia.

LA  - English
AB  - For more than 40 years the area between the towns of Forney and Terrell in northeast Texas has been relatively stable geologically, even though the tract is underlain by argillaceous strata (marl and shale) that form thick expansive soils. During the last few years, small-scale landslides have remodeled the land surface, collapsed some wooden structures, severed sewer and water pipes, snapped telephone cables, and resulted in leaning power poles and fence posts. The movement has occurred along the outcrop trend of the 145-m-thick Upper Cretaceous Marlbrook/Neylandville marl sequence. These marls, which contain a high percentage of montmorillonite clay and thin (0.5-1 cm) bentonite beds, are well known in the region for forming irregular, hummocky topography. One of the principal causes of downslope movement since late 1990 is the saturation of soil and bedrock on sensitive slopes by unusually heavy local rainfall. Total precipitation in the Dallas area since 1989 ranged from 15.9 cm to 50.4 cm above normal (85.6 cm) according to the U.S. Weather Service. Higher than normal rainfall, coupled with gravitational forces, rendered even low- to moderate-slopes in the area unstable.

The age structure of the live-trapped population changed substantially between July 1989 (42.9% juvenile, 9.5% subadult and 47.6% adult) and August 1990 (46.2% juvenile, 15.4% subadult and 34.6% adult).  The mean age of captured female bandicoots increased during the study, from 9.8 months in July 1989 to 15.8 months in August 1990.  In all, 24 of 32 females produced 145 pouch young in 66 litters, with a mean (+/- s.e.) litter size of 2.2+/-0.1 (n = 66).  The number of females that were lactating each month was high throughout the study (85%) and peaked during spring and autumn when all captured females were lactating.  Sexual maturity for males and females occurred at about 5 and 3.5 months of age, respectively.  The causes of mortality of P. gunnii between 1980 and 1990 included road death (63%, n = 85), cat predation (17.8%, n = 24), disease (8.1%, n = 11), trap death (5.2%, n 7), machinery (3.7%, n = 5) and dog predation (2.2%, n = 3).  A total of 25 P. gunnii died from unknown causes.  Cat predation of P. gunnii may be high amongst juveniles and subadults but low for adults.  A net emigration rate of 18% of individuals known to be alive indicates that the Hamilton Municipal Tip is a source for dispersal to other subpopulations.  The 1990 distribution of the population was about 169 ha, within the City of Hamilton and adjacent Shire of Dundas, Victoria.  There has been a decline in distribution and some local extinctions of P. gunnii in several areas between 1988 and 1990.

AB  - The distribution patterns of keratinophilic fungi isolated from Passer domesticus of a coastal (Puri) and an intercoastal (Dhenkanal) district were compared with respect to three parameters, season, age and sex. Irrespective of the parameters, Chrysosporium tropicum and Rollandina hyalinospora showed the highest frequency of occurrence. Their occurrence in the birds was not determined by any ecological or environmental condition in nature. Thus these fungi exhibited their ecological maturity or firm establishment in nature. The maximum fungal distribution occurred during the monsoon season and was minimal in the summer. Juvenile birds were active carriers of the fungi and the male birds harboured the maximum number of fungi. Thus male juvenile birds carried the maximum number of keratinophilic fungi during the monsoon season. The free-living P. domesticus enhances the degree of dispersal of keratinophilic fungi, it being in frequent contact with human artifacts, breeding in settlements and town gardens 'Eusynanthropic habit'. The fungi so dispersed are called 'mesoornithochorus' as their occurrence in birds is determined to a certain degree by avian habits.

AB  - Objective. To determine if there is evidence for a causal relationship between acute encephalopathy followed by permanent brain injury or death associated with the administration of further attenuated measles vaccines (Attenuvax or Lirugen, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Kansas City, MO), mumps vaccine (Mumpsvax, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), or rubella vaccines (Meruvax or Meruvax II, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), combined measles and rubella vaccine (M-R-Vax or M-R-Vax II, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), or combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (M-M-R or M-M-R II, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), the lead author reviewed claims submitted to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
   Methods. The medical records of children who met the inclusion criteria of receiving the first dose of these vaccines between 1970 and 1993 and who developed such an encephalopathy with no determined cause within 15 days were identified and analyzed.
   Results. A total of 48 children, ages 10 to 49 months, met the inclusion criteria after receiving measles vaccine, alone or in combination. Eight children died, and the remainder had mental regression and retardation, chronic seizures, motor and sensory deficits, and movement disorders. The onset of neurologic signs or symptoms occurred with a nonrandom, statistically significant distribution of cases on days 8 and 9. No cases were identified after the administration of monovalent mumps or rubella vaccine.
   Conclusions. This clustering suggests that a causal relationship between measles vaccine and encephalopathy may exist as a rare complication of measles immunization.

AB  - Field investigations of the dynamic interaction between nocturnal drainage winds and a cold-air lake were conducted in a hilly area near Fukuoka City, Japan. It was found that nocturnal drainage winds can be classified into two types according to where they occur, that is, below or above the surface of the cold-air lake.
   The nocturnal drainage wind which contributes to the development of the cold-air lake over a basin and flows down into the surface layer of the lake is one type of nocturnal drainage wind (NDW I). This type of flow, in general, has a thickness of more than 10 m, and a speed which oscillates with periods ranging from 30 to 60 minutes; though the cause of the periodicity has yet to be determined. Within the cold-air lake, that is, on the hillside buried in the lake, another type of drainage wind (NDW II) can be found, the thickness of which is less than about 10 m. Winds of this type also oscillate, with periods of 20 to 30 minutes and of about 40 minutes. These periods agree fairly well with these of internal gravity waves induced in the cold-air lake, suggesting that the periodic behavior of the NDW II type is associated with the wave-like movement of cold air in the lake.
   Although cold air is produced over the entire ground surface, nocturnal drainage winds, which are the flow of cold air down the sloping surfaces, exhibit different characteristics according to whether the slope is located above or beneath the surface of the cold-air lake.

AB  - The Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) forms the eastern boundary of the Basin and Range province and is the longest continuous, active normal fault (343 km) in the United States. It underlies an urban corridor of 1.6 million people (80% of Utah's population) representing the largest earthquake risk in the interior of the western United States.
   We have used paleoseismological data to identify 10 discrete segments of the WFZ. Five are active, medial segments with Holocene slip rates of 1-2 mm a-1, recurrence intervals of 2000-4000 years and average lengths of about 50 km. Five are less active, distal segments with mostly pre-Holocene surface ruptures, late Quaternary slip rates of < 0.5 mm a-1, recurrence intervals of greater-than-or-equal-to 10,000 years and average lengths of about 20 km. Surface-faulting events on each of the medial segments of the WFZ formed 2-4-m-high scarps repeatedly during the Holocene; latest Pleistocene (14-15 ka) deposits commonly have scarps as much as 15-20 m in height. Segments identified from paleoseismological studies of other major late Quaternary normal faults in the northern Basin and Range province are 20-25 km long, or about half of that proposed for the medial segments of the WFZ.
   Paleoseismological records for the past 6000 years indicate that a major surface-rupturing earthquake has occurred along one of the medial segments about every 395 +/- 60 years. However, between about 400 and 1500 years ago, the WFZ experienced six major surface-rupturing events, an average of one event every 220 years, or about twice as often as expected from the 6000-year record. This pattern of temporal clustering is similar to that of the central Nevada-eastern California Seismic Belt in the western part of the Basin and Range province, where 11 earthquakes of M > 6.5 have occurred since 1860. Although the time scale of the clustering is different-130 years vs 1100 years-we consider the central Nevada-eastern California Seismic Belt to be a historic analog for movement of the WFZ during the past 1500 years.
   We have found no evidence that surface-rupturing events occurred on the WFZ during the past 400 years, a time period which is twice the average intracluster recurrence interval and equal to the average Holocene recurrence interval. In particular, the Brigham City segment (the northernmost medial segment) has not ruptured in the past 3600 years-a period that is about three times longer than this segment's average recurrence interval during the early and middle Holocene. Although the WFZ's seismological record is one of relative quiescence, a comparison with other historic surface-rupturing earthquakes in the region suggests that earthquakes having moment magnitudes of 7.1-7.4 (or surface-wave magnitudes of 7.5-7.7)-each associated with tens of kilometers of surface rupture and several meters of normal dip slip-have occurred about every four centuries during the Holocene and should be expected in the future.

AB  - The broad outline of the systematics of the endemic Pacific island land snail family Partulidae has been understood for some time. The family is divided into three genera: Eua has four species, confined to Tonga and Samoa; Samoana has about 23 species, widely but sporadically distributed in Polynesia and the Mariana Islands; Partula has about 100 species, distributed from Belau to the Society Islands.
   This review integrates this systematic and biogeographic knowledge with work on ecology, population genetics and speciation that has concentrated especially on the recently speciated Partula spp. of Moorea in the Society Islands. Explanations of Moorean diversity (much of which seems unrelated to ecological factors) based on parapatric speciation and the evolution of morph ratio clines in the absence of isolation have predominated, although without incontrovertible support. Unitary explanations are probably not appropriate.
   Rather little is known of the basic biology of partulids. They are generally arboreal; feed on a wide range of partially decayed and living plant material; and are relatively long-lived, slow reproducing, ovoviviparous, cross- or self-fertilizing hermaphrodites.
   The phylogenetic and geographical origins of the three genera are unknown. Partula may have evolved, somewhere unknown, from Samoana, which evolved from Eua in the Tonga-Samoa region, this being the region of origin of Eua; but the opposite sequence has also been postulated. The question is unresolved.
   Origins of the Moorean species are better understood as their inter-relationships are relatively clear. Rather few dispersal events probably took place and the Society Island fauna as a whole may be derived from but two colonization events - first by a Samoana sp. and later by a Partula sp., both of which then speciated in situ - with a few intra-archipelago colonization events taking place subsequently, predominantly in a southwesterly direction from the older to the younger islands.
   Many of the questions posed by the group may never be answered. Some species, notably those of Moorea, are already extinct in the wild; others are severely threatened. Artificial introductions of both plants and animals, combined with urban and agricultural development, have had significant impacts, but ill-conceived biological control programmes, targeted at the Giant African Snail, Achatina fulica, constitute currently the most serious threat.
   However, significant areas are still open to research. Analysis of DNA variation, combined with modern ideas of Pacific biogeography, should allow the whole range from the broad origins of the fauna to the detailed evolution within groups of species to be addressed. Some species may yet be relatively secure in the wild and allow field studies, but extraction of DNA from museum specimens provides an exciting opportunity to continue unravelling the evolutionary history of these endangered snails and to contribute further to our understanding of evolutionary processes and the biogeography of the Pacific.

AB  - Study objective: To determine the spectrum of disorders in children younger than 6 years with upper-extremity injury or immobility and to identify clinical findings associated with specific disorders.
   Design: Prospective patient series.
   Setting: Urban pediatric emergency department.
   Participants: Children younger than 6 years seen during a 6-month period with injury or immobility of an upper extremity.
   Results: We identified 178 episodes of immobility or injury of an upper extremity. Radial head subluxation (RHS) was the most frequent diagnosis (63%; 99 definite and 13 probable), followed by fracture (22%) and soft-tissue injury (STI; 13%). One patient each had humeral osteomyelitis and neurologic impairment. The mean age of children with RHS was significantly less than that of children with fractures 127+/-12 months versus 39+/-19 months, P<.01); the only diagnoses in children younger than 4 months old were infection and neurologic impairment. Multivariate regression analysis showed point tenderness and swelling correlated with fractures (P<.05). Decreased arm movement, absence of swelling, and a pull as the mechanism of injury correlated with RHS (P<.05). However, arm traction occurred in only 55% of the children with RHS (95% confidence interval=.46 to .64). By 1 week after the evaluation, all children without fractures had recovered, except one each with a sprain, osteomyelitis, and neurologic impairment.
   Conclusion: Most children with arm injury or immobility have bony or soft-tissue trauma, the majority being RHS. Clinical findings varied between diagnoses and may aid the clinician in deciding whether attempted reduction of RHS is indicated or whether radiographs are warranted first. Nontrauma diagnoses are unusual but should be considered, particularly in the child younger than 6 months old. Appropriate immobilization and follow-up are important for the management of children without a dear diagnosis at the initial evaluation.

AB  - Factors influencing seedling survivorship in the beach morning glory, Ipomoea pes-caprae (L.) Roth, were studied near Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Censuses of recently germinated seedlings revealed an 83% mortality rate over a period of 11 weeks. Seedlings that died occurred significantly further above high-tide line than did seedlings that were still alive at the end of the study. Although distance to the nearest neighbouring plants did not influence the probability of survival, more seedlings survived if their nearest neighbours were monocots than if they were conspecifics. The probability of survival was greater for seedlings which were closer to neighbouring seedlings of I. pes-caprae, but distance to the nearest adult I. pes-caprae did not affect survival. There was 100% mortality of seedlings that were naturally buried by sand. A field experiment manipulated levels of insect herbivory and sand burial, and showed that herbivory caused a seven-fold increase in mortality rate. Although sand burial also increased mortality, this effect was not significant. Overall, seedling mortality appeared to be influenced by both abiotic factors (location on beach, sand burial) and biotic factors (seedling density, neighbour type and herbivory).

AB  - The analysis of sediments, of their position and stratigraphy allows the correction of a recent hypothesis assuming a direct link between an earthquake, the interruption of human settlement and a submersion. Although human occupancy may have been interrupted following the earthquake, the submersion of the antique town may not necessarily have been linked with the same event; it may even have been the cause of its abandonment. Finally, the submersion, which need not have been very quick or of a catastrophic seismic nature, was followed by a slow and less extended reversal of the tectonic movement.

AB  - Patancheru and Bolaram are satellite industrial towns near Hyderabad with over 300 large and medium scale pharmaceutical, heavy engineering, paints, paper and chemical factories. The industries of the area generate a cumulative 8 x 10(6) 1/day of effluents which are being directly discharged on to surrounding Land, irrigation fields, and surface water bodies which finally enter into the Nakkavagu River a tributary of the Manzira River. The present study on abundance and distribution pattern of toxic trace elements indicates the quantitative aspect of pollution in the Nakkavagu Basin. Migration patterns drawn for TDS, toxic elements such as Cu, As, Se, Zn, B, Cr and iron indicate that pollutants discharged by the industries are entering the surface and groundwater system (aquifers) and are also migrating towards the Manzira River further deteriorating the entire hydrological setup of the area.
   Entry and dispersion of pollutants in the hydrological system is shown by distribution diagrams. A conservative estimate indicates that the effect of pollutants on the agricultural lands and water bodies extends 0.25 to 0.5 km to either side of the Nakkavagu River over a length of 25 km. In addition to this, the movement of pollutants with ground water in the downstream direction worsened the hydrological system and increased the possibility of gee-accumulation of pollutants in biota. Open wells, dug wells and tanks have become useless and redundant as the concentrations of Cu, Se, As, B, Cr and Fe have increased to 5 to 10 times the permissible limits. Several villages have been affected by the toxic pollutants in the area. The groundwater system is polluted over a large area as shown in elemental migration diagrams and is not potable. Tentatively an area of 20 sq km can be categorized as the worst affected by various pollutants.

AB  - The coastline of China stretches for about 18,000 km. China's coastal areas concentrate 70% of big cities and 41% of the total population of the nation. Fifty-five percent of the gross national product and 65% of the national industrial output are made in these areas. Although the areas occupy less than 1/7 of the total territory of China, they create more than half of the national wealth. China's coastal areas can be acclaimed as China's ''wealth-belt'', ''lifeblood-belt''. However, most of the areas are low-lying lands with relatively gentle topography. The possible harmful impact caused by the relative sea level rise on the area is studied. This study includes the increase in occurrence frequency of storm surge and flood; the extension of inundation of low-lying land; the acceleration of paralyzation of the existing drainage system; the intensification of erosion and retreat of sea shore; and the increase of the submergence of coastal areas, salt intrusion and the pollution of fresh water resources. Several factors concerning the disaster hazard evaluation for coastal areas resulting from sea level rise are discussed. They include: adopting under-estimated value of sea level rise rate; taking the economic and social developments of a coastal area as a threshold of the hazard evaluation for the area; combining sea level rise with crustal vertical movement; taking account of the capability and adequacy of the protection facilities. The index for these factors and a method of integrative hazard evaluation are presented. Finally, the data for the Chinese regional sea level rise in recent years are also summarized in the paper. The estimated value of future relative sea level rise rate in some main coastal areas of China is 5-8 mm/a. This means that the relative sea level rise in the areas may reach 30-45 cm by 2050 in general, and in a few areas, such as the Old Yellow River Delta, may be 70-80 cm.

AB  - Hydrodynamic data and samples of bed sediment were collected from Nara Inlet, a small incised embayment in the Whitsunday Islands, central Great Barrier Reef. Measured tidal currents in the inlet do not exceed 0.2 ms(-1) even at spring tides. Swell waves dominate much of the inner shelf of the Great Barrier Reef but are absent from in the inlet due to the presence of a fringing reef at the inlet mouth. On the silty sand floor of the inlet, particle size decreases towards the inlet head. Most or the bed is too coarse to be remobilised by fair-weather wave and tides, and we predict that bedload sediment transport thresholds ore only exceeded in the inlet during cyclones. The observed distribution of bed sediments is consistent with landward dispersal of sediment under storm conditions, Over 20 m of (presumably Holocene) sediments occurs in the inlet and the seismic character of the infill is consistent with the observed textural variation of the modern sediments. We infer that sediment accumulation on the floor of the inlet has been storm dominated throughout much of the Holocene.

TI  - HISTORY OF EARTHQUAKES AND VERTICAL GROUND MOVEMENT IN CAMPI FLEGREI CALDERA, SOUTHERN ITALY - COMPARISON OF PRECURSORY EVENTS TO THE AD.1538 ERUPTION OF MONTE NUOVO AND OF ACTIVITY SINCE 1968
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - CALIFORNIA
AB  - The record of felt earthquakes around Naples Bay in southern Italy is probably complete since the mid-15th century.  According to this record, intense earthquake swarms originating beneath Campi Flegrei, an explosive caldera located along the north coast of Naples Bay, have occurred only twice:  (1) before the only historical eruption in Campi Flegrei in 1538; and (2) from mid-1983 to December 1984.  Earthquake activity during the earlier period, which began at least a few years, and possibly as many as 30 years, before the 1538 eruption, damaged many buildings in the city of Pozzuoli, located near the center of Campi Flegrei.  Minor seismic activity, which consisted of only a few felt earthquakes, occurred from 1970 to 1971.  The second period of intense earthquake swarms lasted from mid-1983 to 1984, again damaging many buildings in Pozzuoli.  Two periods of uplift along the shoreline within Campi Flegrei have also been noted since the mid-15th century:  (1) during the few decades before the 1538 eruption; and (2) as two distinct episodes since 1968.  Uplift of a few meters probably occurred a few decades before the 1538 eruption; uplift of as much as 3.0 m has occurred in Pozzuoli since 1968.
   These similarities strongly suggest that, for the first time in 440 years, the same process that caused intense local earthquake swarms and uplift in the early 15OO's and led to an eruption in 1538, has again occurred beneath Campi Flegrei.  Though no major seismicity or uplift has occurred since December 1984, because of the large amount of extensional strain accumulated during the past two decades, if a third episode of seismicity and rapid uplift occurs, it may lead to an eruption within several months after the resumption of activity.

TI  - Soil erosion on dry farming land in two changing environments of the central Ebro Valley, Spain
T2  - HUMAN IMPACT ON EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
LA  - English
CP  - International Symposium S6 on Human Impact on Erosion and Sedimentation, at the 5th Scientific Assembly of the International-Association-of-Hydrological-Sciences
AB  - Increasing loss of productive soils is a major concern in semiarid areas of the Mediterranean region. About 40% of Spanish territory is seriously affected by erosion. One of these areas, the central Ebro valley, in northeast Spain, provides a case-study of climate and human impact on soil erosion. A rainfall gradient exists from the centre of the valley (300 mm, mean annual precipitation) towards the Pyrenean middle mountains (>800 mm). The occurrence of convective storms coupled with the high erodibility of the soils gives rise to very fragile agrosystems in which soil essentially constitutes a non-renewable resource. Socio-economic changes which have occurred in Spain over the last 50 years and more recent changes induced by the agrarian policy of the European Union have led to land abandonment and land use changes. Such changes have produced hydrological and edaphic modifications which have had an effect on soil erosion. Two areas representative of the physiographic variety of the dry farming land in the central Ebro valley have been selected to assess soil erosion caused by land abandonment and land use changes. One of the study sites is located in a semiarid environment near Zaragoza city and the other in a temperate environment of the Pyrenean middle mountains. Soil loss has been measured on experimental plots by Gerlach traps and tipping buckets connected to data loggers and by simulated rainfall in the semiarid area. Fallout caesium-137 has also been used to assess soil movement. The results obtained demonstrate significant differences between the two environments. Cultivation is the main factor causing erosion in the semiarid environment, where shrubs have a very protective effect on the soil surface. Higher crop productivity in the middle mountain area helps to protect the soil. The severity of the soil erosion along with the hydrological problems associated with farmland abandonment have produced an urgent need for appropriate soil conservation strategies.

CP  - 22nd Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique
AB  - The Mt Morgans Minesite is located 800km North East of Perth, the Capital City of Western Australia. The surrounding region has been a significant producer of gold since the turn of the century. The mine was previously host to a township of approx 40 - 50,000 people.
   During the mine's most recent activity significant problems have been experienced in production Drill and Blast relating to excessive costs, unacceptable levels of blast damage to final pit walls and excessive ore dilution.
   DWL were requested to work in conjunction with the newly appointed Drill and Blast Engineer to take control of the situation and recommend actions that were practical and cost effective.
   These recommendations called for a complete change of present blasting practices and the effective recording of all associated data to form benchmarks from which comparisons could be established.
   The process was achieved in a series of steps:
   Current benchmark : all data from present blasting practices was recorded on the newly formed database.
   Recommendations : a series of recommendations were made from the present procedure.
   Implementation : the recommendations were implemented and the data gathered. A minimum of 10 blasts were used to ensure reliable data.
   Analysis : the data was compared back to the benchmark.
   New benchmark : from the analysis stage a new benchmark was established and the process was repeated.
   Use of the above system proved to be effective and simple.
   Some of the changes made to blasting practices were: move from row by row initiation to hole by hole using millisecond delay detonators and detonating cord combined with millisecond connectors, pattern expansion, blast hole diameter increase, bench height increase, reduce size of shots from 2000-3000 holes, to one day load and shoot, ie 500 holes, booster size optimisation, presplit of all transitional to fresh rock pit walls.
   It must be noted that all changes occurred one step at a time to maintain simplicity of analysis.
   The recommended changes had the following effects :drill and blast costs have been reduced by approx S0.50/m(3). In addition a reduced total mining and crushing cost of approx $1.50/m(3), with the combination of hole by hole firing, reduced shot size and presplits wall damage has been reduced, the combination of hole by hole initiation, reduced shot size and differing products has produced less heave and lateral movement resulting in less ore dilution.
   The final outcomes are yet to be reached as the improvement in blasting is an ongoing process, but the exercise has been a successful interaction between DWL and its customer.

CP  - 7th International symposium on River Sedimentation
KW  - INCIPIENT MOTION
KW  - SCOUR
AB  - Culverts represent one of the most common methods of continuing small streams and rivers beneath roads, railways and urban areas. Insufficient downstream bed protection can lead to extensive scouring and erosion of the bed culminating ultimately in the collapse of the structure itself and the consequential disruption to transport networks and increased risk of flooding. Over recent years extensive research has been conducted throughout the world to determine the extent of scouring for various flow conditions and in particular the equilibrium scour depth. From a designer's perspective it is much more important to be able to predict the flow conditions, which just cause scouring to occur, since it is the formation of scour holes that they are specifically trying to avoid. The threshold of motion condition has been studied extensively for uniform open channel flows with the Shields curve being one of the most popular methods of determining threshold conditions in river flows. Little research has been conducted with particular reference to the beginning of motion downstream of water jets of the type encountered at culvert outlets. This paper shows that existing methods of determining the threshold of motion are inappropriate for the non-uniform, impinging jet flow conditions typically found at culvert outlets. Results from a research programme designed to improve the prediction of the onset of motion downstream of culverts are presented. Experimental data from model pipe culverts with diameters of d(o) = 75mm and d(o) = 50mm are shown where the bed material consisted of uniformly graded, non-cohesive material with d(50) values between 0.3mm and 8.2mm. The flow conditions that caused scouring to just begin were recorded for tailwater depths of 0.5d(o), 0.75d(o), ld(o), 1.5d(o) and 2d(o). By plotting the Densimetric Froude number against particle Reynolds number a graphical method for identifying the point at which scouring begins can be determined.

AB  - Radio-telemetry was used to monitor movements and burrow usage by O. anatinus living in the Yarra River catchment, about 20 km east-north-east of the central business district of Melbourne, Victoria. The home ranges of six adult or subadult animals were 2.9-7.3 km (mean +/- s.d. = 4.6 +/- 1.6 km) long, with individuals travelling up to 10.4 km (males) and 4.0 km (females) in a single overnight period. The mean home-range length of adult/subadult animals was significantly greater than that of juveniles (1.4-1.7 km, mean +/- s.d. = 1.55 +/- 0.2 km, n = 2). The animals utilised two drainage channels as well as 11.8 km of natural waterways, including the Yarra River (5 km), Mullum Mullum Creek (4 km) and Diamond Creek (2.8 km). Several animals travelled repeatedly below one-lane and two-lane bridges, confirming that these structures are not inherent barriers to platypus movement. In total, 57 platypus burrows were described, including 26 along the river, 29 along the creeks and 2 along drains. The horizontal distance from the water's edge to burrow chambers was 0.4-3.7 m (mean +/- s.d. = 1.5 +/- 0.9 m, n = 41), with burrows found only in banks extending greater than or equal to 0.5 m above the water. Platypus burrows occurred significantly more often than expected along undercut banks and in association with moderate-to-dense vegetation overhanging the water, and significantly less often at sites where banks had a convex profile at water level. As well, the amount of cover provided along the bank by shrubs/small trees and the ground Payer of vegetation was significantly greater than expected at platypus burrows along the river. These attributes are believed to help conceal burrow entrances from predators as well as reduce burrow damage through erosion.

AB  - The most common ballistic materials available in the urban setting were studied for their MR effects on deflection force, rotation, heating, and imaging artifacts at 1.5 T to determine the potential efficacy and safety for imaging patients with ballistic injuries.  The 28 missiles tested covered the range of bullet types and materials suggested by the Cleveland Police Department.  The deflection force was measured by the New method.  Rotation was evaluated 30 min after bullets had been placed in a 10% (weight per weight) ballistic gelatin designed to simulate brain tissue, with the long axis of the bullet placed parallel and perpendicular to the Z axis of the magnet.  Heating was measured with alcohol thermometers by imaging for 1 hr alternatively with gradient-echo and spin-echo sequences (RF absorption = 0.033 and 0.326 w/kg respectively).  Image artifacts on routine sequences were evaluated.  All the steel-containing bullets except for the Winchester armor-piercing 38 caliber exhibited deflection.  A nonsteel 7.38-mm Mauser also deflected.  Deflection range was 514 to 15,504 dynes.  Rotation occurred when the bullets were not parallel to the Z axis.  Temperature changes were not significant.  Deflecting projectiles resulted in obliteration of the image.  The artifacts from other projectiles were small but varied by content.  The artifact of the Winchester armor-piercing 38-caliber bullet was similar to those without steel.
   Bullets that contain steel or ferromagnetic contaminates such as nickel can be rotated within the MR unit.  Ferromagnetic contaminants do not allow nonsteel bullets to be imaged with confidence; the potential rotation and movement of these missiles results in a relative contraindication to MR, although location within the body and time since injury may be modifying conditions.  Missiles with nonaustenitic steel or nickel in the area of interest make images useless, while projectiles without these materials cause minimal image distortion and signal void.

AB  - The managerial contractual form in China's township and village enterprise (TVE) sector has evolved rapidly during the past 10 years. Our paper uses descriptive data and a theoretical model to demonstrate that these changes may be occurring in response to the rapid development of markets in transitional rural China. We econometrically test the model's main hypotheses, showing that the driving force behind the movement from a leader-run fixed-wage contract to a fixed-payment contract with better incentives for the manager is the relative value of non-marketed inputs owned by local leaders and firm managers. Firm technical structure and local market setting also plays a role in the determination of firm contractual form. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A landslide investigation has been undertaken in the vicinity of Sorbas, Almeria Province, South-east Spain. Using the guidelines suggested by the UNESCO Working Party on the World Landslide inventory, an inventory of the mass movements within the study area has been generated. The area has suffered a wide variety of mass movements, with a landslide density of approximately 4.6 landslides per Km(2). These mass movements range in size from a few tens of m(3) to a few million m(3). There is evidence that the major features may relate to Pleistocene climatic conditions very different to the semi-arid climate of the present day. Movements occurring at the present time appear to be on a smaller scale to those initiated earlier in the Pleistocene. The majority of the mass movements are rock falls, although there are also rock topples, rotational slides and lateral spreads.

AB  - A recent outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Khartoum province, the first ever reported, involved about 10 000 recorded cases.  The peak incidence was in September 1986.  It was widespread all over the province, but the most affected areas were along the banks of the River Nile.  People of both sexes, all age groups, different ethnic origins, and all socio-economic classes were equally affected, suggesting that this epidemic was a new occurrence among a non-immune population.  A leishmaniasis clinic was established and 736 cases were treated and studied.  The control measures, responsible parasite, possible animal reservoir, and vector are discussed.  Possible contributory factors were mass population movement from known endemic areas of CL in Khartoum, expanding towns and new settlements in previously uninhabited areas, high population densities of sandflies, and an increase in the rodent population, including Arvicanthis species.

AB  - The fence effect consists of two related observations: (1) enclosed populations of small mammals grow to abnormally high densities; (2) they then overexploit resources, destroy their habitat, and decline precipitously. The fence effect is widely considered strong evidence for the critical role of emigration in regulating population size, and for ultimate limitation of populations of small-mammal herbivores by resource exhaustion. I reexamine published evidence for the fence effect and conclude that studies in small, artificial pens are unreliable in addressing the fence effect. Studies in large, natural enclosures are mixed in their support of the fence effect. Only two unreplicated studies show evidence for ''abnormally'' high densities of microtines inside enclosures, whereas several others do not. No studies confirm that habitat destruction and starvation cause the decline from high density inside enclosures. Fences tend to eliminate small predators like shrews that probably have a constant effect on vole populations, but are permeable to larger predators, such as carnivores and raptors, whose response may incorporate time lags. Therefore, it is possible that the fence effect is due largely to predator-prey interactions. My own data from three enclosed meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) populations support the notion that a fence contributes to rapid population increases; however, the populations showed widely divergent patterns of growth and decline. Although these populations reduced aboveground plant biomass relative to lower density vole populations, the plants rapidly compensated, and there was no evidence for overgrazing causing the declines. I suggest that a fence effect is most likely to occur in moderately productive habitats, in which herbivore populations are net producers of dispersers, but in which compensation by plants is slow. But it should be unlikely to occur in either highly productive or unproductive habitats.

TI  - COMMUNITY AND CONFLICT - THE ALEXANDRA REBELLION OF 1986
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This paper examines a short-lived township insurrection. It is shown that it was amid the violent encounters between the police and the people in Alexandra during the first six months of 1986 that collective initiatives occurred. While the intention of many activists may well have been the desire to construct an alternative hegemony, the process by which ANC rhetoric and strategy resonated through the Alexandra community was more complex than the neatly delineated conspiracy propounded by both security policemen and ANC commentators alike. This begs the question of to what extent resistance politics which proceed through local oppositions actually addresses the issue of central authority, if at all. In the context of a liberation movement lacking national coherence, however, the image of a community in rebellion can be seen to provide a powerful political symbol. It is felt that in this sense the image of the township insurrections of the mid-1980s may yet become more vital than the fact.

AB  - White-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii) were observed using radiotelemetry and focal observations to evaluate factors affecting locomotor activity and foraging effort. Individuals were highly synchronous in onset and cessation of locomotor activity. Locomotion began ca. 1 h after sunset and ceased before sunrise throughout the year. Hence, the nightly activity period varied inversely with photoperiod. Distance, duration, and frequency of locomotion increased during the early breeding season, March and April, and declined during warm months of the study, May and June. Low ambient temperature, cloud cover, and precipitation had no significant effect on locomotor or foraging activity of this well-insulated leporid (P > 0.05). However, a decline in locomotor activity and an increase in foraging effort occurred when snow cover was present. Trends associated with predation included reduced locomotor activity during periods of greater lunar illumination and an increase in speed of movement when predators (coyotes, Canis latrans) vocalized.

AB  - A series of 254 weapons design experiments was conducted by Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1944 through 1962 and resulted in the dispersal of approximately II PBq (300 kCi) of radioactive La-140. All shots occurred at Point Able in Bayo Canyon, east of the Los Alamos townsite, Public interest and the Government Accounting Office probe precipitated a dose reconstruction to assess potential exposures to members of the public, The information available for each shot included explosive charge size, date and time of explosion, and shot activity, Detailed meteorological data were not available for the majority of the shots, requiring the development of statistically representative meteorological data, A wind rose was developed specific to the afternoon-evening time of the shots, and the wind frequency in each sector was used to determine the fraction of activity dispersed towards each hypothetical receptor, HOTSPOT 7, a Gaussian plume-based dispersion model, was used to determine the average dose per sector per unit of shot activity, The dose from penetrating radiation from ground-deposited La-190 was greater by several orders of magnitude than the dose from inhalation and immersion, The highest doses to a permanent resident probably occurred in the easternmost part of the Los Alamos townsite. The highest annual dose occurred in 1955 and was approximately 0.23 mSv, Assuming an individual had been at the location of maximum potential exposure in the Los Alamos townsite continuously throughout the experiments, the total dose from the 18-y series mould have been approximately 1.4 mSv with an average dose of approximately 0.09 mSv y(-1). Doses at nearby Totavi trailer park, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and Santa Clara Pueblo were approximately 75%, 40%, and 15%. respectively, of those at Los Alamos. Visitors to nearby public areas received negligible doses.

AB  - Aspects of the biology of the social spider Phryganoponrs candidus (=Badumna candida) (L. Koch) in relation to its life history are described, based on data from a field and laboratory study conducted over several years at Townsville, Queensland. Host plant records and preferences are given, and an analysis made of the effects of nest height and ecotone proximity on nest occurrence. Founded between October and February as a chambered silk funnel by a solitary subadult female, the nest was enlarged by the female and her progeny into a complex retreat area and an outlying prey-trapping area. The architecture of the retreat was not an aggregation of repeated subunits. Closely adjacent nests sometimes united their prey-capture webbing to form compound nests. From a tagged sample of new-founded nests, 31% reached a stage at which thriving spiderlings were present. Numbers of spiders in nests ranged from 9 to 224 and correlated with nest size, which ranged from 70 to more than 20 000 cm(2). At the peak of nest growth in October, the stage at which subadult spiders began to disperse, about 90 spiders inhabited each nest; only 12% of new-founded nests reached this stage. Summer dispersal left nests empty; they degenerated under rain and became moribund by March. The main host plants were Zizyphus mauritiana (the chinee apple) and Dolichondrone heterophylla. Most nests occurred between 0.5 and 2.5 m from the ground but height did not influence nest success. Nests were prevalent at ecotones, although they did not thrive better there. Because so much of the social biology of spiders is integrated with the structure and function of their nests, these findings are relevant to an understanding of the evolution of sociality in spiders.

AB  - Cultivated Agave mapisaga and A. salmiana can have an extremely high above-ground dry-weight productivity of 40 Mg ha-1 yr-1. To help understand the below-ground capabilities that support the high above-ground productivity of these Crassulacean acid metabolism plants, roots were studied in the laboratory and in plantations near Mexico City. For approximately 15-year-old plants, the lateral spread of roots from the plant base averaged 1.3 m and the maximal root depth was 0.8 m, both considerably greater than for desert succulents of the same age. Root and shoot growth occurred all year, although the increase in shoot growth at the beginning of the wet season preceded the increase in growth of main roots. New lateral roots branching from the main roots were more common at the beginning of the wet season, which favoured water uptake with a minimal biomass investment, whereas growth of new main roots occurred later in the growing season. The root: shoot dry weight ratio was extremely low, less than 0.07 for 6-year-old plants of both species, and decreased with plant age. The elongation rates of main roots and lateral roots were 10 to 17 mm d-1, higher than for various desert succulents but similar to elongation rates for roots of highly productive C3 and C4 agronomic species. The respiration rate of attached main roots was 32 mumol CO2 evolved kg-1 dry weight s-1 at 4 weeks of age, that of lateral roots was about 70% higher, and both rates decreased with root age. Such respiration rates are 4- to 5-fold higher than for Agave deserti, but similar to rates for C3 and C4 agronomic species. The root hydraulic conductivity had a maximal value of 3 x 10(-7) m s-1 MPa-1 at 4 weeks of age, similar to A. deserti. The radial hydraulic conductivity from the root surface to the xylem decreased and the axial conductivity along the xylem increased with root age, again similar to A. deserti. Thus, although roots of A. mapisaga and A. salmiana had hydraulic properties per unit length similar to those of a desert agave, their higher growth rates, their higher respiration rates, and the greater soil volume explored by their roots than for various desert succulents apparently helped support their high above-ground biomass productivity.

AB  - The Archean Sigma-2 orebody is hosted in the felsic granophyric zone of the differentiated Vicour sill. The sill contains anomalous gold valves and is intrusive into the uppermost part of the Val-d'Or Formation. A geochemical study shows that the Vicour sill has evolved from a ferriferous tholeiitic melt and is comagmatic with the Heva Formation to the south. The competent granophyric zone has been affected by several ductile-brittle deformation events. Three systems of faults and fractures are recognized. Each of these systems is composed of two to three subsystems. The main fault system is oriented east-west with subvertical dip and has a dextral component of movement. Two east-west oriented fault subsystems, moderately dipping (45-degrees) towards north and south, are associated with this feature. The second major structural feature consists of northeast and north-northwest conjugate fractures superimposed on structures of the first tectonic event. The shear movement is sinistral for the northeast fractures and dextral for the north-northwest fractures. The third structural feature is the most interesting with respect to gold mineralization. It consists of east-west-trending, moderately dipping fractures that could be genetically linked with the first structural feature and resulted from a northwest-southeast compression. These fractures increased the tectonic permeability of the granophyre, which allowed Cl- and Na-rich and Ca- and CO2-poor hydrothermal fluids to circulate through the rock and produced subhorizontal mineralized quartz lenses. The lenses are composed of quartz-tourmaline +/- carbonate and of pyrite-pyrrhotite +/- chalcopyrite. Arsenopyrite is observed in the bleached wall rock surrounding the lenses as well as in east-west faults and northeast and north-northwest conjugate fractures. Bleaching is the result of metasomatic sericitization, albitization, silicification, and low carbonatization of the wall rock and decreases away from the mineralized lenses. Gold is associated with pyrite and arsenopyrite and occurs as inclusions and veinlets crosscutting sulfide grains. It was deposited at a late stage along with quartz and, locally, chalcopyrite. Metasomatism was responsible for the formation of arsenopyrite, coarse-grained pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite while ilmenite recrystallized in the veins. Fractures within arsenopyrite and pyrite are filled with late deposits of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. The tholeiitic composition and anomalous gold values of the mafic section of the sill could be additional valuable guidelines in the exploration for similar orebodies.

AB  - The integration of a recently-drilled exploration well, sited near the town of Tain, Rossshire, with a seismic database and onshore exposures allows a new interpretation of the structure in the Easter Ross peninsula, NE Scotland. It is now evident that previous interpretations, which highlighted the importance of NE-SW-striking lineaments, need some modification. Instead, numerous N-S to NNE-SSW-trending folds and faults affect Devonian sequences and show evidence of compressional reactivation of structures which had previously-experienced extension. These inversion structures only appear to be dissected by NE-SW- and E-W-striking faults and extensional fractures in areas adjacent to the Great Glen fault zone. Integration of the onshore data with results from adjacent offshore areas suggests that the peninsula has undergone a complex structural history since the Early Devonian. It appears to have been characterized by Early Devonian (probably rift-related) extensional faulting and subsequent Mid-Late Devonian regional (thermal) subsidence. The restriction of similar structural relations to Devonian sequences on offshore seismic lines from adjacent areas suggests that the contractional and inversion structures, which similarly affect the Late Palaeozoic sequences in onshore areas, were probably related to Permo-Carboniferous structural events rather than younger deformation. Further integration of offshore data with the occurrence of Jurassic sequences on the coast suggests that the peninsula may be considered an integral part of the Inner Moray Firth basin and experienced a similar Mesozoic subsidence history to offshore areas before undergoing regional uplift and dissection due to reactivation of the Great Glen fault zone during the Cenozoic. There is no evidence to suggest that this fault zone had any significant control on basin development, sedimentary sequences or structural geometries during Palaeozoic or Mesozoic periods of extension, and it probably only had minor effect during Permo-Carboniferous inversion. Similarily, its role in tectonic events after the Early Cretaceous appears to have been limited to local deformation with little evidence for any large-scale strike-slip offset along its length. The unusual occurrence of Jurassic coastal exposures in Easter Ross appears to represent fault-bounded slices of sediment downfaulted to accommodate the formation of a 'negative flower structure' in response to limited, dextral strike-slip movement. The results suggest that the Great Glen fault zone was a strike-slip fault system effectively locked during phases of extension in the Inner Moray Firth, but was reactivated during phases of inversion when extensional slip vectors sub-paralleled the lineament.

AB  - Surface mapping, deep borehole intersections and geophysical data indicate the existence of a conspicuous set of spatially and genetically related structural forms, centered around the town of Vredefort in South Africa. The structure consists of a central granitic core, surrounded by concentrically arranged folds and faults that affect strata of sedimentary and volcanic origin. It is demonstrated that the structure conforms to that of the root zone of a multi-ring impact basin. ''Vredefort-related'' characteristics, typical of structures of this kind, are highlighted and brought into their evolutionary perspective. Impact occurred at the end of the period of igneous activity that marked the emplacement of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, approximately 2000 Ma ago. Most traces of a stage of modification of the original transient crater were removed by erosion and the remnant structural forms reflect mainly the effects of centripetally outward directed, horizontally orientated stress. The morphology of the structure was eventually modified by later tectonic movement, and isostatic adjustment.

AB  - The effects of breeding territoriality on the stability of grey red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus bedfordiae) populations were investigated on a control grid and a grid on which the voles were fed, in an outdoor enclosure in Hokkaido, Japan. Vole populations were monitored by live trapping from 1984 to 1986: (1) Population density was 2-7 times greater on the experimental grid to which food was added than on the control grid. Reproductive output was more closely associated with the difference in density between grids than survival or dispersal (immigration and emigration) rates. (2) The number of adult females and pregnancy rate of the experimental population were significantly greater than those of the control one. The difference in the number of adult females between the populations was greater than that in pregnancy rate. (3) The proportion of successful litters and the number of weanlings per litter were not significantly different between the control and experimental population. (4) Adult females held territories on both the control and experimental grid; they were spaced out more than would be expected from random occupation. The territories overlapped more on the experimental grid than on the control grid. (5) Mean territory size of adult females on the experimental grid was about half of that on the control grid. The territory size was correlated negatively with population density. (6) The proportion of trap sites that were used by adult females was significantly greater on the experimental grid than on the control grid. This suggests that adult females on the experimental grid used the area more extensively. This factor, in association with territory size and overlapping of territory, was also important in causing the difference in the number of adult females between the grids. (7) These results call into question the hypothesis that territoriality stabilizes the density in populations of Clethrionomys.

AB  - Leveling surveys in Campi Flegrei, an active volcanic caldera in southern Italy, show that this caldera has undergone both subsidence and uplift of a few meters during the past 85 years. A single source located at a depth of about 3 km beneath the center of the caldera can account for almost all elevation changes recorded in Campi Flegrei since the first leveling survey conducted in 1905/1907. This includes leveling surveys that span periods of subsidence (such as between 1905/1907 and 1919 and between January 1985 and October 1986) and periods of rapid uplift (between March 1970 and October 1971 and between January 1981 and December 1984). A possible geometry for the source of uplift and subsidence beneath Campi Flegrei is a rectangular horizontal sheet located at a depth of about 3 km and centered a few hundred meters east of the city of Pozzuoli. The horizontal dimensions of this sheet are about 1.5 km by 3.0 km; the long axis is oriented N70-degrees-W. This sheet lies adjacent to the most intense area of seismicity that occurred from mid-1983 to December 1984. During an uplift episode this sheet may represent the top of a magma body undergoing internal pressure changes, possibly by intrusion of additional magma. Subsidence is caused by groundwater removal from the water-saturated deposits that fill this caldera to a depth of a few kilometers. A temporary increase in subsidence rate after an uplift episode is caused by increased rate of groundwater removal from newly fractured regions that lie immediately above the magma body. The close proximity of this water-saturated region and the magma body makes it impossible to separate the depth to these two sources from the results of leveling surveys. Two observations indicate that uplift has occurred in the center of Campi Flegrei for at least the past several thousand years. First, marine deposits in the center of Campi Flegrei were uplifted at least 40 m between 4000 and 8000 years ago. Second, continuous seismic profiles of the undersea portion of Campi Flegrei have identified only one region where rocks are fractured and faulted: adjacent to the uplifted marine deposits that surround the point of maximum uplift indicated by recent leveling surveys. On the basis of these observations and the historical record of activity we suggest that Campi Flegrei caldera is in a stage of growing a resurgent dome. The present diameter of the resurgent dome is about 4 km, and the maximum amount of vertical uplift during the past 10,000 years has probably not exceeded 100 m. The episodes of rapid uplift and shallow earthquake swarms during the past 20 years are probably related to the growth of this resurgent dome.

AB  - The major features in development of the ''El Nine-Southern Oscillation'' (ENSO) involve oscillation of the Pacific ocean-atmosphere in an essentially unpredictable (chaotic) fashion. The system moves between extremes of the so-called ''warm events'' lasting one or two years and involving movement of warm sea water from the western Pacific along the equator to impact on the west coast of the American continent and ''cold-events'' associated with easterly trade-wind-induced flows of colder water from the eastern Pacific towards the west. Historical data indicate that ENSO years as experienced by the Island of Java are either much warmer than non-ENSO years or only slightly, if at all, warmer than normal (non-ENSO) years. Hot-dry years within the ENSO warm event cycle are almost always followed by cooler wet years and vice versa. This pattern also extends to include the year immediately following the terminal year of an ENSO warm event set. The initial year of an ENSO warm event set may be either hot with a long dry season or relatively cool (nearer to the temperature of a non-ENSO year) and having a short dry season. In recent years, since 1950, of the 9 ENSO warm. events, the initial year tends to have been hot and dry for 6 (1951, 1957, 1963, 1972, 1982, 1991) and neutral or cool and wet for 3 (1968, 1976, 1986).
   An area of 88,000 ha burned in 1991 (Jakarta Post 30 November 1991) largely in Kalimantan in association with the 1991-1992 ENSO event, an extensive pall of smoke developed over Kalimantan, Singapore and Malaysia during September-October of 1991. Surface vegetation-based fires continued to burn in East Kalimantan as of 29 April 1992 and extended into the 1992 dry season, in response to the ENSO conditions carrying forward from 1991.
   The increasing annual trend in air-temperature exhibited by the mean monthly values over the period 1856-1993, for the Jakarta and the Semarang data taken together is 1.64 degrees C (0.0132 degrees C per year from 25.771 to 27.409 degrees C). The major industrial development in infrastructure for Jakarta has been significant only since 1980 or so and was not apparent before 1970 when the city had the aspect of an extended village with few large buildings (greater than 3-4 stories) and no extensive highways. The 1.65 degrees difference between 1866 and 1991 can presumably be partitioned into: (1) urban heat-island effect, (2) effect of deforestation, (3) effect of secular micro-climate shift, (4) influence of general global warming with particular reference to the tropics.
   When the blocks of non-ENSO years in themselves are considered, the deviations from the secular trend for warmest month mean temperatures in successive years are correlated with that of the next immediate year deviation so that either continual warming or cooling appears to take place from the termination of one ENSO to the initiation of the next. When the deviations around the secular trend shown by the warmest month average temperatures are summed for the inter-ENSO intervals (the separate non-ENSO years) the resultant ''heat-loading'' index is positively correlated with the following (initial) ENSO warmest month deviation from the overall ENSO warmest month secular trend. This provides an immediate predictive mechanism for the likely strength of an ENSO, in terms of the dry season impact to the Island of Java, should one occur in the next year to break a non-ENSO sequence. The length of the build-up and the build-up achieved seems not to be related. The relationship does not in itself however, predict the occurrence of the ''next'' ENSO.
   The data show that a consistent structure underlies ENSO events for the last century and a quarter. However, as a process monitored by mean monthly air-temperature measurements at Jakarta-Semarang, the system is changing in character with time in association with an overall atmospheric temperature increase in a way that involves increased intra-annual temperature fluctuations. In general ENSO years are associated with higher temperatures than non-ENSO years, with a significant negative correlation between subsequent years which are thereafter systematically cooler. This may be because the ENSO event actively mixes excess heat energy into the ocean-sink to an extent that is in direct proportion to the outstanding positive temperature deviation. A weak ENSO, preceded by a relatively modest temperature build-up in the lead-up non-ENSO years, then results in limited mixing which leads to a relatively warm subsequent year while a strong event leads to extensive mixing and so generally results in a following very much cooler year. Atmospheric temperature build-up possibly associated with the greenhouse effect may be coupled to an increasingly wider temperature swing in west and central Java associated with the warm pool influence but anchored by the ocean-sink.

TI  - SOME GEOCHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR ACCIDENT
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - The Chernobyl nuclear accident took place on 1986-04-26, and resulted in radionuclide pollution of vast regions of Byelorussia. This has raised several geochemical problems: (1) investigation of the distribution and behaviour of radionuclides in the natural and technogenic landscapes (which were examined as a result of a 5-a study); (2) modes of occurrence of radioactive elements in the environment; and (3) preliminary estimation of radionuclide migration in the future. As background information. geochemical studies carried out within Byelorussia, as well as landscape investigations in the period 1953-1987 made under the guidance of K. 1. Lukashev were very important for solving the above questions. According to the results of these investigations, the lithogeochemical and hydrogeochemical zoning of Byelorussia is understood and the radioactive background of the republic was studied in the 1960s, as well as the distribution and peculiarities of clay minerals, carbonates, Fe-Mn oxides, organic matter, pH-Eh. and the contents of many elements in the surficial deposits of Byelorussia. All these factors arc of great importance for understanding the behaviour of radionuclides.
   Radionuclide fallout on Byelorussia in the first days after the accident was mainly dependent on the mass movement of air and rain. In cities, fallout was confined to regions with intensive industrial dust emissions, as well as to river valleys, where degassing of deep-seated zones through faults occurred side by side with evaporation. Radionuclide washout from upland territories can be related to secondary processes.
   After 5 a, the radioactive emission near the surface of the Earth decreased due to the decay of short-lived isotopes and penetration of radionuclides deeper into the soil, although the major part still occurs at a depth of 1-5 cm. Bogs, peat-bog soils, aquifers with fluctuating groundwater levels, variable pH-Eh conditions and a high biological activity are all factors contributing to radionuclide migration in the Byelorussian landscape. A part of the radionuclides is gradually removed from eluvial landscapes and accumulated in subareal landscapes (e.g. lakes, oxbow-lakes, water-storage basins).
   The Chernobyl debris are represented by the following substances: ''hot'' particles, pseudocolloids, aerosols and gaseous compounds. Study of the modes of occurrence of radionuclides by different methods (e.g. extracts, sorbents) made it possible to estimate the migration capacity of some radionuclides (Cs, Sr, Ce, Ru), and to distinguish two zones around the reactor-the nearest and remote ones-differing in the ratio of ''hot'' particles and condensate fallout, which causes a different migration capacity of radionuclides.
   A very important part is assigned to biological processes and organic matter, which cause the destruction of 'hot'' particles, the formation of organometallic complexes, and water migration of nuclides.
   In the future (within 300 and more years), the redistribution of radionuclides in the landscape involves processes of weathering, erosion and sedimentation which will strongly depend on climatic conditions. Side by side with a gradual decay of Cs and Sr, an appreciable accumulation of Am-241, which is very mobile in landscapes, should be expected due to decaying Pu-241.
   A considerable development of scientific and applied exploration should also be expected in the future and this will help in solving problems of radioactive pollution of landscapes.

LA  - English
AB  - The 1693 earthquake was a disastrous event affecting eastern Sicily, southern Italy, where it caused over 60,000 victims and total destruction of several villages and towns in the districts of Siracusa, Ragusa, and Catania. The earthquake was followed by a tsunami that struck the Ionian coasts of Sicily and the Messina Strait and was probably observed even in the Aeolian Islands. Historical documents on sea waves and flooding, though not abundant, allow us to form a picture of the tsunami first attack and inundation. The first water movement all along the Sicilian coastline was a strong sea withdrawal, followed by a violent sea return and coastal flooding. The main purpose of this research is to put constraints on the focal mechanism of this earthquake on the basis of the available documents on the tsunami (1) by simulating tsunami from different possible sources via numerical modeling based on finite element technique and shallow water approximation and (2) by choosing the source best fitting the tsunami data as the most plausible cause for this tsunami. The relevance of this study should also be evaluated in light of the circumstance that no certain indication on the earthquake fault can be deduced from the available macroseismic data alone. Solving the source problem for this event, one of the largest occurring in southeastern Sicily in historical times, is a significant contribution to understanding the seismotectonic regime of the region and to assessing the related earthquake and tsunami hazard/risk with implications on mitigation policies.

TI  - MEGARIPPLE DYNAMICS AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IN A MESOTIDAL MANGROVE CREEK - IMPLICATIONS FOR PALAEOFLOW RECONSTRUCTIONS
T2  - SEDIMENTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - An experiment was conducted to study megaripple morphodynamics on a sandy intertidal shoal in a mesotidal mangrove creek (Gordon Creek, Townsville, Australia). Tidal current velocity and depth were recorded with S4 current meters over a period of 35 tides. The tidal megaripples were 0 . 06-0 . 2 m in height and 1-2 m in wavelength, and their movement was monitored by (1) electromagnetic bed-elevation probes (which automatically recorded bed level every 2 min at three positions along the survey transect) and (2) daily surveying for 8 days around spring tidals.
   The tidal currents in Gordon Creek are ebb-dominated, with maximum depth-mean current velocities for the flood and ebb tides of 0 . 62 and 0 . 98 m s(-1) respectively. Significant bedload transport occurs only during spring tides, and only on the larger of the unequal semi-diurnal tides. Bedload transport is overwhelmingly in the ebb direction. Megaripple migration rates reach 5 . 6 m per tide in the ebb direction and up to 0 . 1 m min(-1) within individual tides. Within-tide 'bedform transport rates' are up to 0 . 29 kg m(-1) s(-1).
   The results suggest that for reconstruction of palaeoflows from deposits of preserved fine- to medium-grained sandy tidal megaripples, it is valid to use a depth-averaged velocity of 0 . 5-0 . 6 m s(-1) as the migration threshold. Velocity thresholds associated with partial or complete reversal of megaripple asymmetry are invalid.

AB  - The delivery, flux and fate of terrigenous sediment entering the Great Barrier Reef lagoon has been a focus of recent studies and represents an ongoing environmental concern. Wave-induced bed stress is the most significant mechanism of sediment resuspension in the Great Barrier Reef, and field data and mathematical modelling indicates that the combined effects of short-period wind waves, longer period swell waves, and tidal and wind-driven currents can often exceed the critical bed stress for resuspension. Suspended-sediment concentrations at 20 m water depth indicate resuspension seldom occurs on the middle shelf under normal wave conditions. Non-cyclonic turbidity events are generally confined to the inner shelf. The wave climate in the southern sector of the central Great Barrier Reef lagoon is the most erosive, and resuspension of outer shelf sediments was hindcast for recorded cyclones. Wind-driven, longshore currents are fundamental to the northward movement of sediment, and the annual northward mass flux from embayments undergoing resuspension in the Burdekin region is estimated to be one order of magnitude larger than the mass of sediment introduced by a moderate flood plume. Strong onshore winds are estimated to generate significant three-dimensional bottom return currents on approximately 30-70 days per year, forming a potentially significant offshore-directed sediment flux during high suspended-sediment concentration events on the inner shelf.

AB  - Three large earthquakes with surface-wave magnitudes 6.3-6.7 on 22 January 1988 were associated with 32 km of surface faulting on two main scarps 30 km southwest of Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. These events provide an excellent opportunity to study the mechanics of midplate earthquakes because of the abundance of geological and geophysical data in the area, the proximity of the Warramunga seismic array and the ease of access to the fault zone. The 1988 earthquakes were located in the North Australian Craton in an area that had no history of moderate or large earthquakes before 1986. Additionally, no smaller earthquakes from the fault zone were identified at the Warramunga array, which is situated only 30 km from the nearest scarp, between the 1965 installation of the array and 1986. The main shocks were preceded by a swarm of moderate-sized (magnitude 4-5) earthquakes in January 1987 and many smaller aftershocks throughout 1987. Careful relocation of all teleseismically recorded earthquakes from the fault zone shows that the 1987 activity was concentrated in an area only 6 km across in the gap between the two main fault scarps. The main shocks also nucleated in the centre of the fault zone near the 1987 activity. Field observations of scarp morphology indicate that the scarp is divided into three segments, each showing primarily reverse faulting. However, whereas the western and eastern segments show movement of the southern block over the northern, the central scarp segment shows the opposite, with the northern block thrust over the southern block.
   Analysis of the first arrival times at Warramunga suggests that the three main shocks were associated with the western, central and eastern scarp segments, respectively. The locations of aftershocks determined using data from temporary seismograph arrays in the epicentral area define three inclined zones of activity that are interpreted as fault planes. In the western and eastern portions of the aftershock zone, these concentrations of activity dip to the south at 45-degrees and 35-degrees, respectively, but in the central section the aftershock zone dips to the north at 55-degrees. Focal mechanisms derived from modelling broadband teleseismic data show thrust and oblique thrust faulting for the three main shocks. The first event ruptured unilaterally up and to the northwest on the westernmost fault segment, while the third main shock ruptured horizontally to the southeast. Modelling of repeat levelling data from the epicentral area requires at least three distinct fault planes, with the eastern and western planes dipping to the south and the central plane dipping to the north. The combination of scarp morphology, aftershock distribution and elevation data makes a strong case for rupture of fault planes in conjugate orientation during the 22 January 1988 Tennant Creek earthquakes. More than 20 000 aftershocks have been recorded at Warramunga and activity continues to the present-day with occasional shocks felt in the town of Tennant Creek and some recent off-fault aftershocks located directly under the Warramunga seismic array. Stratigraphic relationships exposed in trenches excavated across the scarps suggest that during the Quaternary, a large earthquake ruptured the surface along one segment of the 1988 scarps.

AB  - The application and value of rapid geomorphological mapping techniques in the assessment of slope instability and erosion hazards in the remote and mountainous area of Ok Tedi mine, Papua New Guinea, are reviewed.  It is believed that this mapping is the first to have been systematically applied to any mining operation in remote mountainous terrain.  Rock avalanches and landslides are features of the area around the mine and represent potential hazards to mine operations.  In 1989 an avalanche with an estimated volume of 70 000 000 m3 occurred in close proximity to the mine and prompted a multidisciplinary geotechnical study of the entire mine operational area.  The assessment of landslide hazard and geomorphological mapping formed integral parts of the study and were carried out at rates of 0.6-0.75 km2 per week.  They yielded the following documentation for geotechnical management:  1:10 000-scale maps and data files of landslide, flooding and erosion hazards for the 2.5-km2 mine lease area and a 300 m wide band along the 40-km service corridor; 1:2500-scale maps showing soils, rocks, drainage, landforms and slope instability over a total area of 9 km2; 1:2500-scale interpretative terrain evaluation maps, together with maps of structural geology, for the identification of likely mechanisms, volumes and effects of existing and potential slope failures; and maps at a scale of 1:2500 showing potential failure runout from the slopes above the mine township.
   This documentation, together with the conclusions reached and recommendations made, played an important role in the geotechnical assessment of slopes in the mine operational area.  The techniques that were used on the project and the approach that was adopted in general should prove cost-effective when applied to other mining projects that face similar terrain hazards.  Nevertheless, some difficulty remains in the interpretation of geomorphological data with respect to outcomes and effects over engineering time-scales.  The limits to what can be achieved without intensive geotechnical investigation and analysis must be identified before engineering and project-management decisions are made.

AB  - Thirty years of civil war in the Sudan have resulted in the isolation of the southern provinces which border Central and East Africa. Consequently, little is known about the epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in this region. To estimate the prevalence of HIV-1 infection in southern Sudan and the risk factors associated with disease transmission, a seroepidemiologic survey was conducted in the township of Juba. Study subjects invited to participate in this study included medical outpatients, inpatients hospitalized for active tuberculosis, and female prostitutes. A total of 401 subjects participated in the study. HIV-1 infection was confirmed in 25 subjects. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection was 19% (8/42) among tuberculosis patients, 16% (8/50) among prostitutes, and 3% (9/309) among outpatients. A significantly higher prevalence of HIV-1 infection was found among female prostitutes when compared to female outpatients: 16% (8/50) vs. 2% (4/178), P < 0.001. Correspondingly, the prevalence of seropositives was significantly higher among male outpatients reporting a history of sexual relations with prostitutes during the prior 10 years compared to male outpatients denying relations with prostitutes: 14% (5/37) vs. 0% (0/94), P = 0.001. A history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) was also associated with HIV-1 infection among male outpatients. The findings of this study indicate that HIV-1 infection is highly prevalent in southern Sudan and that prostitutes and their sexual partners represent a major reservoir of HIV infection in this population. This epidemiologic pattern resembles that seen in the African nations neighboring southern Sudan. Further spread of HIV-1 to northern Sudan could occur because of the movement of military personnel and refugees between the North and South of Sudan. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.(*)

AB  - Steady and transient flow models for regional brine migration have been constructed for quantifying the role of groundwater in the genesis of carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits in the U.S. Midcontinent region. Earlier theoretical studies suggested that ores of the Mississippi Valley type formed as deep groundwater was driven out of basins and onto platform margins by elevated topography (Garven and Freeze, 1984a, b). Several basins surround the major ore districts of the Midcontinent region, but it was the tectonic uplift after the Alleghanian orogeny of Late Pennsylvanian time that created the topography necessary  for driving brines out of the basins and onto the adjacent domes where the ore deposits formed. A typical paleohydrologic reconstruction extending across the Arkoma basin and onto the Ozark dome shows that Cambrian-Ordovician strata acted as regional aquifers in focusing metal-bearing brines at Darcy flow rates of 1.0 to 5.0 m/yr in topography-driven flow systems. Numerical simulations of basin compaction and thrust-induced flow suggest a minor role for sediment compaction and the ''squeegee'' effect in ore formation, especially for the huge ore districts far-removed from the orogenic belts. Ore mineralization associated with topography-driven flow occurred in less than a few million years at temperatures between 80-degrees and 130-degrees-C in broad discharge areas in southeast Missouri, although much warmer thermal transients may have lasted for about 100,000 yrs. Geothermal gradients in discharge areas were strongly elevated by regional flow associated with foreland uplift, yet lateral temperatures gradients are predicted to have been very small in the platform aquifers. Other hydrogeologic simulations predicted similar broad discharge areas in southern Wisconsin and southern Illinois with transient temperatures of ore formation between 150-degrees and 220-degrees-C because of brine movement through the deep Illinois Basin and Reelfoot Rift, respectively.
   Alleghanian uplift of the Appalachians evolved such that paleo-relief probably reached a maximum first in the northeast and then migrated south, culminating with subaerial exposure of the Ouachita fold belt and Arkoma platform. Based on this tectonic interpretation, regional fluid migration pathways are likely to have varied considerably throughout the Late Paleozoic. For example, ores along the Old Lead Belt in Missouri may reflect a discharge pathway for brines driven to the west out of the Appalachian foredeep and Illinois sag as illustrated in two of the simulation models. A similar scenario probably applied for the ore districts in Tennessee. Later uplift in the southern Appalachians drove brines northwesterly out of the Black Warrior Basin and into southeast Missouri, perhaps adding another chemical signature to ore formation in the Old Lead Belt. Mineralization in the Upper Mississippi Valley District is most likely to have originated through the migration of brines out of the Appalachian foredeep and across part of the Illinois sag as a direct result of uplift of the Appalachian Mountains rather than later by uplift of the Pascola Arch in southern Illinois (Bethke, 1986). Uplift of the Ouachita Mountains and foreland platform resulted in the massive migration of brines to the north and in part to the northeast. Ores in the Tri-State District, Northern Arkansas, Viburnum Trend, and Central Missouri record this hydrologic system of which there is little dispute. Deep brines also would have moved easily along the axis of the Reelfoot Rift under a gravity-drive to form the fluorite deposits in southern Illinois. Ore genesis waned in the earliest Mesozoic as erosion dissipated the topography-driven flow systems. Emergence of the Rocky Mountains in the Tertiary resulted in easterly brine migration across the Denver and Forest City basins, but this flow system was too weak in Missouri to play a role in ore formation.

AB  - The idea that families and individuals in England between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries were highly mobile has now been explored in some detail. It is clear that most people could expect to move at least once during their lifetime, that much of this movement was short distance and that the risks of migration were much heavier at certain points of the life cycle than others. The consequences of such mobility for studies which focus on individual spatial communities as a vehicle for studying social structure, institutions or demography are potentially very severe. Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than in the fact that most English family reconstitutions can detect baptism dates for less than 40 per cent of all people marrying in a place. Against this backdrop, the idea that studying a 'local country' defined by walking distance, the physical extent of occupational or religious networks or the width of the labour market, has particular attractions. This article argues that in practice we do not know enough in the English context about the character of migration, the motivations for migration or the reception of migrants, to be able to test the usefulness of theoretical notions of 'local country'. Using a case study of a large West Yorkshire parish between the mid-seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries, this article shows that motivations for migration were often very complex and that migrants who came into townships in the parish, even where they came from other townships in the parish itself, did not integrate easily and without stress into the networks which shaped the character of everyday life for those longer resident. Indeed, the excellent sources for the parish would seem to show that migrants were marginalized economically and spatially, such that eventual acceptance was accorded to the children of migrants, not migrants themselves. Even if migrants theoretically shared the same local country, and even if they had previous connections with the township or individual families within it, there were no guarantees of easy integration. In this part of West Yorkshire then, the idea of a 'local country' as a framework for studying demography or social structure has only limited validity. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The Campi Flegrei caldera is a complex structure in which resurgence occurs through a simple shearing mechanism. The mast uplifted block inside the caldera is the La Starza block. The caldera has shown signs of unrest since 1969 with two bradyseismic events which generated a net vertical ground displacement of 3.5 m around the town of Pozzuoli. The first event occurred between 1969 and 1972, when the ground was uplifted of 1.74 m, while the second took place between 1982 and 1984 and produced a vertical displacement of 1.79 m. These events have been followed by subsidence with small uplifts of few centimeters. Uplifting events, despite the amount of ground displacement, are always accompanied by seismicity which is absent during subsidence. We have performed an analysis of the ground deformation and seismic data collected since 1970. The results obtained on the two independent sets of data are very much concordant. The ground deformation is not quasi bell-shaped as previously suggested, instead its geometry is strongly constrained by structural discontinuities. Seismicity is confined in a rectangular area, NE-SW elongated and centered on the La Starza block. The margins of this area are marked by earthquakes whose hypocenters describe vertical planes which reach depths of about 5 km. The hypocenters of the earthquakes located in the La Starza block are shallower than 3 km. Focal mechanisms of the earthquakes whose hypocenters describe a NNW-SSE fault plane in the Pozzuoli bay show reverse fault solutions, while those of the earthquakes located on the opposite side of the La Starza block show normal fault solutions. All these data well constraints the hypothesis that resurgence occurs through a simple shearing mechanism (Orsi et al., 1996). We have also performed a finite elements modeling of the ground deformation data. This modeling shows that the detected deformation can be accounted for by an overpressure of 75 MPa in a source with a radius of 1 km, located at 5 km depth in a medium characterized by the detected structural discontinuities.

AB  - On June 15th, 1995 a locally destructive earthquake of magnitude M(s) 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred offshore, 7.5 km NNE of the town of Aegion, in the western Gulf of Corinth (Greece). An offshore survey using 3.5 kHz subbottom profiling system and a remote operated vehicle (ROV) has shown that the earthquake caused small sized subaerial to submarine sediment failure in at least four sites, in three fan delta deposits: the Rododafni; the Eliki and the Tolofonas. The fan deltas were located within a radius of about 9 km from the epicentre. The areal size of the four sediment failure sites ranged from 2 x 10(4) m(2) to 6 x 10(5) m(2), whilst the volume of the failed masses ranged from 4 x 10(3) to 3 x 10(6) m(3). The sediment deformation types identified at the failure sites consist of ground cracking, rotational slides, elongated slides, sediment gravity flows and extrusion of mixtures of water and sand (sand boils). The sediment failure in the four sites affected the upper 5-6 m of well layered Holocene (?) topset and foreset fan delta deposits. The failure occurred on slopes ranging from 0.2 degrees to 23 degrees and the slip planes were all bedding planes which have a gradient from 0.2 degrees to 21 degrees.
   The dominant instability mechanism that caused the sediment failure in the Rododafni and Eliki fan deltas is considered to be liquefaction of a shallow sub-surface horizon. The liquefaction was caused by elevated pore pressure enhanced perhaps by the presence of gas, resulting from the cyclic loading induced by the earthquake. The liquefied layer is assumed to have temporarily provided a failure surface for sliding to take place on and caused movement of sand that was ejected onto the surface.
   In the Tolofonas fan delta the causative mechanism in the case of the multi-block rotational slide is considered to be deformation of the underlying sediments caused by remoulding and/or liquefaction while in the case of the elongated slide it is considered to be the result of a combination of shear stress increase and/or strength degradation of the unconsolidated sediment. Both of these conditions could have been generated during the cyclic loading resulting from the Aegion earthquake.
   The study of historical documents reveals that sediment failure like those described above have also occurred at least four times during the past 2500 years in the same locations. Therefore, it is suggested that they could be repeated in the future by any earthquake event with a magnitude greater than 6 R, depending upon the proximity of the site to the earthquake epicentre.

TI  - The rise of women's education in the United States and Korea: A struggle for educational and occupational equality
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES

KW  - COLLEGES
AB  - When, why, and how did women in the United States and Korea become educated? Although independent studies have documented the rise of education for women in each country, no analysis has yet compared hen: in these seemingly dissimilar cultures education became not an oddity for women but a modern necessity. Although the revolution in women's education resulted from and gave rise to profound ideological shifts in both countries, it tool; its roots as well in radical political and economic changes that accompanied industrialization. In the United States women's education began in the post-Revolutionary period (1780-1835) with the growth of public town schools and private seminaries devoted primarily to inculcating domestic ideals, morality, and civic virtue. Mary Lyon's founding of the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1837 marked the advent of higher education for women, which then accelerated the push for other women's colleges, co-education, and the opening of teaching as a ''feminized'' profession during the mid-to late-nineteenth century. Excluded from formal education under the Yi Dynasty (1392-1910), Korean women were modestly educated in feminine morality and virtue based upon Confucian doctrines that strictly limited their roles to the domestic household. When Methodist missionary Mary Scranton founded Ewha Hakdang in 1886 for one student, it became Korea's first formal educational institution for women, subsequently offering the first college-level program in 1910, providing almost the exclusive access to higher education under Japanese colonial rule until 1945, and awarding 97% of its degrees between 1948 and 1985. Although deriving from fundamentally different backgrounds, Puritanism or evangelical Protestantism in the United States and the Confucian philosophy in Korea, the early rationales for women's education involved a similar blend of religious prescriptions, democratic and domestic imperatives, sind eventually arguments for socioeconomic utility. But within the overt agendas articulated by educational leaders or prescribed by the state lay hidden the seeds of what would become the twentieth-century goals for women: the right to an education, the demand for equal education for women, the pursuit of independence and personal autonomy, and the push for economic security through occupational opportunity and mobility. How the women's movement has changed the destiny and mission of women's colleges, without denying the heritage that shaped these institutions from their founding, provides a textbook example of the shifts in women's education that have occurred over nearly 200 years in the United States and 100 years in Korea. This comparative analysis, therefore, begins by examining the historical and ideological roots of women's education, then focuses specifically on the rise of Mount Holyoke and of Ewha Womans University as the first women's colleges in the United States and Korea respectively. By examining career and employment patterns of women graduates, we begin to see how education altered women's lives and occupational choices and how women's aspirations have been met or frustrated by labor force trends, entrenched economic structures, and socio-cultural mores. Although differences;surely emerge, what is more striking is the similarity in patterns of development and in the spirit of the pioneering women and men who opened the doors to education for women - doors to minds that can never be closed.

AB  - Objective. To assess whether small elevations in blood lead level were associated with measurable behavioral changes in a group of poor children between 1 and 3 years old.
   Methods. The study population consisted of children presenting for routine well-child care to the pediatric clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center, a large urban public hospital. The following inclusion criteria were used for entry into the study: age 12 to 36 months; capillary lead screening result <1.21 mu mol/L (25 mu g/dL); no known prior history either of blood lead level >1.21 mu mol/L (25 mu g/dL) or lead exposure requiring chelation therapy; Latino or African-American; English or Spanish spoken in the home; biological mother as primary caretaker; child not presently attending day care; full-term, singleton gestation; birth weight at least 2500 g; no known neurologic or developmental disorder; and no severe chronic disease, including human immunodeficiency virus infection. Study enrollment was simultaneously stratified by capillary lead level and age.
   All children between 12 and 36 months attending the pediatric clinic during the study period received screening capillary blood measures of lead level following the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics as part of routine primary care. During periods of enrollment, consecutive lead measurements performed in the pediatric clinic were reviewed by one of the researchers. For those children meeting entry criteria based on lead level and age, further eligibility based on the remainder of the inclusion criteria was determined through parental interview and review of the medical record.
   Lead exposure was assessed with a single capillary blood specimen, using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Subjects were considered to be lead-exposed if their lead level was between 0.48 and 1.20 mu mol/L (10 and 24.9 mu g/dL) and nonexposed if their lead level was between 0 and 0.48 mu mol/L (0 and 9.9 mu g/dL).
   Behavior was assessed using the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition. The BRS in this age group consists of three components: an Emotional Regulation Factor that measures hyperactive/distractible/easy-frustration behaviors; an Orientation-Engagement Factor that measures fear/withdrawal/disinterest behaviors; and a Motor Quality Factor that assesses the appropriateness of movement and tone. The BRS is scored as a percentile; lower scores reflect more problematic behaviors. Researchers performing the BRS were blinded to capillary lead results.
   Information was collected concerning factors that might confound the relationship between lead and behavior. Demographic factors were collected, including: child's age, gender, and country of origin; mother's age, marital status, parity, country of origin, and primary language spoken; parental education, and occupation and receipt of public assistance. Socioeconomic status was determined using the Hollingshead Two-Factor Inner of Social Position. Maternal verbal IQ was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. Maternal depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Cognitive stimulation provided in the home was assessed using a new office-based instrument, the StimQ, which measures the quantity and quality of play materials and parent-toddler activities in the child's home. To assess the child for iron deficiency, we performed a hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume at the time of the capillary lead evaluation. A presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency was made if the child was either anemic (defined as a hematocrit <32) or had a mean corpuscular volume <72.
   Results. The study sample consisted of 72 children. Children in the lead-exposed group (n = 41) had a mean BRS behavior score that was 15.8 points lower than that of children in the nonexposed group (n = 31), which was significant by the Student's t test. For the emotional regulation factor measuring hyperactive/impulsive/easy-frustration behaviors, children in the exposed group had a mean score that was 14.6 points lower than that of the nonexposed group, which was significant by the Student's t test. For the orientation-engagement factor measuring fear/withdrawal/disinterest behaviors, children in the exposed group had a mean score that was 14.1 points lower, significant by the Student's t test.
   Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the independent relationship between BRS (total and factor scores) and lead group, after adjusting for potential confounders. Six variables were related to either lead group or BRS behavior score in unadjusted analysis and were, therefore, included as potential confounders in each of the multiple regressions: child's age and gender, and mother's age, verbal IQ, depression score, and provision of cognitive stimulation.
   In the analysis of the relationship between the BRS total score and lead group, the adjusted mean BRS behavior score in the exposed group was 17.3 points (95% confidence [CI]: 3.3, 31.3) lower than that of children in the nonexposed group (sr = -0.27). In the analysis of the relationship between the emotional regulation factor and lead group, the adjusted mean factor score in the exposed group was 16.6 points (95% CI: 2.1, 31.2) lower than that for the nonexposed group (sr = -0.25). In the analysis of the relationship between the orientation-engagement factor and lead group, the exposed group had an adjusted mean score that was 14.2 points (95% CI: -2.1, 30.5) lower than that for the nonexposed group (sr = -0.20).
   In these multiple regression analyses, mother's depression score was significantly associated with a lower total BRS score (sr = -0.25) and with lower emotional regulation factor (sr = -0.23). Older children had higher BRS scores (sr = 0.20), and had significantly higher emotional regulation factor scores (sr = 0.22). A relationship was observed between male gender and lower emotional regulation scores that did not reach significance (sr = -0.21). Iron deficiency, cognitive stimulation provided in the home and mother's verbal IQ were not related to any measures of behavior.
   Conclusions. Low-level lead exposure is associated with adverse behavioral changes in very young preschool children. This association may be particularly important for poor children, who are also at risk for behavior problems on the basis of other environmental factors such as maternal depression. Clinicians should consider screening for behavioral problems in very young children with low-level lead exposure.

AB  - Shortly after the crucial political changes connected with the events in November 1989 in Czechoslovakia, some differences in political attitudes and behavior of the Czech and Slovak population appeared. An increasing tension in the Czech - Slovak relations finally led to a peaceful dissociation of the federal Czechoslovakia and to the formation of two sovereign states at the beginning of 1993. It is no wonder that this important change caused a serious discussion of social scientists of the both societies about the societal reasons and consequences of this unexpected and sudden historical and political phenomenon. The author of the present study in agreement with Jiri Musil prefers the comparison of different developments of cultural and social structures in the Czech lands and Slovakia to somewhat superficial historical and politological analyses of the split as a unique event.
   He disposes at some serious and historically relevant sociological evidence concerning the development of Czech-Slovak relationships, namely with the results of some representative Czech and Slovak sociological surveys, particularly from the years 1967, 1984, 1998, April 1993 and October 1993. Except the 1984 survey, he personally participated in all of them.
   In the second half of the 1960s, the Czech lands and Slovakia substantially differed in cultural and social respect. Above all one could observe big differences concerning the degree od urbanization in favour of the Czech lands. Slovakia remained then a country with settlement structure of rural type and with much more traditional way of life.
   A similar lag was characteristic for the structure of economically active population in respect to industrial branches. In the 1960s, the Czech lands belonged, according to their pre-war traditions and in the consequence of the enforced repeated industrialization (for military needs of the Soviet block in the period of the Cold War), to extensively industrialized societies, whereas Slovakia was rather a rural-industrial society where a recently started extensive industrialization went on.
   Towards the end of the 1960s the educational level of the Slovak population was already relatively close to that of the Czech one, although some distinctions still remained.
   At the same time, many important differences lasted in the material level of household equipment which was relatively better in the Czech lands. On the other hand, in consequence of the redistributive economic system, the average earnings were already nearly equal.
   In autumn 1967, on the very eve of the political crisis which signalized the outburst of events known as Prague Spring 1968, a large sociological survey of a representative sample of adult males dealing with social stratification and mobility was carried out by the Czech and Slovak sociologists in cooperation with the State Statistical Office. Its results were published two years later, unfortunately already after the Warsaw Pact Intervention which led to the defeat of the reform attempt connected with the Prague Spring. A special chapter in this book was written by a group of Slovak sociologists headed by R. Rosko. The authors proved that the social status distribution in Slovakia was in the late 1960s significantly lower in the average than the analogical distribution in the Czech lands. It was caused by small differences in the participation of individuals in management, in the level of work complexity typical for the occupational structures in question, and in the distribution of earnings; by more remarkable differences in level of education and material equipment of households; and by large differences concerning average income per capita, standards of consumption and cultural level of the life-style. In general, these findings demonstrated a still lasting deep cultural and social inequality of the Czech and Slovak part of the country. This social unbalance was multiplied by the consequences of the anti-Slovak political repressions in the late 1940s and in the 1950s and of the ''constitutional reform'' from 1960 which brought suppression of the Slovak autonomy in favour of the centralized bureaucratic Prague administration. All these circumstances stimulated a high dissatisfaction of the relatively younger population of Slovakia living in conditions of a rapid demographic development, progress of urbanization and industrialization. It was important for the specific character of the social and political reform movement in 1968 on the Slovak territory which finally caused one of the few real successes of the Prague Spring - the constitutional act declaring federalization of the Czechoslovak Republic.
   In the practical politics of the ''normalization'' regime installed by the Soviet intervention in August 1968, the originally intended federative arrangement was ''via facti'' replaced by a new version of the totalitarian and bureaucratic centralism. However, this time the political regime was in a sense more favourable for Slovakia. The Slovak Communist leaders gained for more better and in some respect even decisive positions in the Prague central administration of the country than any time before. Some changes in this respect occurred only in the late 1980s. In consequence of all this, the process of the secondary redistribution of the GDP in favor of Slovakia not only continued but even intensified in the 1970s and 1980s. Simultaneously, political oppressions concerning hundreds of thousands of participants in the Prague Spring events were in this period sensibly weaker in Slovakia than in the Czech lands. Thus, paradoxically, the ''normalization regime'' brought some advantages for Slovakia as compared with the past.
   Some evidence for this can be find in the data collected by Czech sociologists in the sociological survey on ''class and social structure'' in 1984, i.e. shortly before the beginning of the Soviet ''perestroika''. A recent secondary analysis of this data shows therefore a cultural and social situation typical for the normalization system on the top point of its development. It is not very surprising that thanks to the permanent operation of the redistributive mechanisms during fifteen years after the final defeat of the Prague Spring the cultural and social characteristics of the Czech and Slovak adult populations were mutually much closer in 1984 than in 1967. There remained practically no differences in work complexity and in average earnings. The quality of housing was approximately the same. The households were telephonized in very close percentages. People were equally active in professional studying and in political activities (in official politics, of course). In some respects small differences in favour of the Czech population still existed. This is true as far as the global educational level, the percentage of managers and some items of the households equipment are concerned. In their leisure, Czech population was more frequently engaged in typically urban cultural activities. The Slovak population lived in a substantially higher percentage in their own private houses, in more rooms per family and in better environment than the Czech did. They had in more cases gardens or other land at their disposal and devoted themselves more frequently to domestic agricultural work. They also were more active in social contacts, in visiting relatives, neighbours and friends.
   Still slightly better economic position of the households in the Czech lands - caused partly by lower average number of the more aged Czech families - expressed itself in somewhat higher evaluation of the standard of living from the part of the Czech population.
   In other words, in the midst of the 1980s, the cultural and social characteristics of the Slovak population were already close to the Czech standards but some lag in this respect still existed. Anyway, the Czech lands represented the stagnating part of the federation, while Slovakia was the progressing one.
   The beginning of the Soviet perestroika signalized the Czech population that a new historical crisis of the Soviet-type societies was coming. Feelings of dissatisfaction with the stagnation of the Czech lands combined with political frustration of the citizens of an occupied country gradually grew up, particularly when some difficulties concerning standard of living emerged in the second half of the 1980s. A certain dissappointment caused by the unwillingness of the Gorbatchev's leadership to revise the Soviet official attitude to the events of 1968 also played an important role. The Slovak population living still under the protection of current redistributive processes and under a little better political conditions did not feel these changes as intensively as the Czech did. It is no wonder that these specificities influenced the subjective evaluations of the economic, social, political and cultural situation in the country. In the public opinion polls from the second half of the 1980s, the degree of satisfaction of the Slovak population concerning nearly all questions asked then was significantly higher than that of the Czech citizens. Gradually, as the crisis of 1989 was coming nearer, the evaluations were less and less favourable for the regime in both republics. However, the Czech criticism grew more rapidly than the criticism of the population in Slovakia.
   The ''Velvet Revolution'' of 1989 was initiated mainly by the Czech dissidents and the politically active part of the Czech people. It found an active response also in analogical groups in Slovakia. However, in the course of the year 1990, when the outline of the radical economic reform was prepared by the Federal Government and the first practical steps of it were undertaken, a new shift in the structure of value orientations occurred. Of crucial significance was above all the declaration of President Havel demanding the liquidation of the arms producing industry, strongly developed particularly in Slovakia, and the first measures to its realization.
   The author of the study disposes at representative data from the survey on social transformation (autumn 1991) confronting the objective status positions of the adult population with their subjective attitudes. As far as the objective characteristics are concerned, the results of the survey on social transformation were summoned by the author in 1992 as follows:
   ''We discussed systematically all the relevant partial dimensions of the social position (status)...In all of these dimensions we could record only two significant signals of larger social differences. The first of them is a better standard of housing and a bigger amount of family fortunes in Slovakia (relativized, of course, by higher numerousness of families...). The second is a more often declaration of the subjective feelings of a worse market and especially financial attainability of consumption goods and services in Slovakia as well. In behind of this statement is hidden a more significant factor of a lower income per capita, connected with the already mentioned higher number of family members, and a different perception of the reality, influenced by the difference of social dynamics in the both republics. In no case, however, it is possible to speak about two fundamentally different status hierarchies with an essentially distinct context corresponding to two different phases of the civilization and cultural development.''
   In other words, the cultural and social processes typical of the 1970s and 1980s, namely the stagnation and the beginning of an absolute decline in the Czech Republic and the continuing (although also limited by the character of the totalitarian and anti-meritocratic social system common for both of the two parts of the Federation) relative progress in Slovakia led to a nearly full equalization of the social unbalance which had been observed in 1967.
   On the other hand, the data from 1991 revealed a deep discrepancy between the balanced objective data and large differences of the subjective perception of the social situation. In principle, the evaluation both of the past and of the future transformation processes was much more favourable in the Czech than in the Slovak Republic.
   The most apparent differences in evaluation between the two republics could be found in the fields of standard of living and of social security.
   It was quite clear that such deep differences in attitudes could not be explained by those objective facts that revealed the attained social equalization of the Czech lands and Slovakia but rather in the specificities of the recent development of the two societies after the ''Velvet Revolution''. Anyway, the contradictory shape of the popular attitudes became one of the stimuli that helped the victory of more liberal and pro-federalist rifht-wing political parties in the Czech Republic and rather anti-federalist political parties and movements in Slovakia in the elections of 1992. The election victors decided after relatively short negotiations, without asking people in a referendum, to dissociate the common state of Czechs and Slovaks. It happened at the beginning of 1993 in peaceful way and is acknowledged at present as a matter of fact by majorities of populations in both new states.
   It is highly interesting by now to find out what have been the further destinies of people in both countries as far as the objective positions and the subjective attitudes are concerned. A substantial contribution to this kind of knowledge could bring large representative sociological surveys of about 5000 adult respondents in the Czech and Slovak Republic that took place in April 1993 as a part of broader comparative survey on social stratification and mobility in Eastern Europe. The second important contribution could be drawn from paralel surveys of somewhat smaller representative samples devoted to the study of beliefs and behaviour of Czech and Slovak people carried out in autumn 1993.
   As far as the objective aspect of the problem is concerned, one can state that the economically active population of the Czech and Slovak Republics do not differ in none of the basic social status dimensions characterizing the individuals. Even the indicators of the so called status consistency/inconsistency, namely the rank correlations of education, work complexity and earnings are equal in both republics. Small differences have been revealed only in two newly studied status characteristics. The so-called social capital (the degree of development of purposeful informal social contacts) seems to be somewhat more developed in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic. On the other hand, the Czech lands are a little bit more progressing in the development of the private enterpreneurship. However, the differences are not so deep as to make the social stratification shape of the two societies fundamentally dissimilar. Thus the data concerning the social positions of economically active individuals prove clearly that Slovakia reached approximately the same level od social and cultural development as the Czech Republic.
   There exist, of course, some not negligible differences concerning social and cultural characteristics of the families, including their economically non-active members.
   In Slovakia, significantly more respondents declared that they were living in family houses. The technical equipment of the housing is somewhat better in the Czech lands, the size of the family flats or houses and the number of rooms is larger in Slovakia. The material equipment of the households differs somewhat in some items in favour of the Czech families, in some others in favour of the Slovak. The average amount of their family fortunes expressed in financial values seems to be a little higher in Slovakia. The Czech families are not so numerous as the relatively younger Slovak families and therefore their average income per capita is higher. Among the population that has been questioned in the stratification survey there was substantially less retired persons in the Slovak Republic. The percentage of unemployed among the respondents has been, on the contrary, some times higher in Slovakia. However, the final percentage of economically active was higher in Slovakia.
   All these characteristics are connected with well known differences of the two countries in the settlement structure and in the structure of industries and branches in national economy. In the Slovak Republic, significantly more people are working in agriculture, metallurgy, heavy industry and energetics, yet also in education, culture ans science; in the Czech Republic the same goes for other industry, other services, finance and banking. Also the already mentioned differences in the demographic structures play their role as well as the differences in the ethnical structures (large Hungarian and Gipsy minority in Slovakia) and in confessional structures (substantially more believers, particularly Roman Catholics but also Evangelics in Slovakia).
   If we take into account all the mentioned social and cultural differences, some of them favourable for the Czech, some for the Slovak Republic, we cannot notice, of course, that they are in a part derived from the more rural and traditional past of Slovakia as we analyzed it in on the basis of 1967 data. However, in the whole the weight of this kind of differences is not as high that it could change our basic statement about achieved fundamental cultural and social equality of the societies in question, which both now belong to the industrial type and started together a very similar trajectory of the post-communist transformation.
   However, there is one important field where the recently emerged differences seem to be grave. It is the standard of living of the households.
   In every case, we can present interesting data comparing the evaluation of family standards of living in the Czech lands and Slovakia in 1988 and in 1993. In spite of the fact that they are somewhat subjectively coloured, especially as far as the retrospective evaluation is concerned, they clearly show that the obvious decline of the standard of living in both republics must have been much steeper in Slovakia. At the same time, we have here the first evidence proving the big shift of satisfaction/dissatisfaction attitudes in favour of the Czech lands.
   This opens the discussion of the important topic of subjective perception of the post-communist transformation. The evaluation, based on new experience, is in both republics somewhat more sceptical than in 1991. At the same time, a remarkable change in the relation of positive evaluations occurred in favour of the Czech Republic. In this case also the experience of nine months of Slovak sovereignty evidently plays a certain role. In most of similar questions one can identify a constant phenomenon: 20-25% less of positive and more of negative evaluations in Slovakia than in the Czech lands.
   The discrepancy between the relative equality of general cultural and social structures in the analyzed countries, on the one hand, and big differences in the subjective evaluations, on the other, for the first time revealed in the data from 1991, emerged from the data of 1993 with an even greater intensity. There are, in principle, three ways how to interpret this phenomenon.
   The first would be to query the first of the premises of our considerations by arguing that the residues of the traditional rural cultural and social relations in Slovakia are still alive, particularly in times of new crucial changes, and hamper the operating of relatively young and therefore unstable cultural and social relationships. However, the facts witnessing for basic equality of the present cultural and social structures are substantial and concern nearly all aspects of the daily life in both societies, so that it is not so easy to doubt them.
   There is a case for another explanation as well, namely for the assumption that in the stormy atmosphere of radical social changes some deep cultural and socio-psychological specificities of the nations concerned emerge, which are responsible for the different reactions to relatively equal situations. Neither these phenomena and mechanisms, taken alone, can explain the abruptness and intensity of the change in attitudes in the Czech lands and in Slovakia. In addition, the cultural and psychological phenomena are in principle very vague and their empirical fixation is unusually difficult. One could not notice that therefore this kind of argumentation has been recently many times abused by nationalist politicians both in Slovakia and in the Czech lands on the basis of arbitrary assumptions and statements.
   That is why we offer a third hypothesis, interpreting the stated discrepancy from the angle of the specificities of social and historical dynamics. It tries to explain the differences in attitudes as rationally arguable reactions of two neighbouring nations to historically different combinations of long-term and short-term dynamics.
   It is undisputable, that from the fall of the 1930s, Slovakia, a former agrarian and economically underdeveloped region, moved - with short breaks only - steadily in the direction to an industrial and relatively modern society with growing political authority. Although the Slovaks did not like communism (as the results of the elections in 1946 clearly showed) and had to be forced to adapt themselves to the state-socialist system (as the events in 1947 and 1948 prove), paradoxically the peak of the modernization of their society, bringing hitherto the best living conditions for the population, has been achieved during the period of ''normalization'', i.e. on the top of the development of the totalitarian and anti-meritocratic (egalitarian) social system in Czechoslovakia. It is quite clear from this that typical ideologies of the state socialist era: egalitarianism, state paternalism and authoritarianism have far deeper roots in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic.
   The social experience of a long-term trajectory of a gradual rise and emancipation of the Slovak nation clashed at once after 1989 with a contradictory experience of a rapid decline and deteriorization of the economic and social conditions, much more intensive than in the Czech lands. It is no wonder that the Slovak population reacted to the new situation in a greater extent than the Czech with feelings of frustration, resignation or even refusal.
   The social experience of the Czech nation since the end of the 1930s has been substatially different. In the rude trajectory of development until the end of the 1980s, degradation and stagnation of a formerly well developed Central European land prevailed in general. A short contradictory wave of a renewed progress in the 1960s finished by a grave frustration from the defeat of the Prague spring. The Soviet occupation meant a real lost of national sovereignty for the Czech nation that never accepted it. After the lost of illusions about the possibilities of the Soviet ''perestroika'' and after a certain deteriorization of the standard of living in the second half of the 1980s, the Czech nation was mentally prepared for a ''return to Europe''. The subsequent decline in the first phase of the post-communist transformation was the slightest one among the Central and East European countries and the signs of some improvement showed very early. It is no wonder, again, that most people are relatively more satisfied with the development until now and more optimistic about the future than the Slovak population is. It does not mean, of course that there does not exist a danger of a later desillusion of a part of society and of some rise of feelings of frustration and resignation in the future.
   It is easy to see that this kind of interpretation of our data is rational and corresponds the historical facts found out or corroborated in our surveys. It can explain without distortion of the evident historical reality most of the seeming paradoxes of the Czech and Slovak reality and mutual relationships. In a way it gives also some keys to the explanation of the split of Czechoslovakia and of its unexpected abruptness and peaceful forms.
