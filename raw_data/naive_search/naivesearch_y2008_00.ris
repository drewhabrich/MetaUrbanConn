AB  - Urbanisation can cause severe environmental problems and threaten biodiversity by habitat destruction, fragmentation and degradation. This is particularly the case in fast-growing South Korean city regions. While nature conservation policies were recently adopted that require the creation of habitat corridors, there is a lack of ecological information and tools for effective biodiversity conservation planning. This research has developed and customised an approach that combined landscape character assessment with four landscape ecological metrics to provide quantitative information on the ecological conditions for biodiversity conservation planning at the city regional level. The metrics used in this study were landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch distance and patch context. These indices were simple to use and required land cover data that were recorded from aerial photography and a digital topographic map. The metrics indicated the highest species richness, highest potential for species dispersal and highest ecological stability for the mountain landscape, followed by the urban fringe, agricultural land and the urban area. The results suggest that the landscape ecological metrics provide a useful tool that could play an important role in supporting spatial planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large tracts of natural habitat are being replaced by agriculture and urban sprawl in Mediterranean regions worldwide. We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.

AB  - We explore the extent to which inner-city fauna can be enhanced by source areas in periurban zones as a response to a decreasing quality and size of green habitats within cities. The objectives were to get a better understanding of the interaction between animal populations of urban and peri-urban areas, and the role of urban green structures within this relationship, and to find out the extent to which peri-urban areas can contribute to urban animal populations. We illustrate the idea of peri-urban support by using a simulation model for individual animal movement, applied in a particular case-study with butterflies as model species. Results show differences in accessibility of inner-city areas between model butterfly species that differ in mobility. The impact of peri-urban individuals on populations of inner-city habitats differed among several peri-urban source-scenarios: the enlargement of the inner-city butterfly population by peri-urban individuals was determined as 7-36% for 'moderate dispersers' and 19-56% for 'good dispersers'. Results also show that well-connected habitat patches within existing urban green structures were more likely to be visited by peri-urban individuals than isolated habitat patches. We conclude that peri-urban nature areas, if large enough, can have a potentially positive influence on the presence of fauna in inner-city neighborhoods. In addition, results suggest that connectivity between inner-city and peri-urban habitat patches enhances contribution of peri-urban migrants to inner-city populations. By providing a range of different habitats, from inner-city up to peri-urban area, moderately mobile habitat specialists could better compete against the small set of successful habitat generalists that are increasing in urban environments all over the world.

AB  - We examined the biodiversity of urban habitats in Birmingham (England) using a combination of field surveys of plants and carabid beetles, genetic studies of four species of butterflies, modelling the anthropochorous nature of the floral communities and spatially explicit modelling of selected mammal species. The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the,urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment. We suggest that planners can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity by slowing the pace of redevelopment and by not hurrying to tidy up and redevelop brownfield sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid urbanization throughout the world is expected to cause extensive loss of biodiversity in the upcoming decades. Disturbances associated with urbanization frequently operate over multiple spatial scales such that local species extirpations have been attributed both to localized habitat degradation and to regional changes in land use. Urbanization also may shape stream communities by restricting species dispersal within and among stream reaches. In this patch-dynamics view, anthropogenic disturbances and isolation jointly reduce stream biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes. We evaluated predictions of stream invertebrate community composition and abundance based on variation in environmental conditions at five distinct spatial scales: stream habitats, reaches, riparian corridors and watersheds and their spatial location within the larger three-river basin. Despite strong associations between biodiversity loss and human density in this study, local stream habitat and stream reach conditions were poor predictors of community patterns. Instead, local community diversity and abundance were more accurately predicted by riparian vegetation and watershed landscape structure. Spatial coordinates associated with instream distances provided better predictions of stream communities than any of the environmental data sets. Together, results suggest that urbanization in the study region was associated with reduced stream invertebrate diversity through the alteration of landscape vegetation structure and patch connectivity. These findings suggest that maintaining and restoring watershed vegetation corridors in urban landscapes will aid efforts to conserve freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - Fragmentation of habitat is recognised as the number one threat to biodiversity and as such has attracted considerable research. However, much of this research has been conducted in forestry and agricultural environments, with little research in urban areas. In this study, field surveys were conducted measuring the impact of fragmentation on bird, frog, plant and fungi species richness, within the fragmented urban landscape of southern Sydney. Of all fragmentation parameters examined, remnant area was the best and most significant predictor of species richness for all taxa studied. Remnant size thresholds, below which biodiversity declined rapidly, were observed at approximately 4 ha for bird and frog species richness and approximately 2 ha for plant and fungal species richness. A further threshold appears to exist at approximately 50 ha for the dominance of forest interior species. Further relationships were also observed for perimeter:area ratio, indicating the influence of various edge effects on all taxa. Isolation effects were observed in the form of an inverse linear relationship between distance to other large reserves and species richness for fungi, birds and frogs. Corridor connectivity also produced an overall positive relationship for birds, frogs and plants. It is concluded that the identification of fragmentation thresholds and relationships provides an important management toot for the design of networks aimed at conserving biodiversity in fragmented urban environments.

AB  - Urban developments and road networks extend their impacts on the surrounding habitats along a variable distance, affecting birds living in natural environments. This study identifies the threshold distances upon which several cities and roads, located across a large mosaic landscape of ca. 300 km(2) in central Spain, alter the abundance patterns of the native avifauna. Total species richness, total bird abundance, and abundance of different guilds of birds which are potentially sensitive to human disturbances were modelled by means of tree regression analyzes. Nearby cities do not affect the total bird species richness in natural habitats of the study region. Total bird abundance increases near urban areas, mainly through its positive influence on urban-exploiter species. The effect of roads is negative and highly generalized, although threshold distances to roads vary among different groups of species. The bird communities of deciduous woodlands (ash groves, oak patches and poplars) show higher resilience to deletereous influences from nearby cities and roads. It would be desirable not to build new scattered urban developments within the remnant natural areas of this heavily fragmented region, because their existence and connection to the nearby cities by new roads would add 'invisible' negative effects on the native bird fauna (e.g. on some threatened species from open habitats), considering the buffer distances determining most significant impacts (400 m for urban areas, and 300 m for roads).

AB  - Urban areas are among the land use types with the highes richness in plant species. A main feature of urban floras is the high proportion of non-native species with often divergent distribution patterns along urban-rural gradients. Urban impacts on plant species richness are usually associated with increasing human activity along rural-to-urban gradients. As an important stimulus of urban plant diversity, human-mediated seed dispersal may drive the process of increasing the similarity between urban and rural floras by moving species across urban-rural gradients. We used long motorway tunnels as sampling sites for propagules that are released by vehicles to test for the impact of traffic on seed dispersal along an urban-rural gradient. Opposite lanes of the tunnels are separated by solid walls, allowing us to differentiate seed deposition associated with traffic into vs. out of the city. Both the magnitude of seed deposition and the species richness in seed samples from two motorway tunnels were higher in lanes leading out of the city, indicating an 'export' of urban biodiversity by traffic. As proportions of seeds of non-native species were also higher in the outbound lanes, traffic may foster invasion processes starting from cities to the surrounding landscapes. Indicator species analysis revealed that only a few species were confined to samples from lanes leading into the city, while mostly species of urban habitats were significantly associated with samples from the outbound lanes. The findings demonstrate that dispersal by traffic reflects different seed sources that are associated with different traffic directions, and traffic may thus exchange propagules along the urban-rural gradient.

AB  - The distribution of the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), a medium-sized ground-dwelling marsupial, was examined in habitat fragments within the urban landscape of the city of Brisbane, Australia. From surveys conducted in 68 fragments, bandicoots were found to be present in 33 (49%) despite widespread habitat loss and fragmentation. Logistic regression analysis revealed that of 13 measured independent variables, functional connectivity was the only factor that significantly predicted the presence of bandicoots within fragments, with connectivity positively correlated with the likelihood of occupation. Functional connectivity was equated to the likelihood of bandicoot immigration into the focal fragment from the nearest occupied fragment, based on the estimated resistance to movement offered by the intervening matrix. Within Brisbane, riparian habitat fragments typically have a relatively high level of functional connectivity, as thin strips of vegetation fringing waterways serve as corridors between larger riparian areas and facilitate the movement of bandicoots between patches. Analyses based on the Akaike Information Criterion revealed that the optimal model based on landscape context variables was convincingly better supported by the data than the optimal model produced from fragment characteristics. However, it is important to examine both internal attributes of habitat fragments and external features of the surrounding landscape when modelling the distribution of ground-dwelling fauna in urban environments, or other landscapes with a highly variable matrix. As urban centres throughout the world expand, it is crucial that the ecology of local wildlife be considered to ensure functional connection is maintained between habitat patches, especially for the conservation of species that are highly susceptible to fragmentation.

AB  - Urbanization has been cited as an important factor in worldwide amphibian declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urban - rural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quanti. ed wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a signi. cant negative in. uence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post- breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad- scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites.

AB  - Connectivity has been an accepted goal in ecological restoration of wilderness areas for some time, but it is a relatively new approach in urban areas. The connectivity analysis presented here explores the numbers and patterns of corridors required to connect urban green spaces as part of an overall biodiversity conservation strategy. Green spaces in this study were weighted based on size and a habitat requirement of 0.5 ha for a hypothetical indicator species. Thirteen potential networks were evaluated using Gamma, Beta, and Cost Ratio indices. The study zone contained 54 green spaces (habitat nodes) with a combined area of 636.5 ha in a total urban area of approximately 2,600 ha. Several models (Travelling Salesman, Paul Revere, and Least Cost to User) were used to evaluate possible connections. These results indicated that at least 325 linkages are necessary to connect half of the nodes. Such large numbers of linkages are only feasible by enhancing the matrix of backyard habitat, planted boulevards, and utility rights-of way found in a city. Strengthening such networks should work well to support the biota protected in urban parks and wildlife refuges and the seasonal migrants that sometimes depend on urban habitats for their survival.

AB  - The perceptual range of an animal towards different landscape elements affects its movements through heterogeneous landscapes. However, empirical knowledge and modeling tools are lacking to assess the consequences of variation in the perceptual range for movement patterns and connectivity. In this study we tested how changes in the assumed perception of different landscape elements affect the outcomes of a connectivity model. We used an existing individual-based, spatially explicit model for the dispersal of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). We systematically altered the perceptual range in which animals recognize forest fragments, water bodies or cities, as well as the probability that they respond to these landscape elements. Overall, increasing the perceptual range of the animals enhanced connectivity substantially, both qualitatively and quantitatively. An enhanced range of attraction to forests had the strongest impact, doubling immigration success; an enhanced range of attraction to rivers had a slightly lower impact; and an enhanced range of avoidance of cities had the lowest impact. Correcting the enhancement in connectivity by the abundance of each of the landscape elements in question reversed the results, indicating the potential sensitivity of connectivity models to rare landscape elements (in our case barriers such as cities). Qualitatively, the enhanced perception resulted in strong changes in movement patterns and connectivity. Furthermore, model results were highly parameter-specific and patch-specific. These results emphasize the need for further empirical research on the perceptual capabilities of different animals in different landscapes and conditions. They further indicate the usefulness of spatially explicit individual-based simulation models for recognizing consistent patterns that emerge, despite uncertainty regarding animals' movement behavior. Altogether, this study demonstrates the need to extend the concept of 'perceptual ranges' beyond patch detection processes, to encompass the wide range of elements that can direct animal movements during dispersal through heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Green spaces within urban areas provide services and benefits to human populations and habitat for a variety of species. Freshwater, in the form of rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs and ponds, is an important component of urban greenspaces. This paper focuses on ponds; and specifically ponds within urban areas. This work is timely as during 2008 ponds were designated, in the UK, as habitats of national conservation importance. Yet, while farmland ponds have received considerable attention, there has been little work on the ecology and landscape ecology of urban ponds. Ecological data was collected from 37 ponds in the Borough of Halton (northwest England) over a period of 2 years (2005-2006). The median species richness in these ponds was 28 invertebrate species and 10 macrophyte species. A highly significant correlation was observed between pond density and species richness. The relationship between the richness of different taxa varied according to scale; becoming more significant within pond clusters than within a single pond. These findings have significance for those involved in planning and managing urban environments, further strengthening the need for functional ecological connectivity in urban areas. With pressure to increase infill development, and thus raise housing density, a greater understanding of the affect of urban design on pond ecology will be of importance to urban planners and ecologists alike.

AB  - Ecological research targeting sustainable urban landscapes needs to include findings and methods from many lines of ecological research, such as the link between biodiversity and ecosystem function, the role of humans in ecosystems, landscape connectivity, and resilience. This paper reviews and highlights the importance of these issues for sustainable use of ecosystem services, which is argued to be one aspect of sustainable cities. The paper stresses the need to include social and economic factors when analyzing urban landscapes. Spatially explicit data can be used to assess the roles different green areas have in providing people with ecosystem services, and whether people actually have access to the services. Such data can also be used to assess connectivity and heterogeneity, both argued to be central for continuous, long-term provision of these services, and to determine the role urban form has for sustainability.

AB  - Most Chinese municipal governments and urban planners have attempted to conserve and create urban greenspace in response to rapid urbanization. It is a major task for urban landscape planners to construct an effective and harmonious urban ecological network and maintain a sustainable urban development environment. In this paper, the present situation and a recent greenway augment plan of Xiamen Island were assessed using a series of landscape metrics. The results showed that the recent greenway augment plan could improve the present greenway system considerably. The improvements were indicated by decrease in patch density, and increase in total class area and edge density on the patch level, landscape diversity, landscape evenness and landscape connectivity on the landscape level. On the basis of these analyses, a number of alternative planning scenarios were designed by using network analysis methods for improving the ecological network of Xiamen Island. An alternative planning scenario was proposed to decrease the degree of landscape fragmentation, increase the shape complexity of greenway patches and enhance the landscape connectivity. The results indicated that methods which integrate landscape metrics with network analyses could not only quantitatively assess the present situation and the rationality of planning for urban greenway systems, but also facilitate the design of planning scenarios for urban ecological networks, enabling them to meet the principles of conformity, harmony, circulation, safety, diversity and sustainability. The principles and methods of landscape ecology, and the greenway concepts that have originated in the West can be useful for Chinese landscape planning and can be applied to greenway development in China.

AB  - Bird species richness (S) and numbers (N) were studied in the breeding season in housing developments of different ages in a small English town and compared with village sites, urban green corridors and adjacent arable farmland. S and N were highest in village and green corridor sites. S in urban plots ranged from 13 to 18 species, similar to farmland, but N was much lower in farmland. Marked differences in the number of individual species between plots were recorded. S and N were independent of age of development and area of gardens within plots but both were correlated with the area of greenspace. Greenspace alone and combined with gardens was correlated with the numbers of several individual species. The results are discussed in relation to proposed new large-scale housing developments in England.

AB  - Wildlife conservation in urban habitats is increasingly important due to current urbanization trends. We review the different approaches to studying birds in urban landscapes, and point out the importance of the habitat island ecological theory as a research framework for the management and conservation of urban birds. Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds. We present a conceptual model for urban bird conservation, which includes three aspects (management, environmental education and research) and new alternatives to promote the involvement of different sectors of the society.

AB  - Extensive agricultural and urban development has contributed to the decline of riparian forests across North America. An urban-rural gradient was used to identify species- and guild-level indicators of riparian forest degradation in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference land use. Generalists, which frequented all land use types, dominated (69%) the understorey community, whereas opportunistic (15%) and vulnerable (16%) species were relatively less common. Opportunistic species, which characterized city sites, tended to be exotic, woody and annual, and effective dispersers (i.e., endozoochores). In contrast, vulnerable species, which characterized non-city sites, tended to be native, perennial, and ineffective dispersers (i.e., barochores or anemochores). Indicators of disturbed forests were opportunistic and positively associated with disturbance measures including connectivity and cover of garbage, and negatively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included exotics Solanum dulcamara, Rhamnus cathartica, and Lonicera tartarica. In contrast, indicators of high-integrity forest were vulnerable, often excluded from urban sites and were negatively associated with disturbance measures and positively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included natives Rubus idaeus, Carex spp., and Galium triflorum. Our results suggest that opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds, can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and to identify forest patches that warrant further protection or restoration.

AB  - 1. Spatially explicit landscape models have revealed the importance of spatial arrangement of habitat patches in the behaviour of mobile organisms. Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs.
   2. To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary.
   3. In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it.
   4. In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate.
   5. Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency.
   6. These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. They emphasize the importance of maintaining habitat connectivity on a time-scale that accommodates slow-migrating species such as forest herbs.

The Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (D'MOSS) was created for both ecological and social enhancement through an integrated approach to urban open space establishment and management. We assessed a subsection of the D'MOSS for its contribution to biodiversity enhancement. Invertebrates were selected as indicators of diversity, Pitfall trapping was conducted on a seasonal basis on traffic islands from two landscaping management regimes: extensive mown areas (i.e. limited structural diversity) and the inclusion of indigenous and exotic shrubs, herbs and trees (i.e. structurally enhanced). The influence of adjacent remnant natural areas as a source for these islands, was also assessed. Species-area and species-distance predictions based on island biogeography theory were tested to determine whether they apply at this small scale. In this study, urban traffic islands accommodated 232 invertebrate morphospecies, i.e. 71% of the estimated species richness for a larger sampling effort. A total of 23 881 individuals were sampled, 81 5, of which were a single species of ant and a collembolan. Species abundance followed expected seasonality (high in summer and low in winter) irrespective of island treatment. While enhanced islands supported a higher richness during spring, as well as a greater number of unique species overall, our results were riot conclusive in their support of either the movement of invertebrates along corridors of semi-natural vegetation, or the value of larger areas of urban open space. The lack of independence between distance and area in this study, the limited scale over which diversity was measured, and the influence of multiple sources of emigration are discussed.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, new infrastructure projects and other land use changes must be considered on landscape and regional scales. This requires that important decisions are made after a systematic evaluation of environmental impacts. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity components, and for evaluating and visualising the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this paper was to develop methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and strategic environmental assessment in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional levels.
   In order to test developed methods, a case study was conducted in the region of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the study area embraced the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Focal species were tested as indicators of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity in the landscape. Predictive modelling of habitat distribution in geographic information systems involved the modelling of focal species occurrences based on empirical data, incorporated in a landscape ecological decision support system. When habitat models were retrieved, they were applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on focal species. The scenario involving a diffuse exploitation pattern had the greatest negative impacts on the habitat networks of focal species. The scenarios with concentrated exploitation also had negative impacts, although they were possible to mitigate quite easily. The predictions of the impacts on habitats networks of focal species made it possible to quantify, integrate and visualise the effects of urbanisation scenarios on aspects of biodiversity on a landscape level.

AB  - Although the bird communities of some urban habitats have received considerable research attention, the bird fauna of wooded streets have been little studied despite the fact that wooded streets constitute a distinct feature of the urban landscape. In order to examine the effects of vegetation structure and floristic attributes on bird species richness and bird abundance, 216 wooded streets in the city of Valencia (Spain) were surveyed during three consecutive seasons in the year 2000. During the survey 1,378 individuals of 14 bird species were recorded. With the exception of the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto), most of these species had very low abundances. Depending on the season, the species recorded in wooded streets represented between 19-25% of the species recorded in the nearby urban habitats. Across seasons, tree species richness, tree abundance and tree height were the main factors influencing bird species richness and bird abundance. 34 tree species out of 41 were used by birds. Some large tree species like the Box Elder (Acer negundo), the Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumilla) and the White Poplar (Populus alba) were preferred. A substantial change in the design and management of wooded streets in order to improve their suitability for bird fauna is suggested.

AB  - To evaluate the importance of urban woodlands to serve as potential sites for biodiversity conservation, we analysed bird, carabid beetle and small mammal community responses to urbanisation at different spatial scales. We analysed the relationships between the variations of the structure (species richness S, diversity H' and dominance D) of animal communities of woodlands distributed along a rural-urban gradient, and the variations along this same gradient of (1) the vegetation within woodlands, (2) the landscape at 100 m and (3) 600 m around the woodlands. We identified the spatial scales whose variations along the gradient most affected each animal community structure, and characterised community responses to these variations. Our results showed that urbanisation affected taxa differently according to their dispersal ability. Carabid beetles, less mobile, seem to be sensitive to increasing fragmentation and built surfaces from periurban to town centre which could make their movement within the urban landscape difficult. Birds, mobile species, seem to be more sensitive to variations of the vegetation structure within woodlands from periurban to town centre that could affect their capacity to maintain in habitat patches. Although our study did not allow relating the small mammal community structure to urbanisation, it suggests that this taxa is sensitive to urban local disturbances. A relevant management scale of woodlands can be specified for each taxa conservation. Urban woodlands accommodate over 50% of the species present in periurban woodlands, and effective management could enhance this number. Woodlands seem to be a good choice for promoting biodiversity conservation in towns.

AB  - Communities that live in linear systems such as streams or riparian zones may be particularly sensitive to changes in habitat connectivity. I examined the relationship between environmental variables, the number of low-head dams downstream of each reach, and fish species richness in first-order streams in Wisconsin, USA. The analysis was based on an extensive database of 13 628 localities and similar to 180 000 individual collection records. The environmental variables included climate, elevation, distance from nearest town, and network-specific measures such as link number (the number of first-order tributaries upstream of the current reach), downstream link number, stream order, and fractal dimension. The link number of the downstream reach was the strongest broad-scale correlate of fish species richness in first-order streams. Path analysis of a simple directed graph suggested that, although downstream dams have a significant effect on fish species richness, this effect is small by comparison to the influence of water quantity and summer maximum temperatures. From a management perspective, the results imply that modifications of water volume and temperature are greater threats to fish communities than the decrease in connectivity that results from low-head dams.

AB  - Cities have a major impact on Australian landscapes, especially in coastal regions, to the detriment of native biodiversity. Areas suitable for urban development often coincide with those areas that support high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, there is a paucity of reliable information available to guide urban conservation planning and management, especially regarding the trade-off between investing in protecting and restoring habitat at the landscape level, and investing in programmes to maintain the condition of remnant vegetation at the local (site) level. We review the literature on Australian urban ecology, focusing on urban terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. We identify four main factors limiting our knowledge of urban fauna: (i) a lack of studies focusing at multiple ecological levels; (ii) a lack of multispecies studies; (iii) an almost total absence of long-term (temporal) studies; and (iv) a need for stronger integration of research outcomes into urban conservation planning and management. We present a set of key principles for the development of a spatially explicit, long-term approach to urban fauna research. This requires an understanding of the importance of local-level habitat quality and condition relative to the composition, configuration and connectivity of habitats within the larger urban landscape. These principles will ultimately strengthen urban fauna management and conservation planning by enabling us to prioritize and allocate limited financial resources to maximize the conservation return.

AB  - Birds in urban landscapes primarily occupy parks (forest fragments), wooded streets (linear strips connecting fragments), or the urban matrix. I studied the effects of street location in the landscape, vegetation structure, and human disturbance (pedestrian and automobile load) within wooded streets on bird species richness, temporal persistence, and density of feeding and nesting guilds, and on the probability of street occupation by individual species in Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons. The number of species recorded increased from the least suitable (control streets without vegetation) to the most suitable habitats (urban parks), with wooded streets being intermediate landscape elements. Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual species. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species-particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes-to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting. Local improvements in corridor quality, through increased vegetation complexity and reduced human disturbance, could exert a positive influence on the regional connectivity of the system. Because of differential use of corridors by species with different habitat requirements, however, corridor implementation should also take into account the target species of management.

AB  - Recent interest in converting abandoned railroad lines to public recreation trails holds the potential to conserve and restore wildlife habitat along these corridors, but questions emerge about wildlife use and how best to manage for the multiple interests of wildlife and people. We evaluated the use by birds of 2 abandoned railroad rights-of-way in southeast Nebraska, one a partially converted 42-km urban-rural corridor and the other a converted urban recreational trail. We surveyed birds from 1992 to 1994 in 22 400-m transects (14 rural, 8 urban) that had either continuous woody vegetation (woody) or a more open mixture of grasses and forbs with scattered trees or shrubs (mixed). Of the 112 bird species (99 rural, 77 urban) observed, 47% were neotropical migrants, 38% short-distance migrants, and 15% permanent residents. Overall abundance was generally greater in rural woody and urban mixed transects, but there was no clear urban versus rural difference. Overall mean species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were generally greater in urban transects during autumn and winter but shifted to greater in rural woody transects during spring and rural during summer. Abundance, richness, and diversity for permanent residents were generally greater in urban transects than in rural through all seasons, but for neotropical migrants they were greater in rural woody (spring) or rural (summer). Richness and diversity of short-distance migrants were generally greater in rural transects during spring and summer, but abundance did not differ. For some species, abundance in urban versus rural transects changed seasonally and such patterns in mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) numbers support the concept that doves may behave as migrants in rural segments but as permanent residents in urban. Within the rural right-of-way, woody transects, compared to mixed, had greater total mean bird abundance during spring, summer, and winter and greater species richness and diversity during all seasons. However, these differences did not hold in urban transects, probably because of influences from surrounding suburban landscaping. We found 5 species to be more abundant overall in woody transects and one in mixed during one or more seasons, and within rural transects an additional 7 species more abundant in woody and 2 in mixed. Management along such rights-of-way should consider potential differences among migratory guilds and species in their response to right-of-way vegetation and urban versus rural surrounding land use.

AB  - From November 2001 to January 2002, wintering birds were censused in 30 urban woodlands in Chiba City, near Tokyo, Japan, to determine the factors other than habitat area, influencing avian species composition and diversity in urban woodlands. A group of species such as Sturnus cineraceus and Columba livia were more frequently observed in sparser woodlands. These species are not typically categorized as woodland species, and they preferred mixed habitat of tree-covered vegetation and open areas. The birds of another group, including Streptopelia orientalis and Lanius bucephalus, which tend to use tree crowns as foraging habitat were more frequently observed in the woodlands surrounded by agricultural areas rather than in those surrounded by urbanized areas. This could be because those species can move across agricultural areas, but not urban areas, so that the effect of woodland isolation is not very remarkable for them when agricultural areas surrounded woodlands. On the other hand, some species preferred open area to vegetated area. A mixture of open space and woodlands would result in woodlands of reduced value for these woodland birds. Site planning that reduces the degree of interspersion should be adopted, if woodland habitat is to be conserved or restored. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban areas have an important paper in the conservation of biodiversity, as much by their role supporting a highly specialized ecological community as by their incidence in the global decline of biodiversity. The present article develops several working lines, from ecosystemic perspective, oriented to improve the behavior of the cities respect to biodiversity loss. The main exposition of the work talks about biodiversity support infrastructures, a set of urban elements specifically oriented to improve biodiversity and to solve the problems that traditionally affects the relation between biodiversity and citizens. The paper describes several of these infrastructures, designed so much as isolated elements as in combination with green zones, parks, gardens and with constructed elements and buildings. Also the criteria and conditions necessary to design a program of urban biodiversity are analyzed, focusing on the adaptation to the objectives and necessities of the urban spaces planning. Finally, some of the main programs of biodiversity developed in European cities are superficially described.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of habitat fragmentation on dispersal is an important issue in landscape and conservation ecology. Here I examine the effects of fine- to broad-scale patterns in landscape structure on dispersal success of organisms with differing life-history traits. An individual-based model was used to simulate dispersal of amphibian-like species whose movements were driven by land cover and moisture conditions. To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types. Taken together, these simulations suggest that heuristic conservation strategies could potentially be developed based on important but limited life history information.

AB  - The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing fragments.
   In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space. Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emerging discipline of urban ecology is shifting focus from ecological processes embedded within cities to integrative studies of large urban areas as biophysical-social complexes. Yet this discipline lacks a theory. Results from the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, part of the Long Term Ecological Research Network, expose new assumptions and test existing assumptions about urban ecosystems. The findings suggest a broader range of structural and functional relationships than is often assumed for urban ecological systems. We address the relationships between social status and awareness of environmental problems, and between race and environmental hazard. We present patterns of species diversity, riparian function, and stream nitrate loading. In addition, we probe the suitability of land-use models, the diversity of soils, and the potential for urban carbon sequestration. Finally, we illustrate lags between social patterns and vegetation, the biogeochemistry of lawns, ecosystem nutrient retention, and social-biophysical feedbacks. These results suggest a framework for a theory of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization causes the fragmentation of natural habitats into isolated patches surrounded by anthropogenic habitats. Fragment size and the intensity of human disturbance have been shown to affect both composition and diversity of arthropod communities, but most groups have been understudied. We investigated effects of urbanization on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in and around the Molson Reserve, a preserved maple-beech forest surrounded by residential properties near Montreal, Quebec. We studied how local ant assemblages differed in terms of composition, abundance, and species richness, depending on whether they were situated in the interior forest, in adjacent residential backyards, or at the edge between these two habitats. We also compared an intact forest interior with a younger and moderately disturbed forest ("buffer zone") between the urban matrix and the interior forest. Few differences were detected between the buffer zone and the intact forest interior. Extrapolated estimates of species richness Suggest that it is lowest in the forest interior and highest in urban zones. Community composition, as investigated with ordination analysis, revealed a clear difference between the fauna of urban sites and the fauna of edges and forest interiors, and analyzing the relative abundance of ants showed residential backyards to contain the most ants. Urban assemblages were characterized by several competitively dominant species, including one introduced or "tramp" species. The occurrence of aggressive and dominant species in urban sites and at the edges of the Molson Reserve could potentially interfere with the dispersal and immigration of ground-dwelling arthropods and negatively affect local diversity or community composition in isolated forest reserves in urban centres.

AB  - Aim The woodland ecosystems of south-eastern Australia have been extensively disturbed by agriculture and urbanization. Herein, the occurrence of birds in woodland remnants in three distinct landscapes was analysed to examine the effects of different types of landscape matrices on species richness vs. area and species richness vs. isolation relationships and individual species responses to woodland fragmentation.
   Location The study system comprised three distinct woodland landscapes of the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New South Wales. These landscapes (termed agricultural, peri-urban and urban) are located within 50 km of each other, have remnant fragments of similar age, size, isolation, woodland cover, elevation and climates. The major distinguishing feature of the three landscapes was the properties of the habitats surrounding the numerous woodland remnants.
   Methods Bird surveys, using an area-search methodology, were conducted in 1999 and 2000 in 127 remnants in the three landscapes to determine bird species presence/absence. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, isolation and habitat complexity. To characterize differences between each landscape, we conducted an analysis of the amount of tree cover and human disturbance in each landscape using SPOT imagery and aerial photographs. Linear regressions of woodland-dependent species richness vs. remnant area and remnant isolation for the three different landscapes were calculated to see if there were any apparent differences. Binomial logistic regressions were used to determine the relationships between the occurrence of each species and the size and isolation of woodland habitat, in each landscape.
   Results All the landscapes displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species vs. area relationship, but the slope of the urban relationship was significantly greater than those of the other landscapes. In contrast, only the agricultural landscape displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species richness vs. isolation relationship. When individual species were investigated, we found species that were: (1) apparently insensitive to reduction in remnant area and increase in isolation across all landscapes, (2) absent in small remnants in all landscapes, (3) absent in small remnants in all landscapes and also absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, (4) absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, and (5) absent in small remnants in the urban landscape. Threshold values (50% probability of occurrence) for area and isolation for individual species were highly variable across the three landscapes.
   Main conclusions These results indicate that woodland bird communities have a varying response to habitat fragmentation in different landscapes. Whilst we cannot be sure how representative our chosen landscapes are of other similarly composed landscapes, these results suggest that the type of landscape matrix may have a considerable influence on how bird species are affected by woodland fragmentation in the region. For instance, the properties of a matrix may influence both the resources available in the landscape as a whole for different bird species, and the connectivity (dispersal of birds), between woodland remnants. We encourage further research that examines these hypotheses and argue that the management of the matrix should be included in conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Amphibians commonly use wetlands for breeding habitat, and given the concern about their ongoing global declines, the effects of urbanization on the breeding distribution of amphibians need to be quantified. Thus, we conducted a survey of the larval amphibian community in central Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) wetlands along an urbanization gradient. Wetlands in urban areas had less surrounding forest and wetlands and greater road density than rural wetlands. Urbanization was also associated with increases in hydroperiod (i.e., wetland permanency) and the presence of fish predators. Moreover, urban wetlands had lower larval amphibian species richness than rural wetlands. This decrease in richness was attributable to a decrease in occurrence of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum and A. jeffersonianum) in urban sites. Wood frogs and ambystomatid salamanders were positively associated with the amount of forest surrounding sites and negatively associated with hydroperiod. As a result, we hypothesize that these species are sensitive to the effects of urban development. The remaining species in this study appear fairly resilient to the effects of urbanization. These data demonstrate the importance of quantifying both local and landscape attributes when describing the factors that limit the breeding distribution of amphibians. We recommend that to preserve amphibian biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is best to focus on regional diversity, which protects a variety of sites that encompass various hydroperiods, have adequate buffer habitat, and are connected by dispersal routes.

AB  - Disturbed habitats are often swiftly colonized by alien plant species. Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 x 25 m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n = 240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n = 3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis. Verges hosted but did not facilitate the spread of alien species. The scale dependence and multiplicity of mechanisms explaining alien plant communities found here highlight the importance of considering regional climatic gradients, landscape context and road-verge properties themselves when managing verges.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization are the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in southern California. Loss of habitat and fragmentation can lower migration rates and genetic connectivity among remaining populations of native species, reducing genetic variability and increasing extinction risk. However, it may be difficult to separate the effects of recent anthropogenic fragmentation from the genetic signature of prehistoric fragmentation due to previous natural geological and climatic changes. To address these challenges, we examined the phylogenetic and population genetic structure of a flightless insect endemic to cismontane southern California, Stenopelmatus 'mahogani' (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data suggest that diversification across southern California began during the Pleistocene, with most haplotypes currently restricted to a single population. Patterns of genetic divergence correlate with contemporary urbanization, even after correcting for (geographical information system) GIS-based reconstructions of fragmentation during the Pleistocene. Theoretical simulations confirm that contemporary patterns of genetic structure could be produced by recent urban fragmentation using biologically reasonable assumptions about model parameters. Diversity within populations was positively correlated with current fragment size, but not prehistoric fragment size, suggesting that the effects of increased drift following anthropogenic fragmentation are already being seen. Loss of genetic connectivity and diversity can hinder a population's ability to adapt to ecological perturbations commonly associated with urbanization, such as habitat degradation, climatic changes and introduced species. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of preserving and restoring landscape connectivity for long-term persistence of low vagility native species.

AB  - Within the goal of defining indicators (species or combinations of life history traits) for habitat quality in an urban environment we investigated effects of urbanization on the community composition and morphological characteristics of carabid beetles. Between May and July 2000 nine wood-lots were sampled along three axes representing urban - rural gradients from the centre of the city of Hamburg to its rural borders. Species richness decreased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of the sites but was uncorrelated with the size of the site. Species assemblages were highly nested making successive loss of species predictable. Responsivness towards urbanization could not be linked to specific life history traits. Body length of one species (Carabus nemoralis) declined towards the city centre. Four species were found at all sites. These four species showed differences in fluctuating asymmetry (FA) at the different sites that Could not be interpreted as an indication of responses to habitat suitability. FA of the remaining species (species negatively affected by urbanization) increased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of a site. This matched the prediction that FA indicates habitat quality. Thus, urban effects lead to changes of communities through a predictable loss of species, to a reduction in body size in one species, and to increased FA in species which are susceptible to urbanization. The results indicate that the different sites were islands in an urban matrix rather than parts of a green network which would allow free exchange of plants and animals within the city of Hamburg.

AB  - The effects of urban sprawl and the associated road network on patterns of land use by diurnal raptors were assessed in a extent mosaic landscape of Sierra de Guadarrama subjected to exurban development (Madrid province; Central Spain), within the buffer area of a planned national park. During three consecutive years, the sightings of raptors per 0.25 km(2) were analyzed to identify their habitat preferences according to several vegetation types, urban cover and length of paved roads. Species richness increased with the amount of deciduous forests of Pyrenean oak Quercus pyrenaica and parklands of Narrow-leaved Ash Fraxinus angustifolia in lowland areas, while it decreased with cover of urban/suburban areas. Analyzing the three most abundant species separately, urban development had a negative influence on the Common Buzzard Buteo buteo and the Black Kite Milvus migrans, although positively affected the Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus, probably through an increase in the availability of its potential prey within urban areas. This study did not find a negative influence of the road network, either considering total species richness or the three most abundant species separately. The current levels of urban development diminished the suitability of the study area for the raptor community overall (though particular species can be favoured), notably when residential sprawls are established over ash parklands traditionally devoted to cattle grazing.

We investigated breeding, bird communities on 63 Patches suitable for wildlife in the suburbs of Paris. France. in 2003. After exploring the spatial structure of the data. we tested hypotheses relating local species richness to patch characteristics (size and vegetation). urbanization intensity around patches, and patch isolation relative to the nearest natural remnant. Spatial dependence in the data was considered in the regression analyses because patch distribution may affect local species richness through ecological processes and non-independence between patches situated nearby can pose statistical problems. Fifty-seven regular breeding bird species were recorded over the entire study area. Local bird species richness, patch size and vegetation descriptors were not spatially. autocorrelated. Conversely, urbanization intensity around the patches and patch isolation were spatially autocorrelated. Species richness as mainly related to patch size and to the diversity of trees and shrubs. while neither herbaceous plants, nor patch distance to the nearest large forest remnant had significant effects. Moreover. we found that the degree of urbanization around patches did not provide a strong predictor of bird richness. which is more newsworthy. Overall this study stresses once more the complexity of factors and processes responsible of community patterns in urban landscape. It also highlights the need to explicitly consider spatial issues when investigating these patterns.

AB  - Management of ecosystems often focuses on specific species chosen for their habitat demand, public appeal, or levels of threat. We propose a complementary framework for choosing focal species, the mobile link concept, which allows managers to focus on spatial processes and deal with multi-scale ecological dynamics. Spatial processes are important for three reasons: maintenance, re-organization, and restoration of ecological values. We illustrate the framework with a case study of the Eurasian Jay, a mobile link species of importance for the oak forest regeneration in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden, and its surroundings. The case study concludes with a conceptual model for how the framework can be applied in management. The model is based on a review of published data complemented with a seed predation experiment and mapping of Jay territories to reduce the risk of applying non-urban site-specific information in an urban setting. Our case study shows that the mobile link approach has several advantages: (1) Reducing the vulnerability of ecological functions to disturbances and fluctuations in resources allocated to management, (2) Reducing management costs by maintaining natural processes, and (3) Maintaining gene flow and genetic diversity at a landscape level. We argue that management that includes mobile link organisms is an important step towards the prevention of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Identifying and managing mobile links is a way to align management with the ecologically relevant scales in any landscape.

AB  - Extensive landscape modification by humans has led to the fragmentation of riparian forests across North America. We compared the vegetation of extant riparian forest along an urban-rural disturbance gradient. In 1999, twenty-five sites along Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada were categorized according to land use: urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forest. Differences in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. Urban riparian forests were more disturbed and isolated. They were smaller and characterized by drier, more alkaline soils. Moreover, they had significantly lower native and overall understorey species diversity, and had a higher proportion of exotics including Solanum dulcamara and Hesperis matronalis. Suburban forests were less disturbed, faced greater development pressure, and had sandier soils. Although suburban understorey diversity was similar to that of rural forests, suburban sites had a higher proportion of exotic species, especially escaped horticultural and invasive species including Caragana arborescens and Rhamnus cathartica. Reference sites were relatively large and exhibited greater connectivity, but there was little difference in species composition and diversity among high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and reference sites. These site types were less disturbed than either urban or suburban forests, and reference sites were characterized by hydrophilic species including Scirpus fluviatilis and Carex aquatilis. Our results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess impacts of land use on vegetation along urban-rural gradients.

AB  - Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Artificial neural networks were used to quantify the distribution of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) in relation to physical variables and to land-cover in the Adour-Garonne stream system (SW France; 116,000 km(2)). The relative abundances of 5 FFGs were calculated from macroinvertebrate data recorded at 165 sampling sites. Each site was characterized using 5 physical variables (elevation, stream order, stream width, distance from the source, slope) and 3 land-cover variables (% forested, % urban areas, % agricultural areas). The sites were first classified using the Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), according to the physical and land-cover variables. Two major clusters of sites corresponded to anthropogenically modified and natural areas, respectively. Anthropogenically modified areas were clearly divided into agricultural and urban landscapes. Each major cluster was divided into 3-4 subsets of sites according to a topographic gradient of physical variables. To examine the variability of the communities, FFG proportions at the 165 sites were examined on the SOM trained with physical and land-cover variables. When the riverine landscape was natural, FFG patterns responded to the upstream-downstream gradient in physical variables. When the landscape was altered by agriculture or urbanization, the effects of land-cover on FFGs overcame the influence of the physical variables. The categorization of the landscape into forested, agricultural, and urban areas was relevant to detect changes in FFG patterns. In light of increasing development along riparian zones, the use of SOMs to detect responses of FFGs to landscape alterations at regional scales exemplifies an effective technique for assessing river health based on ecological indicator groups.

AB  - Most river corridors have been highly modified and managed but they still support diverse assemblages of birds. To aid conservation it is important to know which river corridor habitats support the greatest diversity and numbers of bird species. All birds were counted on three occasions in winter along 50 one kin stretches of lowland rivers in eastern England, and habitat variables were recorded. A total of 81 species was recorded. Species richness was greatest on tidal stretches of river, followed by urban/amenity sites, with lowest richness on rural stretches. Mute Swans, Mallards and Moorhens were significantly more numerous at urban/amenity stretches and were scarce or absent in headwater reaches. Three terrestrial species also occurred in significantly greater numbers in urban/amenity stretches. No species was significantly more numerous in rural stretches. TWINSPAN analysis separated out tidal and urban/amenity stretches, while bird species were separated into those associated with riparian trees and shrubs, and those of more open stretches, with further groups associated with wider rivers and the tidal stretches. A CANOCO analysis showed river width to be the most significant factor explaining bird distributions, followed by presence of floodbanks, riparian tree cover and amount of thick marginal vegetation. The rivers studied and their immediate floodplains have long been managed and modified from source and this has an overriding influence on habitat quality and on the species richness and numbers of birds utilizing any particular stretch.

AB  - We studied drivers of habitat conversion in the Panama Canal region, where rich biodiversity in tropical rainforests currently coexists with two major growing cities and a plethora of economic opportunities. We examined existing administrative units (counties) with known biophysical (e.g., rainfall, topography) and socio-economic (e.g., Population density, road density) characteristics. To identify associations between those characteristics and likelihood of habitat conversion to agriculture or urbanization, we used canonical correlation analysis. Two axes accounted for most of the variation among administrative units: one for urbanization and the other for agriculture. Rainfall and topography were negatively associated with urbanization, whereas population wealth was positively associated with land conversion to urban. Agriculture was most strongly associated with elevation variability and topographic complexity. To a lesser extent, agriculture was associated with rural population density, mean annual human population growth and poverty level. We hypothesize that most future habitat loss in the Panama Canal region will be from urbanization as Panama City expands and populations grow along the highway system. Decision-makers will need to emphasize preservation of forests on the edge of developments, where risk of loss is highest. These forested lands tend to become more expensive as urbanization approaches, putting them at greater risk of being converted. Nevertheless, they are still important for protection of the Canal watershed and the high levels of biodiversity in watershed forests. Land planners and decision-makers should consider the influence of socio-economic and biophysical factors when selecting forests to protect for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Between the 1980s and 1990s, conservation policy in Lombardy (NW Italy) was enhanced with the establishment of the Protected Areas System, which encompassed a wide area of nature reserves and regional parks. The main aim of the Protected Areas System was to preserve cultural, natural and traditional human activity over large areas affected by very rapid development processes.
   Currently, the Protected Areas System covers about 26% of Lombardy, and human activity within the protected areas is managed and controlled by a consistent body of rules and laws, operating in an eco-sustainable framework. The actual effect of these rules and regulations on landscape and biodiversity conservation is, however, poorly understood.
   The aims of this study are: (1) to describe the development of the Protected Areas System and its features in southern Lombardy between 1980 and 1994; (2) to confirm that avian species richness is higher in the Protected Areas System than in the related buffer zones; (3) to describe the role of the regulations and laws in establishing the Protected Areas System. The study was carried out in four regional parks of southern Lombardy, and in the related buffer areas, considered as controls. Five variables (natural habitat surface, field size, grassland availability, urban areas, and avian species richness) were compared within and outside the protected areas.
   Results are summarized as follows: during the study period, the surface covered by natural habitats decreased significantly in control (63.6%) than in protected areas (33.2%), the average field area increased 34.2% in control areas and 15.3% in protected areas, urbanized areas increased 52.3% in control areas and 15.1% in protected areas, while no significant difference was observed in grassland availability. Avian species richness was significantly higher in protected than in control areas. Results showed that despite a general reduction of the environmental value in the wider environment from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the network of protected areas effectively protected some landscape features, and successfully contributed in restraining the expansion of urban areas. Moreover, it confirmed that avian species richness is higher in the Protected Areas System than in control areas.
   Data on restraining urban development was of the utmost importance, since the Lombardy Protected Areas System included wide areas of primary urban value. These data can be partially explained by the dominant role of the Park Development Plan on the Urban Development Plan, adopted by the local municipality, and proposes the application of the precautionary principle in the simplification process, which is currently affecting the rules and laws governing protected areas in Italy.

AB  - We developed a new methodology for the assessment of landscape and ecological connectivity at regional scale. This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity.
   The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.

AB  - 1. The conservation of insects is not a priority for most urban dwellers, yet can be accomplished in urban settings by the careful design of urban nature. Our goal is to foster cross-talk between practitioners of insect conservation biology who develop the knowledge base and professional design practitioners who are poised to apply this knowledge in designs and management plans for urban green space. The collaborative product promises a built environment that promotes human well-being and urban beauty while maximizing the potential for the conservation of insects.
   2. There is precedence for collaboration between science and design communities to achieve conservation, and existing professional and civic organizations offer a structure to formalize and expand collaboration. Design professionals, particularly landscape architects, are trained to support insect conservation in the urban landscape through land planning and ecological site design.
   3. Ecological site design is based in principles of sustainability and so must address the well being of humans and nature simultaneously. This powerful approach for insect conservation is illustrated in examples from around the world focusing on roadway-easement corridors, stormwater management areas, and greenroofs.
   4. To improve insect conservation and its public support we offer recommendations, organized in response to cultural aspects of sustainability. Considerations include: a) social drivers for support of conservation practices, b) public perception of urban space, c) applying conservation biology principles in urban areas, and d) merging insect conservation goals with human cultural demands.

AB  - Information to guide decision making is especially urgent in human dominated landscapes in the tropics, where urban and agricultural frontiers are still expanding in an unplanned manner. Nevertheless, most studies that have investigated the influence of landscape structure on species distribution have not considered the heterogeneity of altered habitats of the matrix, which is usually high in human dominated landscapes. Using the distribution of small mammals in forest remnants and in the four main altered habitats in an Atlantic forest landscape, we investigated 1) how explanatory power of models describing species distribution in forest remnants varies between landscape structure variables that do or do not incorporate matrix quality and 2) the importance of spatial scale for analyzing the influence of landscape structure. We used standardized sampling in remnants and altered habitats to generate two indices of habitat quality, corresponding to the abundance and to the occurrence of small mammals. For each remnant, we calculated habitat quantity and connectivity in different spatial scales, considering or not the quality of surrounding habitats. The incorporation of matrix quality increased model explanatory power across all spatial scales for half the species that occurred in the matrix, but only when taking into account the distance between habitat patches (connectivity). These connectivity models were also less affected by spatial scale than habitat quantity models. The few consistent responses to the variation in spatial scales indicate that despite their small size, small mammals perceive landscape features at large spatial scales. Matrix quality index corresponding to species occurrence presented a better or similar performance compared to that of species abundance. Results indicate the importance of the matrix for the dynamics of fragmented landscapes and suggest that relatively simple indices can improve our understanding of species distribution, and could be applied in modeling, monitoring and managing complex tropical landscapes.

AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. This study examined the relationships between landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, and composition of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. Riparian plant diversity, structure, and composition were related to landscape metrics and land use. Species richness was negatively associated with impervious surfaces and landscape diversity, and positively associated with forest cover and largest forest patch index. Shannon species diversity was strongly related to the biomass of non-native species, especially for the regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native and pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense Lour., and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo L. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, unmanaged forest sites had a structurally distinct midstory indicative of reduced disturbance. Urban and agricultural land uses showed decreased native stem densities and signs of overstory tree regeneration failure. Results from this study highlight the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix upon riparian forest plant diversity and structure.

AB  - Greenways are promoted for land conservation in both rural and urban areas, but less attention has been paid to the potential of greenways to serve urban biodiversity conservation goals. This paper presents results of a biodiversity planning study of a highly urbanized environment in Washington, DC (USA) that demonstrate the critical role of ecological greenways and parks in urban species conservation. The Cameron Run study raises fundamental questions about the way biodiversity is defined in urban areas, the scale of analysis required in heterogeneous urban environments, the role of sociocultural factors in urban biodiversity conservation, and the importance of regional greenway connections across the urban gradient. The Cameron Run study is a pilot project for an urban biodiversity information node (UrBIN) in the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) program of the US Geological Survey (USGS). This paper draws connections between the rapidly expanding literature on biodiversity conservation and the smaller, but growing, body of research concerning the ecology of greenways and urban areas, and it does so through the lens of landscape planning. Findings on the Cameron Run watershed are reported, and biodiversity conservation in the watershed is discussed in the context of greenway efforts at local and metropolitan scales.

AB  - The extent to which the 'fragmented' properties of a landscape have actually been caused by anthropogenic fragmentation is often unknown. We can, however, understand links between spatial patterns of habitat in the current landscape and the biota. Built seawalls in Sydney Harbour, Australia, appear to fragment the natural, intertidal habitat. Rocky shores naturally occur, however, in a landscape of 'fragments', i.e. as patches of natural habitat separated by other natural habitats. To examine the extent to which fragmentation, i.e. due to human disturbance, has affected biota, we compared assemblages in these naturally patchy habitats to those in 'fragmented' habitats. Rocky shores were smaller and further apart from one another when surrounded by artificial habitat (called 'complete fragments') than when surrounded by other natural habitats (called 'natural patches'). This pattern matches the physical properties of 'fragmented landscapes'. We therefore tested whether patterns of diversity of biota in complete fragments, in mixed fragments (with one side adjacent to natural habitat and the other to artificial habitat) and in natural patches can be predicted from current models about the effects of the process of fragmentation. The number of taxa, number of unique taxa and variability in the number of taxa were all greater in natural patches than in mixed and complete fragments, although not all analyses were statistically significant. The current study supports notions that the composition and configuration of 'seascapes' is more important to the ecology of many marine organisms than previously thought.

AB  - Non-motorized transport is an integral element of urban transport in Indian cities. More than 50% of the city residents cannot afford any other mode of transport unless heavily subsidized. Therefore, non-motorized transport has to be given equal priority in designing the urban infrastructure. This paper uses Delhi, India as a case study to indicate that the existing urban transport infrastructure in cities does not meet the needs of a large number of city residents who remain outside the formal planning process. This leads to sub-optimal conditions for all modes of transport. An efficient bus system cannot be designed without taking care of the slow vehicles (non-motorized vehicles, NMVs) on the road. Since sustainable transport systems in Indian cities demand the movement of large number of people by bus transport and NMVs, planning for the latter is indispensable. Planning for non-motorized transport and integrating it with the other modes of city transport is a prerequisite for creating sustainable transport systems, thus leading to sustainable cities.

AB  - Despite growing recognition of the important role of cities in economic, political and environmental systems across the world, comparative, global-scale research on cities is severely limited. This paper examines the similarities and differences in urban form and growth that have occurred across 25 mid-sized cities from different geographical settings and levels of economic development. The results reveal four city types: low-growth cities with modest rates of infilling; high-growth cities with rapid, fragmented development; expansive-growth cities with extensive dispersion at low population densities; and frantic-growth cities with extraordinary land conversion rates at high population densities. Although all 25 cities are expanding, the results suggest that cities outside the US do not exhibit the dispersed spatial forms characteristic of American urban sprawl.

AB  - 1. Top predators are seen as keystone species of ecosystems. Knowledge of their habitat requirements is important for their conservation and the stability of the wildlife communities that depend on them. The goal of our study was to model the habitat of leopard Panthera pardus in west and central Asia, where it is endangered, and analyse the connectivity between different known populations in the Caucasus to enable more effective conservation management strategies to be implemented.
   2. Presence and absence data for the species were evaluated from the Caucasus, Middle East and central Asia. Habitat variables related to climate, terrain, land cover and human disturbance were used to construct a predictive model of leopard habitat selection by employing a geographic information system (GIS) and logistic regression.
   3. Our model suggested that leopards in west and central Asia avoid deserts, areas with long-duration snow cover and areas that are near urban development. Our research also provides an algorithm for sample data management, which could be used in modelling habitats for similar species.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This model provides a tool to improve search effectiveness for leopard in the Caucasus, Middle East and central Asia as well as for the conservation and management of the species. The model can predict the probable distribution of leopards and the corridors between various known populations. Connectivity patterns can be used to facilitate corridor planning for leopard conservation, especially in the Caucasus, where the leopard is a top priority conservation species. Also, as top predators are often associated with high biodiversity, the leopard habitat model could help to identify biodiversity hotspots. The protection of biodiversity hotspots is seen as the most effective way to conserve biodiversity globally.

AB  - Urbanization changes bird community structure during the breeding season but little is known about its effects on migrating birds. We examined patterns of habitat use by birds at the local and landscape level during 2002 spring migration at 71 riparian plots along an urban gradient in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Using linear regression, we examined variation in relative density, species richness, and evenness of four migratory guilds associated with natural land covers and building area at four scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m radial buffers). We also examined the influence of local vegetation using multiple regression models. As building area increased, riparian forests tended to be narrower and have fewer native trees and shrubs. In general, native birds were positively associated with tree cover (within 250500 m of stream) and native vegetation, and negatively with building area (within 250 m); exotic species responded inversely to these measures. Short-distance migrants and permanent residents displayed the weakest responses to landscape and vegetation measures. Neotropical migrants responded strongest to landscape and vegetation measures and were positively correlated with areas of wide riparian forests and less development (>250 m). Resident Neotropical migrants increased with wider riparian forests (>500 m) without buildings, while en-route migrants utilized areas having a wide buffer of tree cover (250500 m) regardless of buildings; both were positively associated with native vegetation composition and mature trees. Consequently, developed areas incorporating high native tree cover are important for conserving Neotropical migrants during stopover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The design of urban waterfronts A critique of two Australian 'Southbanks'
T2  - TOWN PLANNING REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - This paper critically examines the urban design of inner-city riverfront cultural and leisure precincts, both called 'Southbank', in two major Australian cities, Melbourne and Brisbane. It evaluates simple functional planning matters such as use, scale and connectivity, as well as examining how these are entangled in more complex organisational, behavioural and representational outcomes, through observation of the broad scope of leisure activities which occur in the two settings. The paper examines four key dimensions of leisure experience on urban riverfronts - escaping the everyday, mixing with strangers, consuming spectacle and exploring new forms of bodily activity. Particular attention is given to the tensions between attempts at careful management of activities and imagery in these leisure zones, and the messy diversity of everyday life which actually takes place in and around them.

AB  - Aim Animal communities can be influenced by the composition of the surrounding landscape through immigration. Depending on habitat preferences, however, the effect of the landscape matrix can be positive or negative and can vary with scale. We tested this idea with arable spiders and tried to infer dispersal distances from relationships between local density and landscape composition at different spatial scales.
   Location Thirty-eight landscapes around the cities of Gottingen and Giessen, Germany.
   Methods Spiders were captured with pitfall traps in one field of winter wheat in each landscape. Landscape composition around the fields was characterized at 11 scales from 95 m to 3 km radius by land-use mapping and subsequent GIS analysis. Correlation tests were performed between landscape composition and local densities or species richness.
   Results In both study regions, local species richness was enhanced by non-crop habitats on a landscape scale. The overall densities of wolf spiders (Lycosidae), long-jawed spiders (Tetragnathidae), crab spiders (Thomisidae), and dwarf sheet spiders (Hahniidae) increased significantly in landscapes with high percentages of non-crop habitats. Out of the 40 species tested, 19 responded positively to the percentage of non-crop habitats in the surrounding landscape, and five responded negatively. Depending on the species, the spatial scales with the highest explanatory power ranged from 95 m to 3 km radius around the study fields, potentially reflecting dispersal distances.
   Main conclusions Arable spider species showed contrasting responses to the landscape context with respect both to the direction and to the spatial scale of the relationship. The variation in landscape requirements among species ensures high spider densities in a wide range of situations, which contributes to ecosystem resilience. However, species richness of arable spiders depends on heterogeneous landscapes with high percentages of non-crop habitats.

AB  - We introduce an initiative to assess and compare landscape changes related to human activities on a global scale, using a single group of invertebrates. The GLOBENET programme uses common field methodology (pitfall trapping), to appraise assemblages of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in visually-similar land-mosaics (urban-rural gradients). Carabids were selected as the focal taxon as they are sufficiently varied (both taxonomically and ecologically), abundant and sensitive to the environment. However, work on other taxa is comparable with the GLOBENET framework. The continuum of decreasing human pressure from city centres into the surrounding countryside was selected to represent human-caused disturbance for this initial stage of GLOBENET because these gradients can be found virtually all over the world. Through the broad-scale assessment envisioned in the GLOBENET programme, we seek to separate general, repeated effects on biodiversity from those that depend on local environments or particular biotic assemblages. Based on this understanding we aim to develop simple tools and protocols for assessing ecological effects of human-caused landscape changes, which could help to sustainably manage landscapes for biodiversity and for human requirements. For instance, the response of different functional groups of carabids to these landscape changes may help guide management practices.

AB  - In this paper, we propose the ecological network concept as a suitable basis for inserting biodiversity conservation into sustainable landscape development. For landscapes to be ecologically sustainable, the landscape structure should support those ecological processes required for the landscape to deliver biodiversity services for present and future generations. We first show that in multifunctional, human-dominated landscapes, biodiversity conservation needs a coherent large-scale spatial structure of ecosystems. Theory and empirical knowledge of ecological networks provides a framework for the design of such structures. Secondly, ecological networks can bridge the paradox between reserve conservation (fixing nature in space and time) and development, which implies change. This is because ecological networks can change structure without losing their conservation potential. Thirdly, ecological networks facilitate stakeholder decision-making on feasible biodiversity goals. They help to focus on an effective spatial scale. We conclude that extending the ecological network concept with multifunctional indicators is a promising step towards sustainable landscape development and stakeholder decision-making.

AB  - The question how animal body size changes along urban-rural gradients has received much attention from carabidologists, who noticed that cities harbour smaller species than natural sites. For Carabidae this pattern is frequently connected with increasing disturbance regimes towards cities, which favour smaller winged species of higher dispersal ability. However, whether changes in body size distributions can be generalised and whether common patterns exist are largely unknown. Here we report on body size distributions of carcass-visiting beetles along an urban-rural gradient in northern Poland. Based on samplings of 58 necrophages and 43 predatory beetle species, mainly of the families Catopidae, Silphidae, and Staphylinidae, we found contrary patterns of necrophages and predatory beetles. Body sizes of necrophages decreased towards the city centre and those of predators remained unchanged. Small necrophages and large predators dominated in abundance in the city centre. Necrophage body sizes appeared to be more regularly spaced in the city centre than expected from a random null model and in comparison to the rural pattern, pointing to increased competition.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges for Latin America and the Caribbean, the most biologically and culturally diverse region in the world, is to halt the loss of species caused by habitat destruction and land degradation. Up to now, setting aside protected natural areas is considered the most effective alternative to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas. however, are under increasing assault by agricultural. silvicultural, and industrial development that surround and isolate them, reducing their habitat quality at the landscape scale. Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 53 1 of them located in 105 countries. where they protect vast ecological and Cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept. it has vet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer. and transition areas. The Current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model. where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural. semi-natural. urban and industrial landscapes.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in economic areas like ports has recently become more important in the European Union due to a stricter interpretation of nature protection laws. In this study we develop a planning and design strategy-the 'habitat backbone'aEuro"with which to support the long-term survival of pioneer species that occur in ports and have low dispersal abilities. For those species, long-term survival in port areas is uncertain because supply of their habitats (on vacant lots) is capricious and depends on land use dynamics. By gaining knowledge about spatial and temporal characteristics of these dynamics we were able to develop a solution to conserve such species. Our solution is based on the creation of permanent habitat-defined as a 'backbone'aEuro"on (semi-) public land with an overall carrying capacity sufficient to support persistent populations. This best ensures long-term survival, and the backbone may also act as refugium. Satellite populations that emerge on adjacent vacant lots will thereby add to the persistence of the overall metapopulation. Management of permanent habitat is focused on retaining early-successional stages of vegetation. Implementing this strategy in the case of the natterjack toad in the Port of Antwerp taught us that realization of a habitat backbone is possible only if landowners, local governments and environmental NGOs cooperate. In the case at hand, such cooperation resulted in a plan that should ensure a coherent and persistent habitat network in which a chorus of some 1,400 natterjack toads could be accommodated-more than the number of toads currently observed.

KW  - CITIES
AB  - In the study of economic-geographic structures, the shifting focus from the national state to the city and its region has highlighted the lack of reliable interurban data sets. The abundance of usable data sets on international structures and flows has no counterpart when studying interurban relations, which makes it hard to draw any extensive conclusions regarding the structure of world city networks.
   Instead of relying on available data sets, Peter Taylor has developed a method for generating data sets that, it is argued, can be used in research on the structure of the world city network. In this approach, actors are defined as cities with internal attribute service values, values reflecting the presence of different transnational service-producing corporations in each city. The structural values between each pair of cities are then established by a mathematical formula based on the service value of each firm in each pair of cities.
   This procedure can be criticized on two accounts. First, although internal attributes on exceptional occasions can be used as a proxy and as a rough estimate for structural values, such studies must have a firm theoretical underpinning in order to be valid from a network-analytical perspective. if not, such generated structural values become nothing more than a junction of internal attributes, thus losing the whole basic idea of social network analysis. Second, the Taylor function used for generating structural values can be questioned. Why should a large presence of TNC offices in a pair of cities imply a larger city interlock link than would be the case between a high-ranked city and a low-ranked city, as the city with the larger service value probably serves cities with a lower service value with economic command, control, and support functions?

AB  - 1. Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology.
   2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach.
   3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management.
   4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and.. if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects.

AB  - The goal of land consolidation in China is still to develop agricultural production. The study of landscape effects of land consolidation projects (LCPs) faces many difficulties because of the lack of government's interest and data. This paper, taking Tianmen City of Hubei Province in Central China as an example, presents a methodology for analyzing landscape effects of LCPs by GIS and Fragstats3.3. It describes landscape effects with indexes of Patch Density (PD), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index (IJI), Aggregation Index (At), and Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI), showing more regular shape, simpler structure and less habitat diversity after LCPs. It computes ten landscape indexes of four categories of patches including Cultivated Land, Road, Water Channel, and River and Pond. The indexes show that 1) cultivated land becomes more fragmental in patch area, less irregular in patch shape and more concentrated in block; 2) the transport capacity of roads and irrigation and drainage capacity of water channels have been improved; 3) the landscape change of river and pond can be summarized as decreasing scale, more regular shape, reducing connectivity and diversity of the class. LCPs can facilitate agricultural production as well as protect cultivated land and food security. However, it is doubted that the increase of cultivated land from LCPs results from the reducing in landscape diversity of water area.

AB  - The UNESCO-MAB Programme, and in particular the Biosphere Reserve Network, is described within the context of international strategies aimed at ecological sustainability in cities. An innovative acceptation of Biosphere Reserves for urban areas, based on the landscape ecology principle of the integration of natural, social, economic and cultural knowledge, is proposed. The interdisciplinary definition of structure and functions for Urban Biosphere Reserves envisages: (i) the inclusion of the whole metropolitan territory within the Reserve's boundaries; (ii) specific criteria for the delimitation of core areas and buffer zones in urban and periurban contexts; (iii) special focus on transition area requirements; (iv) the improvement in living conditions and a solution to the conflict between humans and the environment by enhancing and harmonizing the overall natural, economic, social and cultural qualities of cities; and (v) support for sustainable planning strategies on a local scale rather than the imposition of new conservation ties.

AB  - Forest patches and corridors in the suburban landscape can be viewed as stepping stones between urban forests and forests in the adjacent forested landscape. The construction of a motorway around Ljubljana, Slovenia, has broken up, to a large extent, natural connectivity between urban vegetation and natural vegetation in the suburban landscape. A sample section of the planned Ljubljana-Maribor motorway traversing a case study area was used to show that the motorway will severely affect several tree corridors and break up forest patches in the suburban landscape north-east of Ljubljana. Existing forest patches and corridors enable migration between larger forest complexes to the west and east. The proposed section of motorway traversing the study area will break up most of these interconnections or at least aggravate the situation. Data on land uses and on the arrangement of forests, forest remains, corridors and tree belts in the study area were collected using satellite images. A model of a new connectivity was established using GIS. This study suggests that new corridors of trees be established along the motorway to connect the fragmented remains of the ecological infrastructure. Such a network of forest patches and corridors would represent a higher connectivity of natural vegetation and would constitute a necessary tool for the preservation of interconnections between urban and suburban forests in the suburban landscape, These areas of natural vegetation could also be one of the solutions to the conservation of biodiversity in the urban forests of Ljubljana.

AB  - Management strategies for the regional conservation of forest birds sometimes do not consider explicitly their applicability to areas with different degrees of urbanization. I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects.

AB  - Based on data collected during the National Wolf Census in 2000-01, we analysed the main habitat factors influencing the distribution and abundance of the wolf, Canis lupus, in northern Poland. The study region forms the western border of the continuous Eastern European range of wolves, although attempts at westward dispersal have been observed. Using Geographic Information System techniques, we measured nine habitat variables and three parameters related to wolf occurrence in 134 circular sample plots (radius 7 km, area 154 km(2) each). We compared 72 plots where wolves were recorded and 62 plots with no signs of wolf presence. Wolf plots were characterized by significantly higher forest cover, less fragmentation of forests, lower density of villages, towns, motorways, and railways than wolf-free plots. We found a positive correlation between the sum of wolf observations in plots and forest cover. The number of domestic animals killed by wolves was higher in areas with higher indices of wolf abundance and lower forest area. In multiple regression analysis, four independent variables explained 59% of the variation in wolf distribution and abundance in northern Poland: straight-line distance to continuous range of wolves in Eastern Europe; forest cover; forest fragmentation; and length of major motorways. We conclude that protection of wolves in Poland (since 1998) may not be an adequate conservation measure, especially because of the increasing density of highways and express motorways. Existing forest corridors should be protected and new ones should be restored to ensure long-term conservation of wolves and allow range expansion into Western Europe.

AB  - Urbanisation currently threatens over one-third of the world's known amphibian species. The main threats of urbanisation to amphibian populations are habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and isolation, and degradation of habitat quality. A complex array of interacting biotic and abiotic factors impact amphibians in urban and urbanising landscapes. These can lead to a decrease in species richness and the abundance of individual species towards the centre of cities and towns. The ability of amphibians to disperse can be significantly reduced in urban and suburban landscapes. However, different species exhibit markedly different responses to urbanisation. Amphibian species that are habitat generalists or have relatively low dispersal requirements appear to be better able to survive in urban and suburban landscapes. There is insufficient information on the ecology of amphibians in urban and suburban areas, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics, despite worldwide declines reported over past decades. Future research of amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes would greatly benefit by using long-term studies at sites along urban-rural gradients, conducted at both local and landscape scales. Research needs to be directed to the developing world in the tropics and sub-tropics, which has the highest rates of urbanisation. Research into amphibian ecology and conservation in the urbanising world would be improved through experimental approaches to determine the proximate causes of species' responses to human modification of the landscape. Maintaining viable populations of amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes will require conservation strategies that consider key urbanisation processes (i.e. habitat availability and habitat quality) and the key responses and adaptations to urbanisation (i.e. species availability and species response). Conservation strategies for amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes need to include actions to prevent further loss and degradation of both terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to reconnect the landscape to facilitate dispersal and long-term regional persistence of amphibian populations and communities.

AB  - Rapidly changing peri-urban areas have great ecological and human land-use diversity. Contrasting habitats abound. However, little is known about the way that the biodiversity of a whole urban area depends on the variety of habitats and the linkages, migration and dispersal patterns between them. Great opportunities exist for extending these concepts in both the rapidly expanding manufacturing and commercial cities of Latin America and Asia and into some of the poorest peri-urban environments. To take these opportunities requires understanding of the diverse pressures on peri-urban ecosystems and their consequences for both ecosystem and human health. For some people, peri-urban areas are healthy and the scene of good living standards; for others, they offer a survival opportunity. The complex ecology of urban and peri-urban areas is constantly being disrupted locally by the injection of new species or new types and concentration of chemicals into specific habitats through human activity. Each change alters ecosystem health. The ecosystem health and human mental and physical health consequences of the interplay between economy, society, land and ecosystems in peri-urban areas provide a wonderful opportunity for innovative thinking in applied science, particularly for public health medicine, geography and human ecology.

AB  - 1. We report a field experiment designed to explore the responses by hedgehogs to novel and unfavourable terrain, which they encounter when dispersing between fragmented local populations in farmland. We identified four replicate sites as unused by hedgehogs, but lying between existing populations and containing locally abundant food. At each site, we released six hedgehogs from distant sources at 2-day intervals and monitored their subsequent dispersals over 20 days by radio-tracking. We compared movement trajectories under this treatment to those of 29 hedgehogs released at two sites known to support abundant hedgehogs. A third treatment comprised 20 unmanipulated hedgehogs at three sites. We estimated habitat use and proximity to habitats by comparing each observed trajectory to simulated random walks of equal length. We sought differences between treatments in movement and habitat use from nested analysis of variance.
   2, No two trajectories of any translocated hedgehogs followed the same route; most involved little change in body weight, and took the animal into or through existing populations. Hedgehogs moved substantially further and faster on average from the unfavourable than from the favourable sites. They showed a significantly stronger attraction to habitat edges, which therefore acted as corridors, and a significant proportion of them stayed closer to roads and to urban habitat than random expectation. Habitat preferences also shifted significantly towards urban and away from arable areas. Six were predated, and two killed by road traffic. At least three returned to their release point, with P < 0.05 of this occurring by chance.
   3, In this region, natural dispersals between populations up to 4 km apart are rare events. We have shown, however, that hedgehogs are capable of travelling distances of up to 3.8 km from a release point, and up to 9.9 km in total, compared to an average home range span of 0.8 km, and it appears that none of the local populations in the study area are out of reach of neighbours.

AB  - In urban areas, each land use type possesses its own vegetation characteristics. The purpose of this study is to determine the vegetation structure of land uses in Aydin urban area by means of vegetation cover analysis. Vegetation cover analysis is an indicator of different land uses' contribution to wildlife habitat value. In the analysis, the variables of 1) vegetation ratio, 2) vegetation cover naturalness level, and 3) vegetation cover structural diversity have been used. Results of the analysis indicated that in terms of sum of all variables, natural areas (93%) obtained the highest value followed by highways (76%), and low-density residential areas (67%). Riverbeds (45%), commercial areas (39%) and industrial areas (34%) received the lowest value. The results shows that natural areas are critical in maintaining the ecological qualities of urban environments; improvement of the open spaces in the increasing residential developments contribute to the urban open space system significantly; and ecological corridor alternatives such as roads and water-ways presents opportunities in improving the urban ecosystems.

AB  - Coordinated efforts by ecologists and natural resource managers are necessary to balance the conservation of biological diversity with the potential for sustained economic development. Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetland losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with. fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probablity that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats From timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goal is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.

AB  - We investigated patterns of moth occurrence among habitats in two different landscapes surrounding roosts of the endangered Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) from May to August 2005, and compared these data with published results on the diet of this subspecies. Landscapes were situated in the Ozark Mountains, USA, and consisted of a fragmented, agricultural landscape and a contiguous national forest. We captured 8720 moths constituting >= 314 species and 22 families. Pastures demonstrated a lower abundance and richness of moths than other habitats in the fragmented landscape (p < 0.05). Neither abundance nor richness of moths varied by habitat in the forested landscape, but we did observe variation among roost locations (p < 0.05). Abundant families of moths (n >= 100 specimens captured) did vary in abundance among habitats in both landscapes (p < 0.05), with poletimber stands, riparian forest and upland forest selected, and pasture, forest edge, sawtimber and sapling stands avoided by at least one family of moths. Density and richness of woody plant species were correlated with the occurrence of moths at sampling sites. We recommend maintaining habitat heterogeneity around roosts of the Ozark big-eared bat to encourage an abundance and richness of moth prey, and suggest that forested riparian corridors are important habitat elements for Ozark big-eared bats foraging in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Multiple-species habitat conservation plans (MSHCPs) are designed to eliminate project-by-project review and minimize species-by-species conflicts; but these onetime, short-term processes invariably compress the divergent expectations of interest groups into an exercise driven by economic, amenity, and aesthetic values rather than scientific values. Participants may define an MSHCP as an exchange of habitat preserves for federal permits to take populations of endangered animals and plants, but the outcome is typically driven by overarching arguments over land development and suburban sprawl. Existing land uses also constrain the size, shape, and linkages among wildlife habitats, leading to a divergence of MSHCPs from the scientific preserve selection and design literature. Problems created by constraints to preserve configuration (e.g., land costs, fragmentation, pre-existing amounts of edge, lack of connectivity) must be resolved by long-term, post facto management. To date, estimates of preserve persistence have not been used in MSHCPs. Rather than focus on map-based exercises of preserve elements, it may be more productive to set goals for the persistence of species (states) and ecosystems (processes) within the preserves-accepting that preserve configurations and arrays will be defined by the landscape and politics of suburban areas and that long-term management will provide the primary means of maintaining biodiversity along the wildland/urban interlace.

AB  - To understand the potential financial cost of acquiring lands within a proposed reserve network for the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, we used an assessors GIS database to estimate the acquisition cost in one county within the network to be US$ 2.5 billion. When only larger parcels were selected for the reserve network, the cost of the network decreased exponentially as the size-threshold for parcel selection increased, while the total area of the network decreased only linearly. Although acquiring only larger parcels may make sense financially, it does not result in adequate habitat representation because the spatial distribution of parcels is such that the lower elevation oak woodland and mid-elevation conifer forests tend to be on smaller parcels, which fall below the larger size thresholds and the resulting potential reserve areas are fragmented. Then, for the area surrounding the two major highways that cross the Sierra Nevada, we identified seventeen road barrier areas and six urban conflict areas that pose major, but possibly mitigable barriers to wildlife movement at different time scales. We propose that (1) wildlife conflicts with highway traffic could be feasibly mitigated by installing wildlife overcrossings at the identified locations and (2) constraints on development rather than land acquisition are necessary to protect biodiversity. Finally, we suggest that a combination of highway crossings and restrictions on land-use may be the cheapest way to protect biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Classic Period lowland Maya urban centers often lack sharp boundaries due to progressive dispersal of residential settlement. This dispersal gives rise to questions about the concept of site and the notion of community affiliation. Research one settlement patterns at Chunchucmil, an urban center in NW Yucatan, Mexico, dating to the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., explores the issue of site boundaries and the social and economic implications of such boundaries. Detailed mapping, test pitting, and reconnaissance reveal that Chunchucmil had three densely occupied, concentric, contemporaneous zones of settlement covering between 20 and 25 sq km and inhabited by a population of up to 42,500. Data from both within and beyond the density thresholds marking the edge of the city imply the existence of communities whose boundaries do not always follow those of the site. A portion of the hinterland settlement close to the edge of the city shows stronger economic and social connections with the city, for example. These connections enable the delineation of Greater Chunchucmil, extending 5 kin from Chunchucmil's center. The work at Chunchucmil also allows comparison with other large Maya cities that have been systematically documented. This comparison highlights considerable variability in Maya urban forms and in bow these cities relate to their peripheries.

AB  - The carabid fauna of 28 derelict sites in the West Midlands (England) were sampled over the course of one growing season (April-October, 1999). The study aimed to investigate the relationship between carabid assemblages and five measures of landscape structure pertinent to derelict habitat. At each site measurements of landscape features pertinent to derelict habitat were made: (i) the proximity of habitat corridors; (ii) the density of surrounding derelict land; (iii) the distance between the site and the rural fringe; and (iv) the size of the site. Concurrent surveys of the soil characteristics, vegetation type, and land use history were conducted. The data were analysed using a combination of ordination (DCA, RDA), variance partitioning (using pRDA) and binary linear regression. The results suggest that:
   1. There is very little evidence that the carabid assemblages of derelict sites were affected by landscape structure, with assemblages instead being principally related to within-site habitat variables, such as site age (since last disturbance), substrate type and vegetation community.
   2. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that sites away from railway corridors are more impoverished in their carabid fauna than sites on corridors.
   3. There are some suggestions from this study that rarer and non-flying specialist species may be affected by isolation, taking longer to reach sites. We infer from this that older sites with retarded succession, and sites in higher densities of surrounding derelict land may eventually become more species rich and that these sites may be important for maintaining populations of rarer and flightless species.
   4. Conservation efforts to maintain populations of these species should focus principally on habitat quality issues, such as maintaining early successional habitats that have a diversity of seed producing annuals and perennial plants and enhancing substrate variability rather than landscape issues.

AB  - Human- mediated geomorphic degradation of streams and rivers is a serious environmental problem with negative effects on aquatic biota and social infrastructure. Billions of dollars are spent for stream restoration in the USA alone, but it is still unknown how algal diversity is affected by these efforts. In this investigation, we studied a geomorphically stable and heterogeneous reach and two degraded and homogeneous reaches of Batavia Kill, a highland stream in New York, USA. Spatial surveys of algae and geomorphic conditions were conducted in all three reaches for 2 years. After the first year of study, one of the two unstable reaches was subjected to a large-scale streambed restoration. Species-area relationships ( SAR) were examined for the first time in local algal communities of stream periphyton. Alpha-and gamma-diversity, which represent the species richness at a sample and reach level, respectively, and cell density, were also explored. In all reaches, SAR were fitted with semi- log models, which revealed that the rate of increase of species richness with area, i. e. algal beta-diversity, was significantly higher in the geomorphically stable reach than in the two degraded reaches. Gamma-diversity followed the same trend, whereas alpha-diversity and cell density were significantly higher in the unstable reaches. Restoration significantly increased the heterogeneity of conditions, including depth and particle size. From all studied community descriptors, restoration had a benign influence on algal beta- and gamma-diversity; however, beta- diversity remained the highest in the stable reference reach and this difference was significant. Our results provide guidelines for the use of periphytic algae in future bioassessments of stream bank restoration. Community properties such as species richness and organismal density, which are common metrics of ecosystem health, may be inappropriate in stream restoration surveys; instead diversity measures, often overlooked in applied ecology, e. g. beta- diversity, should be given full consideration.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires information from well-designed studies across a spectrum of land uses, ranging from wildlands to highly, modified production landscapes and large cities, There is currently, a lack of such information about human settlement, even though this is it major source of land-use change with serious implications for biodiversity. Fewer than 6% of the papers in recent volumes of Conservation Biology described work conducted in urban, suburban, or exurban areas or studies In which human settlement was considered explicitly For a variety of reasons, conservation bets tended to focus oil lands with a relatively, small human presence, often dominated by resource extraction and agriculture. Urbanization is occurring in numerous biodiversity, hotspots worldwide, however, and has been identified as a primary. cause of declines in many, threatened and endangered species. Suburban and exurban growth art, affecting biodiversity, in many,places once thought of as too remote to attract such levels of development, Conservation biologists must address the issue of human settlement to enhance the habitat value of unreserved lands for native species, to increase landscape connectivity, between reserves, and to mitigate adverse influences oil reserves from adjacent lands. Conservation and restoration of native habitats in densely, settled areas also have social and educational value. We therefore suggest a more balanced approach in conservation biology to addressing the effects of human land use through increased attention to areas where people live and work.

AB  - Aim To investigate environmental variation and associated assemblage changes of carabid beetles along an urban-rural gradient.
   Location 'Quercus-Acer' (oak-sycamore) woodlands in the city of Birmingham, UK.
   Methods We collected carabid data using pitfall traps on 12 sites in the city. The traps were run from April-September in 2000, and we collected environmental data on 24 individual variables associated with the individual sites and their landscape context. Changes in carabid assemblages were analysed using repeat measures ANOVA and the environment-species relationships with a Redundancy Analyses (RDA) and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM).
   Results We found that: (1) species richness and diversity were lower in the urban and suburban zone and higher in the rural zone; (2) Berger Parker dominance index was higher in the urban and suburban zones; (3) the number of woodland and woodland associated species was significantly higher at the rural end of the gradient; (4) the number of short-winged (brachypterous) species was highest in the rural zone and decreased towards the urban woodlands, whereas the long-winged species were more abundant in suburban woodlands; (5) the median weight length (WML) of the assemblage declined along the gradient from the rural to the urban zone, as did the number of large species; and (6) five of the 24 environmental variables showed a significant relationship with variation in the carabid assemblage. At site level the carabid assemblages were related to the level of site disturbance and soil penetrability, whereas site size and amount of woodland and urban land within 5 km of the site were important at a larger landscape scale.
   Main conclusions The results suggest that urbanization has a deleterious impact on carabid assemblages, causing a reduction in species richness from the rural fringe to the centre of the city. Changes in assemblage structure were related to woodland fragmentation, which led to variations in woodland size, woodland location and site disturbance due to trampling. Large, flightless and specialist woodland species are more susceptible to changes associated with urbanization, presumably due to their longer life spans, lower reproductive rates, more specialized niches and more limited dispersal potential.

AB  - For a highly urbanised city, such as Sydney, there are limited opportunities for revegetation. Through consultation with councils, private landholders, community groups and State Government agencies, realistic opportunities have been identified particularly along riparian and transport corridors occurring on both public and private land. This has been made possible by the Green Web Sydney project. Green Web Sydney proposes the establishment of a green web of native vegetation to protect, conserve and enhance remaining remnant bushland in the Sydney region. Central to this plan is the establishment of habitat corridors that link fragmented patches of bushland to facilitate the movement of wildlife and natural dispersal of native plants, and the implementation of various biodiversity initiatives within Council organisations. The project encourages a consistent and cooperative approach to native vegetation management in the Sydney region. By working locally and regionally within the framework of Green Web, councils and the community will create a green web of bushland corridors, protecting remnant bushland of conservation value and thus enhance Sydney's rich biodiversity and natural heritage.

AB  - Suburban habitats in naturally forested areas present a conundrum in the urban-rural habitat network. Typically, these habitats contain less than half of the native woodland bird species that would exist at these sites if they were not developed. They also contain more total bird species than if these sites were left in a natural state. This apparent contradiction raises the question of "How do suburban habitats function in the urban-rural habitat network?" In this study, we analyze bird distributions on three rural-to-urban gradients in different ecoregions of the United States: Oxford, Ohio; Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. All three gradients exhibit similar patterns of extinction of native species followed by invasion of common species and subsequent biotic homogenization with urbanization. This patterning suggests that suburban land uses, those represented by the intermediate levels of development on the gradients, are a point of extirpation for woodland birds as well as an entry point for invasive species into urban systems. Furthermore, there are consistent patterns in the functional characteristics of the bird communities that also shift with intensifying urbanization, providing insight on the possible mechanisms of homogenization and community structure in urban ecosystems including an increase in the number of broods per year, a shift in nesting strategies, a decrease in insectivorous individuals, an increase in granivorous individuals, and a decrease in territoriality. Consequently, it appears that there are specific traits that drive the shift in community composition in response to urban and suburban land use. These results have significant implications for improving understanding of the mechanisms of suburban community ecology and conserving birds in urban habitat networks.

AB  - Wetland assessment techniques have generally focused on rapid evaluations of local and site impacts; however, wetland biodiversity is often influenced both by adjacent and regional land use. Forty wetlands were studied in the Red River Valley (RRV), Southwest Prairie (SWP), and the Northern Hardwood Forest (NHF) ecoregions of Minnesota, USA, to assess the strength of association between local and landscape condition and avian community composition. We examined the relationship between bird assemblages and local and landscape factors (connectedness, isolation, road density, and site impacts). Landscape variables were calculated for three spatial scales at 500 m (79 ha), 1000 m (314 ha), and 2500 m (1963 ha). Connectedness and road density are important measures for predicting bird assemblages in both agricultural ecoregions (SWP and RRV). Connectedness and its relationship with wetland bird assemblages were most pronounced at the larger scale (2500 m), where the largest remnant patches can be discerned. In contrast, road effects on bird assemblages were most pronounced at the smallest scale (500 m). Wetland isolation corresponded to bird community patterns as well, but only in one ecoregion (SWP). In the urbanizing ecoregion (NHF), species richness was considerably lower than elsewhere but community patterns did not correspond to landscape variables. The focus of wetland conservation planning needs to shift from the site scale to the landscape scale to ensure that connection with the regional wetland pattern is accounted for, therefore, affording the best opportunity to successfully maintain wetland avian diversity.

AB  - Both advocacy and performance measurement ends of the city planning spectrum have advanced the approach of measuring and monitoring urban indicators as a practical means to lofty planning goals. Urban and regional indicator projects aim to generate synergistic utility out of measures of urban quality and progress, trying to transform assessment measures into strategic levers for system change. This article reports on the theory, methods and design of an action research project that has taken place since late 2004, the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu). RVu is the first member of the UN-Habitat Global Urban Observatory network to be established in a developed country. RVu conceptualized and completed overlapping processes in generating both expert-based and citizen-based recommendations on key regional indicators, with a view toward sustainable development. Our hypothesis has been that negotiation and integration of values and ideals will occur throughout such a process and common indicators will emerge that approach a new sustainable view of the region.

AB  - Large captors such as northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) frequently have been the focus of conservation efforts because of their large area requirements and habitat sensitivity. We examined landscape-scale habitat selection of breeding goshawks and created a habitat model of goshawk landscape use in an area (1 600 km(2)) that contained forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes in northern Japan. From a systematic nest survey and extensive radio telemetry, we delineated 36 male home ranges (18 of them were approximated with similar-sized plots around nests) and 44 similar-sized unoccupied plots over the study area. The proportions of forest cover in each home range varied widely (between 2 and 88%). Despite this variation, goshawk landscape use was estimated accurately (classification accuracy = 84%) with a stepwise logistic regression model; the probability of occupancy was positively associated with the proportion of forest interior (> 200 m from the forest edge) and that of open land < 200 m from the forest edge, but it was negatively associated with the proportion of water and the mode of the slope. In home ranges, the proportions of forest interior and open land < 200 m from forest edge complemented each other with the change in forest cover in such a way that the sum of the 2 variables always occupied > 30% of the home ranges. These results suggest that a preference for the 2 different habitats, both of which may have a high prey availability, enables goshawks to nest in landscapes with a wide variety of forest fragmentation. The adverse effect of water on goshawk occupancy was due to the tendency of goshawks not to include a large river (> 800 m wide) in their home ranges. This suggests that goshawks need connectivity between forest patches in their home ranges. The proportion of urban land was 19% lower in home ranges than in unoccupied plots. These results indicate that management efforts should focus on maintaining landscapes with high prey availability and connectivity between forest patches and on preventing urbanization over entire home ranges.

AB  - Appropriately designed, greenways may provide habitat for neotropical migrants, insectivores, and forest-interior specialist birds that decrease in diversity and abundance as a result of suburban development. We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments.
   Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m.
   Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape.

AB  - The concept of nestedness represents a null model that measures the order in presence-absence matrices of species in different assemblages (Patterson & Atmar 1986, 2000). Based on the assumptions of the model, consequences of fragmentation and the vulnerability of species to habitat change can be quantified. Different species assemblages are considered to be nested perfectly, if subsets of one or more species are lost at a time as communities decline in species number and none of the species lost from the richer communities reappears in one of the species poor communities once it was lost. Nestedness is most prevalent in habitat fragments (islands) derived from a once continuous system with a common species pool that became isolated. The presence-absence matrix of species at given sites can be ordered in a way to maximize regularity. Then, the order of sites and species reflects habitat suitability of the sites and the vulnerability of a given species to fragmentation. This concept of nestedness is illustrated and used
   1. to derive estimates of minimum viable populations of lemurs in forest fragments of Madagascar;
   2. to learn, at which size a forest fagment is perceived as "forest" by Malagasy reptiles;
   3. to test whether the system of protected areas within the city of Hamburg represents a network for the local avifauna with species exchange or whether the single protected areas represent islands in the urban matrix;
   4. to link life history traits to the vulnerability of species to the urban environment and to develop hypotheses on the causes underlying the evolution of nested patterns. The analysis of the urban system revealed that the Protected areas within the city limits of Hamburg are perceived by birds as islands in an urban matrix. "Green" links between the areas do not act as corridors that allow free movement of all species. The vulnerability of any given bird species to fragmentation of woodland habitat within the city depends on its ability to use the urban matrix between the protected areas and seems to be related to the investments in egg-shell material. Species with high requirements for egg-shells disappear earlier from the community. Analyses of nested patterns can provide insights in biodiversity processes and valuable recommendations for decision making where longterm data are not available. The main values of the analyses of nested patterns, however, is to develop hypotheses that can then be tested with more detailed studies.

AB  - Effective assessment of biodiversity in cities requires detailed vegetation maps. To date, most remote sensing of urban vegetation has focused on thematically coarse land cover products. Detailed habitat maps are created by manual interpretation of aerial photographs, but this is time consuming and costly at large scale. To address this issue, we tested the effectiveness of object-based classifications that use automated image segmentation to extract meaningful ground features from imagery. We applied these techniques to very high resolution multispectral Ikonos images to produce vegetation community maps in Dunedin City, New Zealand. An Ikonos image was orthorectified and a multi-scale segmentation algorithm used to produce a hierarchical network of image objects. The upper level included four coarse strata: industrial/commercial (commercial buildings), residential (houses and backyard private gardens), vegetation (vegetation patches larger than 0.8/1ha), and water. We focused on the vegetation stratum that was segmented at more detailed level to extract and classify fifteen classes of vegetation communities. The first classification yielded a moderate overall classification accuracy (64%, k = 0.52), which led us to consider a simplified classification with ten vegetation classes. The overall classification accuracy from the simplified classification was 77% with a k value close to the excellent range (k = 0.74). These results compared favourably with similar studies in other environments. We conclude that this approach does not provide maps as detailed as those produced by manually interpreting aerial photographs, but it can still extract ecologically significant classes. It is an efficient way to generate accurate and detailed maps in significantly shorter time. The final map accuracy could be improved by integrating segmentation, automated and manual classification in the mapping process, especially when considering important vegetation classes with limited spectral contrast.

AB  - River corridors in urban environments provide areas of biodiversity which are important for both aesthetic and economic reasons. A physical habitat model, which was used to assess urban rivers in Birmingham, UK, was applied to pairs of selected reaches to represent differing levels of habitat diversity on three rivers. The results for different life-stages of dace, roach and chub suggest that the worst physical habitat occurs in highly modified channels and at the highest flows. Four scenarios, which were designed to represent alterations in flow regime caused by changes in management practices, were calculated using the hydrological model. Changes in physical habitat created by changes to the flow regime were assessed using a consistent, replicable method. It was shown that an increase in runoff would have detrimental effects in all cases, and that less engineered sites would benefit more from flow reductions. The lack of a suitable habitat for fry is shown to be a limiting factor for fish at all sites.

AB  - Land use is rapidly expanding in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, primarily from growth in the number of rural homes. There is a need to project possible future land use and assess impacts on nature reserves as a guide to future management. We assessed the potential biodiversity impacts of alternative future land use scenarios in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. An existing regression-based simulation model was used to project three alternative scenarios of future rural home development. The spatial patterns of forecasted development were then compared to several biodiversity response variables that included cover types, species habitats, and biodiversity indices. We identified the four biodiversity responses most at risk of exurban development, designed growth management policies to protect these areas, and tested their effectiveness in two alternative future scenarios. We found that the measured biodiversity responses, including riparian habitat, elk winter range, migration corridors, and eight other land cover, habitat, and biodiversity indices, are likely to undergo substantial conversion (between 5% and 40%) to exurban development by 2020. Future habitat conversion to exurban development outside the region's nature reserves is likely to impact wildlife populations within the reserves. Existing growth management policies will provide minimal protection to biodiversity in this region. We identified specific growth management policies, including incentives to cluster future growth near towns, that can protect "at risk'' habitat types without limiting overall growth in housing.

AB  - To assist land managers responsible for park management, we conducted a pilot study to examine small mammal assemblages at 7 riparian parks in suburban/ urban landscapes and at 1 riparian site in mature forest, all located in central Pennsylvania. Species richness and diversity were lowest in parks containing manicured habitats and surrounded by human-modified landscapes. However, parks managed for passive recreation supported mammalian assemblages that were similar in richness and diversity to our mature riparian forest site. The mature riparian forest site contained four species of small mammals (eastern chipmunks [Tamias striatus], white-footed mice [Peromyscus leucopus], deer mice [P. maniculatus], and woodland jumping mice [Napeozapus insignis]), and Spring Creek Nature Park, a park managed to promote natural and native habitats, contained five species (short-tailed shrews [Blarina brevicauda], eastern chipmunks, white-footed mice, meadow voles [Microtus pennsylvanicus], and meadow jumping mice [Zapus hudsonius]). In contrast, parks located in more urban settings and consisting primarily of mowed habitat contained only 1 or 2 species of small mammals. We did not capture non-native species in our study. Based upon this study, we recommend locating parks along streams or other natural corridors, leaving unmowed 10-15-m buffers along streams, and planting native trees along stream corridors in order to encourage diversity of small mammals in suburban and urban parks.

AB  - Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in situations where species perform key life support functions in ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means. Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen, the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK 160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare, respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays, including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report the occurrence of 10 Mallomonas taxa from several urban water bodies in four Southeast Asian cities in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Apart from some cosmopolitan or pantropic species, the two presumed Asian synurophyte endemics (Mallomonas grata and Mallomonas ocellata) were found. We discuss the patterns of their geographic distribution that could contravene Finlay's neutral model of ubiquitous dispersal of microbial eukaryotes for these two species.

AB  - A prospective strategy is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation in Germany. The traditional concept of protecting isolated remnants of endangered habitats as nature reserves could not stop the continuing decline of endangered species and the regional losses in biodiversity sufficiently. During the last century, different approaches to protect open space, species, and habitats have been developed. Based on a literature review, an analysis of the legal framework and a representative case study, this paper tries to characterise the development of greenways and habitat networks in Germany and to discuss the general possibilities and limitations in an European context. In Germany, greenways were first established to prevent urban sprawl, to separate settlements, to provide recreational opportunities and to improve air quality in industrialised urban areas. The increased relevance of nature conservation has led to the development of new types of habitat networks in addition to the greenway concept since 1980. Species-oriented habitat networks focus on the specific requirements of target species, while multifunctional habitat networks try to address many landscape functions when reconnecting the remnant habitats. The Kronsberg Project is an example of a local, multifunctional habitat network. It illustrates some of the implementation difficulties resulting from conflicting interests of the various user groups. In addition, the need became obvious to plan multifunctional networks which allow for spatial separation of conflicting site related objectives. The legal framework for habitat networks in Germany is, in principle, a sound legislation which requires that habitat networks cover a minimum of 10% of the total land area of the German states. The conceptualisation of the networks must not be restricted to the boundaries of the individual German states because the networks should have an interstate character and also contribute to the European network of Natura 2000. However, this national and European network cannot be presently implemented by the German national authorities. Instead, the framework legislation must be passed as nature conservation laws at the state level, while concrete implementation takes place at the regional and local levels. There the implementation is hampered primarily by property ownership considerations or conflicting interests of landowners. This situation hinders the implementation of national and European objectives for habitat networks. In order to create a forward looking network strategy for Germany, more authority should be transferred to the national level. In addition, a stronger link between the scientific and conceptual basis of habitat networks is needed. Prioritising landscape functions and the selection of target species require better coordination. Economic incentives could be used to reduce the conflicts with landowners. Hopefully, a change in the EU-agricultural policy will facilitate this development. (c) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aeroalgal sampling of Varanasi City, India, was done using a Tilak Rotorod sampler and exposing agarised Bold basal medium Petri plates during March 2003 to February 2005. Amongst the 34 airborne algal genera recorded, cyanobacteria dominated the aero-algal flora, followed by green algae and diatoms. The generic diversity of airborne algae as well as the constituting groups exhibited seasonal variation. The most favored period for the appearance of cyanobacteria in the air was summer, while winter favored green algae. Presence of diatoms was almost uniform throughout the year. The presence of algal particles in the air depended upon the abundance and dynamics of algal source and their release and dispersal in the atmosphere. Best model selection with Akaike information criteria indicated temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind velocity as the most important climatic factors determining algal diversity. These factors exert their effect both directly by influencing entrainment and dispersal of algae from the source, and indirectly by regulating the dynamics of the possible algal source (soil, water, plant body, wall and roof of the building) by supporting or inhibiting the algal growth. In a closed environment and at low altitude sampling site characteristic is also an important factor. Open area near to the countryside had maximal aero-algal diversity.

AB  - We review the existing literature on patterns of moth (Lepidoptera) and community composition ill northeastern Nearctic forest ecosystems across hierarchical scales ranging front individual trees to entire managed ecoregions. Moths are species-rich in northeastern forests of North America. with the most diverse families being, Noctuidae and Geometridae. Individual trees and forest stands, however, are often dominated by few species. Climate, stand age. disturbance regime, and landscape heterogeneity are significant predictors of abundance of dominant species. Most other moth species ill the regional pool are patchily dominant and appear to occur regularly at very low abundance. Moth communities respond predictably to forest-management practices, and the outcomes of postmanagement response are largely drivelly changes in the plant community. Significant reductions in moth species richness and changes in Community composition are correlated With Clear-cut harvesting, whereas selective logging appears to cause more moderate changes in moth community Structure. Broad-scale effects of forest fragmentation on moth communities in unglaciated regions are best described by species replacement rather than species loss: moth species richness decreases slightly across a gradient of fragment sizes'. but shifts in moth community composition are more important, especially ill the relative importance of herbaceous-plant-feeding species ill large and small fragments. Species that appear to be most sensitive to timber management or habitat loss ire dietary specialists as larvae, dispersal-limited as adults. or dependent on commercially valuable free species such as oaks, Quercus L.

AB  - This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services; and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.

AB  - This article considers violence and the urban landscape as implicated occurrences. Urban landscapes are approached as something other, and more, than the scenes of violence - backdrops or settings for unkindness. Instead the paper explores the ways in which the terrain and fabric of the city can partake of violence, can be caught up in its delivery. This is to posit landscape as something not so easily divisible from the encounters and experiences taking place within and across it. I develop this loosely phenomenological argument by serial illustration, ranging over time and space and touching down in the cities of Manchester, London, Paris and then Cardiff, a 21(st) century capital city busy 'regenerating' its urban core. Bringing the article to a close, and following in the steps of street-level bureaucrats working with Cardiff's city centre homeless, I consider some contrary pairings of cruelty and kindness, and insist on (pedestrian) movement as constitutive of the urban landscape.

AB  - This study was carried out to find what factors could affect bird diversity in green areas in an urban landscape. We selected 83 sites of different size and type of urban landscapes in Seoul, South Korea and surveyed bird diversity. Urban green patches were grouped into three subclasses: < 1 ha, 1-10 ha and > 10 ha. The cumulative bird diversity was greater in the subclass 1-10 ha than in < 1 ha or in > 10 ha. We suggest that bird diversity was closely related to habitat size, especially in the category 1-10 ha, and recommend this area be used to establish new bird habitats in urban landscapes. The number of bird species was significantly correlated with the number of insect species in studied patches, but was not correlated with the size of green areas or the distance to roads. Therefore, we suggest that the number of insect species is the most important factor affecting bird diversity within our urban study area.

AB  - Through examinations of inner-city street economies in Johannesburg and mechanisms of emigration and political resistance in the Bapenda Omnisport and Mouchouchou quarters of Douala, the paper attempts to explore how notions of piracy might usefully elucidate the everyday practices of African urban residents attempting to operate more resourcefully in underresourced cities. Rather than being rooted in clearly defined familial, territorial and institutional relationships, residents increasingly seek out and manage a wide diversity of engagements within the city without long-term or clearly defined commitments. The key to realising movement within and among cities is to multiply the uses that can be made of resources of all kinds and this means the ability to put together different combinations of people with different skills, perspectives, linkages, identities and aspirations. Such complex and not easily identifiable forms of social organisation constitute a kind of perceptual system, a way of seeing that leads individuals and groups to put objects and experiences to many, otherwise unanticipated uses.

AB  - In determining isolation effects in fragmented populations, the landscape matrix is not often considered. Usually simple distance measures are used to quantify degree of isolation. We tested the effect of the matrix on the presence of red squirrels in 354 wooded patches in the Brussels Region, by comparing several isolation measures. These were 1) distance to the nearest source patch, 2) the Hanski-measure (a combination of distance to and size of all possible sources), 3) effective distances calculated from different least cost models using the ArcView grid extension 'Cost Distance' (a combination of distance and resistance of the landscape, with different resistances for different landscape types) and 4) some combinations of the Hanski-measure and the effective distances. Size and quality of the target patches were always included in the tests of the predictive power of different isolation measures on squirrel presence/absence. All variables examined (patch size, quality and isolation) significantly influenced squirrel presence. Models using the effective distances gave the best results. Models including the Hanski-measure improved significantly when Euclidean distance was replaced by effective distance, showing that parameterisation of matrix resistance added significant additional explanatory power when modelling squirrel presence.

AB  - White-winged choughs (Corcorax melanorhamphos, Corcoracidae) are a common, breeding resident in and around the city of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. We compared five measures of reproductive success between the urban and non-urban populations of choughs to investigate the effect of urbanization on this cooperatively breeding species. Urban choughs initiated breeding earlier than their non-urban counterparts and were more likely to suffer nest failures. However, there was no difference in the number of successful nests in a season or the number of fledglings produced per successful nesting attempt. A greater proportion of fledglings survived their first 12 months in the non-urban habitat. We suggest that increased rates of nest predation and fledgling mortality in the urban environment may have a negative effect on reproductive success and remove any advantage that might be gained through a longer breeding season. Possible effects of urbanization on the social and genetic structure of white-winged choughs are also discussed.

AB  - The issue of "waterfronts" concerns the quality of townscape along water structures but it also deals with multilateral and historically changeable relations between water and town as well as their importance in the process of sustainable development. Facing the challenge of global climate changes and fast urbanization processes the Polish-Dutch project "Poznan Waterfront Warta valley" is an attempt to establish a united waterfront of different specialists for creation and development of friendly, safe and attractive space between the city and the water. The river as a spine of urban and natural structures has got an incomparable potential for developing recreational functions, housing, business and culture activities as well as straightening the ecological functions of green corridors. Since the oldest urban structures in Poznan and most valuable architectural monuments are located in the vicinity of water, the Warta valley can be a perfect foreground for the cultural heritage exposition. The diversity of urban waterfronts can present a potential which makes it possible to create the image of the city focused on its identity and unique landscape.

AB  - Much of the biodiversity associated with isolated wetlands requires aquatic and terrestrial habitat to maintain viable populations. Current federal wetland regulations in the United States do not protect isolated wetlands or extend protection to surrounding terrestrial habitat. Consequently, some land managers, city planners, and policy makers at the state and local levels are making an effort to protect these wetland and neighboring upland habitats. Balancing human land-use and habitat conservation is challenging, and well-informed land-use policy is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the specific risks of varying amounts of habitat loss. Using projections of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations, we related the amount of high-quality terrestrial habitat surrounding isolated wetlands to the decline and risk of extinction of local amphibian populations. These simulations showed that current state-level wetland regulations protecting 30 m or less of surrounding terrestrial habitat are inadequate to support viable populations of pool-breeding amphibians. We also found that species with different life-history strategies responded differently to the loss and degradation of terrestrial habitat. The wood frog, with a short life span and high fecundity, was most sensitive to habitat loss and isolation, whereas the longer-lived spotted salamander with lower fecundity was most sensitive to habitat degradation that lowered adult survival rates. Our model results demonstrate that a high probability of local amphibian population persistence requires sufficient terrestrial habitat, the maintenance of habitat quality, and connectivity among local populations. Our results emphasize the essential role of adequate terrestrial habitat to The maintenance of wetland biodiversity and ecosystem function and offer a means of quantifying the risks associated with terrestrial habitat loss and degradation.

AB  - Roadsides are preferential migration corridors for invasive plant species and can act as starting points for plant invasions into adjacent habitats. Rapid spread and interrupted distribution patterns of introduced plant species indicate long-distance dispersal along roads. The extent to which this process is due to species' migration along linear habitats or alternatively, to seed transport by vehicles has not yet been tested systematically. We tested this by sampling seeds inside long motorway tunnels to exclude nontraffic dispersal. Vehicles transported large amounts of seeds. The annual seed rain caused by vehicles on the roadsides of five different tunnel lanes within three tunnels along a single urban motorway in Berlin, Germany, ranged from 635 to 1579 seeas/m(2)/year Seeds of non-native species accounted for 50.0% of the 204 species and 54.4% of the total 11,818 seeds trapped inside the tunnels. Among the samples were 39 (19.1%) highly invasive species that exhibit detrimental effects on native biodiversity in some parts of the world. By comparing the flora in the tunnel with that adjacent to the tunnel entrances we confirmed long-distance dispersal events (>250 m) for 32.3% of the sampled species. Seed sources in a radius of 100 m around the entrances of the tunnels had no significant effect on species richness and species composition of seed samples from inside the tunnels, indicating a strong effect of long-distance dispersal by vehicles. Consistently, the species composition of the tunnel seeds was more similar to the regional roadside flora of Berlin than to the local flora around the tunnel entrances. Long-distance dispersal occurred significantly more frequently in seeds of non-native (mean share 38.5%) than native species (mean share 4.1%). Our results showed that long-distance dispersal by vehicles was a routine rather than an occasional mechanism. Dispersal of plants by vehicles will thus accelerate plant invasions and induce rapid changes in biodiversity patterns.

AB  - Although invasive plants are recognized as a major ecological problem, little is known of the relative importance of plant community characteristics versus landscape context in determining invasibility of communities. We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges.
   Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R-2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R-2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R-2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R-2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion.
   Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion. However, edge habitat was important for invasion, probably due to increased propagule pressure. The community features associated with L. maackii invasion may be indicators of past disturbance.

AB  - American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) populations are increasing across North America, often at high rates in urban areas. A monthly survey of American Crows in the Seattle Christmas Bird Count (CBC) circle suggested that winter counts reflected American Crow abundance at other times of the year, so we used CBC results for American Crows as a measure of population trend. In the Seattle area, local survival and fecundity appear unable to account for exponential population growth. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile dispersal from outlying suburban and exurban areas contributes to growth in the urban population by radiotagging 56 juveniles 5-46 km away from the central business district of Seattle and tracking their movements. juvenile American Crows' centers of activity were 0.2-22.2 km away from their natal territory during the first 3-12 months after fledging. An estimated 45% survived one year. Movements of dispersing American Crows varied in their consistency with simulated random-walk paths; the data suggested that, at the population level, American Crows were not drawn into urban areas, though some individuals may have been. Movements of dispersers produced a net influx into the city, because of greater reproductive success outside the city than in it. Simulations of urban population growth that included immigrants and emigrants accounted for most of the observed growth, which indicates the importance of distant suburban and exurban breeding pairs to urban population dynamics.

AB  - Effects of urbanization on geomorphic, habitat, and hydrologic characteristics and fish biotic integrity of 45 streams in the Chicago area were examined by the U.S. Geological Survey from 2000 to 2001. An agricultural to urban land-cover gradient approach was used. Landscape characteristics such as texture Of surficial deposits, slope, riparian land cover, and stream network position also were examined to determine if these factors influenced the effects of urbanization. Among geomorphic characteristics, channel enlargement occurred in urban streams with a high percent of watershed clayey surficial deposits. Other geomorphic and habitat characteristics such as stream power, fine substrate, and amount of riffles did not correlate with percent watershed urban land but instead correlated with reach slope. Bank erosion, habitat variability, and two habitat indexes did not correlate with watershed urban land. Below 30% watershed urban land, the unit area discharge for a 2-year flood increased with increasing urban land; however, above 30% urban land, unit area discharges for a 2-year flood were variable, most likely due to variations in stormwater management practices, point-source contributions, and the transport index. Streams with greater than 33% watershed urban land had low base flow, but the effects of urbanization on base flow were offset by point-source contributions. Fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were low in streams with greater than 25% watershed urban land. Fish IBI scores also were low in streams with high percentages of watershed clayey surficial deposits and enlarged channels. The amount of riparian forest/wetland buffer had no moderating effect on geomorphic/habirat/hydrologic characteristics and fish IBI scores. Variations in the texture and topography of glacial landforms affected reach slope and some habitat characteristics. Longitudinal profiles were useful for distinguishing differences in local geologic settings among sampled sites.

AB  - Among factors causing soil degradation one of the most important, although less studied in Mediterranean environments, is the irreversible loss of soil due to urbanisation processes, inserted into the more general concept of soil sealing. In coastal Mediterranean regions, such as the Valencia Region, Spain, land cover transformations are mainly produced by contemporary socio-economic changes that have produced a drift from traditional agriculture to industrial and tourism economies, reinforced by population's trends to concentrate in cities or larger urban regions. Evaluation of soil sealing is then a key element to understand soil degradation and the disappearance, in most cases, of highly productive soils.
   This work, inserted within a major study on land use-cover change and soil degradation of metropolitan areas in the Valencia Region, presents the preliminary results on the urban-non urban (open agrarian and natural spaces) dynamics in the municipality of Alicante, the second largest city in the region. Three sets of panchromatic air photos for the years 1956, 1985 and 1998 have been used. After air photo scanning, on screen digitising using a base digital topographic map at scale 1 : 10,000, was applied to extract two major types of soil cover: agrarian and urban. A Geographical Information System vector structure has been implemented for cartographic comparison. Finally, to identify spatial and temporal changes maps and overlays together with synthetic tables were produced in order to assess soil degradation.
   Results show that there has been a substantial loss of soil devoted mainly to agriculture. Urban growth can be differentiated into three distinct spatial patterns: 1) edge compact enlargement of the city boundaries, including growth following the main road network; 2) compact new urbanisation alongside the coast and 3) the colonisation by groups of individual residences mainly over continental open spaces. One of the main impacts of such new urban pattern has been the loss of the most fertile soils distributed over the alluvial plains around the city, which has been mainly occupied by the tourist and residential buildings.

AB  - Aim We examine patterns of temporal turnover of common species in avian assemblages in North America to test the hypothesis that changes in avian diversity structure observed in these assemblages were associated with the colonization of common species.
   Location The contiguous United States and southern Canada.
   Methods We measured temporal turnover from 1968 to 2003 for 547 avian species at 1673 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. We used the Euclidian distance between expected and observed presence/absence vectors and randomization tests to place species into two categories, common and not-common, and into three categories for common species: (1) always common, (2) common and colonizing, and (3) common and extirpated. We used these categories to identify species experiencing extreme colonization and extirpation events and to examine changes in species composition at BBS routes. We also determined how these patterns were associated with changes in species richness and changes in similarity in species composition.
   Results Nine of the 547 species represented outliers, where the number of BBS routes colonized greatly exceeded the number extirpated; no species showed extreme values for extirpation. The nine species colonized BBS routes primarily in the upper Midwest and north-eastern United States. Presence of the nine species at BBS routes was correlated with increasing net gain in common species (difference between common colonized and common extirpated), higher levels of species richness and increasing species richness over time, more similar species compositions and increasing similarity over time, and a greater prevalence of common species over not-common species. The literature indicates that all nine species experienced some form of geographical range expansion during the time of the survey involving four elements: (1) introduction and invasion; (2) the ability to use human-altered environments, including habitats associated with agricultural, suburban, or urban areas; (3) intensive management activities, including habitat improvements and reintroductions and (4) the ability to use habitats formed through forest regeneration. These factors in combination point to anthropogenic activities and related land use histories as the primary drivers of change. One of the nine species colonized regions well outside its historic geographical range and the remaining eight species were native within the regions they colonized.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that a combination of anthropogenic activities promoted, within certain regions of North America, the geographical expansion of a limited number of common species that were native to those regions. These colonization events were correlated with changes in diversity structure, implying that large-scale diversity patterns were being influenced by anthropogenic activities. These changes can be characterized primarily by gains in species richness, an increased prevalence of common species, and more similar species compositions. Thus, using simple large-scale measures of diversity could be problematic if recent biogeographical patterns of species diversity are not considered. Specifically, using species richness or an indicator species to assess diversity could bias assessments towards common species whose populations have recently benefited through anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The effect of urbanization on species distribution has been extensively documented, but a main challenge in urban ecology is to better understand the factors causing different distributions among species in response to urbanization. Hence, this paper aims to compare the effects of urbanization on woodland plant assemblages in two cities and to describe species responses by using several indicators. The study was carried out in the cities of Angers and Rennes (North-Western France) where 11 isolated woodlands were surveyed along an urban-rural gradient in each city. Abundance data of spontaneous species were collected from 220 quadrats. The effect of land cover (within a 500 m buffer around each woodland) on species assemblages was investigated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Buildings and pavement areas were the most significant predictors of species composition, and the effect of location in Angers or Rennes appeared on the second axis. More than 60% of the most frequent plant species were indicator of urban or rural location and their preferences were similar in the two cities. These lists of urban and rural indicator species were compared with Ellenberg's indicator values and two other indicators specific to forest environment. The species which grow preferentially in urban woodlands are species which are already known to be associated with recent forests rather than ancient forests; with hedgerows rather than woodlands. The opposite pattern was observed concerning rural species. Moreover, urban indicator species have higher optima for soil pH and soil nitrogen content than rural indicator species. Different characteristics and history of forest habitat-continuity of the forest land cover, linearity of the habitat, change in adjacent land cover and land use-could select the same species, and the responses of the latter might involve different preferences concerning soil alkalinity and nutrient status.

AB  - This paper describes a project undertaken during 2001/2002 which developed a method for valuing hedgerows adjacent to the inland waterway network of Great Britain. The method enables the landowner, British Waterways, to manage their valuable environmental asset to achieve a good level of biodiversity and robust habitat balanced against the heavy amenity use the 3000 km canal network endures. Valuation techniques were developed using a combination of new and existing ecological indices for components of biodiversity, hedgerow structure and amenity, and synthesised into an index in an innovative combined approach. The resultant index was then applied to a sample 20 km section of hedge alongside the Grand Union Canal in Southeast England. The results obtained reflect the hedgerows' present value, and highlight factors that might improve or limit their future increase in value. The results from the case study application also demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between hedgerow structure and biodiversity, and that hedgerows in urban areas are less biodiverse and structurally sound than those in rural areas. Furthermore, there is a zone within rural areas influenced by the adjacent urban areas and/or higher amenity use. The paper concludes with an assessment of the approaches' strengths and weaknesses with a view to its compatibility with other hedgerow evaluations, such as HEGS, its use by other agencies or landowners, and to aid hedgerow management and future development.

AB  - Existing roads have far-reaching effects on biodiversity, and therefore road network expansion is of critical concern to conservation planning. Road density trend analysis is often too coarse and assumes homogeneous landscapes, whereas spatial transition probability analysis captures landscape variability typical of ecoregions. Simple models for projecting road network growth will assist planning agencies and conservation organizations to guide protection efforts. We investigate growth of regular public roads in the State of Maine over a 17-year historical period, and then use the best-selected (AIC) logistic regression model to validate and then project spatial probability of future roads to the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion. Nearly 2000 km of new roads were constructed in settled landscapes in Maine 1986-2003, influencing 37,000 ha of adjacent habitats. The majority (93.5%) of the new roads performed local functions and were short (< 1/3 km in length), characterized as residential roads typical of sprawl. The best-selected logit model [dwelling density (+), elevation (-), distance to urban area (-), distance to existing primary/secondary highway (-)] captured 84% of reserved new road points in Maine, and only 27% of random points at the > 0.5 probability level. The projected model forecasts 0.5 million km of new residential public roads in the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion for the next two decades, suggesting that cumulative effects of residential road network expansion are a serious region-scale biodiversity threat.

AB  - In order to measure, evaluate, map and monitor the ecological and socioeconomic quality of urban waters, adaptive assessment and management methods are needed. Existing practices to assess the hydromorphologic quality of waters, usually developed for rural areas and river systems, are not suitable for the special situation of urban waters. Furthermore socioeconomic issues, like aesthetics, recreational values etc. are not considered. For this purpose, we present a new assessment method. Based on sectoral guiding principles the four modules "physical diversity", "aquatic migration","spatial integration", and "attractiveness of the stream corridor" are developed. These sectoral guiding principles are based on the requirements given by the concept of "stream habitat connectivity" and the needs of the urban population.

AB  - 1. In a region of south-eastern England, we investigated the hierarchical genetic structure of populations of two stream-dwelling caddisflies (Trichoptera: Polycentropodidae) with contrasting distributions: Plectrocnemia conspersa inhabits numerous small, patchily distributed seeps and streams, while the confamilial Polycentropus flavomaculatus is found in fewer but larger streams and rivers. We also contrasted the genetic structure of P. conspersa in the lowland south-east with that in an upland region in the north west.
   2. Microsatellite genotypes were obtained from samples of both species taken from a 'core area' and at sites 15, 40 and 100 km from this core (two regions for P. conspersa, totalling 45 sites and 1405 larvae; one region for P. flavomaculatus, totalling 10 sites and 269 larvae).
   3. The genetic structure of P. conspersa differed in the two regions. In the upland north-west, significant genetic differentiation was observed at a spatial scale of around 40 km from the core, while there was no structure in the lowland south-east up to around 100 km. Areas of high altitude did not appear directly to reduce gene flow, whereas other potential landscape barriers, including particular geological formations, large urban areas and the sea had a pronounced effect.
   4. Weak genetic differentiation in P. conspersa across large distances, particularly in the lowland south-east, suggests that it disperses strongly, facilitating gene flow within and between catchments. Conversely, for P. flavomaculatus we found strong genetic differentiation between almost all sites, suggesting that dispersal is much more limited.
   5. Greater dispersal in the patchily distributed P. conspersa than in P. flavomaculatus, which occupies larger and presumably more persistent habitats, could be a general feature of other similarly distributed aquatic insects. While higher relief is potentially a partial barrier to dispersal, P. conspersamust have effective gene flow through such apparently inhospitable terrain, perhaps attributable to dispersal between neighbouring small and ephemeral populations. Indeed, its exploitation of headwaters and seeps requires the ability to disperse between such sites. Apparently it cannot, however, overcome more continuous barriers, consisting of large tracts of landscape with few habitable larval sites. Such landscapes, including those created by humans, may have a stronger effect on population connectivity and colonization in the longer term.

AB  - This paper assesses the occurrence of density-dependent habitat selection in an urban fragmented landscape, composed of forest fragments (urban parks) connected by corridors (wooded streets], to test the hypothesis that as population density increased in the parks their suitability decreased and individuals entered alternative habitats, such as wooded streets. Density variation of six species was studied during two consecutive breeding seasons. Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets. More detailed studies are required to determine how birds perceive and regulate their population dynamics in fragments and associated corridors, particularly for species targeted for management.

AB  - This paper presents the first study of the benthic invertebrate assemblages of the upper section of the Paraguay River, a major tributary to the Pantanal wetland in Brazil. Thirty-eight sites were sampled along a 200 km section below the city of Caceres in November 2000. Sixty-nine species and morphospecies were identified, which were dominated by Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. Mean density of benthic invertebrates varied between 72 and 10 354 m(-2) in the meandering sector of the river, 3611-49629 m(-2) in the straight-transitional sectors, 682-5962 m(-2) in the floodplain lakes, and 1704-2208 m(-2) in floodplain channels. Highest densities were attained in sand-gravel sediments dominated by the psammophilous oligochaete Narapa bonettoi. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.75 to 2.08 and was highest in floodplain lakes. Statistical analysis (UPGMA and CCA) revealed that benthic assemblages in the floodplain habitats were clearly distinct from the riverine habitats. In the river channel, the habitats were distinguished by grain size while the floodplain habitats were mostly determined by current and silt-clay concentration (floodplain channels) or by organic matter concentration (floodplain lakes). Conservation efforts in the Upper Paraguay area should aim to maintain the flood pulse as a permanent source of spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim To address the relative role of adjacent land use, distance to forest edge, forest size and their interactions on understorey plant species richness and composition in perimetropolitan forests.
   Location The metropolitan area of Barcelona, north-eastern Spain.
   Methods Twenty sampling sites were distributed in two forest size-categories: small forest patches (8-90 ha) and large forest areas (> 18,000 ha). For each forest-size category, five sites were placed adjacent to crops and five sites adjacent to urban areas. Vascular plant species were recorded and human frequentation was scored visually in 210 10 x 10 m plots placed at 10, 50 and 100 m from the forest edge, and additionally at 500 m in large forest areas. Plant species were grouped according to their ecology and rarity categories. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was carried out to detect patterns of variation in species assemblage, and to explore the relationships between these patterns and the richness of the species groups and the studied factors. Factorial ANOVAS were used to test the significance of the studied factors on the richness of species groups. Relationships between human frequentation and the studied variables were assessed through contingency tables.
   Results Forest-size category was the main factor affecting synanthropic species (i.e. those thriving in man-made or man-disturbed habitats). Synanthropic species richness decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge and, when forests were adjacent to crops, it was higher in small forest patches than in large forest areas. Richness of rare forest species was lower in small forest patches than in large forest areas when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Richness of common forest species and of all forest species together were higher close to the forest edge than far from it when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Forests adjacent to urban areas were more likely to experience high human frequentation, particularly in those plots nearest to the forest edge.
   Main conclusions Forest-size category and adjacent land use were the most important factors determining species richness and composition. The preservation of large forests adjacent to crops in peri-urban areas is recommended, because they are less frequented by humans, are better buffered against the percolation of nonforest species and could favour the persistence of rare forest species.

AB  - The red fox (Vulpes vulpes ) is one of the best-documented examples of a species that has successfully occupied cities and their suburbs during the last century. The city of Zurich (Switzerland) was colonized by red foxes 15 years ago and the number of recorded individuals has increased steadily since then. Here, we assessed the hypothesis that the fox population within the city of Zurich is isolated from adjacent rural fox populations against the alternative hypothesis that urban habitat acts as a constant sink for rural dispersers. We examined 11 microsatellite loci in 128 foxes from two urban areas, separated by the main river crossing the city, and three adjacent rural areas from the region of Zurich. Mean observed heterozygosity across individuals and the number of detected alleles were lower for foxes collected within the city as compared with their rural conspecifics. Genetic differentiation was significantly lower between rural than between rural and urban populations, and highest value of pairwise F (ST) was recorded between the two urban areas. Our results indicate that the two urban areas were independently founded by a small number of individuals from adjacent rural areas resulting in genetic drift and genetic differentiation between rural and urban fox populations. Population admixture and immigration analysis revealed that urban-rural gene flow was higher than expected from F (ST) statistics. In the five to seven generations since colonization, fox density has dramatically increased. Currently observed levels of migration between urban and rural populations will probably erode genetic differentiation over time.

AB  - The study on landscape pattern is an important field of urban land use and ecological change. Since 1990s, the widely accepted Patch-Corridor-Matrix model is generally used in qualitative description of landscape pattern. In recent years, quantitative evaluation on urban landscape dynamics is becoming hot in research. By making a critical review on existing research methods of landscape pattern, a new approach based on RS/GIS is put forward in this paper, comprising three steps, "General pattern characteristics - Gradient differentiation feature- Directional signature of the landscape", and we call it GGD. This method is applied to the case study of Xi'an metropolitan area in China. The result shows that the method is effective on quantitative study of urban landscape.
   The preparation of the method GGD is setting up research platform based on RS and GIS. By using the software of Geographical Information System (Arcgis9.0 & Erdas), the authors got the interpretation of remote sensing images of different years, and carried on the division of the landscape type of the research region. By calculating various index of landscape level with software Fragstats3.3 as an assistant tool and adopting three steps of GGD combined with landscape index, this paper can assesses the landscape spatial pattern of urban area: 1) General pattern characteristics analysis is to get transition probability of various landscape through Markov chain and to predict the landscape transformation by introducing CA model. The analysis emphasizes on total landscape structure and its change over time; 2) Gradient characteristic analysis, which makes gradient zone by taking city as a center outwardly with certain distance and contrastively analyzes the landscape index of each subarea, stresses the spatial character of landscape pattern, verifies urban morphology theories and provides the quantitative warranty for establishment of urban modality. Therefore, the analysis is useful for supervising urban expanding speed; 3)Direction characteristic analysis, which is setting up radiate strip on west-east, south-north, southwest-northeast and northwest-southeast and form certain width on each direction, can precisely and quantitatively indicate different characteristic of urban landscape at each development direction, and by combined with gradient analysis it is highly advantageous to the examination and planning of urban expanding direction.
   In the case study on Xi'an metropolitan area, remote sensing images of 1988 and 2005 Landsat-TM were handled, and the division of the landscape type of the region was also carried on. According to the above approach, the result was got and some valuable information was showed as follows:
   1) The diversity of overall landscape of Xi'an metropolitan area tends to increase and the degree of fragmentation tends to deepen. With the increase of urbanization level, the visual component of landscape is more and more diversified, the shapes of landscape is more and more complicated and ecologically more and more fragmented. In the region where urbanization level is low, natural landscape: is the main component of the landscape, the diversity of the landscape is low. And because landscape is seriously disturbed by human activities with urbanization, fragmentation of the landscape emerges periodically.
   2) In the process of transect gradient analysis, the landscape pattern index can explore the urbanization gradient, and its trend to reduce gradually towards the suburban. The landscape of area with a high urbanization level is mainly man-created, and its patches show large number, small area, simple shape and higher landscape heterogeneity. The transect gradient analysis on different time series indicates the relationship between urbanization level and landscape pattern. The landscape of urban area suffers intensely from human being, and its pattern component and spatial collocation depends on the interference intensity to a large degree. In the area with a high urbanization level, its pattern component is more man-created and less natural landscape. The landscape collocation characteristic of its patches takes on a large number, little average area. simple shape and low polymerization degree.
   3) Analysis of direction and gradient of Van metropolitan area can quantitatively reflect influence of urbanization and characteristics of urban landscape in the main development axes of north-south and east. Result shows that the degree of internal integration between Van city and Xianyang city is gradually enhanced with the quickly urbanization course in China.

AB  - 1. As urbanization accelerates, interest is growing in the traits of urban plants. We classified 822 UK vascular plants on the basis of their occurrence along an urban-rural gradient in 26 710 samples of vegetation from 2508 UK 1-km grid squares, including a wide range of rural habitats and Sheffield and Birmingham, two of the UK's largest cities.
   2. Both alien and native species were classified with respect to mean proportion of urban land cover in the 1-km grid squares in which the species occurs (urbanity), and absolute frequency in highly urban grid squares (urban frequency). Bayesian regression models were then developed for both measures, with a wide range of plant traits as explanatory variables.
   3. Results for aliens and natives and for both urban measures were remarkably similar: the single, coherent picture of 'successful urban species' that emerges from our analysis is of robust plants of relatively fertile, dry, unshaded, base-rich habitats. Only seed mass behaved very differently for natives and aliens; seed mass was related positively to success of urban natives, and negatively to success of urban aliens. Neither clonality, seed dispersal nor seed persistence in the soil were strongly linked to success in urban habitats.
   4. Synthesis. Cities can provide opportunities for surprisingly rich floras, but the traits of species that can persist in cities are quite narrowly circumscribed. More generally, it is clear that analysis of traits reveals important patterns in floristic data that would be far from obvious from a purely floristic analysis.

AB  - Riparian habitats are important sites for avian conservation in western North America. These sites are also places of increasing human exploitation due to water availability and vegetation composition. Degradation and habitat patchiness of these systems may cause declines in avian species that are obligate breeders or use these habitats as corridors during migration. Our objective was to examine species composition and diversity of birds inhabiting a patchy Mesquite landscape in central Mexico. The study was conducted in the Salado River watershed in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve. We conducted bird censuses using circular plot surveys in four zones of similar size differing mainly in proximity to town. We compared bird presence and density with plant coverage and density measured at the same points. We recorded 80 bird species, 53.6% of which were winter migrants. The four zones studied were not statistically different in bird species composition but differed in bird densities. Points counted inside the zones differed in bird densities and were positively correlated with plant density. The study site can be considered important for bird conservation due to its bird species richness, migratory species found exclusively in riparian habitat, and the presence of resident endemic species that breed in the area. Vegetation clearance that involves partial reduction of plants can represent a threat to bird conservation in the area. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We assessed the influence of land cover at multiple spatial extents on fish assemblage integrity, and the degree to which riparian forests can mitigate the negative effects of catchment urbanization on stream fish assemblages. Riparian cover (urban, forest, and agriculture) was determined within 30 m buffers at longitudinal distances of 200 m, 1 km, and the entire network upstream of 59 non-nested fish sampling locations. Catchment and riparian land cover within the upstream network were highly correlated, so we were unable to distinguish between those variables. Most fish assemblage variables were related to % forest and % urban land cover, with the strongest relations at the largest spatial extent of land cover (catchment), followed by riparian land cover in the 1-km and 200-m reach, respectively. For fish variables related to urban land cover in the catchment, we asked whether the influence of riparian land cover on fish assemblages was dependent on the amount of urban development in the catchment. Several fish assemblage metrics (endemic richness, endemic: cosmopolitan abundance, insectivorous cyprinid richness and abundance, and fluvial specialist richness) were all best predicted by single variable models with % urban land cover. However, endemic: cosmopolitan richness, cosmopolitan abundance, and lentic tolerant abundance were related to % forest cover in the 1-km stream reach, but only in streams that had < 15% catchment urban land cover. In these cases, catchment urbanization overwhelmed the potential mitigating effects of riparian forests on stream fishes. Together, these results suggest that catchment land cover is an important driver of fish assemblages in urbanizing catchments, and riparian forests are important but not sufficient for protecting stream ecosystems from the impacts of high levels of urbanization.

AB  - The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, was first found in New Zealand in 1990. At present, its distribution is predominantly in towns and cities in northern New Zealand, although its presence is increasingly being reported from new locations. Its distribution in many of these new locations cannot be explained by natural spread, but by human mediated dispersal (HMD). Estimates of the distances of HMD for Argentine ants in New Zealand (minimum and maximum median distances 9.97-71.99 km, respectively) suggest that this type of dispersal occurs often, and as such is primarily responsible for the range expansion of the species in New Zealand. Additionally, HMD can operate over relatively short distances, demonstrating that the main movement of this species between and within urban environments is by humans and associated pathways. Examining the frequency, direction and distances, and pathways over which HMD occurs may assist in the control and management of ant pest species closely associated with humans.

AB  - Question: How does seed dispersal reduce fen isolation and contribute to biodiversity?
   Location: European and North American fens.
   Methods: This paper reviews the literature on seed dispersal to fens.
   Results: Landscape fragmentation may reduce dispersal opportunities thereby isolating fens and reducing genetic exchange. Species in fragmented wetlands may have lower reproductive success, which can lead to biodiversity loss. While fens may have always been relatively isolated from each other, they have become increasingly fragmented in modem times within agricultural and urban landscapes in both Europe and North America. Dispersal by water, animals and wind has been hampered by changes related to development in landscapes surrounding fens. Because the seeds of certain species are long-lived in the seed bank, frequent episodes of dispersal are not always necessary to maintain the biodiversity of fens. However, of particular concern to restoration is that some dominant species, such as the tussock sedge Carex stricta, may not disperse readily between fens.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of seed dispersal can be used to maintain and restore the biodiversity of fens in fragmented landscapes. Given that development has fragmented landscapes and that this situation is not likely to change, the dispersal of seeds might be enhanced by moving hay or cattle from fens to damaged sites, or by reestablishing lost hydrological connections.

AB  - This article focuses on the space-time dynamics of sexual encounters in city neighborhoods associated with sex work and cruising. The data were collected as part of a multisite, longitudinal ethnographic study conducted in major cities of southern France. The results suggest that there is a continuous interaction between these sexualized public spaces and urban planning. Urban planners, however, are not the only actors shaping the location and the use of the space. Participants create a dialectical movement from night normative worlds to occult practices interwoven with daytime activities. They also create subtle social rules governing actors and their practices.

AB  - Vegetation and land use mapping are considered very important tools in conservation and management of semi-natural areas in urban ecosystems. I observed, by remote sensing techniques (Naturalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and GIS applications (overlay mapping), environmental changes occurred in the period 1975/2002 in the Appia Antica Regional Park, an important corridor of the ecological network of Rome that preserves vegetal patches testifying a potential towards evolved woodland communities. The results show the benefits of multi-temporal analysis in evaluating the state of landscape and in developing appropriate management projects. Three main aspects emerged: 1) reduction of agricolural practices (that enhanced natural development of herbaceous and shrubby communities, acting as important landscape elements for the emprovment of connectivity in ecological network); 2) natural recovery of shrubby vegetation (that can help the evolution of vegetation towards more evolved successional stages); 3) development of building activities (that may have caused the naturalization of alien species, reducing the floristic quality of the Park).

AB  - Using data from the National Wolf Census, carried out in Poland in 2000-2001, and GIS techniques we analysed habitat selection by wolves Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758 in uplands and mountains of southern Poland. We compared ten habitat variables and two parameters related to wolf abundance in 52 circular plots (154 km(2) each) with recorded wolves and 97 randomly selected plots with no signs of wolf presence. Wolf plots were characterized by higher elevation and closer location to the state border than wolf-free plots. Furthermore, wolf plots had higher forest cover, but smaller number of villages and towns and shorter railways and roads than plots without wolves. The best model explaining wolf distribution included forest cover, number of villages, length of roads and railway lines. Compared to northern Poland, the southern part of the country offers worse habitats for wolves due to significantly denser network of settlements and transportation routes.

AB  - Based on data from the National Lynx Census, carried out in Poland in 2000-2001, and using Geographic Information System, we analysed nine habitat characteristics in 56 circular sample plots (113 km(2) each), where lynx (Lynx lynx) have been recorded, and 118 plots with no signs of their presence. In plots with lynx the forest cover (on average 68%) was two times higher and the forest fragmentation lower than in plots with no lynx records. The plots with and without lynx differed significantly also in the number of villages and towns, length of main motorways and railways. Lynx occurrence was negatively associated to human settlements and transportation infrastructure. Logistic regression analysis showed that sufficient forest cover (> 40%) and the short straight-line distance to the eastern or southern border of Poland (as a proxy of the distance to a more contiguous range of lynx in Europe) are the two most important variables explaining lynx distribution. We conclude that, in Poland, increase of forest fragmentation and transportation infrastructure may become important threats to lynx populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic structure of the large Japanese field mouse populations in suburban landscape of West Tokyo, Japan was determined using mitochondrial DNA control region sequence. Samples were collected from six habitats linked by forests and green tract along the Tama River, and from two forests segregated by urban areas from those continuous habitats. Thirty-five haplotypes were detected in 221 animals. Four to eight haplotypes were found within each local population belonging to the continuous landscape. Some haplotypes were shared by two or three adjacent local populations. On the other hand, two isolated habitats were occupied by one or two indigenous haplotypes. Significant genetic differentiation between all pairs of local populations, except for one pair in the continuous habitats, was found by analysis of molecular variance (<smallcapitals>amova</smallcapitals>). The geographical distance between habitats did not explain the large variance of pairwise F-ST-values among local populations. F-ST-values between local populations segregated by urban areas were higher than those between local populations in the continuous habitat, regardless of geographical distance. The results of this study demonstrated quantitatively that urban areas inhibit the migration of Apodemus speciosus, whereas a linear green tract along a river functions as a corridor. Moreover, it preserves the metapopulation structure of A. speciosus as well as the corridors in suburban landscape.

AB  - We parameterized neural net-based models for the Detroit and Twin Cities metropolitan areas in the US and attempted to test whether they were transferable across both metropolitan areas. Three different types of models were developed. First, we trained and tested the neural nets within each region and compared them against observed change. Second, we used the training weights from one area and applied them to the other. Third, we selected a small subset (similar to1%) of the Twin Cities area where a lot of urban change occurred. Four model performance metrics are reported: (1) Kappa; (2) the scale which correct and paired omission/commission errors exceed 50%; (3) landscape pattern metrics; and (4) percentage of cells in agreement between model simulations. We found that the neural net model in most cases performed well on pattern but not location using Kappa. The model performed well only in one case where the neural net weights from one area were used to simulate the other. We suggest that landscape metrics are good to judge model performance of land use change models but that Kappa might not be reliable for situations where a small percentage of urban areas change.

AB  - The importance of unprotected habitats for the persistence of species in reserve networks is likely to be high for species living in highly fragmented habitat in which regional persistence depends on metapopulation processes. The dingy skipper butterfly (Erynnis tages) is a regionally rare declining species in Britain. In the Creuddyn Peninsula (North Wales), it inhabits patches of its host plant, Lotus corniculatus L., growing in lightly grazed areas in sheltered microhabitats, and its regional distribution is dominated by metapopulation processes. In this area, 16 (61%) out of 2620 ha of dingy skipper habitat are located in reserves. The remaining unprotected habitat is mostly located in wasteland areas vulnerable to urban development Using a metapopulation model, the incidence function model, I evaluated the extent to which the persistence of the dingy skipper in the landscape could be guaranteed with the existing reserve network. According to model projections, the dynamics within the reserve system were relatively stable when the unprotected habitat remained, with a maximum of 4% simulation replicates going extinct in a 100-year time frame. When unprotected habitat was completely removed, however, the dynamics in the reserve network became markedly unstable, with an increased extinction risk ranging from 15 to 36%. We calculated a relatively simple measure of "patch importance, " the colonization potential, for each patch. The incidence function model predicted that for low and medium levels of regional stochasticity (a value from 0 to 0.2), protecting only a relatively small number (four to six) of large and well-connected patches (high colonization potential) in addition to the existing reserves would be enough to decrease notably the extinction risk of the dingy skipper metapopulation. The number of patches needed to be increased (11 patches) for high levels of regional stochasticity (sigma = 0.3). My results suggest that long-term persistence of a regionally rare butterfly in a reserve network may depend on the presence of unprotected habitat. For a more realistic estimate of the efficiency of,reserves for protecting rare species, conservation biologists should consider incorporating metapopulation dynamics in their evaluations of persistence in existing reserves.

AB  - Ailanthus altissima (tree of heaven), Simaroubaceac, is an early successional tree, native to China and North Vietnam, which has become invasive in Europe and on all other continents except Antarctica. It is most abundant in urban habitats and along transportation corridors, but can also invade natural habitats. This paper reviews the literature on the morphology, distribution, ecology, habitat requirements, population biology, genetics, physiology, impacts, management and uses of this species.

AB  - Forested riparian corridors are thought to minimize impacts of landscape disturbance on stream ecosystems; yet, the effectiveness of streamside forests in mitigating disturbance in urbanizing catchments is unknown. We expected that riparian forests would provide minimal benefits for fish assemblages in streams that are highly impaired by sediment or hydrologic alteration. We tested this hypothesis in 30 small streams along a gradient of urban disturbance (1-65% urban land cover). Species expected to be sensitive to disturbance (i.e., fluvial specialists and "sensitive" species that respond negatively to urbanization) were best predicted by models including percent forest cover in the riparian corridor and a principal components axis describing sediment disturbance. Only sites with coarse bed sediment and low bed mobility (vs. sites with high amounts of fine sediment) had increased richness and abundances of sensitive species with higher percent riparian forests, supporting our hypothesis that response to riparian forests is contingent on the sediment regime. Abundances of Etheostoma scotti, the federally threatened Cherokee darter, were best predicted by models with single variables representing stormflow (r(2) = 0.34) and sediment (r(2) = 0.23) conditions. Lentic-tolerant species richness and abundance responded only to a variable representing prolonged duration of low-flow conditions. For these species, hydrologic alteration overwhelmed any influence of riparian forests on stream biota. These results suggest that, at a minimum, catchment management strategies must simultaneously address hydrologic, sediment, and riparian disturbance in order to protect all aspects of fish assemblage integrity.

AB  - Conservation programs in urban ecosystems need to determine the genetic background in populations of urban dwellers. We examined the genetic diversity and structure of Pieris rapae and P. melete using AFLP markers, and compared them between species and between urban and rural environments. As a result: (i) in both species, there was no reduction in genetic diversity within urban populations by direct comparison of diversity measurements, although the analysis of molecular variance suggested significant reductions in the variance within seasonal subpopulations in urban populations; (ii) P. rapae retained greater genetic diversity within species and populations; (iii) populations of both species showed significant genetic differentiation, and P. melete was more strongly subdivided; (iv) in both species, geographically close populations did not cluster with one another in the UPGMA analysis; (v) there was no genetic isolation due to geographical distance in either species; (vi) the genetic composition of seasonal subpopulations differed in urban populations of both species, and the genetic distances among subpopulations were correlated with seasonal differences in P. rapae and with temporal differences in P. melete. These results indicate that the genetic diversity in urban populations of both species was reduced at times, but was maintained by dispersal from genetically differentiated populations. Differences in the ability and mode of dispersal in the two species may be reflected in the degree of population subdivision and patterns of seasonal change in the genetic composition.

AB  - Aim To examine how parameters of the species-area curve and factors determining bird species richness are affected by seasonality.
   Location One hundred and thirty urban parks of the city of Valencia (Spain) ranging between 0.03 and 18.6 ha.
   Methods Bird censuses were conducted monthly during 1998 and 2004. For each park, 27 variables were recorded as measures of size, structure and isolation. Linear regression was used to test for patterns in species richness relative to independent variables. The results of each season were compared.
   Results Curves corresponding to the breeding period (spring-summer) had significantly higher intercepts, but slopes did not change across seasons. Turnover rates of resident species were dependent on patch size and isolation considering spring, but not autumn, from different years. Additionally, turnover rates in spring were lower in parks in close proximity to others than in isolated ones. In all seasons, the number of bird species showed a strong relationship with park area, which explained c. 60% of the variation in species numbers. Habitat variables and park isolation explained a small amount of the variation in species numbers. The data did not give support to the random placement hypothesis.
   Main conclusions The overall conclusions of this study give little support to the possible influence of seasonality on species-area relationship or on the three main hypotheses explaining it. This lack of influence of seasonality could be explained by the seasonal stability of the bird populations of the parks within the study area as a consequence of different factors, mainly the characteristics of the species pool, similarity in the features of the parks irrespective of their size, and stability of resources and conditions across seasons. The question of whether this lack of influence of seasonality on the species-area relationship occurs in those ecological systems that have a larger seasonal variation than the urban parks of the study area remains unresolved. Closer examination of the seasonal patterns reported in this study is likely to be useful in increasing our understanding of the species-area relationship.

AB  - Aim Species richness in itself is not always sufficient to evaluate land management strategies for nature conservation. The exchange of species between local communities may be affected by landscape structure and land-use intensity. Thus, species turnover, and its inverse, community similarity, may be useful measures of landscape integrity from a diversity perspective.
   Location A European transect from France to Estonia.
   Methods We measured the similarity of plant, bird, wild bee, true bug, carabid beetle, hoverfly and spider communities sampled along gradients in landscape composition (e.g. total availability of semi-natural habitat), landscape configuration (e.g. fragmentation) and land-use intensity (e.g. pesticide loads).
   Results Total availability of semi-natural habitats had little effect on community similarity, except for bird communities, which were more homogeneous in more natural landscapes. Bee communities, in contrast, were less similar in landscapes with higher percentages of semi-natural habitats. Increased landscape fragmentation decreased similarity of true bug communities, while plant communities showed a nonlinear, U-shaped response. More intense land use, specifically increased pesticide burden, led to a homogenization of bee, bug and spider communities within sites. In these cases, habitat fragmentation interacted with pesticide load. Hoverfly and carabid beetle community similarity was differentially affected by higher pesticide levels: for carabid beetles similarity decreased, while for hoverflies we observed a U-shaped relationship.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the effects of landscape composition, configuration and land-use intensity on the similarity of communities. It indicates reduced exchange of species between communities in landscapes dominated by agricultural activities. Taxonomic groups differed in their responses to environmental drivers and using but one group as an indicator for 'biodiversity' as such would thus not be advisable.

AB  - Dispersal is a ubiquitous trait in living organisms. Evolutionary theory postulates that the loss or death of propagules during dispersal episodes (cost of dispersal) should select against dispersal. The cost of dispersal is expected to be a strong selective force in fragmented habitats. We analyzed patchy populations of the weed Crepis sancta occupying small patches on sidewalks, around trees planted within the city of Montpellier (South of France), to investigate the recent evolutionary consequences of the cost of dispersal. C sancta produces both dispersing and nondispersing seeds. First, we showed that, in urban patches, dispersing seeds have a 55% lower chance of settling in their patch compared with nondispersing seeds and, thus, fall on a concrete matrix unsuitable for germination. Second, we showed that the proportion of nondispersing seeds in urban patches measured in a common environment is significantly higher than in surrounding, unfragmented populations. Third, by using a quantitative genetic model, we estimated that the pattern is consistent with short-term evolution that occurs over approximate to 5-12 generations of selection, which is generated by a high cost of dispersal in urban populations. This study shows that a high cost of dispersal after recent fragmentation causes rapid evolution toward lower dispersal.

AB  - Riga, the capital city of Latvia is a world heritage site since 1997. Its rich architectural heritage consists of buildings in a variety of styles, built in different periods from the Middle Ages up to the present day. Unlike many other cities, Riga has a very clearly perceptible, precise urban structure.
   At the beginning of the twentieth century, Riga experienced a real construction boom, which coincided with the development of Art Nouveau. Buildings of this style represent nearly one-third of the whole inventory of the city centre. Riga is a real Art Nouveau metropolis.
   Formal variety of Art Nouveau in Riga comprises Eclectic Decorative trend, co called Perpendicular Art Nouveau and National Romanticism. Primarily local architects were active in Riga, most of them being graduates of the Riga Polytechnical Institute.
   Functionalism or Modern Movement prevailed during Latvia's first period of independence. A new urban zone consisting of prefabricated panel blocks encircling the city's historical centre is the main consequence of the period of the soviet occupation. A new period in the development of architecture and urban development of Riga started after 1990, when country reclaimed its independence and a free market economy reemerged.

AB  - This study examined the influence of habitat structural complexity on the collective effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on herbivore abundance in urban landscapes. The persistence and varying complexity of urban landscapes set them apart from ephemeral agroecosystems and natural habitats where the majority of studies have been conducted. Using surveys and manipulative experiments. We explicitly tested the effect of natural enemies (enemies hypothesis), host plant quality, and herbivore movement on the abundance of the specialist insect herbivore, Stephanitis pyrioides, in landscapes of varying structural complexity. This herbivore was extremely abundant in simple landscapes and rare in complex ones. Natural enemies were the major force influencing abundance of S. pyrioides across habitat types. Generalist predators, particularly the spider Anyphaena celer, were more abundant in complex landscapes. Predator abundance was related to greater abundance of alternative prey in those landscapes. Stephanitis pyrioides survival was lower in complex habitats when exposed to endemic natural enemy populations. Laboratory feeding trials confirmed the more abundant predators consumed S. pyrioides. Host plant quality was not a strong force influencing patterns of S. pyrioides abundance. When predators were excluded, adult S. pyrioides survival was greater on azaleas grown in complex habitats, in opposition to the observed pattern of abundance. Similarly, complexity did not affect S. pyrioides immigration and emigration rates. The complexity of urban landscapes affects the strength of top-down forces on herbivorous insect populations by influencing alternative prey and generalist predator abundance. It is possible that habitats can be manipulated to promote the suppressive effects of generalist predators.

AB  - This paper intends to establish a procedure for analyzing urban road network performances, with deficient functional hierarchy. The problem occurs in many Brazilian cities, in which the capacity of the main urban network is not sufficient enough to handle the necessities of the through traffic that takes advantage of the local network. The conflicts are then stressed between the interests of the traffic (translated into service quality associated with the main roads) and the interests of the community (expressed in terms of quality of life related to the conditions observed on the local roads). This balance of interests may be represented through traffic operating indicators-such as vehicle flows and speeds, which are generally available even under the context of a lack of data. Interventions are proposed and tested for the main and local systems that would ensure satisfactory levels for the quality of service and quality of life. The procedure aims to stimulate the participation of the intervenient actors, trying to converge to a traded solution.

AB  - Maintaining forest biodiversity by combining protection, management and restoration in forest and woodland landscapes is one of the components of ecological sustainability. Succeeding with this can even be viewed as an acid test of sustainability as a whole. The principle of sustainable forest management has stimulated a proliferation of a number of criteria and indicators. However, to achieve ecological sustainability, it is vital that the monitoring of a suite of relevant indicators are compared with performance targets to assess both status and, if repeated, the trends in actual landscapes. We first describe how traditional measurement tools for describing wood resources need to be complemented by monitoring of the elements of biodiversity including species, habitats and functions at multiple spatial scales. Second, we provide examples of empirical non-linear relationships between presence and fitness of species' populations and different levels of anthropogenic change in their respective habitats at different spatial scales, and argue that this can be used to formulate science-based performance targets for indicators. Finally, using the results from monitoring and with relevant performance targets, it is possible to make assessments of the status of a certain criterion, such as biodiversity. Examples of practical assessment tools such as regional gap analysis and habitat suitability models are presented for strategic and tactic planning, respectively, of operational management for protection, management and re-creation of different elements of biodiversity. Additionally, the need to assure communication with iterated feedback of the results of assessments to managers and policy-makers is discussed. Aiming at bridging the gaps among the fields of policy, science and management, we finally stress the need for international co-operation. We suggest the establishment of a network of case studies in the form of "landscape laboratories" in gradients of forest alteration and different governance systems together with managers of forests and woodland representing different trajectories towards SFM. Watersheds, Model Forests, Biosphere Reserves and National Park are four relevant concepts to be employed.

AB  - Although the influx of visible minority immigrants has created an atmosphere of diversity and multiculturalism in Canada's three major gateway cities, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, immigration has also produced metropolitan landscapes of fragmentation and ethnic separation. The objective of this study is to compare the residential patterns of visible minority populations in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, using a rigorous and consistent method that examines the temporal and spatial nature of segregation and its links to local housing characteristics. The paper reviews the literature on models of urban separation, and ethnic and visible minority segregation in Canadian cities, and develops four propositions regarding expected residential patterns and concentrations of visible minorities. It tests these propositions using an analysis of 1986, 1991 and 1996 Census data, in which residential patterns in the three cities are examined and related to the distribution of different types of housing. Our findings confirm previous research results of fragmentation and dispersal, but we uncover decisive differences between cities.

TI  - Do villages' shape our cities?
T2  - Space Syntax 5th International Symposium, Vol 2, Proceedings
LA  - English
CP  - 5th International Space Syntax Symposium
AB  - It frequently occurs in the growth of cities that villages are absorbed into the fabric of that city. But what are the consequences of this? How far and how do these villages become part of the overall fabric of the city? How does this affect the village, and what is the effect on the wider city? These questions have been raised by geographers and social scientists in relation to the cities of Manama and Muharraq, "Have these small and big villages evolved to become no more than just settlements `implanted' in an environment that they have nothing to do with, from the economical or cultural angle?" (Jafar, 1975:320). Today; the urban expansion around or inside Bahrain villages has changed its structure; (Al-Najar, 1998). Fast urbanisation, especially if considered in the context of Bahrain's metropolitan growth, has considerably blurred the boundaries between urban, and village districts (see fig.290). However, it has not been discussed as a spatial question. The aim of this paper is to pose these questions in relation to the cities of Manama and Muharraq, by the methods of space syntax in order to try to clarify the spatial aspect of the processes described by the geographers and social scientists.
   Through the study of villages of real cases and the ability of space syntax we need to extract common `generic' themes of villages at macro and micro levels as well as the degree of their mechanism in the city. The outcome might be linked to different levels of changes in the city growth process when studying the complexity of global patterns based on the spatial interaction of local units such as villages. This paper is divided into four parts:
   The first part is the quantitative analysis, which is based on 9 of these villages in Manama and Muharraq cities in 1998. The first measure lies upon the axial representation of space. It will be first applied to the main configuration of the villages' layouts within the city system - at a global level - trying to analyze the mechanism of the villages' spatial configuration in the part-whole relationship system? Are they segregated or integrated in the city? Are villages' spatial configurations having a similar behaviour in the two cities? Secondly; this measure will be applied to the villages at the local level, which will benchmark these villages; in order to see how the villages' spatial configuration differentiates the local level from the global level? Thirdly, the study will merge both levels to see how the spatial factors common between the global level and local level play a role in segregating or integrating the villages into the city system?
   The second part represents the main core of this study in which we will try to answer the following questions: What are the spatial factors behind spatial segregation or integration of the villages in the city? Does the segregation or integration of the villages depend on the local level of the village's configuration, or on the global level Naim, for example; has two spatial rings shape pattern and a line extending from the center to the edge.
   The integration core for Naim and Arad at the Local Level is located in the center and extends to the edges of the villages in four different directions. Hillier noticed, from studying the integration and segregation core of many settlements, in different cultures of a structure; the deformed wheel (Hillier; 1989; p. 11). He articulates that the villages, for example, with local deformed wheels, have the effect of relating local movement to the larger scale of movement through the area. It links to the edges in all directions, ensuring that it is integrated into the larger scale urban context. This works by relating the `local grid conditions' of each line to the larger scale spatial system. The more the two correlate, the more we have `synergy' between local and global movement, and this is in practice what makes local areas or villages feel well used. (Hillier, 1999) This applies also to the spatial factor of the segregated Arad and integrated Naim at the global level, because in Arad, the integration core is not linked or integrated into the urban context strongly (ALV: ALU, is 11.6: 1 in GL), while Naim, has each line of the deformed wheel linked to the urban context (5.5: 1 in GL). This explains why the village had a high synergy at the global level.
   The paper concludes with opening up more questions that need further investigating in future studies, such as:
   1. What impact does the surrounding area have on the village's spatial behaviour (integrated as well as segregated)? For example, a new planning town close to the village or a big planning project like an airport;
   2. What impact does a ring road or a highway have on the spatial behavioural relationship between the village and the city?
   3. How do these different spatial villages mechanisms influence the growth process of Manama city and Muharraq city?
   4. How to develop an enhanced method for measuring micro patterns such as villages or local units in the urban system?.

AB  - Current federal housing policy and the planning approaches of many local governments focus on the dispersal of subsidized families. There have been, in fact, two generations of dispersal policy. The first, occurring in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, was part of the fair housing movement that was aimed at addressing issues of racial discrimination and suburban exclusionism in housing, and the second, dating from the early 1990s, is focused on deconcentrating poverty in American cities. Both generations of dispersal efforts, regardless of their differing justifications, use roughly the same policy strategies. This article reviews the policy history of housing dispersal and offers a schematic interpretation Of different programmatic approaches.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide socially valuable ecosystem services. Through an historical analysis of the development of the National Urban Park (NUP) of Stockholm, we illustrate how the co-evolutionary process of humans and nature has resulted in the high level of biological diversity and associated recreational services found in the park. The ecological values of the area are generated in the cultural landscape. External pressures resulting in urban sprawl in the Stockholm metropolitan region increasingly challenge the capacity of the NUP to continue to generate valuable ecosystem services. Setting aside protected areas, without accounting for the role of human stewardship of the cultural landscape, will most likely fail. In a social inventory of the area, we identify 69 local user and interest groups currently involved in the NUP area. Of these, 25 are local stewardship associations that have a direct role in managing habitats within the park that sustain such services as recreational landscapes, seed dispersal, and pollination. We propose that incentives should be created to widen the current biodiversity management paradigm, and actively engage local stewardship associations in adaptive co-management processes of the park and surrounding green spaces.

AB  - This study examined the extent to which commonly used and easily obtained landscape metrics contribute to a conservation planning process that must be completed rapidly and economically. Specifically, we aimed to determine if landscape metrics could be used to guide the prioritization process when the importance of sites to conservation portfolios is measured in terms of irreplaceability, as measured by the probability that a particular site will be required in conservation reserve network. This question was examined in the context of a flexible planning process where the size of a conservation portfolio may vary over time. We used avian survey data from 35 riparian forest sites in central Ohio to calculate irreplaceability scores for each site. Landscape composition within a 1-km radius of each site was measured as the number of buildings and the percent forest, agriculture, roads, pavement and mowed surfaces. Multinomial logistic regression models were created and compared using Akaike Information Criterion. Results suggest that when predicting the irreplaceability value of a site, a simple yet effective method involves the use of forest coverage at the landscape-level plus one metric measuring human disturbance. This result appears to hold across a range of portfolio sizes and is therefore useful even in the context of a planning process that varies in scope over time. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the role of imported cases in the local epidemiology of malaria and population genetics of Plasmodium falciparum in an urban endemic area in Colombia.
   METHOD A total of 679 P. falciparum cases presenting in the city were interviewed, mapped, and genotyped using msp1 and msp2 molecular markers.
   RESULTS Among the cases, 75% were classified as imported and harboured single-clone infections. The P. falciparum parasite population had low genetic diversity with a preponderant haplotype (mean genetic diversity H = 0.36), even when microsatellite markers were used (H = 0.49), partly because of the small scale at which population movement was studied. Nevertheless, indigenous and potentially introduced cases were identified.
   CONCLUSION Migration is a confounder in planning malaria control in this endemic urban area. Longitudinal studies which monitor the P. falciparum population in imported and autochthonous cases at larger spatial scales would be necessary to study the effect of population movement on malaria transmission and, with suitable molecular markers, on the spread of drug resistance.

AB  - 1 The distribution and dynamics of insect populations in cities is poorly understood. One approach to address this question is to explore the permeability of the urban habitat to species from surrounding rural areas, which can serve as reservoirs in source-sink dynamics.
   2 Here, we present data on the distribution of the forest insect pest of spruce, Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Scolytidae), along two axes entering the city of Brussels (Belgium) from the south-east and to the town centre.
   3 The insect was caught everywhere along these transects, even in heavily urbanized surroundings, and sometimes in relatively high numbers. The catches were highest near the middle of the transects and lower at both ends of them.
   4 This pattern was associated, on the one hand, with an urbanization gradient with the numbers of flying individuals increasing with the distance from the city centre and, on the other hand, with lower catches at the periphery of the city where a high proportion of broadleaved trees may have disrupted the response to aggregation pheromones.
   5 In addition to the probable rural origin of the beetles, high catches at the Port of Brussels indicated that some of the insects might be of foreign origin and enter the city with imported timber, highlighting a pathway for unintentional introductions of organisms, including potentially invasive species.

AB  - Europe is a highly urbanised continent. The consequent loss and degradation of urban and peri-urban green space could adversely affect ecosystems as well as human health and well-being. The aim of this paper is to formulate a conceptual framework of associations between urban green space, and ecosystem and human health. Through an interdisciplinary literature review the concepts of Green Infrastructure, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being are discussed. The possible contributions of urban and peri-urban green space systems, or Green Infrastructure, on both ecosystem and human health are critically reviewed. Finally, based on a synthesis of the literature a conceptual framework is presented. The proposed conceptual framework highlights many dynamic factors, and their complex interactions, affecting ecosystem health and human health in urban areas. This framework forms the context into which extant and new research can be placed. In this way it forms the basis for a new interdisciplinary research agenda. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Comprehensive planning of towns and townships takes a wider scale in the country. Therefore, there appears an urgent need to revise or review some conceptions of planning methodology that should be accepted after various alternatives consideration. According to our opinion,
   a) classification of centres of a settlement system (towns and townships) requires self-determination and equal understanding which, from one side, should reflect more precisely the existing diversity of development between the centres and their functions and, from the other side, the rank granted to these centres should meet the EU criteria;
   b) the functional structure of towns and townships, reflected by diversity in the purpose of their territory use and its indefinite character during the process of residential area modernization which takes place under market conditions, forces to give upa detailed setting of plot purpose and look for a more universal model of landuse purpose specification which could be applicable not only for planning of rural agricultural territories but for urban planning of residential areas as well.
   Proposals presented in the paper (Tables 1 and 2) respect the systematic conception of settlement network, accepted in Lithuania and in the other EU countries and based on the hierarchy of elements and development dependency allowing application of sustainability and balance principles for the system element development. They are prepared taking into account new urban planning conceptions and reflecting the following factors:
   changing business and production conditions as well as growing qualitative safety, service and ecological requirements for a residential environment;
   increasing importance of economic factors and resulting need for a more rational land use and broader urban internal integration when developing public transportation and urban system for a common space use;
   respect to stable urban structural elements of residential areas (urban framework) as well as to local cultural identity and historically formed compositional peculiarities;
   advantages of the functional and social diversity and polycentric character of urban structures.

AB  - The flow of organisms in lotic environments is known as Macroinvertebrate Stream Drift: a phenomenon that has long fascinated freshwater ecologists. Stream-dwelling organisms are often transported downstream in the water column in substantial numbers. Because they have limited swimming ability and the movement is apparently passive, the process is referred to as drift. This study assesses drift fauna in a lotic environment upstream from the Australian inland city of Wagga Wagga, looking at the abundance and diversity of invertebrates over sampling times spanning daytime, dusk and nighttime. Not only did the abundance of individual macroinvertebrates increase from daytime to nighttime, but the diversity of taxa also increased. Although not as sharp as the increase in individual numbers, the diversity of taxa however did more than double from the dusk sampling period to the first night sampling period.

AB  - 1. Despite the accelerating global spread of urbanized habitats and its associated implications for wildlife and humans, surprisingly little is known about the biology of urban ecosystems.
   2. Using data from a 60-year study period, this paper provides a detailed description of how the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis L. - generally considered a shy forest species - colonized the city of Hamburg, Germany. Six non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are investigated regarding the environmental factors that may have triggered this invasion.
   3. The spatio-temporal analysis of 2556 goshawk chance observations (extracted from a total data set of 1 174 493 bird observations; 1946-2003) showed that hawks regularly visited the city centre decades before the first successful breeding attempts were recorded. Many observations were made in parts of the city where territories were established in later years, demonstrating that these early visitors had encountered, but not used, potential nest sites.
   4. Pioneer settlement coincided with: (i) an increase in (legal) hunting pressure on goshawks in nearby rural areas; (ii) an increase in avian prey abundance in the city; and (iii) a succession of severe winters in the Greater Hamburg area. On the other hand, there was no evidence to suggest that the early stages of the invasion were due to: (i) decreasing food availability in rural areas; (ii) major habitat changes in the city; or (iii) rural intraguild dynamics forcing hawks into urban refugia. While breeding numbers of a potential rural source population were at a long-term low when the city was colonized, prior to first settlement there was a sharp increase of goshawk chance observations in the city and its rural periphery.
   5. The urban population expanded rapidly, and pair numbers began to stabilize after about 10 years. Ringing data (219 ringed nestlings from 70 urban broods; 1996-2000) demonstrated that most urban recruits had fledged in the city, but also confirmed considerable gene flow between urban and rural habitats. Analysis of chance observations (as raw data or as detrended time series) suggested a tight coupling of population dynamics inside and outside the city.
   6. City-colonizations such as the one described here provide a valuable opportunity to study some fundamental aspects of population ecology on a scale at which detailed monitoring is logistically feasible. Furthermore, a good understanding of urban ecology has become essential for efficient wildlife conservation in modern, human-altered environments.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (m(eff)) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two m(eff) calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower m(eff) values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated m(eff) values varied from 0 to 20 885 km(2) across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analyzed data from 287 streams in Wisconsin and northern Michigan to evaluate the relative effects of human disturbance levels on the influence of catchment, network riparian, reach riparian, and instrearn variables on fish assemblages. The streams were divided into high, medium, and low human disturbance groups based on catchment and network riparian urban and agricultural land uses. We used canonical correspondence analyses to evaluate relations among variables at the four spatial scales and fish assemblage composition, abundance, and presence/absence and to partition the relative importance of spatial scales. Catchment and network riparian land uses were among the dominant variables correlated with fish for high disturbance catchments but not for low disturbance catchments. The variations in fish assemblage composition, abundance, and presence/absence explained by catchment factors were substantially higher for high than for low disturbance catchments, although the variations explained by network riparian factors and reach riparian land uses were similar among disturbance levels. In contrast, the variations in fish variables explained by instream factors and the interaction of the four spatia ' I scale environmental factors were considerably lower for high disturbance than for low disturbance catchments. We concluded that in largely undisturbed catchments, fish assemblages were predominantly influenced by local factors, but as disturbance increased in catchments and riparian areas, the relative importance of local factors declined and that of catchment increased. Hence, instrearn and riparian habitat improvements would be most effective in catchments that are largely undisturbed and catchment scale land-use management would be more effective for improving stream quality in degraded catchments.

AB  - 1. Worldwide, increasing numbers of stream restoration projects are being initiated to rehabilitate waterways modified by urbanisation. However, many of these projects have limited success in restoring stream communities. Prompted by this, we investigated previously unrecognised barriers to aquatic insect colonisation in urban streams.
   2. To investigate whether the availability of suitable substrata for oviposition limited the longitudinal distribution of caddisflies, large boulders were added to the upstream reaches of one stream. Prior to the addition, more egg masses were observed downstream and this longitudinal pattern persisted subsequently.
   3. Malaise trapping revealed that adult caddisfly diversity and abundance was greater downstream than upstream. Furthermore, in a previous study the authors found larval caddisflies reflected the longitudinal distribution of adults.
   4. The only obvious potential obstructions between reaches were roads beneath which the stream flowed through culverted crossings. Malaise trapping was used to examine the effect of road culverts and bridges on caddisfly dispersal. Numbers of caddisflies caught declined upstream and about 2.5 x more individuals were taken in traps immediately below than above five culverts.
   4. Bridges, which had a more open structure than culverts, had no significant effect on the size of catches made above and below them.
   5. Road culverts could act as partial barriers to upstream flight, with consequences for larval recruitment in urban streams. We recommend that urban planners and designers of restoration projects consider possible synergistic effects of poor oviposition habitat and barriers to aquatic insect dispersal, which may be critical for the colonisation of urban headwater streams and for the maintenance of stream insect populations.

AB  - The chironomid populations of a 40km section of the middle Loire (Tours region) were studied for the first time. Six collections (distributed over the years 1994 to 1996) of pupal exuviae and benthic pupae were made from April to November, in the main river bed, at 4 sites of this potamal zone. A total of 12,073 specimens were sorted and 117 species or taxa identified. Thirty one are new for continental France, in particular Polypedilum acifer TOWNEs and Saetheria reissi JACKSON, two dominant species. Among these, three genera are new: Hayesomyia, Robackia and Saetheria. A new pupal exuvia which has only been noted in the Loire has been recorded: Chironomus Pe23 (LANGTON 1995). A comparison of the middle Loire chironomid fauna with that of the potamal zones of five large European rivers - Rhone and Garonne (France)- Meuse (Belgium) - Po (Italy) - Rhine (Germany) - confirms the diversity and faunistic originality of the middle Loire using several descriptors such as diversity indexes, rarefaction curves, equitability index, distribution of species abundance, number of "endemic" species and distribution of dominant species. Causes of the high specific richness observed, as well as rare species abundance or scarcity, are discussed taking into account functional characteristics of the River Loire's potamic parts such as the connectivity pattern. The relationship between high biodiversity and large, sandy rivers is also discussed using similar results obtained on two other large sandy rivers: the Po and the Elbe (Germany) rivers.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans) are common residents of many urban areas in North America, but little is known about how they have adapted to Urbanization. With increasing urban sprawl, it is important to understand how and why animals are using urban landscapes. We studied radiocollared coyotes in Tucson, Arizona, USA, from October 1996 to December 1998 to determine home range size, habitat use, and nocturnal movement patterns in 7 habitat patch types: natural, commercial, parks, vacant, residential, washes, and roads. Home ranges of resident coyotes averaged 12.6 km(2) (range = 1.7 to 59.7 km(2)). Home ranges encompassed a smaller portion of natural patches and a larger proportion of park and residential areas than were available in the Study area. Coyotes used habitat patch types within the home ranges in proportion to their availability except during the dispersal season, when coyotes selected natural areas and washes and avoided park and residential areas. We used radiolocation data from 120 nighttime observation sessions of 11 animals to determine nocturnal movement patterns. Rates of movement peaked at 2300 and 0500 hr. Rates of movement did not differ among habitat patch types. Individuals moved minimum distances of 1.3 to 6.2 km during the night. Coyotes were most active at night from 2200 to 2400 hr. Disturbances associated with urbanization are multi-scaled and widespread: therefore, wildlife biologists and managers should study habitat use by urban, wildlife at multiple scales.

TI  - Desegregation lawsuits and public housing dispersal - The case of Hollman v. Cisneros in Minneapolis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
KW  - POVERTY
AB  - In recent years the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has settled several desegregation lawsuits across the country in ways that further the agency's current strategies of public housing redevelopment and housing mobility through tenant-based assistance. One of the chief motivations for these policies is the dispersal of subsidized housing as a means of deconcentrating poverty. This article examines the deconcentrating effects of one desegregation lawsuit, Hollman v. Cisneros in Minneapolis. The Hollman case incorporated three means of dispersal: (i) redevelopment of public housing and the relocation of displaced families, (2) a housing mobility program, and (3) development of scattered-site replacement housing. In this case, despite full implementation of the consent decree, a very limited amount of dispersal actually occurred. Marketing the mobility program and suburban replacement housing to inner-city families has proven very difficult, and most poor families remain in central city neighborhoods. These findings call into question the underlying assumptions of a deconcentration approach to alleviating poverty in the inner city.

AB  - 1. This paper introduces key messages from a number of papers emanating from the Second International Symposium on Riverine Landscapes held in August 2004 in Sweden, focusing on river restoration. Together these papers provide an overview of the science of river restoration, and point out future research needs.
   2. Restoration tests the feasibility of recreating complex ecosystems from more simple and degraded states, thereby presenting a major challenge to ecological science. Therefore, close cooperation between practitioners and scientists would be beneficial, but most river restoration projects are currently performed with little or no scientific involvement.
   3. Key messages emanating from this series of papers are: The scope, i.e. the maximum and minimum spatial extent and temporal duration of habitat use, of species targeted for restoration should be acknowledged, so that all relevant stages in their life cycles are considered. Species that have been lost from a stream cannot be assumed to recolonise spontaneously, calling for strategies to ensure the return of target species to-be integrated into projects. Possible effects of invasive exotic species also need to be incorporated into project plans, either to minimise the impact of exotics, or to modify the expected outcome of restoration in cases where extirpation of exotics is impractical.
   4. Restoration of important ecological processes often implies improving connectivity of the stream. For example, longitudinal and lateral connectivity can be enhanced by restoring fluvial dynamics on flood-suppressed rivers and by increasing water availability in rivers subject to water diversion or withdrawal, thereby increasing habitat and species diversity. Restoring links between surface and ground water flow enhances vertical connectivity and communities associated with the hyporheic zone.
   5. Future restoration schemes should consider where in the catchment to locate projects to make restoration most effective, consider the cumulative effects of many small projects, and evaluate the potential to restore ecosystem processes under highly constrained conditions such as in urban areas. Moreover, restoration projects should be properly monitored to assess whether restoration has been successful, thus enabling adaptive management and learning for the future from both successful and unsuccessful restorations.

AB  - To characterize the airborne algal diversity in a populous subtropical urban environment, sampling was done at a height of 2.5 m, the normal human breathing zone. Results indicated that airborne algae are the permanent constituent of Varanasi city atmosphere. The nature, composition, and relative ratio of constituting groups differed among sampling sites. Cyanobacteria, possibly due to their broad ecological distribution, dominate the fluctuating climates of subtropical regions such as Varanasi. The majority of the airborne algae were of local origin, indicating short-distance transport of the algae. Soilborne algae constituted the bulk of aeroalgal flora. This might be due to their ability to withstand the dehydrating effect of the atmosphere. Composition of the acroalgal community also exhibited seasonal variation along with the change in climatic condition of the area. Thus, the physiological ability of an algal group to tolerate different types of abiotic stresses and the climatic conditions of the area appeared to be the two major factors responsible for regulating the structure of the aeroalgal community in the air.

TI  - Evaluating impacts to Florida panther habitat: How porous is the umbrella?
T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST

KW  - FORESTS
AB  - The endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) shares its shrinking habitat with agriculture, surface mining, and rapid urban growth. Although panthers have extensive home ranges and use diverse land covers, methods that dominate panther habitat evaluation for Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultations and regional land use planning consider only forested day-use elements within the landscape mosaic. Maehr and Deason (2002) present a Panther Habitat Evaluation Model (PHEM) that, in addition to excluding nonforested habitat, reduces the assessed value of forest patches based on criteria for patch size, forest type, proximity to a "core" area, and connectivity to other patches. An examination of the foundations of PHEM is therefore warranted. Building oil earlier work that included an evaluation of panther habitat selection studies (Comiskey et al. 2002), we examine PHEM in light of data quality criteria and the panther's known life history requirements. We conclude that the precepts and rules of the PHEM methodology are based on unwarranted assumptions, nonstandard methods of analysis, and exclusion of relevant data, leading to an undue emphasis on day-use land cover and forest patches larger than 500 ha. Large areas of southern Florida that have abundant prey and are intensively used by panthers would score low in PHEM habitat assessments because they lack large forest patches. We discuss the conservation implications of applying a methodology that discounts substantial portions of Occupied panther habitat as unsuitable, and describe all alternative approach to habitat definition and evaluation that is both consistent with panther habitat requirements and applicable to conservation decision-making. Conserving sufficient habitat for recovery of the panther extends an umbrella of protection to the many species that dwell within its range.

AB  - Industrialization has been one of the major factors in the development of the countries, and has caused a population increase in cities, resulting in urban sprawl. Because industrialization and urbanization often advance in an uncontrolled or unorganized way in developing countries, they can have destructive effects on the environment, particularly on basic ecosystems, wildlife habitat, and global biodiversity. One of the places that has been subject to intense industrialization and resulting urbanization is the Gebze district of Kocaeli in Turkey. Land use and land cover changes that occurred in the region were investigated using satellite images acquired in 1987, 1997, and 2002. In the detection of changes postclassification comparison approach is employed using an artificial neural network classifier, specifically a multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm. Results show some important findings regarding the size and nature of the change that occurred in the study area. In the despoiled areas, a large number of pixels of pasture and forest lands have been replaced by urban pixels; as a result, the total area of urban pixels doubled in the 15-year period with a higher urbanization rate between 1997 and 2002. A significant amount of forest land, about 38% for deciduous and 22% for coniferous forest, has been destroyed. In addition to the statistical estimates of the change, its spatial distribution was also investigated through a map of change that helps to determine the areas where considerable degradation and deforestation have taken place.

AB  - In this paper I outline the institutional history of forestry and conservation in Mexico and describe changing understandings of fire and forest production. Industrial forestry has lost legitimacy with urban audiences, whilst conservation and biodiversity protection have gained increasing moral authority and financial clout. Conservationists in Oaxaca see forests as a location for biodiversity protection and ecotourism.
   Conservationists' representations of logging and agropastoral fires are widely supported by urban audiences, and may threaten the economic base of Mexico's community forestry movement. Paradoxically, these conceptions of nature suppress the ecological knowledge both of conservationists and rural people.

AB  - Some species cope with, and survive in, urban areas better than others. From a conservation viewpoint it is important to understand why some species are rare or are excluded in the urban landscape, in order that we might take action to conserve and restore species. Two ecological factors that might explain the distribution and abundance of butterfly species in the urban landscape are dispersal ability and the availability of suitable habitat. The influence of these factors was assessed by examining the distribution and genetic structure of four grassland butterfly species in the West Midlands conurbation, UK. The four species differ in their distribution and abundance, mobility and habitat specificity. No significant fit to the isolation-by-distance model was found for any of the study species at this spatial scale. Mean F-ST values revealed a non-significant level of population structuring for two species, Pieris napi (L.) and Maniola jurtina (L.), but moderate and significant population differentiation for Pyronia tithonus (L.) and Coenonympha pamphilus (L.). Results suggest that these species are limited more by the availability of suitable habitat than by their ability to move among habitat patches. Conservation strategies for these grassland species should initially focus on the creation and appropriate management of suitable habitat. More sedentary species that have already been excluded from the conurbation may require a more complex strategy for their successful restoration.

AB  - Successional dynamics in Mediterranean forests have been modulated by anthropogenic disturbances during thousands of years, especially in areas densely populated since ancient times. Our objective is to determine whether pine tree cover (early-successional species) and oak tree cover (late-successional species), used as a surrogate of successional stage of peri-urban fragmented forests in the Valles lowlands (Catalonia, NE, Spain), are primarily determined by (1) climate and topography; (2) anthropogenic disturbances; (3) patch structure; or (4) patch dynamics from 1956 to 1993. Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. tree cover were separately recorded on 252 randomly selected plots of 100 m(2), within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 to 218 ha. Multiple linear regressions indicated that forest patch history is the most important variable determining oak and pine tree cover: new forest patches showed higher pine and lower oak tree cover than recently split patches (i.e. those that became fragmented from large forest areas after 1956). Patches already existing as such in 1956 (pre-existent patches) showed higher pine cover than recently split patches. Oak cover increased and pine cover decreased with increasing forest connectivity of the patch. Finally, highly frequented forests were related to high cover of pines. Climatic and topographic variables were not significant. We conclude that pine and oak cover in these peri-urban forests are mainly determined by recent patch dynamics, but also by the spatial pattern of patches. However, human-induced disturbance can modulate this as there is some evidence for pine being associated with a high human frequentation.

AB  - The AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique was used to compare the levels of genetic diversity and differentiation among Paracercion calamorum, Ischnura senegalensis and I. asiatica and to compare the genetic structure of populations found in highly fragmented urban habitats to populations in relatively continous rural habitats. For all 3 spp., high genetic diversity was found in both areas. However, population genetic differentiation among urban populations was approximately twice that Of rural populations, indicating that movements between habitat patches are more restricted in urban areas, probably due to human disturbances that may function as barriers. Inter-specific differences regarding genetic diversity and differentiation are further discussed in terms of habitat specificity.

AB  - Roads remove habitat, alter adjacent areas, and interrupt and redirect ecological flows. They subdivide wildlife populations, foster invasive species spread, change the hydrologic network, and increase human use of adjacent areas. At broad scales, these impacts cumulate and define landscape patterns. The goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the dynamics of road networks over time, and their effects on landscape patterns, and identify significant relationships between road changes and other land-use changes. We mapped roads from aerial photographs from five dates between 1937 and 1999 in 17 townships in predominantly forested landscapes in northern Wisconsin, USA. Patch-level landscape metrics were calculated on terrestrial area outside of a 15-m road-effect zone. We used generalized least-squares regression models to relate changes in road density and landscape pattern to concurrent changes in housing density. Rates of change and relationships were compared among three ecological regions. Our results showed substantial increases in both road density and landscape fragmentation during the study period. Road density more than doubled, and median, mean, and largest patch size were reduced by a factor of four, while patch shape became more regular. Increases in road density varied significantly among ecological subsections and were positively related to increases in housing density. Fragmentation was largely driven by increases in road density, but housing density had a significantly positive relationship with largest patch area and patch shape. Without protection of roadless areas, our results suggest road development is likely to continue in the future, even in areas where road construction is constrained by the physical environment. Recognizing the dynamic nature of road networks is important for understanding and predicting their ecological impacts over time and understanding where other types of development are likely to occur in the future. Historical perspectives of development can provide guidance in prioritizing management efforts to defragment landscapes and mitigate the ecological impacts of past road development.

AB  - Reflecting the lack of critical information for most protected species, recovery plans for organisms listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act tend to oversimplify habitat descriptions. Here we present our approach for improving the definition of habitat for rare and patchily distributed listed species. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) occurs in riparian and scrub communities in California's Central Valley. Habitat quality for the species currently is defined essentially exclusively in terms of presence and abundance of its larval host plant, elderberry (Sambucus spp.). Using detailed measures of physical and biological attributes at diverse sites occupied by the beetle, we characterized and defined habitat quality on the basis of not only host plants, but on an array of biotic and abiotic environmental characteristics. We identified four geornorphically distinct habitat associations: alluvial plain, narrow riparian corridor, upper riparian plain, and non-riparian scrub. Depending on habitat type, the environmental characteristics most strongly associated with beetle presence were host plant availability, topography and proximity to habitat edge. Increased local population size of beetles was associated with higher elderberry density and the presence of larger, more mature plants. Stochasticity in site occupancy over space and time confounds our ability to identify sites that are most able to contribute to long-term beetle survival, while underscoring the importance of unoccupied habitat to the beetle. Adopting a multivariate definition of habitat may facilitate more effective identification of locations critical to the recovery of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, and prioritization of those management actions that can contribute effectively to meeting conservation goals for the species.

AB  - This review presents historical transformation on urban planning approaches in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Urban areas in Japan have always been threated by urban conflagrations due to the high number of wooden structures. The Tokyo metropolitan area which was previously known as Edo until the Meiji Revolution in 1864. Dramatic changes in power was successful but few urban structure reformation occurred, and Tokyo was damaged by urban conflagrations in the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa Eras. The fervent wishes of Japanese urban planners centered on construction of fireproof urban areas. Such wishes accounted for little in actual policy, however, as witnessed to by the failure of Tokyo officials to construct fireproof urban architectures following the massive destruction left by World War II. In September 1959, the Ise-Wan (Ise Bay) Typhoon caused tremendous damage and left over 5,000 dead. As measures against such disasters, the Japanese government enacted the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961. However, measures against Earthquake-induced disasters were yet far from sufficient although Japan experienced hit by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. In 1964, the Niigata Earthquake clearly demonstrated modern Niigata City's vulnerability to earthquakes despite its facilities for the National Sports Festival were equipped with modern technology, all of these facilities were destroyed. Reflecting such disasters, re-examination of measure against earthquake disaster began at coastal cities of Japan, which were constructed in post war time. This paper tracks developments in Japanese urban planning movement that the author took part in for about 20 years from 1964.

AB  - Tainan is a city full of architectural diversity, with nearly four hundred years of history since the Dutch colonization in 1624. The Taiwanese called it Fucheng, which means "the first capital built in Taiwan." During the urbanization process, the vernacular spatial characteristics became concealed as a result of the urban renovation plan during the Japanese colonial period. The authors wish to explore this vernacular quality and make it the aesthetic criteria for the old town district in Tainan. First, urban conservation and aesthetic zoning plans in western countries are reviewed for reference. Second, the authors make an analysis of the morphological structure in the old town district, define the exterior layer and interior layer of typical old town blocks, and illustrate - with spatial characteristics, spatial deficiencies, urban context gaps and lost space - the composition of temple plazas and land use patterns, etc. Third, based on the morphology of aesthetic zoning, redevelopment of the historic landscape by both accentuating the streetscape and rezoning inside the old town blocks is proposed. In addition, the authors suggest viewshed control and graded density to recompose a pedestrian village with a fluid open space network. After the aesthetic zoning techniques are fully discussed and understood, the authors finally encourage marketing and an autonomous community as means toward the sustainable development of the old town district.

AB  - 1. The domestic feral cat (Felis catus L.) is a good model for studying intraspecific variability of dispersal patterns in mammals because cats live under a large diversity of socio-ecological conditions. We analysed both the natal and breeding dispersal patterns of domestic cats in a promiscuous urban population and tested whether or not it differed from the male-biased natal dispersal pattern observed for polygynous rural populations.
   2. During an 8-year study we recorded the exact date of in situ death for 148 marked cats and the exact date of disappearance from the population for 99 other cats. Because undiscovered deaths might over-estimate dispersal probabilities when considering only disappearance probabilities, we made an novel application of multistrata capture-recapture methods in order to disentangle dispersal from true mortality.
   3. We showed that mature females dispersed, both before and after their first reproduction, at 1 and 2 years old. Contrary to females, no dispersal seemed to occur in males. Before sexual maturity, females that disappeared at 1 and 2 years old were in worse body condition than females that stayed in the population area after 2 years old. However, they did not reproduce less successfully before their disappearance than females that died later in the population area.
   4. The female-biased and low natal dispersal pattern in this population was atypical compared to other promiscuous/polygynous mammals and differed from that observed in rural polygynous populations of domestic cat. Neither local mate competition nor inbreeding avoidance appeared to be sufficient pressures to counterbalance ecological constraints on dispersal in an urban environment. However, local resource competition for den sites between potential matriarchies could lead to the breeding dispersal of less competitive females.

AB  - Watershed urbanization decreases diversity and taxonomic richness of aquatic insect communities, and headwater streams are particularly susceptible to degradation from urbanization. Patterns of taxon loss between urban headwater communities and communities in adjacent downstream, higher-order reaches might indicate which processes are controlling taxon loss and the extent to which unique headwater taxa are lost after urbanization. We compared insect communities in urban and rural watersheds and investigated if community similarity between headwater streams and adjacent higher-order main-stern reaches was greater in urban than in rural watersheds. We sampled insect communities in 3 urban and 3 rural watersheds in Maryland's Piedmont region during 3 seasons. Mean taxonomic richness was 4.3x greater and the Shannon diversity index was 1.8x greater in rural than in urban headwater streams. Simpson's index was 1.9x greater in urban than in rural headwater streams. The Jaccard similarity index calculated between headwater and main-stem communities was 1.6x greater for urban sites than rural sites during autumn, and the proportion of headwater taxa shared with the main-stem community was 1.8x greater for urban than rural sites. Redundancy analysis also indicated significantly greater similarity between urban headwater and main-stem communities than between rural headwater and main-stem communities. As expected, urbanization decreased diversity, and the communities remaining in urban headwaters were mostly subsets of the communities in the main-stem streams. This result suggested that taxa unique to headwaters were at the greatest risk of local extirpation after watershed urbanization. A significant interactive effect of landuse type and the longitudinal position of a reach along the headwater on taxonomic richness and the Jaccard index suggested that patterns of taxon loss partially depended on the proximity of a headwater reach to the main-stem stream. Overall, the results suggested that water- and habitat-quality degradation were not the only effects of watershed urbanization that determined the composition of insect communities in urban headwaters.

AB  - Twenty-eight sites along the Wasatch Front, north central Utah, representing the range of urban land use intensity for wadeable streams Of the area, were sampled in September 2000. Fish communities were assessed by single-pass electrofishing, and physical habitat and water-quality characteristics were measured. Oil average, normative species comprised 54% of species richness and 53% of relative abundance, although only Salmo trutta and Pimephales promelas were very abundant at any I site. Salmo trutta mid Catostomus platyrhynchus, a native species, were the most widely distributed and abundant species captured. Analysis of fish communities using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed a community gradient from sites dominated by Salmo trutta and Cottus species (C. bairdi, C. beldingi) to sites dominated by Catostomus platyrhynchus. Sites dominated by C. platyrhynchus were smaller in size and had less habitat cover, smaller average substrate size, higher concentrations of dissolved constituents, and higher water temperature than sites dominated by S. trutta. Sites dominated by C platyrhynchus were located in more intensely urbanized watersheds at lower elevations. Stream size and associated instream habitat availability appear to limit S. trutta distribution and abundance, while native species appear more tolerant of decreased water quality, and increased water temperatures in more urbanized streams. Most of the study sites are affected by development of water infrastructure for human water use (e.g., dams and diversions), and this infrastructure may play a role in dispersal of species.

AB  - Most urban growth in Canada occurs in the urban-rural fringe. The increasing dispersal of the Canadian urban population is due to centrifugal forces pulling urbanites past the suburbs into the surrounding exurban communities. Most Canadian urban centres are located on prime agricultural land. Exurban sprawl devours an inordinate amount of the better agricultural land. The growth around the city of Winnipeg is a case in point. Within Winnipeg's urban field are the rural municipalities of East and West St Paul. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of urban growth on the agricultural land of these RMs as well as the rate of urban growth in both Municipalities based on database analysis using aerial photographs taken in 1960 and 1989 and Geographic Information System (GIS). East St Paul was found to have a higher rate of urbanization (from 10(.)14% to 43(.)75%) between 1960 and 1989 than West St Paul (from 7(.)36% to 23(.)57%). The growth prediction using Markov probability chain analysis showed that East St Paul will henceforth experience a reduced rate of increase than West St Paul. The rate of urbanization for both RMs is found to be comparable with areas surrounding other major cities such as Toronto. The largest increases in urban land use categories occurred in and around the existing exurban settlements. It was found that most urbanization take place on the most fertile soil.

AB  - Societal needs for power generation, water management/use, and land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural) have often resulted in a significant departure from the natural processes of hydrologic regimes and material transport and deposition throughout most of the rivers flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes of the western USA. We examine the compromised ecosystem integrity of one such river, the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, below a large irrigation and power dam that has altered hydrologic regimes and reduced channel sediment supply. We review the ecological structure and function of gravel-bed rivers as they vary across a hierarchy of landscape scales with different spatial and temporal dimensions. Major linkages within the large, alluvial river systems of the western USA include exchange of water and materials along longitudinal connections from streams to rivers, lateral connections between river and floodplain systems, and vertical surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water exchanges. Longitudinal linkages dominate confined ( canyon) river reaches while unconfined ( floodplain) reaches show strong affinities for lateral and vertical exchange. Hydrogeomorphic processes, driven by river power and cut and fill alluviation, produce a dynamic landscape in floodplain reaches, which we refer to as a Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM). The SHM fosters high physical and ecological diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecosystem complexity. In this case study, we examine the dynamics of a series of floodplains along a 90 km river landscape, employing an airborne spectrophotometer, producing georeferenced hyperspectral imagery, coupled with ground truth measures of river hydraulics, river depth, riparian vegetation and other surface characteristics. From these data we derived estimates of the hydraulics and hydrographic regimes necessary to mobilize channel and riparian sediments, thus reestablishing the dynamics of the river SHM. We also evaluated subsequent variation in aquatic and riparian habitat characteristics. Evaluation of these factors, which affect interactions between the river channel and the surrounding river - riparian corridor, permitted us to develop a restoration strategy focused on normative variation among the various physical and biotic processes contributing to ecosystem integrity.

AB  - The brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is in decline throughout much of its natural range with the notable exception of urban areas and a few islands. In some urban areas, its density can be high enough to cause conflict with householders. We provide the first genetic-based study of dispersal for T. vulpecula in the urban environment. Seven microsatellite markers were used to investigate genetic structure of adult male (n = 53) and female ( n = 39) possums sampled from mainland suburbs of Sydney, and on nearby Scotland Island. Samples from Scotland Island also provide an opportunity to assess the effect of isolation on genetic variability, which, as theory would predict, was significantly lower than observed in mainland samples. Male-biased dispersal was inferred from patterns of relatedness between individuals of each sex. Average relatedness was significantly higher between adult female possums than between adult male possums sampled within the same garden area. In addition, males were genotypically more similar to one another at substantially greater geographic distances than females. Along with male-biased dispersal, strong localised genetic structure for both sexes infers generally high philopatry. Dispersal distances were greatest for adult male possums sampled from mainland locations. However, even for these males, genotypic similarity between possums separated by distances further than similar to 900 m was lower than the sample average, suggesting infrequent dispersal beyond this distance. Knowledge of dispersal patterns is important to managing the density levels of overabundant T. vulpecula in urban areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - It is argued that if planners are to recognize and support socially diverse neighbourhoods, it is important that they become better acquainted with both the form of diverse places, as well as the evaluation of that form. Thinking in these terms may also help planners adopt a particular language about diversity that is sensitive to the unique requirements of diverse places. A framework for evaluating the socially diverse neighbourhood from a design standpoint is suggested. Two sources are used: urban and community design that is specifically meant to create places that support social diversity; and ecological principles that are meant to improve the relationship between habitat and species diversity. This framework is applied to an evaluation of diverse areas in the city of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. A multi-dimensional definition of diversity that includes income, race/ethnicity, age and family type is used. Forty-nine block groups satisfied the condition of being highly diverse in all four categories. It was found that these areas were mostly inner-ring, 'blue-collar' suburbs, often having the physical characteristics of strong edges, grids with commercial corridors and mixed housing types.

AB  - This paper analyzes US geographic differences over nine regions in patterns of occupational mobility between 1880 and 1900 among the National Panel Study (NPS) of white men in the age cohorts 5-14 and 25-34. Comparisons focus on father-to-son mobility for the younger age cohort as it reached adulthood, and on intra-generational movement in midlife for the older cohort. Levels of upward mobility vary positively in both cohorts with levels of regional urbanization, while, contrary to the "frontier thesis" of American historians, location in the most recently settled parts of the United States has little relationship to occupational mobility. Using log linear models, the paper analyzes the higher mobility of the urban regions. Inheritance of occupation across and within generations is relatively constant across urban regions. Most of the geographic variation is explained by differential occupational structure, especially the growth of a clerical/sales workforce in the urban regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, particularly the threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics.
   Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate "spread" or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches.
   Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along "biological corridors" appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites, and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a lire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.

AB  - Modem society depends on complex agro-ecological and trading systems to provide food for urban residents, yet there are few tools available to assess whether these systems are vulnerable to future disturbances. We propose a preliminary framework to assess the vulnerability of food systems to future shocks based on landscape ecology's 'Panarchy Framework'. According to Panarchy, ecosystem vulnerability is determined by three generic characteristics: (1) the wealth available in the system, (2) how connected the system is, and (3) how much diversity exists in the system. In this framework, wealthy, non-diverse, tightly connected systems are highly vulnerable. The wealth of food systems can be measured using the approach pioneered by development economists to assess how poverty affects food security. Diversity can be measured using the tools investors use to measure the diversity of investment portfolios to assess financial risk. The connectivity of a system can be evaluated with the tools chemists use to assess the pathways chemicals use to flow through the environment. This approach can lead to better tools for creating policy designed to reduce vulnerability, and can help urban or regional planners identify where food systems are vulnerable to shocks and disturbances that may occur in the future.

AB  - We analyze a 114-year historical record (1871-1985) of the change in abundance of 373 native plant species in Auckland, New Zealand, with the aim of identifying the attributes that predisposed some species to local extinction and rarity following European settlement. The 1871 survey records the relative abundance of native plants in the Auckland area just 31 years after Europeans began clearing the native vegetation for settlement, whereas the 1985 survey records the relative abundance of the same species 114 years later, when the area had been transformed into an urban landscape. Four attributes were significantly and independently related to the probability that a species was locally extinct or rare in 1985. (1) compared with species that were common in 1871, initially rare species were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985; (2) compared with tall species, short species were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985; (3) gymnosperms and dicotyledons were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985 than were pteridophytes or monocotyledons; and (4) species occupying habitats that suffered the greatest loss of area following European settlement were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985 relative to species occupying less affected habitats. Two additional attributes, long-distance dispersal ability and capacity for clonal spread, failed to independently explain significant variation in 1985 abundance. We discuss the likely causes of these relationships and consider their implications for understanding extinction processes.

AB  - Remnant plants in urban fringes and native plants in gardens have the potential to contribute to the conservation of threatened plants by increasing genetic diversity, effective size of populations, and levels of genetic connectedness. But they also pose a threat through the disruption of locally adapted gene pools. At Hyams Beach, New South Wales, Australia, four bushland stands of the rare shrub, Grevillea macleayana McGillivray, surround an urban area containing remnant and cultivated specimens of this species. Numbers of inflorescences per plant, fruits per plant, and visits by pollinators were similar for plants in urban gardens and bushland. Urban plants represented a substantial but complex genetic resource, displaying more genetic diversity than bushland plants judged by H-c, numbers of alleles per locus, and number of private alleles. Of 27 private alleles in urban plants, 17 occurred in a set of 19 exotic plant. Excluding the exotic plants, all five stands displayed a moderate differentiation (F-ST = 0.14 +/- 0.02), although the urban remnants clustered with two of the bushland stands. These patterns may be explained by high levels of selfing and inbreeding in this species and by long-distance dispersal (several seeds in the urban stand were fathered by plants in other stands). Genetic leakage (gene flow) from exotic plants to 321 seeds on surrounding remnant or bushland plants has not occurred. Our results demonstrate the conservation value of this group of urban plants, which are viable, productive, genetically diverse, and interconnected with bushland plants. Gene flow has apparently not yet led to genetic contamination of bushland populations, but high levels of inbreeding would make this a rare event and difficult to detect. Remnant plants in urban gardens could successfully contribute to recovery plans for endangered and vulnerable species.

AB  - Data on permits for new housing starts are a key source of information on recent changes in the urban landscape of central Arizona, USA. Drawing primarily on the conceptual parallels between the process of urban expansion and the spatial spread of non-human species, we outline a nested series of 'colonization' models that could be used to study changes in urban landscapes through simulations of housing starts. Within our probabilistic colonization framework, the ecological principle of density-dependence (operating simultaneously on different spatial scales) governs the positioning of new housing units. These simple models afford a great diversity of possible spatial patterns, ranging from tight clustering of houses to urban sprawl to more subtle patterns such as aversion of housing developments from (and aggregation near) different kinds of landscape features. These models can be parameterized from a variety of types of governmental housing data. Ultimately, such a framework could be used to contrast development patterns among cities and identify pertinent operational scales and factors influencing processes associated with urbanization.

AB  - During the first half of the twentieth century, private building developed at Perpignan into an architectural ensemble which is unique in the Languedoc-Rousillon region. This ensemble spreads out in the former suburbs, in particular around the railway station, and in new neighbourhoods which emerged after the demolition of the city's fortifications. This development brought a profound renewal to Perpignan's urban landscape. Influenced by various stylistic trends, from regionalism to the modern movement, the leading architects of the period (Edouard Mas-Chancel, Raoul Castan, Ferid Muchir, Alfred Joffre, etc.) created a series of buildings of astonishing variety in their composition and of considerable quality in their detailing. Beyond the diversity of references, however, shared motifs, reciprocal influences and architectural syncretism give the Perpignan neighbourhoods of this period a unified quality which is a powerful contribution to the city's "special character".

AB  - Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and ranged in size from 9 to 71 km(2). Watershed land cover was summarized from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to 20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated. Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness. Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI, density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.

AB  - The genetic combinations between mycobionts and photobionts in Parmotrema tinctorum collected from ca. 60 km(2) of the Shimizu district, of Shizuoka City in Japan was investigated based on ITS rDNA sequences. This lichen produces apothecia quite rarely, and in principle propagates vegetatively by isidia. The genetic diversity of the mycobiont comprised four types, while that of the photobiont comprised 21 types. There were 28 different combinations between mycobiont and photobiont. All the photobionts were identified as Trebouxia corticola (s. lat.), based on both molecular phylogenetic results and morphological observation of culture strains obtained in this study. Therefore, P. tinctorum is considered to be highly selective toward the photobiont. The 28 combinations from the small area represent an unexpectedly high diversity, because P. tinctorum is thought to propagate vegetatively. Four possible mechanisms to account the high genetic combinations are suggested: i.e., photobiont exchange, fusion of thalli, and long-distance dispersal of isidia or ascospores. The genetic diversity of photobionts was poor in the urban area, but rich in suburbs and mountainsides. This might be caused by a bottleneck or founder effect in the population recovering from former damage by heavy air pollution, or variable selectivity of P. tinctorum depending on the environments.

AB  - Urbanization within the Tucson Basin of Arizona during the past 5 years has fragmented the original desert scrub into patches of different sizes and ages. These remnant patches and the surrounding desert are dominated by Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), a long-lived shrub whose flowers are visited by > 120 native bee species across its range. Twenty-one of these bee species restrict their pollen foraging to L. tridentata. To evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L. tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert.
   The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L. tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were overrepresented in the habitat fragments., probably due to enhanced nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was a minor faunal element at > 90% of the fragments and exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses, or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not have been apparent. Pollination interactions with this floral host are probably not adversely affected in this system because of its longevity and ability to attract diverse pollinators but will demand careful further study to understand.

AB  - In the lower Danube and the Danube Delta the juvenile fish assemblage has been surveyed in August 2001. In the main channel of the Danube downstream of the town Galati (Romania) and in the Sfintu Gheorghe branch in the Danube Delta altogether 22 sites were sampled by beach seining and electrofishing respectively, covering nine mesohabitats. Altogether 109 beach seine samples and 318 electrofishing points were taken during daylight, to analyze the distribution and abundance of fish species and ecological guilds compared to regulated rivers, to derive conservation targets for the fish community of Central European rivers. A total of 22 412 fish was caught representing 42 species, five of them non-native. Bleak and monkey goby were most abundant and frequent, contributing together 61% to the total catch. The highest fish densities were observed in connected side waters, but substantial amounts of phytophils in the main channel and regular distributions of rheophils and lithophils between main channel and side waters indicated a high ecotone connectivity. Large woody debris was identified as most important habitat structure for riverine cyprinids, whilst its replacement by riprap favors gobiids. Accordingly, habitat alterations and embankments are prerequisites for gobiid fish to invade Central European rivers. River rehabilitation and mitigation measures should provide large woody debris as most important natural in-channel structure and improve the lateral connectivity of main channels to ecotone complexity beneficial for fish.

AB  - Post-apartheid transition in South Africa's small towns has received little attention. Using the South African Property Transfer Guide, 2500 residential transfers were analysed in Margate. Spatial and temporal patterns in Black house purchase were interpreted through discussions with key actors. The findings indicate the importance of micro-dynamics in determining specific post-apartheid transitions and confirm the relationship between racial employment profiles and housing markets. Black in-movement to previously White areas has focused on Extension 3, where private building of low-cost housing has occurred, but the area is now becoming resegregated. Whilst peripheral housing need not imply exclusion from services in small towns, unpaid mortgage bills and municipal rates have led to repossessions and affected the credit status of new Black buyers.

AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring the globally outstanding natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 170 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional biodiversity recovery plan, the result of 3 years of assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategists, sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately, though, the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. Although the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the widest public in our conservation efforts.

AB  - Ecological and evolutionary theories have focused traditionally on natural processes with little attempt to incorporate anthropogenic influences despite the fact that humans are such an integral part of virtually all ecosystems. A series of alternate models that incorporated anthropogenic factors and traditional ecological mechanisms of invasion to account for fish incidence patterns in urban lakes was tested. The models were based on fish biology, human intervention, and habitat characteristics. However, the only models to account for empirical patterns were those that included fish invasiveness, which incorporated species-specific information about overall tolerance and fecundity. This suggests that species-specific characteristics are more important in general distributional patterns than human-mediated dispersal. Better information of illegal stocking activities is needed to improve human-mediated models, and more insight into basic life history of ubiquitous species is needed to truly understand underlying mechanisms of biotic homogenization.

TI  - Collective influence of urban design on space use - Towards meaningful use of urban spaces in the 21st century
T2  - OLD WORLD - NEW IDEAS: ENVIRONMENT AND CHANGE AND TRADITION IN A SHRINKING WORLD, PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
CP  - 32nd Annual Conference of the Environmental-Design-Research-Association
AB  - Although it is understood that the influence of urban design on space use is collective, emanating from its major aspects, urban design endeavours geared towards enhancing meaningful use of urban spaces often put more emphasis on certain aspects than others. This paper demonstrates the collective influence of urban design on space use through examination of the major aspects of urban design and use of public urban spaces in Dar es Salaam city centre, Tanzania. The purpose is to emphasise the importance of the above understanding about the relationship between urban de sign and space use, to urban design efforts for enhancing meaningful use of urban spaces. In Dar es Salaam city centre, implemented urban design has to the largest extent been a deterrent to meaningful use of public urban spaces. It has contributed to a number of serious urban space use problems which include: haphazard occurrence of small scale commercial activities in urban spaces, underutilization of urban spaces, pedestrian movement problems, and occurrence of awkward urban space uses. With the exception of haphazard occurrence of small scale commercial activities which has been contributed mainly by the planned land use pattern, all other urban space use problems in the city centre have been influenced by more than one of the major aspects of urban design. The paper therefore concludes that the influence of urban design on space use is indeed from all its aspects, and that if urban design strategies aimed at enhancing meaningful use of public urban spaces are to be successful, they ought to take into account all the aspects. The paper culminates with a suggestion of some six criteria for such strategies for Dar es Salaam city centre and similar urban areas elsewhere.

AB  - Bryophytes seem particularly suitable to investigate genetic diversity in relation to habitat disturbance due to their large employment as bioindicators and to the recent application of molecular markers to moss population studies. Genetic variation and structure were analysed in seven urban, extraurban and remote populations of Leptodon smithii, an epiphytic moss of Quercus ilex, a phanerogamic species of Mediterranean climax vegetation. A total of 210 individual shoots were DNA extracted and amplified with internal simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers, and 54 haplotypes were identified. An uneven distribution of haplotype number and frequencies was observed among sites, with a higher number of haplotypes and more homogeneous haplotype frequencies in the extraurban/remote populations. Molecular diversity indices were overall higher in the extraurban sites than in the urban ones. Multilocus linkage disequilibrium values were in line with the occurrence of sexual/asexual reproduction in the seven populations. The isolation-by-distance model was not supported by Mantel test among sites; however, within-population fixation index (F-ST) highlighted a clear relation between genetic and physic distances among trees, suggesting a limited dispersal range for L. smithii's spores. The genetic structure was mainly affected by population size, wood structure and extent, and genetic drift consequent to habitat fragmentation and human-induced disturbance.

AB  - 1. The odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile, is a native ant species common throughout North America. In its natural habitat, T. sessile is a low-key species that consists of small colonies. In invaded urban areas, T. sessile exhibits extreme polygyny and polydomy and becomes a dominant invasive pest.
   2. The current study examined: (i) the density, persistence, and the spatial distribution of nests in a large supercolony of T. sessile, (ii) trail abundance and overall colony connectivity as facilitated by the network of trails, (iii) the abundance and the spatial distribution of competing ant species, and (iv) the effect of environmental factors on the number and distribution of T. sessile nests.
   3. A distinct pattern of seasonal polydomy was observed, whereby the colony undergoes an annual fission-fusion cycle. The colony occupies one or a few nests during the winter, experiences rapid exponential growth in the spring to colonize available nesting sites, reaches maximum nest density in the summer, and again coalesces in the winter, returning to the same winter location year after year. The trails show spatio-temporal variation as well, depending on the location of nesting and foraging sites. Furthermore, nest movements may be driven by soil microclimate and proximity to man-made structures.
   4. In total, 119 ant nests were discovered in a 3.15 ha plot, 90 (76%) of which belonged to T. sessile. Tapinoma sessile exhibited strong colony connectivity as 78/90 (87%) of nests were connected to at least one other nest by a trail. Mean persistence time for T. sessile nests was 133 +/- 5 days.
   5. Results indicate that T. sessile is a highly adaptable native ant species that exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its colony social structure. A high degree of polygyny and polydomy may contribute to its ecological dominance and pest status in urban environments.

AB  - Dispersal plays an important role in the population dynamics of many carnivores, yet little information exists about the dispersal and movement patterns of swift foxes (Vulpes velox). We radio-collared and monitored 68 swift foxes for dispersal at 2 study sites in northwestern Texas from January 2002 to April 2004. Dispersal distance for juveniles (13.1 +/- 0.3 km, s), adults (10 +/- 4.7 km) and transients (25.4 +/- 9.1 km) did not differ by age class (F = 1.49, df = 2, P = 0.24) or sex (F = 0.23, df = 1, P = 0.63) but differed by study site (F = 4.72, df = 1, P = 0.04). Mean dispersal distance from private ranches (PR) was greater than from National Grasslands (NG). Peak dispersal occurred during October-November (13 individuals) and January-February (7 individuals). Dispersal direction was influenced by land-use practices (i.e., toward rangelands and away from anthropogenic features). Direction of dispersal among foxes that occupied the NG was uniform (n = 16, P = 0.08), whereas foxes from PR dispersed in a northwesterly direction (n = 18, P <= 0.001) away from a town and croplands. Three resident adult foxes made extraterritorial movements. Distances of these movements ranged from 0.2 km to 11.4 Ism. Distance of extraterritorial movements did not differ by sex (F = 0.05, P = 0.83), nor by duration of movement (F = 1.11, P = 0.32). Knowledge of movement distances and patterns is important for conservation and protection of swift foxes and their habitats.

AB  - The relationships between the distribution patterns of threatened wildlife species and current land-use planning were investigated in a city of Japan to design a sustainable and land-use plan. Spatial distributions of 165 species of threatened wildlife (99 plants and 66 animals) were obtained by surveying most of the Chiba City, located in northeastern part of the Tokyo Bay area. Distribution maps were created within 334 rectangular cells, each measuring 1.1 km x 0.9 km, oriented in the cardinal directions. Four land-use zones, i.e., urbanization promotion, parkland, agricultural and urbanization control, and agricultural promotion zones were identified.
   The distribution of these threatened species was analyzed in terms of green cover and zoning categories. Few threatened wildlife species were found in the urbanization promotion or parkland zone. Most were concentrated in the surrounding arable areas with green covers of more than 50%. Areas other than those set aside for intensive agricultural development in the agricultural promotion development zone contained the greatest number of species. These areas belonged to the agricultural and urbanization control zone, where the traditional agricultural landscape still remains in and around narrow valleys called "yatsu".
   The results suggest that the regional biodiversity depends heavily on areas in which the traditional landscape remains relatively intact. Based on these results, a series of recommendations, including conservation and restoration of habitats, establishments of wildlife networks and corridors, and citizen involvement in conservation, were presented to the city studied. The data and recommendations will hopefully help the city, as well as many other areas faced with similar issues, devise future land-use plans that combine sustainable development with conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of high quality living environments.

T2  - URBAN STUDIES

KW  - LONDON
KW  - LIFE
AB  - This article provides a comparative analysis of neighbourhood renewal processes in Brussels and Montreal based on a typology of such processes wherein gentrification is precisely delimited. In this way, it seeks to break with the extensive use of a chaotic conception of gentrification referring to the classic stage model when dealing with the geographical diversity of neighbourhood renewal, within or between cities. In both Brussels and Montreal, the gentrification concept only adequatly describes the upward movement of very restricted parts of the inner city, while neighbourhood renewal in general more typically comprises marginal gentrification, upgrading and incumbent upgrading. Evidence drawn from the case studies suggests that each of these processes is relevant on its own-i.e. linked to a particular set of causal factors-rather than composing basically transitional states within a step-by-step progression towards a common gentrified fate. Empirical results achieved in Brussels and Montreal suggest that a typology such as the one implemented in this article could be used further in wider research aimed at building a geography of neighbourhood renewal throughout Western cities.

AB  - In the early morning of January 17, 1995, an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 occurred, with its epicenter in Awaji Island, to the south of Kobe City located near Osaka City. It was later named the Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake.
   The earthquake left over 6,400 people dead and about 40,000 injured, completely destroying over 100,000 houses and buildings, causing about 300 fires, resulting in the suspension of such "lifelines" as city water, electricity, and gas supply, and halting transportation systems including road and railway traffic. It inflicted extensive damage not only on Kobe, but also on Osaka and other cities.
   In the light of destruction caused by the earthquake, in 1997, the Osaka Municipal Government, the Osaka City Regional Preparedness Plan, which includes citizen evacuation in the event of earthquake, construction of seismic-resistant facilities, and fire-fighting and other emergency activities. The original plan was prepared, on the basis of an inter-plate earthquake occurring beneath the Pacific Ocean. In addition to this hypothesis, the new plan also incorporates the assumption that an earthquake with its epicenter under Osaka could occur due to movement of the Uemachi Faults running under the central part of the City in the north-south direction. Estimated damage that could be incurred through this potential earthquake were used for the latter plan.

KW  - INVESTMENT
KW  - GENDER
AB  - Contemporary international migration shows points of departure from the immigration of the past. First, all continents are now significantly implicated in the transfers of populations. Second, then is immense diversity among immigrant characteristics and human capital, including both legal and illegal status, and ranging from the movement of well-resourced cosmopolitans to the flows of refugees who may well be poverty-stricken and without documentation. Third, the numbers of international migrants are at a very high level. Fourth, destinations are more concentrated than has been the case in recent history, focussed upon large metropolitan centres, or gateway cities, in advanced societies.
   These are contexts confronting planners on an everyday basis in multicultural gateway cities such as Sydney (Australia) and Vancouver (Canada). Both metropolitan areas share a common economic and cultural history, and their Pacific Rim location has recently strongly affected migration Rows as legislative reform opened the boundaries of their nation states to new immigrant origins. While Sydney is a nationally primate city and twice the size of Vancouver, each metropolitan area displays similar processes of economic and cultural transformation.
   This volume addresses a number of intellectual and planning questions that have ensued. In Chapter 2 we ask to what extent contemporary immigration is reshaping urban spatial structure, requiring new concepts of urban form and new strategies for service provision. The housing dimension of immigrant settlement has been an important preoccupation of planners, and in Chapter 3 we consider such issues as tenure, affordability, house price inflation, land use conflicts, and the globalization of urban housing markets: accompanying elevated immigration in gateway cities. The differential response to immigration among different family members has recently been identified, and Chapter 3 addresses the gendering of immigration and women's mobilisation to secure necessary services. An important institution in shaping attitudes about immigration is the media, and Chapter 5 considers its representation of minority groups, including two case studies of media coverage of land use conflicts between immigrants and the long-settled population. We argue that it is local government where immigrants typically encounter the state in the delivery of everyday services, and Chapter 6 considers the multicultural readiness of local governments in Sydney and Vancouver in serving a culturally diverse body of citizens. Finally, in Chapter 7 we offer some concluding remarks on the challenges of physical, social, and multicultural planning in gateway cities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because of its capacity to infect human beings and domestic animals with a number of different viruses, the study of the mosquito Ochlerotatus albifasciatus (Macquart, 1938, (Diptera: Culicidae)) assumes great importance from the point of view of sanitation. It is a well-known fact that the abundance of this species peaks after drought periods in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Cordoba. This article aims at explaining the presence of the high abundance of adult O. albifasciatus in Buenos Aires city in February 2005. As no breeding immatures were recorded during the previous weeks, the most likely hypothesis was that mosquitoes entered the city from breeding sites located in the outskirts. Wind observations, the existing knowledge on this species biology, atmospheric dynamic models, and meteorological data were used to support this hypothesis and identify the sources.
   Mass transport of these individuals was apparently the consequence of a convective process. It was demonstrated that the occurrence of a convective process transported air masses from the periphery towards the City of Buenos Aires. Air-parcel trajectories, Ezeiza radar images, and the flood zones observed in satellite images indicated that the source was located in the lowlands of Ezeiza in the Rio Matanza basin, some 50 km to the southwest of the City. The evidence suggests that O. albifasciatus is transported by wind, and the trajectory models are a very useful tool to locate the sources of proliferation of these insects.

AB  - Gyula Illyes, Hungarian poet, fiction writer, essayist and dramatist, emigrated to Paris after the fall of the Hungarian Republic in 1919. There, he came into contact with the working class movement as well as with surrealistic circles. Strongly influenced by modern French writing, Illyes nevertheless adopted realism in his novels. He reflects upon his emigration times in Paris in his novel, Hunok Parisban [Huns in Paris]. The present paper focuses on the following main issues in relation to this novel: types of description, panoramic views, walks, atmosphere of certain districts, the stylistic characteristics of the descriptive sequences. Illyes's description of Paris is a classic example of a type of urban literature that was pioneered in Paris of the 1840s, and was used to celebrate the diversity and dynamism of the modern city. At the center of his description was the figure of the flaneur, or urban stroller, who embodied and represented the quintessential qualities of urban modernity.

AB  - The percentage of exotic plant species (PES) at large geographic scales is presented in form of political maps (Texas and North America) and of isoline maps (Great Britain). in the latter case it is possible to visualize that higher proportions of alien invaders are present in urban and industrial areas as well as in maritime ports rather than in agricultural lands. Consequently, it is possible to predict that the ratio of urban to agricultural species will continue to increase in the future. Based on a survey of 200 world floras, a multiple regression analysis is presented in order to determine the importance of different factors in the yield of PES values. The contribution to the total variance was: disturbance degree 55 %; total species richness 14%; insularity 9%, and latitude 2%. Neither the mean annual precipitation nor the mean annual temperature showed a significant contribution to the total variance. The predominance of Europe as the main deliverer of weeds to other temperate regions in the world has been attributed to the aggressive or imperialistic geopolitics of this region, and to the construction of the first international oceanic fleet. Then are reasons to believe, however, that the great size of Eurasia also played a role in the success of its weedy invasive flora. Since several authors found a weak positive correlation between the radial rate of dispersal and the invading success in plants, a table collecting 153 data allowed a first, tentative comparison among different taxa. The mean dispersal rates were 64.2 for microorganisms; 48.5 for invertebrates, 17.2 for vertebrates, 6.9 for plants, and 0.19 km/yr for palynological registers. A discussion about the significance of these results is included. An alternative way to compare invasive ability, especially among agricultural pests, is by means of an index of cosmopolitanism (C*) which varied as follows: 0.642 for phytopathogens, 0.439 for insects and 0.259 for weeds. Weeds are 15 times, agricultural insects 26 times and phytopathogens 37 times more cosmopolitan than, say, common mammals, taken as an example for comparison. Finally, although animals (invertebrates plus vertebrates) show a higher mean dispersal rate than plants (field observations plus ancient pollen registers), it seems that animals are better colonizers of pristine or scarcely disturbed communities, while plants are more successful in anthropic habitats.

AB  - We identified different distributions of marine nonindigenous species (NIS) and native species on some artificial structures versus natural reefs and using experimental manipulations, revealed some possible causal mechanisms. In well-established subtidal assemblages, numbers of NIS were 1.5-2.5 times greater on pontoons or pilings than on rocky reefs, despite the local species pool of natives being up to 2.5 times greater than that of NIS. Conversely, on reefs and seawalls, numbers of native species were up to three times greater than numbers of NIS. Differential recruitment to different positions and types of surfaces appeared to influence distribution patterns. NIS recruited well to most surfaces, particularly concrete surfaces near the surface of the water, whilst natives occurred infrequently on wooden surfaces. The position of rocky reefs and seawalls close to the shore and to the seabed appeared to make them favourable for the recruitment of natives, but this positioning alone does not hinder the recruitment of NIS. We argue that pontoons and pilings represent beachheads (i.e. entry points for invasion) for many nonindigenous epibiota and so enhance the spread and establishment of NIS in estuaries. Habitat creation in estuaries may, therefore, be a serious threat to native biodiversity.

AB  - Existing transportation system of Dhaka City has now become a mounting menace for the entire city system due to its inherent system deficiencies and jeopardized functional efficiency of the city due to various transportation problems. In Dhaka, about 60% of trips are on foot while almost half of the remaining trips are on Non Motorized Transport (NMT). By contrast, in American cities, about 5% of trips are made without motorized vehicles and in European and Japanese cities, about 20 - 50% of trips are made without motorized vehicles. Because of lower income level, majority of the population in Dhaka are unable to afford private transport and are dependent on low cost public transport or even on walk. But many problems always create hindrances for easy and convenient pedestrian movement on the walkway. The aim of this paper is to examine the existing pedestrian problems of Dhaka City along with some guidelines and policies to overcome the problems for the convenient walking ways especially in the central business district (CBD) area of Dhaka city. We use the database collected from the field through questionnaire surveys and observation surveys to show the extent of the problems. Observation surveys utter the design standards, problems etc. whereas the questionnaire surveys give the responses of the users of the pedestrian ways about their purpose of walking, age and income groups etc. Finally, the outcome proposes the necessary guidelines for more convenient and safer pedestrian movement in the study area. The guidelines can be applied for both in short-term and long-term basis according to the priority indeed.

KW  - Spain
AB  - Squatting in abandoned houses and buildings in Spanish cities has been a continuous occurrence since the early 1980s. CSOAs (Ccntros Sociales Okupados y Autogestionados/Squatted and Self-Managed Social Centres) acquired greater public importance than buildings squatted only for housing purposes. Nevertheless, both forms of squatting have taken place simultaneously. This article delineates the main characteristics of this movement by taking into consideration: (a) spatial trends, (b) the ideological principles, (c) attempts at coordination and (d) the interrelationship with other social movements. This exercise develops a working definition of the squatters' movernent in Spain which allows us to argue that its repertoire of protest and political objectives represents an innovation in the cycle of alter-globalization demonstrations which the squatters' movement has actively joined.

AB  - The genetic variability and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum are key factors in malaria control strategies. Studies have suggested no P. falciparum population structure although linkage disequilibrium was observed in some African areas. We have assessed length polymorphism at 6-22 microsatellites in four urban and rural sites (Djibouti, Dakar, Niamey, and Zouan-Hounien, n = 240 blood samples). Results have shown a P. falciparum population structure in Africa (Fst = 0.17-0.24), lower genetic diversity in Djibouti (He = 0.53) than in the other sites (He = 0.73-0.76), and 3) significant linkage disequilibrium in Djibouti. These results could be related to geographic isolation and low flow of parasites between sites. They also suggest a potential effect of rural suburbs to generate genetic diversity in towns. This could affect the dispersal of selected drug resistance and should be considered when adapting urban malaria control strategies.

AB  - Sustainability is an important concept for society, economics, and the environment, with thousands of research papers published on the subject annually. As sustainability science becomes a distinctive research field, it is important to define sustainability clearly and grasp the entire structure, current status, and future directions of sustainability science. This paper provides an academic landscape of sustainability science by analyzing the citation network of papers published in academic journals. A topological clustering method is used to detect the sub-domains of sustainability science. Results show the existence of 15 main research clusters: Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, Forestry (agroforestry), Forestry (tropical rain forest), Business, Tourism, Water, Forestry (biodiversity), Urban Planning, Rural Sociology, Energy, Health, Soil, and Wildlife. Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, and Forestry (agroforestry) clusters are predominant among these. The Energy cluster is currently developing, as indicated by the age of papers in the cluster, although it has a relatively small number of papers. These results are compared with those obtained by natural language processing. Education, Biotechnology, Medical, Livestock, Climate Change, Welfare, and Livelihood clusters are uniquely extracted by natural language processing, because they are common topics across clusters in the citation network.

AB  - Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) nest in urban and suburban areas across North America, but little is known about movements, habitat use, or survival of fledglings in these settings. We followed 40 radio-tagged, fledgling Cooper's Hawks hatched in Tucson, Arizona in 1999 or 2000, for up to 6 mo to estimate survival, and describe patterns of movement and the environments they use while dispersing. The typical pattern of movement for hawks we tracked through early winter consisted of sedentary behavior in the natal area, followed by relatively long movements beginning 11-13 wk after hatching, and finally sedentary behavior again when they settled into a fall/winter home range. Distances between relocations of individual hawks were, on average, greater for females ((x) over bar = 6.8 km, range 0.02-51.7 km, SD = 9.8) than males ((x) over bar = 3.8 km, range = 0.05-20.8 km, SD = 5.4; t-test, P = 0.02). Home range size for nine hawks during their first fall/winter averaged 771 ha (SD = 403). Distance from center of home range to natal site averaged nearly twice as far for females ((x) over bar = 10.9 km, range = 4.2-19.5 km, SD = 6.4) as males ((x) over bar = 6.0 km, range = 2.2-13.3, SD = 5.0), but the difference was not significant (t-test, P = 0.23). Survival of radio-tagged hawks was 67% through 180 d. Hawks used a variety of environments prior to settling for the winter, but were found most frequently (35% of locations) in riparian areas. We found no discernable pattern of habitat selection for land use categories inside winter home ranges. We speculate that the abundance of food may facilitate survival of post-fledging, dispersing hawks in Tucson.

AB  - This study examines personal support networks in Beijing and Hong Kong, based on survey data collected in 2000. It was found that these two Chinese cities, which share a common Confucian cultural heritage, are similar in many aspects of social support. The supportive roles of spouse or partner are prominent and diffuse. Other close relatives are more involved in instrumental than emotional support. Non-kin primary ties specialize in emotional support. Neither extended kin support nor institutional support is significant. Nonetheless, the two cities differ in certain aspects of social support, reflecting their differences in such macro social-structural forces as economic modernization, urbanization and the social organization of work. Compared to the Hong Kong Chinese, the Beijing Chinese are more likely to seek support from close kin or coworkers, but less likely to rely on institutional help. Sources of support in both cities are also affected by the micro social-structural positions people occupy, particularly marital status and household income. It is noted that about 10% of the respondents in both cities reported "no one" to turn to for support. Among the various types of support, emotional comfort is the most difficult to find.

AB  - Agriculture and urban development have destroyed 95% of native brushland habitat in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas. Therefore, habitat restoration is an important issue in the LRGV. Since 1982, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been replanting areas in the LRGV to native brushland species to establish a wildlife corridor along the lower reach of the Rio Grande. Vegetation composition of a mature brushland, a replanted habitat and an unaided secondary succession site (fallow field) were examined at one locale in the LRGV in 1999. The mature brushland edge plot had the highest species richness (43) followed by the replanted edge plot (37), mature brushland interior (35), replanted interior plot (33) and fallow field interior (12) and edge (11) plots. Edge and interior plots in the same habitat were similar in species composition (mature brushland, 74%; replanted, 63%; fallow field, 70%). Community similarity was greater for mature brushland and replanted habitats (47%) than the mature brushland and fallow field (32%), or the replanted and fallow field habitats (28%)'. These data suggest that current replanting techniques used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the LRGV achieve a more diverse plant community in a shorter length of time than unaided secondary succession of fallow fields.

TI  - Critical Transport Infrastructure in Urban Areas: Impacts of Traffic Incidents Assessed Using Accessibility-Based Network Vulnerability Analysis
T2  - GROWTH AND CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - Incidents (vehicle breakdowns, crashes, roadworks, lane blockages, severe weather, etc.) are believed responsible for about 50 percent of traffic congestion in Australia's major cities, which is a similar situation to that found in cities in many other parts of the developed world. Incident-based congestion is particularly disruptive because of its random occurrence in space and time, which maximises the operational impacts of the congestion on social and economic activities. This paper discusses a method for assessing critical locations-congestion "hot spots"-in urban road networks, and the development and application of diagnostic tools that will allow urban road system managers to anticipate potential vulnerabilities to incident-related congestion and take proactive action to avoid congestion rather than react to it. The expected Outcomes are then reduced congestion, delays, and pollution; significantly improved performance from the existing urban road system; and reduced pressure to build more roads. The method involves modelling of travel demand, network topology, capacity and road geometry, the identification and assessment of impacts of traffic incidents at specific locations in a road network, and the use of accessibility impact analysis to assess system-wide effects. Accessibility impact analysis is undertaken using an accessibility framework, which can account for time of day, transport mode and destination choices by individuals, and level of traffic congestion among other factors. A case-study application to a specific (potential) incident in a real-world network indicates that the proposed method is feasible and demonstrates its power in identifying not just total impacts but the distribution of those impacts across a region or community. While Current approaches to urban road network planning and management tend to be reactive-finding cures for problems as they arise or addressing locations of recurrent congestion or bad incident record-the vulnerability analysis method described in the paper should lend itself to a proactive approach that can anticipate structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities and help to avoid or at least temper potential adverse effects, rather than to react to them afterwards.

AB  - Nature reserves not only protect habitat-stressed species but also provide recreation and welfare services to people. Therefore, site accessibility matters in reserve design. This study incorporates public accessibility, determined by urban populations and distances between urban areas and reserve sites, as an additional factor in conservation reserve design besides species representation and economic characteristics of individual sites. Ail optimization approach is introduced to determine a reserve network with maximum accessibility while satisfying specified representation targets under Financial constraints. The paper also presents an empirical application of this approach to endangered/threatened birds in Illinois, USA, and analyzes the tradeoffs between ecological, economic, and social objectives of biological conservation. The results show that: i) the conventional minimal representation approach would result in a small reserve network, but this network would have poor accessibility; ii) public accessibility can De improved significantly by selecting alternative sites with the same amount of conservation budget; iii) further improvement in accessibility can be achieved by enlarging the network, but in this particular case the gains would be insignificant after the first few additional sites; and iv) a regionally integrated conservation plan, as opposed to decentralized conservation efforts, is beneficial for both species protection and social welfare.

AB  - Globalization is best described as a complex process embodying conditions of instant communication and the rapid movement of people, goods, and ideas. Aligned with this process is a reorganization of state and society that some geographers have referred to as "rescaling"-a reconfiguration of the spatial scales at which governance occurs. The emerging landscapes of a rescaled global economy reveal not a diminishing role for the local, but rather the resurgence of place-cities-as deterritorialized centres of global control. The prominence of these command and control nodes within a global post-industrial economy is increasingly being linked to discourses of economic efficiency. Using the case of Toronto, Canada, the authors interpret changing governance structures as evidence of a rescaling process that has seen resources and responsibilities move in opposite directions, to the detriment of the quality of place in the city. Rhetorical calls for global competitiveness have led to a withering of the state's role in providing the context for the emergence of locally enriched social and cultural environments. The case of Toronto reveals a spatial paradox where changes in governance aimed at enhancing global competitiveness have actually diminished the local qualities cities depend upon to sustain such advantage. None the less, economic competitiveness and quality of place need not necessarily work in opposition, and we advance a general planning framework to balance these desires.

AB  - Many problems and challenges of ecosystem management currently are driven by the rapid pace and spatial extent of landscape change. Parks and reserves within areas of high human population density are especially challenged to meet the recreational needs of local populations and to preserve valued environmental resources. The complex problem of managing multiple objectives and multiple resources requires an enormous quantity of information, and conceptual models have been proposed as tools for organizing and interpreting this information. Academics generally prefer a bottom-up approach to model construction that emphasizes ecologic theory and process, whereas managers often use a top-down approach that takes advantage of existing information to address more pragmatic objectives. The authors propose a formal process for developing, applying, and testing conceptual models to be used in landscape monitoring that reconciles these seemingly opposing perspectives. The four-step process embraces the role of hypothesis testing in the development of models and evaluation of their utility. An example application of the process to a network of national parks in and around Washington, DC illustrates the ability of the approach to systematically identify monitoring data that would both advance ecologic theory and inform management decisions.

AB  - This study analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of 4,587 (94% of the total) confirmed dengue cases in Kaohsiung and Fengshan Cities (a two-city area) that occurred in Taiwan from 2001 to 2003. The epidemic had two simultaneous distinct diffusion patterns. One was a contiguous pattern, mostly limited to I km from an initial cluster, reflecting that there was a rapid dispersal of infected Aedes aegypti and viremic persons. The second followed a relocation pattern, involving clusters of cases that diffused over 10 weeks starting from the southern and moving to the northern parts of the two-city area. The virus from one clustering site jumped to several distant areas where it rapidly dispersed through a series of human-mosquito transmission cycles to several localities. In both patterns, transmission of disease quickly enlarged the epidemic areas. Future dengue control efforts would benefit from a timely syndromic surveillance system plus extensive public education on how to avoid further transmission.

AB  - A "quiet" revolution in architecture and urban planning has been taking place over the last decade, aiming to heal the wounds inflicted upon the landscape during the modern era. It is quiet because its practitioners are not united under a single banner and because their sensitivity to people and the environment often translates into design that does not call attention to itself Nonetheless, its impact can not be overstated. Surfacing from all corners of the globe, this transnational revolution is dramatically reshaping our physical environment, the social life that occurs in it, and the practice of urban design. In this essay, Professor Nan Ellin describes this transformation focussing on five principle qualities hybridity, connectivity, porosybity, authenticity, and vulnerability. She also examines the larger social changes in which these qualities are emerging featuring a shift towards slowness, simplicity, sincerity, spirituality, and sustainability.

AB  - Predicting native species occurrence on the urban fringe is problematic due to the high level of human disturbance. None-the-less there are many ecologically important remnant patches and other mixed habitats that support native wildlife in these areas. Urban communities also value these habitats for their existence value. Therefore it is important to have a predictive model to help inform planners on what supporting environmental conditions they need to conserve and inform decisions on how to reduce threats and sustain wildlife populations. We have found traditional statistical distribution models do not work well in these environments due to gaps in the data and accounting for irregularities from human disturbance. As a solution we use probabilistic cause-effect models to capture the relevant relationships. These models are developed as a Bayesian network to: i) deal with issues of missing data, and ii) use a model-based methodology for analysis and discovery of non-linear relationships.
   Our study is concerned with koala conservation in a coastal regional in Australian. The Redlands Shire in the state of Queensland is colloquially referred to as the Koala Coast due to the abundance of its koala populations, but these are under significant threat from urban expansion. While background disturbances from roads and urban development do represent the main threat, other controllable threat variables such as dog ownership have an impact on koala populations. A Bayesian network model has been developed to understand these relationships and threats ( Figure 1).
   Habitat conditions for koalas are relatively well understood. Preferred areas have specific eucalypt species, high soil fertility, low acidic and well drained soils. Apart from direct degradation of habitat from land clearing, the major disturbance threats to koalas are from diseases, vehicle movement and domestic pests. Studies focussed on the first two threats show that levels of urbanisation are generally a good indicator of koala population disturbance, but very little has been done on domestic animals. Next to cars, domestic dogs are the highest human-induced impact on koala mortality. Our Bayesian model separates the affects of urbanisation and dog presence to consider what management actions could be taken to reduce the threat of dog attacks.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Data was available on many of the key variables, however it was not complete. Mapping was available for vegetation and urban settlement patterns. We also obtained data on dog presence for this study for the year 2005, but recent data for the response variable was sparse. Data from koala surveys carried in 1996 to 1999 was available, but it was difficult to relate these variables because of the incongruent time periods between the koala surveys and domestic dog data. Attempts to statistically model this relationship gave very poor correlations. The decision was made to use a Bayesian network model that was initially parameterised from a subjective survey conducted with ecologists and environmental managers. The survey gave an initial network that was then trained from the available data.
   Outputs from the model show predictions of koala distributions, scenarios on effects of management actions to control dogs, and the uncertainties in predictions.

TI  - Faultline Citizenship: Ethnonational Politics, Minority Mobilisation, and Governance in the Israeli "Mixed Cities" of Haifa and Tel Aviv-Jaffa
T2  - ETHNOPOLITICS
LA  - English
AB  - Belfast, Jerusalem, Brussels, Montreal, Sarajevo and Nicosia are among the most oft-mentioned examples of ethnically divided cities, situated in a wider context of ethnonational conflict (to varying degrees of intensity). At the same time there are other cities where ethnic and cross-community tensions are significant, but which have not occupied sufficient academic interest. In the Israel/Palestine context, the cities of Tel Aviv-Jaffa and Haifa represent such cases. They both contain a minority of Israeli-Palestinians whose patterns of political mobilization and interaction with local state institutions have rarely been explored. Yet the interaction between urban governance actors and Palestinian activists in these cities reveals much about the nature of contemporary ethnopolitics in Israel/Palestine. The aim of the paper is to provide an analysis of the ways through which the different mobilization strategies of IsraeliPalestinians in these cities are shaped by altercations between local governance mechanisms, and the internal and external intricacies of ethnic movement politics. The paper develops a relational approach to the study of citizenship in ethnically polarized cities. It suggests that powerful insights into patterns of claiming citizenship can be gained by incorporating dynamic institutional approaches to local minority mobilization with the important roles of symbolic urban politics and the politics of place. The constellation of those factors provides for a rich picture of the subtleties of minority strategies and the governance of ethnically fractured cities.

AB  - Urban neighborhoods form the basic functional unit of municipalities. Socioeconomically, they consist of social networks and interlocking layers of social networks. Old, stable neighborhoods are blessed with large social networks and dense interlocking layers. Both social control and social support depend on these complex structures of tight and loose ties. Public health and public order depend on these structures. They are the basis of resilience of both the neighborhood itself and of the municipality that is composed of neighborhoods. In New York City in the 1970s and later, domain shift occurred because of the disruption of the socioeconomic structure by the massive destruction of low-rental housing. A combined epidemic of building fires and landlord abandonment of buildings leveled a huge percentage of housing in poor neighborhoods and forced mass migration between neighborhoods. Social relationships that had existed between families and individuals for decades were destroyed. Community efficacy also greatly diminished. Drug use, violent crime, tuberculosis, and low-weight births were among the many public health and public order problems that soared in incidence consequent to the unraveling of the communities. These problems spilled out into the metropolitan region of dependent suburban counties. The ability of a municipality and its dependent suburban counties to weather a disaster such as an avian flu pandemic depends on the size of social networks in its neighborhoods and on the interconnection between the social networks. Diversity such as gained by social and economic integration influences the strength of the loose ties between social networks. Poor neighborhoods with extreme resilience conferred by a dense fabric of social networks must also maintain connections with mainstream political structure or they will fail to react to both good and bad impacts and communications.

AB  - The goals of landscape planning are multiple for rural ecosystems of the resettlement area in the Hubei Province of China. They relate to the types, diversity and patterns of the ecosystems, and to the conservation of ecosystem functions and biodiversity. We were interested in the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and the promotion of the development of farmland ecosystems and natural forest ecosystems. The landscape planning took into account the conservation and the restoration of forestlands, and the reconstructions of farmlands, towns and villages. The areas of towns and villages were assigned by trade-off analysis balancing ecological, economic and social benefits. The spatial pattern of used lands was designed by a multi-criteria optimal spatial planning, resulting in the strengthening of some primary ecosystem functions. In the resettlement area forests will expand to a matrix, and cropland patches together with tree fences will form patch-corridor systems. Significant ecological, economic and social benefits can be derived from this landscape pattern.

AB  - The fish assemblage and limnological features along twelve sites from the Terri River basin (Catalonia, Spain) were sampled quarterly from August 1999 to May 2000. Twelve fish species were captured, of which four were native and eight exotic. Correspondence analysis revealed that spatial variation accounted for most of the variation (73.7%) in fish species composition. The upstream, urban area was dominated by chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with some exotic species coming from nearby Lake Banyoles, whereas Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) predominated in the rest of the Terri River. Along the longitudinal gradient, fish assemblage displayed discontinuous variation and disappearance in more polluted areas. Fish abundance was significantly correlated with summer oxygen concentration and decreased in downstream sampling sites. Species richness was higher in downstream sampling sites due to the proximity of the Ter River. Common carp size increased progressively along the course of the Terri River, whereas the pattern for the eel was the opposite, with the smallest found in downstream sampling sites and a gradual increase in size in the upper reaches. The natural zonation in the fish assemblage of the Terri River is presently altered to a high degree by habitat degradations, pollution, and dispersal of exotic species.

AB  - The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve (TRNERR) is a 2,500-acre nature preserve located at the southwestern-most corner of the United States, next to the U.S.-Mexico border. A twelve-member board-representing state, federal, and local agencies as wen as academic and nonprofit sector interests-manages the reserve. The major agencies are the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and California State Parks. It is one of twenty-five national estuarine research reserves under NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. TRNERR, is an island of natural habitat and green spaces surrounded by the vast metropolitan region of San Diego-Tijuana. It is of special interest because of the ecological and social services it offers to this large urban region. TRNERR represents some of the last remaining habitat of its type in California, where 90 percent of historical coastal wetlands have been lost to development and other factors. TRNERR is located at the terminus of a 1,750-square mile watershed, of which 70 percent is located in Mexico and the remainder in the United States. Over 370 different bird species have been sighted at the reserve, of which seven are endangered. A variety of projects and associated challenges take place at TRNERR, including restoration and education, cooperative endeavors with Mexican partners, water quality monitoring, local public outreach and education, and diverse research activities.
   River National Estuarine Reserve can be seen as an integral part of an emerging network of estuarine conservation areas along the increasingly urban southwest California coast; a network that sets an example for similar regions elsewhere in North America. As part of this initiative, a civic society is operating a center to educate a large number of school children and adults about the remaining diversity of biophysical resources in the estuary. More than 140 bird species were recorded there since 1993 and an additional thirty species were reported previously that might still visit the area from time-to-time. Similarly, San Diego has invested heavily in the creation of urban wetlands that support a diverse population of coastal birds and other wildlife (City of San Diego 2001).

AB  - Feral populations of crop species along roadsides contribute to the uncertainty regarding the containment of genetically modified (GM) crops, as the feral populations could promote the persistence of transgenes outside of cultivated fields. Roadside populations of several common crop species are known to occur far from arable fields, and the dispersal pathways that promote their recruitment in road verges are unclear. Human-aided dispersal, in particular adhesive dispersal by vehicles, has been suggested as a possible vector, but this has not yet been proven experimentally. We sampled the seed rain from vehicles inside two motorway tunnels in an urban environment to reveal the contribution of crop species to seeds unintentionally dispersed by traffic beyond agricultural production areas. Three species of arable crops, wheat Triticum aestivum, rye Secale cereale and oilseed rape Brassica napus, were among the most frequent species deposited by vehicles inside the motorway tunnels. Each of the three species was clearly more predominant in one direction of traffic. While seeds of Triticum aestivum and Secale cereale were primarily transported into the city, Brassica napus was significantly more abundant in samples from lanes leading out of the city. Seed sources in the local surroundings of the tunnels were virtually nonexistent, and the high magnitude of seed deposition combined with high seed weights suggests a dispersal mechanism different from other species in the sample, at least for Triticum aestivum and Secale cereale. This provides evidence that spillage during transport is a major driver for long-distance dispersal of crops. Our results suggest that seed dispersal by vehicles is the major driver in the recruitment of roadside populations of arable crops, providing a possible escape route for GM crops. Risk management should thus aim at curbing transport losses of GM crops.

TI  - Wartime evacuation and the spread of infectious diseases: epidemiological consequences of the dispersal of children from London during World War II
T2  - JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY

KW  - PHILIPPINES INSURRECTION
AB  - The proposal to evacuate children from the large towns and cities of the United Kingdom during World War 11 caused much concern among wartime epidemiologists and public health officials. It was anticipated that dispersal on such an unprecedented scale might result in an unusually high incidence of epidemic disease amongst the native children of the reception areas. Although studies were carried out at the time, there was no general agreement about the actual extent to which the anticipated increase in disease activity occurred. The inconclusive nature of the findings has stimulated the present paper. We explore the temporal and spatial evidence for the raised incidence of three infectious diseases (scarlet fever, diphtheria and poliomyelitis) in the wake of the evacuation from the principal city affected (London) between 1939 and 1945. In so doing, we make allowance for the masking effect of the regular, background, pattern of disease activity on the pattern of disease associated with the evacuation. Isolation of the latter pattern indicates that the evacuation resulted in (i) a raised incidence of infectious disease in the reception areas to which the London evacuees were transferred and (ii) an associated increase in the epidemiological integration of London and the reception areas. Contrary to the expectation of wartime medical officers, Poisson probability mapping shows that, in general, evacuation-associated increases in disease activity were no more pronounced in rural than urban areas of the reception counties.

AB  - Landscape structure influences the abundance and distribution of many species, including pathogens that cause infectious diseases. Black-tailed prairie dogs in the western USA have declined precipitously over the past 100 years, most recently due to grassland conversion and their susceptibility to sylvatic plague. We assembled and analyzed two long-term data sets on plague occurrence in black-tailed prairie dogs to explore the hypotheses that plague occurrence is associated with colony characteristics and landscape context. Our two study areas (Boulder County, Colorado, and Phillips County, Montana) differed markedly in degree of urbanization and other landscape characteristics. In both study areas, we found associations between plague occurrence and landscape and colony characteristics such as the amount of roads, streams and lakes surrounding a prairie dog colony, the area covered by the colony and its neighbors, and the distance to the nearest plague-positive colony. Logistic regression models were similar between the two study areas, with the best models predicting positive effects of proximity to plague-positive colonies and negative effects of road, stream and lake cover on plague occurrence. Taken together, these results suggest that roads, streams and lakes may serve as barriers to plague in black-tailed prairie dog colonies by affecting movement of or habitat quality for plague hosts or for fleas that serve as vectors for the pathogen. The similarity in plague correlates between urban and rural study areas suggests that the correlates of plague are not altered by uniquely urban stressors.

AB  - The 26-month study was carried out in 2001-2003 on a network of 15 roads (48.8 km) with different traffic volumes (350-10,500 cars day(-1)) and varying structure of the surrounding landscape in farmland of south-western Poland. A total of 862 road-killed birds were recorded. The most abundant group was made up by urban species (50.2%), followed by hedgerow specialists (30.3%), woodland birds (7.7%) and those associated with open areas (3.8%). The total shares of the three most numerous victim species (Passer domesticus, Passer montanus and Hirundo rustica) amounted to 79.3%. The mean (+/- 1 S.E.) yearly number of casualties per 100 m of road calculated for 15 roads reached 0.91 +/- 0.20 for all groups, 0.44 +/- 0.14 for urban birds, 0.28 +/- 0.07 for hedgerow specialists, 0.06 +/- 0.02 for woodland species and 0.03 +/- 0.01 for birds of open areas. For the three commonest species the values were as follows: P. domesticus 0.40 +/- 1.37, H. rustica 0.07 +/- 0.03 and R montanus 0.13 +/- 0.05. A disproportionately high mortality was recorded near tree belts, hedgerows and built-up areas, while it was much lower in open farmland. Traffic volume had a clear negative impact on the mortality of P. domesticus and woodland species. In order to limit the losses among birds due to vehicle traffic the spontaneous bushy vegetation should be removed from the immediate road vicinity. New hedgerows should be made "safe" for wildlife by planting them further away from the roads, i.e., along dirt roads, watercourses and ditches. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In coastal southern California, natural riparian corridors occur in a landscape mosaic comprised of human land uses (mainly urban and suburban development) interspersed among undeveloped areas, primarily native shrublands. We asked, does the composition of the landscape surrounding a riparian survey point influence plant species distribution, community composition, or habitat structure? We expected, for example, that invasive non-native species might be more abundant as the amount of surrounding urbanization increased. We surveyed 137 points in riparian vegetation in Orange County, California, along an urbanization gradient. Using logistic regression we analyzed 79 individual plant species' distributions, finding 20 negatively associated and 12 positively associated with the amount of development within a 1-km radius around the survey points, even after accounting for the effects of elevation. However, after summarizing plant community composition with Detrended Correspondence Analysis we observed that, overall, community composition was not statistically correlated with the amount of development surrounding a survey point once the association between development and elevation was taken into account. Non-native species were not particularly associated with increasing development, but instead were distributed throughout vegetation and urbanization gradients. However, the extent of the tree and herb layers (structural attributes) was associated with development, with the tree layer increasing and the herb layer decreasing as urbanization increased. Thus, although the degree of surrounding urbanization appears to influence the distribution of a number of individual plant species, overall composition of the community in our study system seemed relatively unaffected. Instead, we suggest that community composition reflected larger-scale environmental conditions, such as stream order and other variables associated with elevation, and/or regional-scale disturbances, such as historic grazing or enhanced atmospheric deposition of nitrogen.

AB  - Spatial patterns of the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) population density was analysed in the cities of Bern and Brussels in order to explore its spatial population dynamics. The surveys were carried out in Bern in 1998 and 2000 and in Brussels in 2001 to assess population density in relation to local characteristics. In Brussels, population density was also measured using pheromone traps distributed over the city and collected twice per moth generation. A quantitative relationship was found between local population density ( measured by pheromone traps and survey observations) and the amount of leaves left on the ground the previous fall. Several other factors were related to observed infestation levels: the occurrence of the pathogen Guignardia aesculi was inversely related to infestation by C. ohridella in Bern in 1998 and 2000, the number of horse chestnut trees within 800 m distance was positively related to infestation level in Bern in 2000, and the proportion of green areas within 100 m and the number of other horse chestnut trees within 2000 m were positively related to infestation levels in the 2001 Brussels survey. The pattern of infestation levels as a function of distance to potential population reservoirs suggested that C. ohridella re-invades areas where overwintering leaves have been cleaned from refuge areas such as parks or urban forests. Our results indicate that the removal of leaves is a feasible first aid control measure to reduce moth population densities. However, leaf removal may not reduce moth densities when done improperly. In places where proper leaf removal is not feasible, other control measures are needed.

AB  - California valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee) is a seriously threatened endemic oak species in California and a keystone species for foothill oak ecosystems. Urban and agricultural development affects a significant fraction of the species' range and predicted climate change is likely to dislocate many current populations. Here, we explore spatial patterns of multivariate genotypes and genetic diversity throughout the range of valley oak to determine whether ongoing and future patterns of habitat loss could threaten the evolutionary potential of the species by eradicating populations of distinctive genetic composition. This manuscript will address three specific questions: (i) What is the spatial genetic structure of the chloroplast and nuclear genetic markers? (ii) What are the geographical trends in the distribution of chloroplast and nuclear genotypes? (iii) Is there any part of the species' range where allelic diversity in either the chloroplast or nuclear genomes is particularly high? We analysed six chloroplast and seven nuclear microsatellite genetic markers of individuals widespread across the valley oak range. We then used a multivariate approach correlating genetic markers and geographical variables through a canonical trend surface analysis, followed by GIS mapping of the significant axes. We visualized population allelic richness spatially with GIS tools to identify regions of high diversity. Our findings, based on the distribution of multivariate genotypes and allelic richness, identify areas with distinctive histories and genetic composition that should be given priority in reserve network design, especially because these areas also overlap with landscape change and little degree of protection. Thus, without a careful preservation plan, valuable evolutionary information will be lost for valley oak.

AB  - In this work, we examined all the plots of land which appeared by the "No shantytown Program and Urban plots of land", evaluating the high and low articulation level of these plots of land with the Presidente Prudente's urban area. We watched out the occurrence and the level of sociospacial segregation, After that, we observed the level of integration among the people who live in the plots of land and the rest of the city, as well as, the grade of access that they have from the public consumption resources. We concluded that the spacial production and, specially, the no-continuing production of the urban areas, help the construction of the socio-spacial segregation. It's is remarkable, when we realized the differences of accessing the city related to the plots of land already studied. At Parque Shiraiwa, a plot of land which is located in a region where there are developed plots of land, we watched that the people who live there, have a great level of consumption. However, in some cases from Conjunto Brasil Novo and, mainly, from Jardim Morada do Sol, we checked how the implantation of the housing settlements in certain areas far from the city cause a low spacial movement, creating for this reason, urban areas determined by clear conditions of sociospacial segregation.

AB  - The Columbia Bottomlands, a Southern floodplain forest formation on the upper Texas coast, historically covered over 283,000 ha but has since been reduced to 25% of its former extent. The importance of this regional ecosystem as critical stopover and staging habitat for Nearctic-Neotropical migratory landbirds gave rise to the Columbia Bottomlands Conservation Plan, an active land acquisition and conservation program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its governmental and non-governmental partners. The Plan seeks to establish an integrated network of protected tracts as representative examples of the regional landscape, and thus conserve ecosystem integrity, function, heterogeneity, and biological diversity. We describe the Conservation Plan and its progress to date, and we summarize data on the plant composition of a typical preserved tract. Vegetation sampling at the Dance Bayou Unit, a mature forest remnant, revealed a mosaic of species composition across habitats varying in microtopography, soil type, and flooding pattern. The Dance Bayou study is a formative step in developing guidelines for future plant inventories, for site characterization in aid of land acquisition, and for restoration targets. As threats from urban development accelerate, intensified efforts may be needed to reach the Conservation Plan goal of protecting 10% of the original ecosystem extent.

AB  - Informal or incidental learning in recreational parks has been rarely assessed, although most city-dwellers enjoy and appreciate wildlife in their day-to-day lives. Incidental or informal learning is non-intentional and grows out of spontaneous situations and is mostly self-directed. Here, we focus on the informal setting of a small urban park in Ludwigsburg (Germany) as a source of incidental learning. Two hundred and forty-eight visitors were interviewed at the park using a questionnaire, and 102 other people (non-visitors) acted as a control group. Park visitors scored significantly better in their knowledge of animal species compared with our control group. Species knowledge increased with age, with number of park visits, and with educational level. Using the number of species visitors had previously seen at the park, we found a significant influence of educational level, park visiting frequency, and of park use. Ninety-seven percent of participants responded with positive attitudes towards animals, and most animals were detected by their movement, rather than by their sound or coloration.

AB  - A certain number of signs permits to think that a new movement of agricultural colonization is to occur in the state of Amapa, nothern Brazil. We thus try to produce an objective constatation on the presence of eventual deforestation zones, using a set of ERS images in multi-temporal combinations. These are actually an effective way of detecting any change in the cover of primary forest.
   Not constating any large scale movement of colonization, we then experiment the same method of study on the state capital, the city of Macapa. As we can observe an important growth of the urban area, we can deduce that an important share of the people that are coming to Amapa are attired by the city more than by rural zones.

AB  - Discussions of the intranational migration of sexual dissidents have focused on rural-to-urban movement, and have largely conceptualized 'queer migration' through a symbolic rural-urban binary, consequently normalizing rural-to-urban displacement while eliding the real diversity of queer relocations. There is also a strong suggestion of teleological and ontological finality in the normalization of rural-to-urban relocation narratives, intimating a once-and-for-all emergence from the rural 'closet'. To elicit greater complexity, I suggest that the explanatory scale of queer migration should be downsized from fixed rural-urban contrasts to the actual movement of the queer body through space. To this end I rethink 'queer migration' as an 'embodied queer identity quest', suggesting that while 'coming out' often underpins relocation decisions, the personal, embodied and individualistic nature of this experience generates movement on a variety of paths and scales. Arguably most important among these are peripatetic migrations, which most tellingly counter the teleology of rural-to-urban models. Moreover, in evoking embodied displacements predicated on 'coming out, I seek to contemplate the possible affects of bodily sexual desires in shaping the contours of queer migration.

AB  - The distribution of Aedes.aegypti (L) (Diptera: Culicidae) oviposition in Buenos Aires City is spatially heterogeneous. Oviposition activity was monitored for a year with a grid of 279 traps at 850-m intervals that were serviced weekly. Geostatistics were used for the spatial analysis and generalized linear regression to model oviposition as a function of demographic and environmental variables. The proportion of weeks infested and the total number of eggs showed spatial continuity and were higher in areas that had higher densities of houses and were closer to industrial sites; they were lower in areas with higher human populations or higher densities of flats. When all sites were considered, the spatial structure showed a strong trend, but after regression, the residuals presented lower spatial dependence. When only infested sites were considered, the oviposition variables were spatially autocorrelated and the regression residuals showed little or no spatial dependence. The spatial pattern of Ae. aegypti oviposition in a highly urbanized city such as Buenos Aires seems to be related to the urbanization gradient. These urban environments might present different resource availability or continuity between patches of resources.

AB  - Invasion of natural ecosystems by exotic species is a major threat to biodiversity globally. We assessed two alternative (but not exclusive) hypotheses to explain the success of exotic species in urban bushland on low fertility sandstone-derived soils in Sydney, Australia. These were that success of exotic species is promoted by: (1) plant attributes in particular disturbance types; and (2) freedom from herbivores. We tested these at sites subject to different types of disturbance: nutrient and water enrichment (below stormwater outlets), nutrient enrichment (riparian zones of creeks with an urban catchment) and physical disturbance (tracks), and control sites. At each site we estimated percentage cover of all species and surveyed leaves for damage by herbivores. Species were classified as native, non-invasive exotic or invasive exotic. We found that sites without any disturbance did not support exotic plants. Physically disturbed sites on low fertility soils supported only one exotic species, suggesting that nutrient enrichment is a critical prerequisite for exotic species invasion on low fertility soils. Exotic species cover was highest and native species richness most reduced in areas of highest nutrient enrichment. Both invasive exotic and non-invasive exotic species had significantly lower levels of leaf herbivory than native species, implying that release from pests alone cannot account for the success of invasive species. Specific leaf area of invasive exotic species was consistently higher than specific leaf area of non-invasive exotic and native species, regardless of disturbance type. In physically disturbed sites of higher soil fertility, exotic species were small herbs and grasses of long flowering duration and with small unassisted or wind-dispersed seeds. In sites subject to nutrient-enrichment, exotic species were more likely to be climbers, able to propagate vegetatively, and with seeds dispersed by vertebrates. Thus different plant attributes contribute to exotic species success under different disturbance types. The clearest consistent difference we found between invasive exotic and non-invasive exotic species was in specific leaf area, suggesting that large specific leaf area facilitates invasiveness.

AB  - The European Directive on urban wastewater treatment voted in 1991, compelled industries to deal with their wastewater As a result, highways companies had to dig stormwater detention ponds alongside roads mainly in order to catch and treat road runoff. These stormwater ponds were quickly and largely colonised by aquatic organisms while they were only designed for a technical purpose. But if many of them have been dug all over Europe, their use by wildlife remains poorly studied.
   This article aims at taking stock of the role of highway stormwater detention ponds for biodiversity by (i) reviewing the knowledge on the chemical contamination found into it and (ii) addressing the problem of the use of these stormwater ponds by wildlife. The discussion is based on a survey conducted during one year (2002 - 2003) on six highway stormwater detention ponds situated in south-eastern France.

AB  - The North American environmental movement has historically sought to redress the depletion and degradation of natural resources that has been the legacy of the industrial revolution. Predominant in this approach has been the preservation of wilderness, conservation of species biodiversity and the restoration of natural ecosystems. While the results of such activity have often been commendable, several scholars have pointed out that the environmental movement has inherited an unfortunate bias against urban environments, and consequently, a blind spot to ways in which densely populated built spaces can serve to enhance rather than degrade efforts to achieve sustainability. After exploring this concern we argue that environmental architecture can serve as a counter-balance to this bias, focused, as it is, on the ways in which the construction and organisation of built spaces for humans can help or hinder the pursuit of environmental priorities. But if environmental architecture is to take this role then it must be understood in a broader context, one which does not exclude other moral, political and aesthetic values in the production of human environments. We will highlight several examples of how environmental architecture has combined success and failure at taking a broader view of environmental questions, with a specific focus on one green skyscraper that may be good for the natural environment but not necessarily for the human environment of the city.

AB  - Conservation organizations and public agencies are interested in identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation action, often acquisition or easements. Typically, this requires the use of uncertain data and vaguely defined decision criteria. I developed a decision support system to address these uncertainty issues and assist in evaluating conservation opportunities for the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in Santa Barbara, California. Functionally defined planning units were used to aggregate data on land suitability, land cover change, salamander presence, and movement risk along potential linkages between breeding ponds. I used a fuzzy-logic-based inference engine to evaluate the planning units and rank the relative suitability of interpond linkages for conservation action. The sensitivity of the rankings was considered with respect to uncertainty in salamander occurrence data and the relationship between land-cover-change threats and site suitability. All linkages were substantially degraded, but five areas were consistently identified with high relative suitability for conservation action despite differences in assumptions and uncertainty in biological data. The combination of functionally defined planning units and a fuzzy-logic-based decision support system provides a general framework for considering the suitability of sites for conservation action.

AB  - Aim To determine whether invasive and locally abundant non-native species have a more homogenizing effect on plant communities than non-invasive and less abundant non-native species.
   Location California and Florida counties, conservation areas in the USA, and eight US cities.
   Methods Species lists among counties, conservation areas and cities were compared to see whether invasive and abundant non-native species increased the Jaccard index of similarity between localities beyond any increases caused by non-invasive and less abundant non-native species.
   Results For all comparisons, we found that invasive non-native species have a significantly greater homogenizing effect than non-invasive non-native species. For the US conservation areas, we found that locally abundant invasive species tend to be more widespread and more widely shared than less abundant invasive species. There is also a positive relationship between homogenization by invasive species and the magnitude of human disturbance.
   Main conclusions Invasive non-native species tend to be disproportionately shared among communities relative to non-invasive non-native species. This effect is enhanced by human disturbance, as measured by the ratio of non-native to native species. There is a synergism between abundance and geographical range which enhances the homogenizing effects of abundant species. Invasive species, with wide ecological niches, are more widely shared among communities and more locally abundant. Abundant invasive species are thus more spatially homogenizing, and more ecologically dominant (functionally homogenizing). Also, 'perceived homogenization' is probably greater than homogenization measured by the increase in shared species. The abundant species typically seen by the casual observer in a biological community are probably more commonly shared between communities than less common species. Studies that lack abundance data and measure homogenization only on the basis of shared species, which includes most homogenization studies to date, probably underestimate the homogenizing impacts of non-native species as perceived by people.

AB  - In course of our survey of aquatic vegetation, 49 species (Table 1) in three different man-modified waterbodies - two altered river-arms of the Danube river and one seepage canal - in the area of Bratislava city were evaluated in 2000-2001. The greatest impact on the richness of species diversity was caused by the loss of connectivity with the Danube river system. A continuous type of macrophyte distribution prevailed in the canalised bed. Timing of flood disturbances and historical genesis of the habitats have reflected in proportion of growth forms. The submersed hydrophytes dominated in the most recently created aquatic habitat, alternating with the local patches of acro-pleustophytes. The higher presence of floating leaf rhizophytes was recorded in more advanced successive stages. To retard the process of succession towards the terrestrial ecosystem, future management should consider the restoration of flow conditions in analysed habitats.

AB  - While several studies have demonstrated that roads can act as barriers to small mammal movement, the relationship between road density and small mammal abundance has not yet been investigated. In southeastern Ontario, Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mice) suffer high over-winter mortality rates, resulting in small springtime populations and frequent local extinctions. Peromyscus leucopus movement is known to be inhibited by roads, which should result in lower rates of immigration into and recolonization of habitats in landscapes with high road density. We tested two predictions: (1) Forest sites situated in landscapes with high road densities have a higher chance of P. leucopus being absent during the early spring than forest sites situated in landscapes with low road densities and (2) P. leucopus populations during the summer are smaller in forest sites situated in landscapes with high road densities than in landscapes with low road densities. We sampled P. leucopus in focal patches within nineteen landscapes (7 rural, low-road-density landscapes; 7 rural, high-road-density landscapes; 5 urban landscapes). There was no significant relationship between road density and the presence/absence of P. leucopus during the early spring. We found a significant positive effect of road density on P. leucopus relative abundance during the summer, even when we excluded the urban landscapes and based the analysis on only the 14 rural landscapes. Our results suggest that any negative effect of roads on P. leucopus populations, created by their inhibition to moving across roads, is far outweighed by some positive effect of roads on P. leucopus abundance. We suggest that the two most likely explanations are that roads are positively correlated with an important as-yet-undetermined component of habitat quality, or that roads positively affect P. leucopus by negatively affecting their predators.

AB  - A survey of stream fish communities was conducted in the upper Des Plaines River watershed in Illinois and Wisconsin to determine the distribution of fish species and to evaluate the effects of tributary spatial position, urbanization, and multiple low-head dams on fish species diversity and species composition. Forty-eight sites upstream of Salt Creek in Illinois to the headwaters in Wisconsin were surveyed between 2002 and 2004. We found that fish species diversity decreased as agricultural land was replaced by urban land. In addition, tributary position within the drainage network caused significant differences in fish species diversity; specifically, We found significantly less fish species diversity in main-stem tributary streams located lower in the drainage network than in similarly sized streams located in the headwaters of the drainage area. Fish species composition. determined by multivariate principal components analysis, also showed significant differences among stream position within the drainage network. Increases in urbanization did not have a significant effect on fish species diversity within undammed tributary sites, but it did have a strong influence on fish species composition. Hence. as urbanization increased in these undammed tributaries, the fish species composition changed from coolwater-riverine specialist to warmwater-riverine generalist assemblages. In contrast, for tributary streams with low-head dams, the presence of dams had a greater effect on fish species composition than urbanization. In addition, the presence of multiple low-head dams on the main stem had a cumulative detrimental effect on fish species diversity, which decreased along an upstream-to-downstream gradient. Consequently, it is important to consider tributary spatial position within the drainage network, the amount of urbanization, and the number and locations of darns when characterizing the structure of warmwater fish communities. especially in relation to the development of restoration plans in highly urbanized or urbanizing watersheds.

AB  - The process of globalization is well established and its positive effects touted by most nations. Less well known are its effects on Populations negatively affected by the movement of capital and goods from rich to less rich countries and groups of people from poor to wealthy nations. After first discussing the effects of globalization on migratory patterns, this paper then examines, briefly, the mental health effects on the groups compelled to leave their native lands. These groups historically have crowded into cities and those cities become prey to developers less interested in rational planning than in providing profitable areas for local and foreign investments. As these migrations occur, they result in significant increases in diversity and, often, conflict between the hosts and the newly arrived groups. The paper then describes some techniques for ameliorating these conflicts through an understanding and application of cross-cultural training approaches. While these techniques have never been applied on the massive scale that might be required, in principle they Should have positive Outcomes. The paper argues that the coming migratory disasters as a result of globalization require that nations develop and deploy mechanisms that will mitigate the most negative of the likely outcomes.

AB  - There is little consensus on where and how employment is decentralising in metropolitan areas. However, a number of key processes have been brought to light, and different cities have tended to display different processes: strong CBDs, suburban polynucleation, job dispersal, scattering, edgeless cities and perhaps 'keno capitalism'. This paper explores the distribution and growth of employment at a fine spatial scale. It is shown that, at this scale, there are very dynamic processes of growth and decline throughout metropolitan areas, but that these processes are organised at a wider scale by stable employment centres and by links between these centres. The structures and processes thus revealed suggest that the spatial economy of metropolitan areas should be approached as a chaotic system. From an empirical perspective, this means that, depending on the scale of analysis and the way data are considered, polynucleation, dispersal and chaos are all observed: this may partly explain the lack of consensus in the literature. The only process not evident within Canadian cities is scattering, but this process may in fact be occurring within some areas identified as suburban employment zones.

TI  - The Internationalization of the City Beautiful
T2  - INTERNATIONAL PLANNING STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - While the international dimension of the British garden city movement has been well documented, the global reach of American-style 'city beautiful' ideas has been more understated. The reasons lie partly in the ethnocentricity of the dominant American literature. What is generally missing is a broader appreciation of the worldwide move towards civic art at the turn of the twentieth century characterized by a diversity of approaches, exchanges, contestations and cultural expressions. This paper addresses this lacuna. In particular, it draws upon the experiences of Anglophone nations where notions of the city beautiful were shaped by a distinctive cultural mix of indigenous and imported ideas not always directly and unproblematically tied to the American scene.

TI  - Understanding the movement of goods, not people: Issues, evidence and potential
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The movement of goods or freight occurs in every urban area. However, such movements have not received the same level of attention as that given to the movements of people. We do not understand the effects of several massive changes affecting urban freight movements. This paper presents a comparative review of planning studies of the movement of goods in order to assess our current understanding and to provide a context for a research agenda on the movement of urban goods. The studies reviewed provide basic data such as time of day activity, trip and vehicle characteristics. However, they do not provide an understanding of the key relationships that underlie the movement of goods, including those related to land use/transport interaction. Basic research into an integrated modelling effort for urban goods movement (UGM) is needed to address issues associated with congestion and air quality that affect most major urban centres.

AB  - To save lives immediately after a catastrophic earthquake occurs, it is essential for an urban transportation system to retain its functional performance in order to carry injured people to hospitals. Recent seismic assessment studies have mostly been based on cost-benefit analyses, carried out in monetary terms that are reasonable for long-term considerations. However, many problems of seismic risk management still remain. For example, attributing a monetary value to a human life is considered impossible. Also, requirements for functioning of a transportation system are different in the period immediately after an earthquake. This paper concentrates on how to assess the importance of an urban transportation system as it relates to saving human life, and what system enhancements should be made to improve performance.
   This paper proposes a risk assessment method for the functional reliability of a transportation system immediately after an earthquake. In that period, system malfunction adversely affects the saving of lives as a result of time delays when moving injured people to medical facilities. A system dynamics simulation of transporting injured people is incorporated in the method, which uses two assessment approaches to evaluate the differences of cumulative injured people who receive medical care. In deciding on the destination of medical facility in the simulation, two ways of deciding are addressed; one uses information only on the road network, and the other uses information on both road network and hospital availability. Results of an application to an actual target area show the most vulnerable road links and differences of the two decision-making processes. A way to mitigate the loss due to damage to road links is examined. The paper also summarizes future developments in advanced information technology for emergency transportation systems.

AB  - Habitat remnants in urbanized areas typically conserve biodiversity and serve the recreation and urban open-space needs of human populations. Nevertheless, these goals can be in conflict if human activity negatively affects wildlife. Hence, when considering habitat remnants as conservation refuges it is crucial to understand how human activities and land uses affect wildlife use of those and adjacent areas. We used tracking data (animal tracks and den or bed sites) on 10 animal species and information on human activity and environmental factors associated with anthropogenic disturbance in 12 habitat fragments across San Diego County, California, to examine the relationships among habitat fragment characteristics, human activity, and wildlife presence. There were no significant correlations of species presence and abundance with percent plant cover for all species or with different land-use intensities for all species, except the opossum (Didelphis virginiana), which preferred areas with intensive development. Woodrats (Neotoma spp.) and cougars (Puma concolor) were associated significantly and positively and significantly and negatively, respectively, with the presence and prominence of utilities. Woodrats were also negatively associated with the presence of horses. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and coyotes (Canis latrans) were associated significantly and negatively and significantly and positively, respectively, with plant bulk and permanence. Cougars and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) were negatively associated with the presence of roads. Roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) were positively associated with litter. The only species that had no significant correlations with any of the environmental variables were black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Bobcat tracks were observed more often than gray foxes in the study area and bobcats correlated significantly only with water availability, contrasting with results from other studies. Our results appear to indicate that maintenance of habitat fragments in urban areas is of conservation benefit to some animal species, despite human activity and disturbance, as long as the fragments are large.

AB  - Selection of natal dens and diurnal shelters by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) was investigated within the metropolitan area of Melbourne. Of 72 natal dens, 61% were in residential, public park, school or industrial lands. Most dens were beneath buildings (44.4%) or in earth banks (30.6%). The habitat categories in which dens were sited did not differ significantly from those described for London. Dens were more common beneath weatherboard buildings and were associated with properties that did not contain domestic dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris). Diurnal shelter positions for 20 radio-collared foxes were obtained, and home-range data collected for 11 foxes. Estimated areas of adult home-range, for 100% minimum convex polygons (MCPs), varied between 11.5 and 45.8 ha, with from two to five diurnal shelter sites used in each home-range. Foxes showed a consistent preference for diurnal shelters associated with exotic weed infestations over ornamental and native vegetation or built habitats. Within these categories a diversity of substrates were used, including buildings, drains, graves, cypress trees, ornamental rockeries and garden beds. A preference for exotic weed infestations is an identifiable resource requirement for foxes in Melbourne and its removal may assist in reducing the abundance of urban foxes.

AB  - The Japanese Archipelago (land area: 377 880 km 2) extends over a distance of c. 2000 kin, with a maximum width of 300 km. Geologically, it is a young and tectonically very active area. Japan is a mountainous, wet and forested country, with its people concentrated in densely populated urban areas along the coast and on alluvial plains. Rivers are short (max. length: 370 km), steep, and exhibit flashy flow regimes. The river regime coefficient ranges from 200 to 400, which is up to an order-of-magnitude, higher than that of most continental rivers. Japan has a rich freshwater fauna and flora with a high proportion of endemic species. A distinct latitudinal gradient (subarctic to subtropical climate) in combination with the radial character of the river network results in high spatial differentiation of the freshwater fauna.
   While water quality has improved remarkably during the past decades, Japanese rivers are still heavily impacted by canalization. loss of most dynamic flood plains, flow regulation, invasion by exotic species, and intensive urbanization. Currently 49% of the entire human population concentrates on 14% of the land, and the annual flood damage is the highest worldwide. As a consequence, major recent restoration initiatives aim to protect people and property against floods as well as simultaneously improving the ecological integrity of river ecosystems.

TI  - Squatters in the creative city: Rejoinder to Justus Uitermark
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - A recent change in attitude of politicians and officials in Amsterdam towards artists who use squatted workspaces does not entail co-optation of squatters as providers of cultural services. The municipal Breeding Places Amsterdam (BPA) project is a continuation of the long-standing tendency to legalize squats, but now motivated in terms of the artists' function for the city. There are no indications that recent legalizations have an effect that is different from earlier legalizations. They did not cause the squatters' movement to shift from waging a housing struggle towards creative expression, nor did they affect the core business of the movement: squatting. Internal conflicts, the use of legal procedure instead of political arguments and highly differentiated outcomes for individual squatters are not specific to the recent era of squatting. Some squatters are now trying to play their cards in a way that is compatible with the hype of the creative city. This illustrates the resilience of the prevailing pattern of 'flexible institionalization'. Flexibility and diversity may well be characteristics that have enabled the squatters' movement to survive under increasingly adverse conditions.

AB  - We evaluated the success of an Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) translocation program which released, by backing, 143 juveniles into the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota area from 1984-95. All of the released, and 80% of 194 wild-fledged birds, were handed and color-marked as nestlings. The first nesting attempt Occurred in 1986 and the first successful nest was in 1988. By the end of the 2000 nesting season, we had documented 131 nesting attempts, 90 (69%) of which were successful. The greatest number of occupied sites in any year (19) was in 2000, while the most productive sites documented ill any year (13) was in 1999. From 1987-2000, 194 wild-fledged chicks were produced in the Twin Cities area. Mean number of young fledged per occupied nest during this period was 1.57 (range = 0-2.3) and mean number of young fledged per Successful nest was 2.17 (range = 1-2.7). Overall nest success was 69% with a small number of sites and individuals responsible for a disproportionate number of fledglings. Released birds were more likely to return to nest than wild-fledged birds, and more males than females returned to nest. Mean female dispersal distance (384 km) was greater than that of males (27 km). We conclude that this translocation was successful and with proper management this population will remain stable or continue to grow.

AB  - The appropriation of seashores is a recent phenomenon in the history of coastal settlements. This resulted from specific interest of the seaboard for bathing purposes, not the previous cultural pattern. Summer time visitors are invariably rooted to close-by cities, where they live and where their economic activities are concentrated. For bathing purposes, beaches are mainly being occupied with secondary residences, for temporary uses. This creates the long, but thin, stretch of longitudinal urban occupation found along most of the shore line. In the state of Parana beaches started being used for bathing purposes during the 1920s, but only thoroughly developed thirty years later. This was done through an intense process of appropriations that completely dominated the seashores at south of Paranagua Bay. As a result, coastal erosion took place, courses of water were jeopardized, the landscape was destroyed, and fishing colonies were expelled; not to mention urban problems such as unorganized streets network and settlements of poor environmental quality. The following article presents the occupation process of the part of Parana's seashore that was shaped by the bathing use of beaches, the resulting urban configuration of the adopted model, and the resulting damage and problems. In addition, this article explores rules and regulations established since the 1980s seeking to control the occupation of beach bathing space through state legislation, versus the subordinate district legislation -an unusual situation in the Brazilian seashore public management.

AB  - Data for the United Kingdom (UK) Manchester Butterfly Atlas produced conflicting species loss rates for increased urban development. In particular, a very low rate of loss was recorded (0.19 species for every 10% increase in urban cover) for the Mersey Valley mapped at a high resolution of 1 ha units. It was suggested that sampling artefacts (uneven recording) or failure to distinguish vagrant individuals from breeding populations cause this. Herein, results are reported for 30 sample squares, within the Mersey Valley, surveyed uniformly throughout 1999. It is shown that loss rates are as high as areas mapped at lower resolution over wider areas (0.67-0.68 species for every 10% increase in urban cover) and that increasingly stringent definitions of urban cover result in higher loss rates. Comparison with the data from the Atlas, but for the same 30 sample squares, indicate that the low rates at a fine scale for the complete Atlas data are more likely to be caused by uneven recording than from failure to record species status. However, progressive sampling of squares, despite uniform recording, will inevitably cause a reduction in loss rates of total species for increases in urban development.

AB  - Local abundance of animals with aquatic and terrestrial life stages may be useful to determine criteria for protective buffers around wetlands. Maiden flights and daily commutes of adult Odonata (damselflies, dragonflies) occur between wetland breeding area and adjacent upland habitat used for foraging, maturation, and nocturnal roosting. We measured abundance of dragonflies adjacent to a wetland in Mississippi, USA to determine if abundance varied with distance from water. Sexually mature males and combined females/prereproductive adult males (females-immatures) were recorded 10-160 in from the littoral edge of a 185 ha shallow reservoir. The number of dragonflies was dominated by Celithemis eponina throughout the study period. Mean abundance did not change with distance from water out to 160 m, both for all species combined and for each of three dominant species. In the assemblage, mature males outnumbered females-immatures in the 10-40 in distance, whereas the reverse occurred in the 130-160 m distance. At the species-level, there was a mixed response in the mature male: female-immature ratio, with little resemblance to the assemblage pattern. Results of this study suggest that wide buffer zones around wetlands may be essential to protect Odonata assemblages, especially females and sexually immature adults. Furthermore, odonate flight behavior may serve as a useful bio-criterion to determine the width of ecologically significant wetland buffers.

AB  - Since 1979, the scenic road movement in Taiwan has promoted the conservation of and connections between landscapes of particular natural, ecological, and cultural value. Scenic road segments have been designated in national and regional comprehensive plans. Alteration or improvement of these segments including their adjacent landscapes must maintain their visual quality. However, due to the lack of established practices to plan and manage designated scenic road segments, the visual quality of many of these road corridors have been negatively impacted. These impacts have been resulted from recent changes in both roads and adjacent land uses regarding urban sprawl and increased traffic demand. In this study, a systematic evaluation framework is established for reassessing and rating existing scenic road segments. This framework incorporates both a landscape quality assessment and a recreational quality assessment. Landform, land-cover, land-use, vegetative cover, etc., are used to define landscape assessment units within each road segment. Thus the diversity of landscapes in the same road segment can be considered. The evaluation scores are used to examine whether existing scenic road segments are qualified to be a national level scenic road or potential scenic road. This holistic and systematic scenic road system can be used to better guide future road and adjacent land-use developments. The evaluation framework is reviewed by experts in the fields of scenic roads and public officials involved with scenic road designations and management. The Taiwanese experience provides a model for conserving landscapes along road corridors in other countries with regions facing development pressure.

AB  - Remote sensing of urban land surface temperatures (LST) has been conducted based largely on pixel-by-pixel correlation with land use and land cover (LULC) types. Few studies have examined the spatial variations of LST within land use zoning polygons, in spite of its significance on the knowledge of environmental implications or planning practices. This study aimed to analyze the spatial patterns of LSTs and to explore factors contributing to the LST variations in the city of Indianapolis. Four Terra's ASTER images, representing distinct seasons, were used in conjunction with other types of spatial data for the analysis. The potential factors were grouped into the categories of LULC composition, biophysical conditions, intensity of human activities, and landscape pattern. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relative importance of each group of the variables. Moreover, the spatia variations of LST were examined at both the residential and general zoning levels, so that the environmental effect of urban planning on LST may be assessed. By analyzing the mean and standard deviation values of normalized LSTs, the seasonal dynamics of LST were finally studied. Results show that the biophysical variables were most significant in explaining the spatial variations of LST. At both zoning levels, LST possessed a weaker relationship with the LULC compositions than with the biophysical variables. Principal component analysis further indicates that the cumulative variance was always larger in residential zoning, implying that the factors contributing to the LST variations in general zoning might be more complex than those for the residential zoning. An interesting finding of this study was in the relationship between LST and the landscape metrics of zoning polygons. It suggests that smaller residential zoning polygons were associated with larger temperature variations, and that the more complex in shape a residential zoning category was, the more intrapolygon variation of LST tended to be. These correlations, however, did not exist in the nonresidential zoning categories. The spatial pattern of LST in Indianapolis may be characterized as concentric in the central part of the city, a hot ring along the Highway 465, and several hot corridors along the radial highways outward to the countryside. The seasonal fluctuation of LST was weak in the central part, but increased towards the countryside. Due to the amount of anthropogenic heat, land use zones with less human activities were found to have a strong seasonal variability, whereas the zones with intensive human activities fluctuated less in LST.

AB  - Although studies often report that densities of many forest birds are negatively related to urbanization, the mechanisms guiding this pattern are poorly understood. Our objective was to use a population simulation to examine the relative influence of six demographic and behavioral processes on patterns of avian abundance in urbanizing landscapes. We constructed an individual-based population simulation model representing the annual cycle of a Neotropical migratory songbird. Each simulation was performed under two landscape scenarios. The first scenario had similar proportions of high- and low-quality habitat across the urban to rural gradient. Under the first scenario, avian density was negatively related to urbanization only when rural habitats were perceived to be of higher quality than they actually were. The second landscape scenario had declining proportions of high-quality habitat as urbanization increased. Under the second scenario, each mechanism generated a negative relationship between density and urbanization. The strongest effect on density resulted when birds preferentially selected habitats in landscapes from which they fledged or were constrained from dispersing. The next strongest patterns occurred when birds directly evaluated habitat quality and accurately selected the highest-quality available territories. When birds selected habitats based on the presence of conspecifics, the density-urbanization relationship was only one-third the strength of other habitat selection mechanisms and only occurred under certain levels of population survival. Although differences in adult or nest survival in the face of random habitat selection still elicited reduced densities in urban landscapes, the relationships between urbanization and density were weaker than those produced by the conspecific attraction mechanism. Results from our study identify key predictions and areas for future research, including assessing habitat quality in urban and rural areas in order to determine if habitats in urban areas are underutilized.

AB  - Recent withdrawal of the US. military from the Republic of Panama has exposed 64,000 ha of lowland forest in the former Canal Zone to possible development. The forests form a 16-km-wide strip reaching 65 km from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean and function as the water supply for the canal and as home to one of the world's richest terrestrial biotas. We present an overview of the distribution of bird diversity in the forests of the canal area based on 10 years of inventories. A total of 498 terrestrial species has been recorded, of which 177 occur only in lowland forests. More species reside in Caribbean- than in Pacific-slope forests and in the largest forest tracts. The Panamanian government, recognizing the importance of the forests for protection of biodiversity and for proper functioning of the canal, has created two national parks and a national monument in the canal area. One large park, Soberania National Park, currently contains 92% of the region's forest-dwelling species. Two large tracts on the Caribbean coast, the Achiote Road forest and the Fort Sherman forest, are not designated as national parks but are recognized as important forest areas. Those two forests harbor species found nowhere else in the canal corridor Extensive fragmentation, disconnection of forested corridors between foothills and lowlands, and anthropogenic degradation of forests near towns have altered regional bird-community dynamics. Some dynamics occur on large spatial scales, such as the poorly understood movements of elevational and transisthmian migrants. Long-term maintenance of bird species diversity in the canal area will require preservation of the large forest tracts and reestablishment of a forested connection from the canal corridor lowlands to the Chagres lowlands and foothills in the east. Such conservation activities will be challenging to execute given the region's growing human population and desires for a stronger national economy. We recommend protection of remaining forests and active enforcement of protection laws to reduce hunting and further intrusions.

KW  - UNITED-STATES
AB  - The Refuge Improvement Act of 1997 established a statutory mission and management standards for the National Wildlife Refuge system. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service subsequently issued a policy for ensuring the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health of the system. This policy requires understanding the management objectives of each refuge in a local, regional, and national context. An assessment of the refuge system in a national and regional context reveals that refuges are typically smaller than many conservation holdings and are unevenly distributed across the conterminous U.S. Western rangelands, coastal wetlands, and northern grasslands; wetlands are the best-represented ecosystems, while temperate forests have the poorest representation. In contrast to other agency holdings or management designations in the national protected areas network (e.g., national parks, national forests, wilderness areas), refuges tend to occupy sites at lower elevations and that have higher productivity and soil quality. This difference points to the important contribution of the refuges in providing much needed ecological balance within the national protected areas network. However, the ecological integrity of the refuge system is challenged by the proximity of individual refuges to development. Overall, the refuges are becoming islands in a landscape matrix of urban and agricultural development. This creates future challenges for meeting management objectives to ensure the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health of the system. If the policy to ensure biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health of the refuge system is to be successful, it may be more important to address issues about what happens on adjacent lands than uses within refuges.

AB  - The Han Chinese migration into Inner Mongolia has been an ongoing process. There have been academic studies on such migration, and on Han Chinese peasant migrants and their interactions with the Mongols. This paper is a study of a particular group of Han migrants, known in English as the sent-down youths, sent by the government to Inner Mongolia, in the movement of 'going up to the mountains and down to the villages', or the rustication movement, which reached its height during the Cultural Revolution (1966 1976). Among the total of 17 million urban middle school graduates sent to various parts of China to become farmers, about 200,000 went to Inner Mongolia. By the mid-1980s the majority of these sent-down youths had returned to the cities and regained their urban household status. Based on works written by those who went to Inner Mongolia, and especially the interviews I conducted with some of them, this paper analyses their experiences, what it meant to them and the impact they had on the ecology and the political and ethnic integration of Inner Mongolia. I argue that the rustication movement as a Communist 'civilizing' project had negative effects on the ecology of Inner Mongolia. The sent-down youths functioned as instruments in the Han demographic and economic expansion and domination, but in the process, as individuals they underwent journeys of discovery of themselves and of the Mongols. To some, the experiences meant more awareness of ethnic diversity and more consciousness of ethnic rights as well as environmental issues. On the popular level, they played a role in enhancing ethnic integration.

AB  - The community and the government of the city of Manizales have been working for ten years to become a "City of Knowledge", in the same way the eco-region named Coffee Belt, with its landscape as intangible cultural heritage of humankind and with its biodiversity, have got into an agreement with all the participants, the desire to become a "Region that Learns." Under this concept, our research group and development have recognizing the role of a university in a "city of knowledge and a region that learns". In this paper we present as the region has left constituting in region of knowledge, their Systems of the National System of Innovation, Colombian network COMPITE, economical and social areas where region can have competitive advantage, infrastructure in high velocity data networks, Agro-industrial Districts of region, among other important initiatives. The group wants to do of the knowledge management an institutional capacity and a differentiating characteristic that redounds in the construction of an intelligent organization inside the city and the region, promoting new performance environments from the science and technology. This is what we are doing at Manizales University and this paper shows advances in: generating new knowledge, using accessible knowledge in decision making, embedding knowledge in processes, products, and/or services, accessing valuable knowledge from outside sources, representing knowledge in documents, databases and software, facilitating knowledge growth through culture and incentives, measuring the value of knowledge assets and/or impact of knowledge management, transferring existing knowledge into other parts of the organization. The organization that learns precise of the integration of subsystems to meet the objectives in the same way as happens with intangible management. In this paper, some relevant aspects are present on integration of information and communication technology, management of human capital, Knowledge management and Information management, reflected in generating competitive assets in the intelligent organization for the city and the region.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to exploit the main traits and the transformations that occurred during the proccess uf urbanization of the city of Mariana, in Minas Gerais State, in the period from 1960 to 1990, which was influenced by some changes in order to accomodate the new coming population. We will concentrate in the polarization between the settled population and the new one, which may be faced as a characteristic of that city's urban scenery during the proccess mentioned above. Some studies show that the native population, frightened by the increasing offer of workmanship from the coming groups began to stablish frontiers between them, what affected the political situation and also the division of territorial areas. Thus, such movement seems to have produced effects on the spatial organization of the city and, also, in the access of the native population to the cultural goods, what means that this proccess seems to have affected the evolution of aspects of citizenship.

AB  - Population data on raccoon (Procyon lotor) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), collected between 1987 and 1996 in the city of Scarborough (Ontario, Canada), were used to develop spatially explicit population models for use in disease control planning. The objective of model development was to: (1) provide a standard analytical method to identify areas of high-density raccoon and skunk subpopulations within cities, and (2) to identify those subpopulations predicted to function as sites of high dispersal (either into or out of subpopulations). These areas could be targeted in disease control programs. The models combined landscape map data with a stochastic, age-structured population model, which incorporated habitat-specific demographic data and functions relating to animal dispersal. Using this approach, the assemblage of raccoons and skunks inhabiting Scarborough was modeled as occupying discrete subpopulations linked by dispersal (i.e., a metapopulation). The landscape data used in this study were derived from classified LANDSAT satellite imagery data. Population data were derived from the literature and from trapping data collected within the Scarborough study area. The resulting models depicted metapopulations containing 7432 +/- 1529 raccoons (mean +/- 1 SD) distributed throughout eight subpopulations, and 533 +/- 125 skunks distributed throughout 10 subpopulations. Raccoon density within subpopulations ranged from 37 to 94 animals/km(2). Skunk density within subpopulations ranged from 6.4 to 12.6 animals/km(2). Five raccoon subpopulations and one skunk subpopulation were predicted to stabilize at high relative population densities (>125% carrying capacity), implying that these subpopulations were functioning as net importers of dispersing animals. As such, these subpopulations were at higher risk of being sites of rabies outbreaks than surrounding subpopulations, owing to their high population densities and greater likelihood of receiving infected individuals. In contrast, one raccoon subpopulation stabilized at low relative population density and therefore appeared to be functioning as a net exporter of dispersing animals. The disease control implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Before 1900, Blacks typically occupied the swampy portions of New Orleans, Louisiana. As the city embarked on an ambitious Progressive Era public works project to improve drainage in the 1890s, it began to overhaul environmental conditions. This process, if carried out according to rational engineering principles, would serve the entire city equitably. At the same time as the improvements, Jim Crow policies appeared in the political landscape and presented a potential challenge to equity in the engineering project. An examination of the design and delivery of drainage and sewerage services compared with racial segregation offers insights into the discussion of environmental equity and also the agents of segregation in New Orleans. By 1930, engineering concerns overcame racist tendencies in delivering public services. Drainage allowed Blacks to move into previously uninhabited portions of the city, but Jim Crow policies ultimately limited their movement out of the lowest sections of the city.

AB  - This study investigates the diet of six breeding pairs of powerful owls in the Yarra Valley Corridor in Victoria, Australia, and compares prey consumption with prey availability. The six sites represent a continuum of habitats, ranging from urban Melbourne, through the urban fringe interface to a more forested landscape. We found that powerful owls in the Yarra Valley Corridor are reliant almost exclusively on arboreal marsupial prey as their preferred diet, with 99% of their overall diet comprising four arboreal marsupial species. These four species (the common ringtail possum, common brushtail possum, sugar glider and greater glider) were also the most abundant species observed while spotlighting; however, their abundance varied along the continuum. There was a strong positive relationship with the presence of these species in the diet and their site-specific availability, indicating that the powerful owl is a generalist hunter, preying on the most available prey at a given site and in a given season. This study suggests that food resources are high in these disturbed urban fringe sites and it is unlikely that food availability in urban environments will limit the potential survival of urban powerful owls.

AB  - The dispersal of the tule mosquito, Culex erythrothorax, was studied in the proximity of Lake Tynan in the city of Watsonville, CA. From July 18 to 20, 2000, approximately 43,000 female Cx. erythrothorax were marked with luminous powder and released, using a distinct color each day. Recaptures were sampled by using 21 carbon dioxide-baited traps ranging in distance from zero to 2.8 km from the release site. During the 5 days of postrelease sampling, 319 marked mosquitoes were recaptured. The percentage of the marked mosquitoes that were recaptured was 0.46,. 0.50, and 0.55% based on the 3 releases, respectively. Overall, the mosquitoes dispersed 0.57 km/day; the mean distance traveled increased during the 5-day sampling period from 0.42 km/day to 0.89 km/day from day I to day 5, respectively. Based on the Lincoln index, the estimated total population size for Cx. erythrothorax in the study area ranged from 3.8 to 9.4 million mosquitoes. This species was found to constitute a nuisance to local residents because of the abundance of this species and its capability to disperse into proximal communities.

AB  - The prehistoric urban center of Harappa is located in the middle of the Punjab plain of northwestern South Asia. There are no stone resources of any kind nearby, only sand and silt. Yet a great diversity of rock and mineral types are present at the site. This paper first examines Harappa's rock and mineral assemblage from the perspective of the greater Indus Valley's complex geology. The subsequent section will consider the scale - both quantity and bulk size - of the materials that were transported to Harappan cities. Next, the distance one would have to travel to acquire certain materials will be examined from the standpoint of the lack of stone resources around Harappa and the nature of the materials themselves. An outline of the several possible modes by which the physical movement of lithic commodities took place will follow. I conclude with a discussion of the differing motivations behind the acquisition and transport of rock and minerals in the greater Indus Valley region.

AB  - Although mistletoe is typically viewed as a parasite of juniper in a two-way interaction, its role may become neutral or even mutualistic when their common avian seed dispersing agents are considered as a three-way interaction. In the study area, wintering avian frugivores forage on both one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) berries and on the fruit of its associated mistletoe (Phoradendron juniperinum). Three major findings emerged from our studies that support a three-way interaction and the hypothesis of conditional interactions. First, mistletoes provide a stable resource for shared avian seed dispersers; junipers do not. Whereas juniper berry production varied 10- to 15-fold over the 3 years of our study, mistletoe fruit abundance did not vary significantly. Second, the abundance of avian seed dispersal agents, such as Townsend's solitaires (Myadestes townsendi), is strongly tied to the abundance of Juniper berries in mast years and mistletoe fruits in all years. In fact, the best overall predictor of their common avian seed dispersal agents was the abundance of mistletoe; stands with mistletoe attracted up to 3 times more avian frugivores than stands with little or no mistletoe. Thus, mistletoe berries can serve as the main attractor for birds that disperse juniper berries. Third, in agreement with the hypothesis that mistletoe can benefit junipers by attracting and supporting greater populations of avian seed dispersal agents, the number of juniper seedlings was more than 2-fold greater in stands with high mistletoe density compared with stands that had little or no mistletoe. Results suggest that the occurrence of a three-way interaction, in the presence of environmental variation (in this case, annual variation in juniper berry crops), may change the ecological roles of associated species. A conceptual model is presented to illustrate how the role of mistletoe may range from parasitic to mutualistic, while the role of avian seed dispersers may conversely range from mutualistic to parasitic, the latter by acting as vectors for the spread of mistletoe.

CP  - 80th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
KW  - FORM
AB  - The assumption that travel demand is influenced by land use has long been applied in Dutch spatial planning policy. The aim of the present analysis is to explore how far this policy has succeeded in bringing about a compact and mixed spatial structure. Hence, a detailed analysis of the variation and development in the dispersal of urban activities, mix of uses, density, and diversity in urban areas between 1990 and 1996 is provided. It appears that although urban areas are leveling out on the one hand, they are undergoing a process of separation on the other. Although most of the building in the Randstad (the densely populated western part of the Netherlands) is taking place inside the designated urban regions, it is not producing compact monocentric towns; the urban areas are converging more and more, the metropolitan centers are losing their importance, and subcenters and concentrations of services are springing up on the edges of the urban regions. These phenomena confirm the emergence of complex, polycentric urban areas. Suburban sprawl is increasing rapidly in the intermediate zone outside the Randstad, where low-density residential areas, monoenvironments, and business estates are expanding. This region appears to have become the suburban search space for the Randstad. These dual trends will increase the distance between locations and make destinations less easily accessible by bicycle and public transport. Hence, neither the polycentric development inside the Randstad nor the suburban developments outside the Randstad will contribute to the reduction of car use.

AB  - Aedes aegypti was eliminated from Brazil in 1955, but re-infested the country in the 1970s. Dengue outbreaks have occurred since 1981 and became endemic in several cities in Brazil after 1986. Urban yellow fever has not occurred since 1942, and only jungle yellow fever cases have been reported. A population genetic analysis using isoenzyme variation combined with an evaluation of susceptibility to both yellow fever and dengue 2 viruses was conducted among 23 A. aegypti samples from 13 Brazilian states. We demonstrated that experimental infection rates of A. aegypti for both dengue and yellow fever viruses (YFV) are high and heterogeneous, and samples collected in the endemic and transition areas of sylvatic yellow fever were highly susceptible to yellow fever virus. Boa Vista, a border city between Brazil and Venezuela, and Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast region are considered as the most important entry points for dengue dissemination. Considering the high densities of A. aegypti, and its high susceptibility to dengue and yellow fever viruses, the risk of dengue epidemics and yellow fever urbanization in Brazil is more real than ever.

AB  - Recent analyses of human impacts on Amazonian landscapes have focused primarily on upland forests that have been deforested as roads have penetrated the frontier. In contrast, relatively little priority has been given to documenting and understanding landscape changes in the roughly 400 000 km(2) of Amazonia's floodplains, where an extensive network of waterways has long provided the transportation infrastructure. Amazonian floodplains generally support higher rural population densities than the uplands and provide critical habitat and food for fish and shrimp species, a principal source of protein for millions of rural and urban Amazonians. We examined cover type changes in a 52 304 ha tidal floodplain near the mouth of the Amazon River in Amapa, Brazil (tidal range = 2-3 m). We found five major cover types discernible in both black-and-white infrared aerial photographs taken in October-November 1976, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data from November 1991. The cover types were: (1) water and unvegetated banks, (2) herbaceous cover, both natural and agricultural, (3) early regrowth or degraded forest, (4) palm forest, and (5) mixed species varzea forest. From 1976 to 1991, the areal extent of the aquatic, herbaceous, early regrowth and degraded forest, and palm forest cover types increased from 2833 to 3406, 10708 to 15074, 3842 to 5446, and 1250 to 3208 ha, respectively, while the areal extent of the mixed species varzea forest decreased from 33 671 to 25 170 ha. Logging, heart-of-palm. extraction and agricultural conversion are interacting disturbances which, combined with the rapid regrowth that occurs in the tidal floodplains of Amazonia, have produced a landscape characterized by a high rate of cover type transitions and a substantial loss of the mixed species varzea forest. The annualized forest conversion rate is comparable to that reported elsewhere for upland Amazonian landscapes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied how the genetic structure helps in understanding the demographic history of a species and predicting its future, using the endangered orchid Spiranthes spiralis.
   A Parisian population was mapped during three consecutive years. Its genetic structure was assessed using isozymes and compared with several populations from southern France. Seed dispersal distances were experimentally evaluated. Computer simulations were performed to reconstruct the population history.
   Unlike southern France populations, the Parisian population exhibited two genetically distinct patches. Seed dispersal was limited to the neighbourhood of the fruiting plants. The simulations showed that the best explanation for the observed genetic structure was a recent colonization event by two small groups of founders.
   Current patterns of gene flow should result in a rapid genetic and demographic homogenization. New populations of S. spiralis could be successfully established by few founders and exhibit significant growth rates without any detrimental effects of inbreeding. This offers insight into the successful management of endangered plant species in urban areas.

AB  - In 1999, Turkey was struck by two major earthquakes that occurred 86 days apart on the North Anatolian Fault system. Both earthquakes had right-lateral strike-slip mechanisms with moment magnitudes greater than 7. The number of strong-motion records obtained from the Kocaeli earthquake (17 August 1999, M-w 7.4) was 34. The second event, designated as the Bolu-Duzce earthquake (12 November 1999, M-w 7.2), triggered 20 instruments. Among the records that we have from these earthquakes, seven are from near-source ground-motion data. These records were obtained from the cities of Gebze (GBZ), Yarimca (YPT), Izmit (IZT) (capital city of the province of Kocaeli), Adapazari (SKR) (capital of the province of Sakarya), Duzce (DZC) (shaken strongly in both the events), and Bolu (BOL). In many of these urban centers, extensive structural damage was observed. Although these near-field data have greatly expanded the strike-slip near-source ground-motion database worldwide for M-w > 7 earthquakes, they represent a blurred image of the actual severity of the ground motions in the epicentral area because of the sparseness of the national strong-motion network and the unrepresentative geologic conditions at the recording sites. We examine the records to determine whether they provide clues about the extensive damage on the housing stock in the epicentral region. The goal is tackled with earthquake structural engineering criteria in mind, using the drift spectrum as the primary yardstick. There appears to be conflicting evidence that the fault-normal (FN) direction should represent a greater damage-causing potential when this potential is based on ground-story drift spectra. The component with larger ground velocity does correlate better with the component with larger drift demand, but this does not always coincide with the FN direction. The period of the peak velocity pulse matches the structural period where the drift demand is the largest. Further refinements of code requirements that consider this effect are in order.

AB  - Epibiotic assemblages have been shown previously to differ between pontoons and rocky reefs. This may occur for a variety of reasons, one of which is that pontoons move, whereas reefs do not. Effects of movement of the substratum are particularly pertinent to studies involving settlement panels because these experimental units are often suspended from pontoons such that they can move up and down, or attached to ropes such that they can rotate. The development of epibiotic assemblages on panels that were fixed, moved up and down, or rotated, was studied to test hypotheses about the effects of movement on sessile organisms. The covers of barnacles, sponges and ascidians increased greatly with increasing movement and/or rotation of the substratum, whereas species of red and brown foliose algae and tubiculous polychaetes generally decreased with increasing movement and/or rotation of the substratum. In general, assemblages on panels that moved up and down were most similar to those on rotating panels. One of the most obvious differences was the 2 to 3-fold greater biomass on rotating panels compared to fixed panels, which was attributed to the greater abundance of barnacles. It was concluded that, although movement of a surface can influence the composition of assemblages, this factor on its own may explain only some of the differences reported between pontoons and reefs. Furthermore, the method of deployment of settlement panels was shown to have great effects on the types of assemblages that develop. Differences in water flow were proposed to explain some of the observed patterns, but this idea needs to be investigated further.

AB  - Different species, populations, and individuals disperse and migrate at different rates. The rate of movement that occurs in response to changes in climate, whether fast or slow, will shape the distribution of natural ecosystems in the decades to come. Moreover, land-use patterns associated with Urban, suburban, rural, and agricultural development will complicate ecosystem adaptation to climate change by hindering migration. Here we examine how vegetation's capacity to disperse and migrate may affect the biophysical and biogeochemical characteristics of the land surface tinder anthropogenic climate change. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of plant migration strongly influences carbon storage, evapotranspiration, and the absorption of solar radiation by the land surface. As a result, plant migration affects the magnitude, and in some cases the sign, of feedbacks from the land surface to the climate system. We conclude that future climate projections depend on much better understanding of and accounting for dispersal and migration.

AB  - Populations of mammals that depend on early successional forests or shrub-dominated habitats are declining in portions of the eastern United States. Although much of this decline can be attributed to maturation of young forests that once dominated the East, fragmentation and suppression of natural disturbances also have been implicated. Responses by habitat specialists (e.g., New England cottontails [Sylvilagus transitionalis]) and carnivores with large area requirements that rely on prey associated with early successional habitats (e.g., bobcats [Lynx rufus]) have been most extreme. Populations of facultative or opportunistic users of early successional habitats (e.g., black bears [Ursus americanus] and little brown bats [Myotis lucifugus]) apparently have not been affected by fewer young stands. As eastern forests mature, biotic and abiotic forces will increase abundance of early successional habitats. However, maturation of these forests will take a century or more. In the meantime, using even-aged silviculture and applying controlled burns to native shrublands may be useful to alleviate current shortages. In landscapes modified substantially by suburban-urban developments and dense networks of roads, conventional management efforts likely will be insufficient. In these regions, increased populations of generalist predators are of exerting intense predation on mammalian herbivores that are restricted to small patches, and movement between patches by small mammals is limited. Mammals large area requirements also are hampered in these landscapes by frequent road crossings. These limitations may require implementing habitat management programs for mammals that differ from those developed for other disturbance-dependent taxa. Large (>10-ha), clustered patches of early successional habitat may be necessary to maintain viable populations. The effectiveness of these managed habitats will be further enhanced by positioning them close to existing land uses that are characterized by early successional habitats (e.g., powerline corridors). In agricultural landscapes, the representation of old-field habitats could be increased in set-aside programs.

AB  - Large scale slope movement occurred at communities on hill slope in Kaohsiung areas have been recognized as a serious public concern by the resident at Kaohsiung city in southwestern Taiwan. The administration of Kaohsiung metropolitan containing the area of 2645.60 km(2) includes both Kaohsiung city and county governments. However, Most of hill slope areas are located at Kaohsiung County with 1970.62 km(2) which were occupied more than 70% of total Kaohsiung areas. Weak geological structure, uneven distributions of rainfall intensity, steep geomorphology and intensive development were identified as the predominated factors contributing to the slope failures at community on Kaohsiung slope land.
   Natural disasters damaging properties, infrastructure and human life can be serious all over Kaohsiung metropolitan area. To identify large scale soil mass movement, debris flow and surface runoff erosion by using satellite image processing system and aerial photography implementation on the surface of earth should be required in this project. Applications of GIS integrated with GPS and RS technology would also be necessary and critical for this research. This project was proposed as a three year study to establish a risk assessment model of environmental disasters and set up geo-hazard database systems for the communities on hill slope in Kaohsiung metropolitan. All results can give a fundamental guideline of sediment related disaster prevention. Hopefully, this guideline can help Kaohsiung city and county governments set up their own disaster prevention and mitigation systems to keep urban safe and well development in the future. It is expected that the establishment of this risk model and disaster database system can be used to help a well development of community on urban planning, designing and controlling the hazard mitigation of Kaohsiung area in southwestern Taiwan.

AB  - The effect of immigration on social cohesion is a political issue, expressed as a fear that racially skewed residential patterns represent ghettos which prevent integration. Residential patterns have been measured by indices of segregation. The range of indices is reviewed in the paper and measured empirically for England and Wales by using census data for 1991 and 2001, including a new index of migration dispersal. There has been an increase in residential mixing as a result of growing minority populations and their more even spread across localities. These two trends are identified by two commonly used indices of segregation which are moving in opposite directions for the most recent immigrant groups. The sensitivity of each index to modifiable area boundaries makes them unsuitable for evaluation of cities' relative performance. The residential patterns of cities after immigration are more clearly understood by using demographic measures of migration and age structure.

AB  - To improve local food systems in the U.S. it is important to understand what is happening in the dominant mainstream food system, because that system poses formidable constraints to how much success local food systems can achieve. Major changes occurred in the food-system-centred part of the American landscape. The principal trends in the changes of the food system are that farmers get less of the food dollar, their numbers decrease and large farms are dominating the farming community. Accompanying changes are high pesticide use, less biodiversity in crops, more use of genetically modified organisms and booming factory farms. These trends change the rural communities and make farmland disappear from urban fringes. The consumer part is changing by the development of mega-superstores and fast-food chains. Driving forces are the increasing concentration in the mainstream food industry, horizontal and vertical integration making the concentration processes more dominant. Changes in food consumption and globalization of the market both affect the patterns in the landscape, as did the environmental movement. Local food systems are still existing, but more fragile and characterized by diversity. They cannot change the dominant food systems. A stronger planning system can help them to provide a more solid place on the market by filling in the gaps and making use of the movement towards healthy/sustainable food systems. Complementarities between the American and European experience can be noted, although differences exist as well.

AB  - The location high-order service sectors outside traditional CBDs can be taken as a sign of the CBD's decline and there is evidence that such a process is occurring. However, all evidence does not point this way. In this paper, we study the Paris region in order to explore the location patterns of 17 distinct high-order business service sectors. The location patterns of high-order business services are found to be complex, each sector behaving differently and each sector displaying combinations of concentration and dispersal. Hypotheses are put forward relating the various interlocking patterns to the markets (producer-consumer; local-global), to the internal structure (large-small establishments, local branches, back-offices, small consultancies) and to the nature (technical-non-technical) of each sector.

AB  - Many cities throughout the United States have implemented programs for managing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations. However, basic ecological questions, such as seasonal movement patterns and habitat use of deer in urban landscapes, have gone relatively unstudied. We conducted a telemetry study to investigate seasonal movements and habitat use of female white-tailed deer in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA, during 1996-1999. Home range size varied seasonally, with the largest occurring during the spring ((x) over bar = 144 ha [SD = 7 ha]) and smallest during the summer ( F = 50 ha [SD = 7 ha]). Home ranges during fall ( F = 93 ha [SD = 11 ha]) and winter ((x) over bar = 85 ha [SD = 6 ha]) were similar in size. Deer in this study demonstrated a high degree of fidelity with their seasonal home ranges, except during a severe winter when 75% of the deer shifted their fall home range. These deer all returned to their original home range the following spring. Habitat analysis indicated that deer used woody cover habitats during every season. Habitats within parks and conservation areas made up the greatest percentage (52-68%) of home range compositions during all seasons except the severe winter when 78% of the home range encompassed residential neighborhoods. Our data suggest that a major difference between urban and rural deer is in spatial scale. Deer in this study used habitats that might be expected based on studies of deer in rural landscapes but occupied smaller home ranges than normally reported for deer in rural landscapes. Deer management programs developed for urban communities should consider movement patterns of deer to ensure the most effective control of particular nuisance individuals.

AB  - The rapid growth and development of motorisation combined with relatively small investments made to improving transportation infrastructure in cities, as well as in tourism destinations, has led to serious problems in the unobstructed movement of vehicles in public traffic areas. Traffic congestion on roadways, in ferryboat ports and at state borders during the summer months and year-round lines of cars going to or returning from work are a regular presence in traffic in most urban and tourism destinations in Croatia, as well as in the rest of Europe.
   Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can be implemented in urban and tourism centres, which, for example, have no opportunity for increasing the capacity of their traffic networks by constructing new, or expanding existing, transportation infrastructure, and no opportunity for increasing parking capacities. The only solution would be to optimise traffic networking by introducing intelligent technologies. Intelligent transportation systems and services represent a coupling of information and telecommunication technologies with transportation means and infrastructure to ensure greater efficiency in the mobility of people and goods. ITS implementation helps to provide better information to motorists and travellers (tourists); improve traffic and tourist flows, cargo transportation, public passenger-transportation; facilitate the work of emergency services; enable electronic traffic-related payments; enhance the security of people in road traffic; and monitor weather conditions and the environment. To motorists the system provides guidance to roads on which traffic is less intense, guidance to available parking spaces, and guidance, for example, to a good restaurant or interesting tourist attraction.
   his paper focuses, in particular, on ITS application in city and tourism destinations in connection with parking problems. Guiding vehicles to the closest vacant parking space helps to reduce traffic congestion, reduce the amount of time lost in searching and increase the occupancy rate of car-parks.

AB  - The first black men to enter the West were Spanish-speaking settlers from central Mexico. They were followed by free English-speaking fur traders and by slaves primarily in Texas. Some males arrived in California during the 1850s, initiating a voluntary migration of farmers, miners, soldiers, and cowboys through the nineteenth century. In the early twentieth century, black men settled mainly in the cities and worked in unskilled nonunion occupations. By World War II, far more migrants had arrived in response to wartime work opportunities. War work allowed both newcomers and old residents access to skilled unionized employment for the first time. Discrimination continued, however, prompting a civil rights movement in the West in the 1960s that paralleled activities in the South. That movement opened new opportunities for the skilled and educated. However, postwar deindustrialisation moved many unskilled African American men to the margins of the Western urban economy.

TI  - From Megastructure to Megalopolis: Formation and Transformation of Mega-projects in Tokyo Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - The Tokyo Bay is characterized by one of the highest concentrations of megaprojects in Asia. However, the tradition of mega-project development in this region can be traced back to the megastructural movement in the 1960s from which it drew inspiration in planning and design. From the megastructural movement in the 1960s to the ongoing mega-projects in Tokyo Bay, there has been a marked evolution in planning concepts and urban development strategies. Underlying these changes is the substantial transformation of economic patterns and social ideologies that occurred as Japanese society entered the post-industrial era. To examine the formation and evolution of urban design ideas in Tokyo Bay, this paper focuses on two epochal mega-projects, Tange's 1960 Tokyo Bay Plan and the Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, and compares them in terms of their socio-economic objectives, planning approaches, relationships between architecture and infrastructure and the notion of symbolism embodied in the project. Through the analysis, it is argued that these mega-projects were both instruments and products of the major socio-economic restructuring of the time. They represented an idealistic effort to create total environments that serve as model cities of their eras.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation and habitat quality on sedentary forest birds in an urban and suburban environment. The study area was situated in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, embracing the city centre, suburbs and parts of the rural surroundings. Breeding forest birds were surveyed in 51 forested sample sites (2-700 ha) and five species of resident birds were selected for further studies: willow tit (Parus montanus), crested tit (P. cristatus) and coal tit (P. ater) representing coniferous forest and marsh tit (P. palustris) and nuthatch (Sitta europaea) representing deciduous forest. A spatial landscape analysis was made using a geographical information system (GIS). In 21 of the smaller sites (2-200 ha), a field study was conducted to examine habitat quality parameters like vegetation age, structure and composition, and human-induced disturbance. The probability of occurrence (breeding) of bird species as functions of landscape and habitat descriptors was tested using logistic regression. All investigated species of the Parus guild showed high probabilities of occurrence only in forest patches larger than 200-400 ha, and was not present in patches smaller than 10-30 ha. This meant that patches of presumably suitable habitat (coniferous vs. moist deciduous forest) were left unoccupied. The amount of standing dead and decaying trees provided additional explanation for the distribution of the willow tit. Large areas of urban open land, industrial land use and large bodies of water had a negative influence on the probability of occurrence of several species, which indicate that they were sensitive to isolation. The probability of occurrence of the marsh tit was also influenced by distance to other sample sites with marsh tits. Unlike the Parus species, the nuthatch was breeding in most of the parks and forest remnants. This species prefers mature deciduous forest, mainly oak, which habitat was common in the urban environment. The nuthatch was only absent in some of the smallest (a few ha) forest fragments, with a mean distance between forest patches in the surroundings of over 100 m. The study showed that large forest areas and a high amount of forest in the landscape are important for the investigated resident birds that are not adapted to the urban environment. Vast areas without tree-cover seemed to be poor habitat and/or restrict dispersal. Strips of high-quality habitats, including standing trees with nest-holes, were not entirely absent in the urban and suburban environment.

AB  - Urbanization, an important driver of climate change and pollution, alters both biotic and abiotic ecosystem properties within, surrounding, and even at great distances from urban areas. As a result, research challenges and environmental problems must be tackled at local, regional, and global scales. Ecosystem responses to land change are complex and interacting, occurring on all spatial and temporal scales as a consequence of connectivity of resources, energy, and information among social, physical, and biological systems. We propose six hypotheses about local to continental effects of urbanization and pollution, and an operational research approach to test them. This approach focuses on analysis of "megapolitan" areas that have emerged across North America, but also includes diverse wildland-to-urban gradients and spatially continuous coverage of land change. Concerted and coordinated monitoring of land change and accompanying ecosystem responses, coupled with simulation models, will permit robust forecasts of how land change and human settlement patterns will alter ecosystem services and resource utilization across the North American continent. This, in turn, can be applied globally.

AB  - This paper focuses on the evolution of Greenway planning and implementation in China, and provides a historical context to the Greenway concept. It was found that:
   (1) Although the concept of Greenway was an adaptation from the Western World, the Chinese have a history of more than 2000 years of Greenway planning and implementation. Chinese Greenways have been called various names and were planned for various reasons.
   (2) The long history of Greenway planning and implementation in China was mainly a "top-down" approach, which, while very effective under a centralized administrative system, often lacked a scientific basis and significant public participation.
   (3) The functions of the Greenways were mainly protection and productive, with little concern for human uses such recreational uses of cycling and hiking.
   Greenways in China are discussed chronologically and in three categories:
   (1) Riparian Greenways run along rivers, streams and water channels. The history of these Greenways dates more than 2000 years, since a time when trees were grown along canals and city moats. They have in modern times evolved into a network of drainage channels.
   (2) Greenways along transportation corridors. These Greenways run parallel to state and provincial highways, railroads, country roads and urban streets and evolved from tree plantings along highways. Used exclusively by emperors, the green corridor networks have been systematically planned and constructed at a national scale and directly organized by the central government.
   (3) Greenways along farmland for wind protection. These plantings evolved from individual segments of windbreak rows to a network of protective windbreaks and the large, regional scale "Green Great Wall" project running along the northern edge of China.
   As Greenways have evolved in China, they reflect changes in ideology, utilization and scale; from protection of production or beautification to ecological and multiple uses, and from small-scale fragments to a systematic regional and national network. The occurrence of disasters, the involvement of state leaders and the influence of science played an important role in the evolution of Greenways in China.
   The paper also argues that:
   the traditional top-down approach in Greenway planning and implement should be integrated with scientifically based methods;
   recreational uses should be considered and integrated into existing and planned Greenways; the recently invoked "city beautiful", or cosmetic approach to Greenway planning and implementation should be stopped; and
   Greenways should be planned as an critical strategic element of ecological infrastructure at both the regional and urban scale during current rapid and extensive urbanization occurring in China. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant distribution borders are key features to characterise the ecological niche of a species and to monitor effects of climate change. Here we focus on an evergreen small tree, Ilex aquifolium, which reaches its north-eastem range edge in Denmark. Our main objectives are to describe and to model the current distribution of the species, to identify the most important climatic and land use factors which shape this distribution pattern, and to analyse the species' habitat requirements. For this purpose we used data from a national mapping project, complemented by information from forest owners. The distribution and abundance of L aquifolium in Denmark have markedly changed during the past 40 years. It is now found in almost all districts, although the centres of abundance still coincide with the historical records. Our model shows lower habitat suitability for the species in northern and eastern districts, where winters are more severe and spring precipitation is lower. To a lesser extent, land use influences I. aquifolium occurrence, but it is more common in areas with a high proportion of forests and/or urban sites. The analysis of habitat requirements supports these results, since I. aquifolium occurs mainly as a forest species in deciduous stands, on relatively nutrient-rich moist soils, and under moderately high light conditions. However, some records may be the product of seed dispersal from planted individuals nearby. The results suggest that the range edge of tile species has moved at least 100 km east within half a century. Since I. aquifolium is sensitive to winter frost, this change in distribution may be due to increasingly mild winter temperatures.

AB  - Background: The loss of autonomy at advanced ages is not only associated with ageing, but also with the characteristics of the physical and social environment. Recent investigations have shown that social networks, social engagement and participation act like predictors of disability among the elderly. To analyze the effect of social networks on the level of autonomy (instrumental and basic disability) at initial stages of the old age.
   Methods: The source of data is the first wave of the Survey "processes of Vulnerability among Spanish Elderly", carried out in 2005 to a sample of 1,250 individuals? with the later purification of the data, it was in a size final sample of 1.244 individuals? The population object of study is the cohort aged 70 to 74 years in metropolitan areas (Madrid and Barcelona) and not institutionalized. Disability is measured by the development of basic activities of daily life (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily life (IADL). ne structural aspects of the social relationships are measured through the diversity of social networks and participation, for which a global indicator of social network diversity was built.
   Results: For each unit that diminishes the indicator of social network diversity, the probability of suffering an instrumental disability ?in front of not suffering any disability? is multiplied by 0.97 (IC95% 0.95 - 0.99), and the probability of suffering a basic disability is multiplied by 0.91 (IC95% 0.87 - 0.94)
   Discussion: Like in other geographic scopes, a statistically significant relationship exists between the indicator of diversity of social network used and the disability, in its two levels of graveness. Therefore, the diversity of the social network seems to show a protective effect in front of the disability among the Spanish urban population at the beginning of the age.

TI  - Working-class formation in Europe and forms of integration: History and theory
T2  - LABOR HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Within the parameters of a class model this paper seeks to explain how the European labor movements developed against a background of expanding capitalist labor markets, rural - urban split, liberal political hegemony, conflicting and competing religious, ethnic and linguistic affiliation and state repression, from the mid nineteenth century until World War II. Stating that solidarity, organization and militancy are functions of urbanism, the paper raises the question of how different societies overcame the rural urban split. Besides noting that most countries in East and South Europe did not manage to cross the bridge, one may point out that extensive urbanization resulted from the exodus from the countryside simultaneous with the growth of industrial labor markets in towns and cities, and next, how the labor movement managed to expand trade unions outside the urban sector, and seeking electoral support among the agrarian population. Provided labor had considerable national political power, this turned out to be an effective policy; otherwise this organizational expansion would be confronted with violent opposition. Early industrialization often went hand in hand with liberal political domination, which occupied the social space and hence obstructed further diffusion by other organizations. Only external events such as a major war or an economic crisis were able to break these ties effectively. In West and North Europe repression was moderate and temporary, whereas the working classes in South and East Europe were exposed to repression and harassment by landlords, industrialists and state bureaucracies. Only fundamental changes in international and national power structures could bring advantages to the labor movement. From a theoretical angle it is the interaction between mode of production, political organization and state structure that best explains different forms of working-class integration in Europe.

AB  - In the Netherlands indigenous Quercus robur L. populations are rare and have been maintained as patches in ancient woodland. For adequate conservation of these populations, information about genetic variation and population structure is necessary. in order to assess the genetic variation and structure of these populations, microsatellite polymorphisms were studied in two autochthonous populations. These two populations differed slightly for their gene diversity, which was as high as was observed for Q. robur populations in France and Germany. For reforestation purposes there is an interest in the genetic variation of a half-sib family harvested from one tree. The gene diversity of the two studied half-sib families-obtained from a forest and an urban area - was similar, but relatively low. This indicates that, for reforestation purposes, seeds should be harvested from many different trees in order to obtain a population with a genetic variation as high as was observed for an autochthonous population.

AB  - The blurring of rural and urban space in Sub-Saharan Africa has been a topical theme in recent years. Under economic duress, occupational distinctions between the two have tended to disappear. It is often inferred that burgeoning trade and service sector activities have encouraged greater personal mobility and rural-urban linkages as heightened movement of economic actors bridge the physical distance between town and countryside. Meanwhile, the theme of globalisation applied to Africa has tended to suggest that physical distances are contracting as cyberspace and mobile phones spread. But amid this debate, the fluctuating cost of oil as a key determinant of physical movement and distance perception has largely been overlooked. This paper examines Zimbabwe's rural and urban economies' vulnerability to international oil price fluctuations. Possible future oil price trends and their effect on African development are probed.

AB  - The Southern California Bight covers a region of about 300 km of coastline from northern Baja California to Point Conception. The present study includes ascidian species abundance data from 1994 to 2000 from 29 sites within the 12 major harbors of the Bight north of the Mexico/US border, plus 2 sites in Ensenada (Baja California, Mexico) sampled in August 2000. Nonindigenous ascidians form a major part of the fouling community biomass on floating docks in these harbors. Nine solitary and 5 colonial species are present, 13 of them in San Diego Bay, the largest bay in this region. The most northerly and among the smallest bays, Santa Barbara, contains 8 nonindigenous species. This study reports additional surveys to our 1998 paper (Lambert & Lambert 1998, Mar Biol 130:675-688) for fall 1997, spring 1998 and summer 2000, documents the newly arrived Botrylloides perspicuum, and corrects the records of 2 species. A main focus is the listing and abundance of species at each survey site within each major harbor and an attempt to analyze the differences between sites and between seasons within a single harbor with reference to variations in water movement, temperature, salinity, pollution factors and competition. Several species appeared for the first time in southern California during 1994 to 1997, apparently correlated with the influx of warmer water during the El Nino of that time. Subsequent surveys show that all of these species have persisted, several have dramatically increased in abundance and distribution, and an additional species has successfully invaded.

KW  - basic network
KW  - RISK
AB  - This article focuses on the effects of a so-called "basic network" for the transport of hazardous materials by rail and its (dis)advantages. The basic network offers authorities an easier to use framework for external risk policy as well as an easier framework to analyse at the municipal level the possibilities for urban development and communicate risks to civilians from an external safety policy perspective. However, there are still a number of disadvantages that should be taken into account. In this article five disadvantages are addressed. The first disadvantage is the fact that in the future the proposed limited numbers for transport are in certain parts of the network higher than currently and thus allow volume growth. Secondly, problems may occur if the transport numbers are fixed on basis of law. The third disadvantage is that some existing problems with external safety due to too much transport may be politically neglected in the future. This may lead to the realization of vulnerable objects too close to important railways, resulting in higher overall risks. Fourthly, there is a shift in coordination of safety between the responsible ministries which have diverging interests. This can easily lead to conflicting policies on the transport of hazardous materials and urban developments. The final issue is that two-dimensional safety zoning cannot be applied in cases where the buildings are constructed above the infrastructure without taking into account the three-dimensional structure. The authors conclude that even though the intention of the basic network idea is a good one, other more structural measures are needed to reach the goal of a safer transport of hazardous materials and a less inhibited urban development.

AB  - The global distribution of HIV strains is changing due to the movement of people because of immigration, travel, and military deployment. While the United States' HIV epidemic is predominantly caused by the HIV-1 group M, subtype B strain, non-B strains have been identified. This article reviews what is known currently about HIV strain diversity in the US. Studies in the US have focused on selected populations, thus the overall national prevalence of HIV non-B subtypes is unknown. Non-B infections are associated with birth in or contact with persons from non-B endemic countries, and with heterosexual transmission. The US will likely see an increase in the prevalence of genetically diverse HIV strains overtime.

AB  - The lay-out of the habitat is subjected to constraints imposed by the design of the street network, itself organized along the lines of a modulated orthogonal grid. From the very foundation of the town, the implantation of the street network goes along with large scale operations of land management (levelling out, filling in), whose chronology is slightly posterior to the first occupation of the sites. Now the implementation of the gridwork will not only lead to a new form of distribution of the dwelling units responding to a systematic parcelling out of the earlier constructions. Few material traces of parcelling out have been kept; thus, one has to rely of a process of backward reflexion on what the Higher Empire constructions may have looked like to develop the study of this specific aspect of private construction within the urban dynamics of Northern Gaul.

AB  - In North-western Germany woodland fragmentation has caused a decline in many forest plant species. Hedgerows partly offer a similar environment as forests and have been identified as potential habitats for forest plants in various studies from North America and Western Europe. The objective of this study was to examine whether this applies also to Central Europe and which variables affect the spatial distribution and abundance of forest plant species in hedgerows on a local scale. Three hedgerow networks north of the city of Bremen, Germany, were selected as study areas and divided into totally 515 hedgerow segments. In each segment we recorded all vascular plants and a large number of explanatory variables relating to structure, spatial configuration, environment and management. Averaged across species there was a predominant effect of environmental factors on the occurrence of forest species in the hedgerows, followed by spatial configuration and management. Hedgerow structure was found to be less important. In general, forest species were favored by low nutrient and light availability as well as high connectivity with other hedgerows or forest; they avoided hedgerows with a west-easterly orientation and an adjacent land use in the form of fields or grasslands. Forest species found and not found in hedgerows did not differ in their environmental preferences or life history traits. The number of threatened forest species in the hedgerows, however, was lower than expected with respect to their overall proportion to the total number of forest species in the region.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of land transformation. It is supposed to change the frequencies of species trait states in species assemblages. We hypothesize that the flora of urban and rural areas differs in the frequency of trait states and ask which traits enable a plant to cope with the urban environment. We tested our hypothesis in Germany, which was divided into grid-cells of ca 130 km(2). We distinguished urbanized (with more than 33% urban land use; n = 59), agricultural (with more than 50% agricultural land use; n = 1365) and semi-natural (with more than 50% forest and semi-natural land use; n = 312) grid-cells and calculated the proportions of plant species per trait state in each grid-cell. Multiple linear regressions explained the log-transformed ratio of one proportion to another with land use (urban, agricultural, semi-natural) and the environmental parameters (climate, topography, soils and geology). Additionally, linear mixed effect models accounted for the effects of land use and biogeography and differences in sample size of the three grid-cell types. Urbanized and rural areas showed clear differences in the proportion of trait states. Urbanized grid-cells had e.g., higher proportions of wind-pollinated plants, plants with scleromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by animals, and lower proportions of insect-pollinated plants, plants with hygromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by wind than other grid-cells. Our study shows that shifts in land use can change the trait state composition of plant assemblages. Far-reaching urbanization might consequently homogenize our flora with respect to trait state frequency.

AB  - In contrast to the widespread extirpation of native fire ants (Solenopsis geminata) across southern US following the invasion by imported red fire ants (S. invicta), some residential areas of Austin form unexpected refuges for native fire ants. Ironically, these urban environments provide refuges for the native fire ants while adjacent natural habitats have been overrun by invasive fire ants. Resistance to invasive fire ants in these urban areas occurs mainly in older residential properties constructed prior to the S. invicta invasion, while more recent construction has allowed establishment by S. invicta. The invasive ability of S. invicta is often attributed to escape from parasitoids and efficient dispersal of polygyne multiple queen colonies. Here we also show the importance of landscape parameters in the invasion process, where low levels of disturbance and continuous plant cover in older residential areas form possible barriers to colonization. Dense leaf cover (high NDVI) was also found to be associated with native ant refuges. Long term residential land ownership may have resulted in lower recent disturbance levels and increased plant cover that support refuges of native fire ants.

AB  - The wave of sit-ins that swept through the American South in the spring of 1960 transformed the struggle for racial equality. This episode is widely cited in the literature on social movements, but the debate over its explanation remains unresolved-partly because previous research has relied on case studies of a few large cities. The authors use event-history analysis to trace the diffusion of sit-ins throughout the South and to compare cities where sit-ins occurred with the majority of cities where they did not. They assess the relative importance of three channels of diffusion: movement organizations, social networks, and news media. The authors find that movement organizations played an important role in orchestrating protest; what mattered was a cadre of activists rather than mass membership. There is little evidence that social networks acted as a channel for diffusion among cities. By contrast, news media were crucial for conveying information about protests elsewhere. In addition, the authors demonstrate that sit-ins were most likely to occur where there were many college students, where adults in the black community had greater resources and autonomy, and where political opportunities were more favorable.

AB  - European ground squirrels typically inhabit dry grasslands throughout central and south-eastern Europe. Over the past decades, the species increasingly utilises anthropogenically shaped areas. During a 7-year field study on a population in a semi-urban habitat near Vienna, Austria, we monitored a 5.9-fold decrease in ground-squirrel abundance, with high densities having been maintained by immigration. The decline occurred parallel to an escalating urbanisation of the surroundings. A survey concerning the former dispersion of squirrels indicated an increase in population size during the [ate 1970s, after the region had been drained. Our findings suggest that improved river control of the Danube had ameliorated a sub-optimal habitat, which enhanced the formation of a dispersal sink. After several years of high population Levels, abundance decreased, most Likely due to anthropogenically promoted Landscape fragmentation and habitat degradation. The results of our study support the assumption that artificially induced environmental changes may be crucial for the persistence of small-mammal populations at the edge of their geographic range.

AB  - Aim To explore the determinants of island occupancy of 48 terrestrial bird species in an oceanic archipelago, accounting for ecological components while controlling for phylogenetic effects.
   Location The seven main islands of the Canary archipelago.
   Methods We obtained field data on population density, habitat breadth and landscape distribution in Tenerife, Fuerteventura and La Palma, aiming to sample all available habitats and the gradient of altitudes. In total, 1715 line transects of 0.5 km were carried out during the breeding season. We also reviewed the literature for data on occupancy, the distance between the Canary Islands and the nearest distribution border on the mainland, body size and endemicity of the 48 terrestrial bird species studied. Phylogenetic eigenvector regression was used to quantify (and to control for) the amount of phylogenetic signal.
   Results The two measurements of occupancy (number of occupied islands or 10 x 10 km UTM squares) were tightly correlated and produced very similar results. The occupancy of the terrestrial birds of the Canary Islands during the breeding season had a very low phylogenetic effect. Species with broader habitat breadth, stronger preferences for urban environments, smaller body size, and a lower degree of endemicity had a broader geographical distribution in the archipelago, occupying a larger number of islands and 10 x 10 UTM squares.
   Main conclusions The habitat-generalist species with a tolerance for novel urban environments tend to be present on more islands and to occupy a greater area, whereas large-sized species that are genetically differentiated within the islands are less widespread. Therefore, some properties of the ranges of these species are explicable from basic biological features. A positive relationship of range size with local abundance, previously shown in continental studies, was not found, probably because it relies on free dispersal on continuous landmasses, which may not be applicable on oceanic islands.

AB  - Five large (greater than 35 ha) urban bushland reserves in Greater Sydney were selected where herpetofaunal assemblages could be deduced and there were recent herpetofauna surveys. Four reserves (Rockdale Wetlands Corridor, Wolli Creek Valley, Burnt Bridge Creek Corridor and Middle Harbour Bushland Reserves) had been surrounded by residential development for more than 50 years. The fifth (University of Western Sydney, Richmond campus) was surrounded by agricultural and peri-urban development. Records from the scientific literature, local natural history groups, amateur herpetologists and council archives were used to gather historic information on the frogs and reptiles. Interviews were also conducted with researchers and neighbours of the reserves. Eight extant species were common to all reserves while another, predicted to be in all reserves, was universally absent. Despite the relatively large size of these bushland remnants, in all reserves the number of reptile and frog species had declined since urbanisation. The largest losses occurred in the four urban reserves. Seven species predicted to have occurred historically were now only present in the peri-urban site. Some herpetofaunal groups were more vulnerable than others. Goannas were locally extinct in urban reserves. Tree frogs and geckos were depleted while ground frogs and skinks were reduced to approximately half their original species numbers. This is in contrast to the peri-urban site where there had been no loss of tree frogs or goannas and generally more than half of the species in each group were extant. Urban impacts that appeared to relate to herpetofauna decline were direct human intervention that resulted in death or removal of individuals (e.g. goannas, large snakes), interference with habitat such as bush rock removal (e.g. smaller snakes, geckoes, skinks), fire (e.g. non-burrowing small residents), interference with the water cycle including infilling and pollution (e.g. frogs) and exotic predators (e.g. dragons, turtles, skinks). In general, herpetofauna with the least future prospects were those most susceptible to decline.These included the large, conspicuous fauna that required a substantial home range, attracted the attention of humans because of 'pet appeal' or due to their perceived danger; were vulnerable at some stage of the lifecycle to predation by feral species; and had specific habitat requirements for reproduction such as quality water or open sandy banks for egg incubation. Those that are small, generalist and unappealing to humans are most likely to survive. There is, therefore, little doubt that diversity in reserves will continue to dwindle unless strategies are devised to overcome the present trend. Current conservation strategies that generally target single species need to be expanded to ecosystem level to monitor threats and management implemented for their removal.

AB  - Green spaces play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological and social systems, a fact recognised in public policy commitments in both the UK and Europe. The amount of provision, the distribution of green space and the ease of access to such spaces are key contributors to social and ecological function in urban environments. We measured distance along the transport network to public green space available to households in Sheffield, and compared this with the distribution of private garden space. In addition, we used a geodemographic database, Mosaic UK, to examine how access to green space varies across different sectors of society. Public green spaces are chronically underprovided relative to recommended targets. For example, 64% of Sheffield households fail to meet the recommendation of the regulatory agency English Nature (EN), that people should live no further than 300 m from their nearest green space. Moreover, this figure rises to 72% if we restrict attention to municipal parks recognised by the local council. There is an overall reduction in coverage by green space when moving from neighbourhoods where green space is primarily publicly provided to those where it is privately provided. While access to public green space varies significantly across different social groups, those enjoying the greatest access include more deprived groups and older people. This study highlights the need for additional green space to be created and existing green space to be protected in light of increasing development pressure. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Artificial structures are becoming common features of the landscape in shallow waters of urban areas, but very little is known about their ecology. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), intertidal seawalls replace considerable portions of natural habitats, including rocky shores. Previous studies have shown that seawalls and rocky shores generally support similar assemblages of plants and animals, with important differences in relative abundances of some species. The behaviour of key consumers can have a fundamental role in structuring benthic assemblages, and it is, therefore, necessary to assess whether it is changed by the replacement of natural habitats with artificial structures. This study compares patterns of movement of the common patellid limpet Cellana tramoserica between seawalls and vertical rocky shores. The distances displaced, the orientation of movement and the homing behaviour of marked individuals were recorded from day to day, over a period of several tidal cycles (14 d) and for a longer period (ca. 3 mo), on several seawalls and rocky shores. Short-term patterns of movement (1 to 14 d) did not differ between structures. In contrast, after 3 mo, although the orientation of the movement remained random on both kinds of structures, limpets on seawalls had dispersed longer distances and tended not to retain their original positions. These results suggest that long-term dispersal of C. tramoserica, rather than foraging bouts, could be altered by the replacement of rocky shores with artificial structures. Differences in use of habitat by key consumers should be incorporated in models aimed at identifying the mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of different assemblages on natural and artificial structures.

AB  - Unlike many regions in the world where wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are threatened, in Australia they are a significant invasive species. As such, the molecular ecology of feral pigs was investigated to understand their social and population genetic structure. Samples from 269 adult animals were collected over their distribution ill southwestern Australia. Using 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we identified 7 inferred feral pig populations that had moderate heterozygosity (mean = 0.580) and displayed a high level of differentiation (mean R-ST = 0.180). In revealing the genetic structure of feral pigs, we detected anomalies in the pi native origin of some individuals. Samples from these animals were collected from 2 main areas: recently colonized regions that were previously uninfested, and established feral pig populations, where animals from geographically isolated areas had been introduced. In the latter, these corresponded to areas that were in close proximity to public road access and towns. Given the large distances immigrants were found from their population of origin (from 50 to > 400 km), the generally low levels of dispersal of southwest feral pigs, and the grouping and sex of these pigs, we suggest that these individuals have been deliberately and illegally translocated to supplement recreational hunting stocks. Additionally, we could not detect any genetic contribution in these feral pigs from domestic pig herds, suggesting that the deliberate release of domestic pigs to restock feral Populations is relatively uncommon. Our molecular data allowed some inferences regarding the Success or lack thereof of current, management practices, and offered considerable insights into the dynamics of the feral pig populations and identification of "new" approaches that may allow for better control of this highly destructive species.

AB  - Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) currently live in metapopulations in the parts of their range where plague, caused by the bacterium Yesinia pestis, has invaded. Prairie dogs are highly susceptible to the pathogen, with most animals within towns dying during Y. pestis outbreaks. A review of population genetic studies of prairie dogs demonstrates considerable differentiation between prairie dog towns. Despite declines and fluctuations in size of prairie dog populations, they continue to harbor considerable genetic variation. This results from continual dispersal and gene flow, likely along low-lying drainages that connect towns. When combined with estimates of population size, the landscape genetic approach described here will provide precise estimates of dispersal and gene flow, in addition to evaluation of long-term stability of prairie dog metapopulations.

AB  - In sewage rehabilitation planning, closed circuit television (CCTV) systems are the widely used inspection tools in assessing sewage structural conditions for non man entry pipes. Currently, the assessment of sewage structural conditions by manually interpretation oil CCTV images seems inefficient, especially for several thousands of frames in one inspection plan. Also, the assessment work significantly involves engineers' eye sight and professional experience. With a purpose of assisting general staffs in diagnosing pipe defects on CCTV inspection images, a diagnostic system by applying machine learning approaches is proposed in this paper. This research was first to use image process techniques, including wavelet transform and computation of co-occurrence matrices, for describing the textures of the pipe defects. Then, three neural network approaches, back-propagation neural network (BPN), radial basis network (RBN), and support vector machine (SVM), were adopted to classify pipe defect patterns, and their performances were compared and discussed. The diagnostic system of pipe defects was applied to a sewer system in the 9th district, Taichung City which is the largest city in middle Taiwan. The result shows that the diagnosis accuracy of 60%, derived by SVM is the best and also better than the diagnosis accuracy of 57.4%, derived by a Bayesian classifier. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent urban development along the US coasts has negatively impacted the local environment, and these impacts will only increase thanks to rapid regional population growth. Empirical spatially disaggregate land-use models provide a way to explore future conditions and environmental impacts before irreversible changes occur. An assumption of many models is that access to urban-employment centers is the major factor locating urban uses within a region, the opposite of the pattern seen in most natural amenity rich areas. As a result, it is unclear whether models focusing on center accessibility can be used to predict future land-use patterns in urbanizing coastal regions. In this paper the relationship between accessibility and the location of urban development was examined for coastal New Jersey, USA. Two questions were addressed through the analysis: (1) Is accessibility to urban or employment centers correlated with the location of urban conversions? (2) If accessibility is correlated with the location of urban conversion, does the inclusion of such variables into a land-use-change model improve the ability of the model to locate future urban development? Results from the analysis indicate that traditional accessibility relationships can be used to explain the location of urban conversions in New Jersey's coastal region, but inclusion of accessibility and other locating factors does not necessarily improve the predictive ability of a model. The accessibility relationship is contrary to findings in many other high-amenity areas, because, in part, of the importance of access to the region's transportation network.

AB  - Hong Kong (22 degrees N) is on the northern margins of the Asian tropics and has a native fig flora of 24 species. A total of 3.4 km(2) of the urban area on Hong Kong Island was surveyed for spontaneous and planted fig plants of reproductive size. The 1124 individuals included 14 species in four subgenera: seven native species (F. fistulosa, F. hirta, F. hispida, F. microcarap, F. pumila, F. subpisocarpa, and F. variegata), four of which were sometimes planted, one probably native (F. virens), one naturalizing species (F. religiosa), and five exotic species that occurred only in cultivation, two of which (F. altissima, F. rumphii) are pollinated and produce viable seeds. The native species in the two most common subgenera form distinct ecological guilds: those in subgenus Sycomorus bear large, many seeded, green or yellow figs and are bat-dispersed pioneers on exposed soil; those in subgenus Urostigma bear small, few-seeded, dark-purple figs and are largely bird-dispersed and epilithic. The density of potentially fruiting fig plants in the study area (2.3/ha) was within the range reported for tropical forests and between them they were visited by the entire urban frugivore fauna. This study shows the importance of the urban fig flora to urban wildlife and also highlights the risk of cultivated Ficus species becoming invasive, despite their obligate species-specific pollinator mutualisms.

AB  - As urban and suburban areas expand, the problem of sewage disposal spreads as well. Inappropriate planning of a sewage management system could impair water quality, destroy habitat, and threaten public health. Simply building a sewage interceptor system along the urban river corridor to handle the wastewater effluents without regard to the impacts from combined-sewer overflows (CSOs) in the storm events cannot fulfill the ultimate goal of environmental restoration in the receiving water body. This study therefore carries out a system-based assessment to search for the optimal operating strategy of the interceptor facilities with respect to biocomplexity or biodiversity in an urban river system. In particular, it focuses on the richness of the fish community in the biological systems, the effect of stress on the fish community by storm events, and their capacity for adaptive behavior in response to the CSO's impact in the Love River estuarine system, South Taiwan. By integrating the biological indicators in an environmental context, two simulation models describing the quality and quantity of storm water and their impact on the river water quality are calibrated and verified. The interactions of natural systems and engineered systems covering both spatial and temporal aspects can then be explored in terms of the predicted levels of dissoved oxygen (DO) along the river reaches so as to strengthen an ultimate optimal search for the best operational alternative for the interceptor system. In view of the inherent complexity of integrating simulation outputs at various scales to aid in building the optimization step, three regression submodels were derived beforehand. These submodels present a high potential for exhibiting, eliciting, and summarizing the nonlinear behavior between the CSO impacts and the DO levels in the river reaches. With the aid of such findings, this study finally applies a linear programming model to determine the optimal size of a constructed storage pond (i.e., a detention pond), based on several types of storm events in the study area. This is proved essential for minimizing the ecological risk in such a way so as to indirectly improve the biodiversity in the estuarine river system.

AB  - The problem of ageing water pipes manifesting leaks and breaks is common to municipalities throughout Canada, North America, and the world. Among them, the City of Toronto has been confronted with water main infrastructure problems, currently encountering a break rate of roughly two occurrences per week over a network of 5347 km. The appropriate corrective action, which aims to restore pipe integrity and prevent future breaks and leaks, should be decided based on a general knowledge of the state of deterioration of the water main network, a thorough understanding of the governing failure modes, and a clear identification of the problem areas. To achieve these goals, an extensive sampling and testing programme was undertaken by the University of Toronto in collaboration with the City of Toronto. The programme encompassed a period of three years, from 1998 to 2000, and involved the testing and analysis of 100 exhumed pipe samples, mostly cast iron, in the University's structural testing laboratories. The purpose of these tests was to ascertain the extent of material loss due to corrosion, the mechanical properties of the pipe material, and the mode of failure. Simultaneously, soil samples were extracted in the proximity of the sampled pipes, identified, and classified, and their corrosion aggressiveness was investigated through tests in the University's environmental and geotechnical engineering laboratories. The outcome of this interdisciplinary investigation, complemented by further research efforts, should lead to a clearer understanding of water main failure phenomena and contribute to the efforts of the many cities endeavouring to minimize the number of break occurrences and prioritize their maintenance and rehabilitation schedules.

With the arrival of Italian army and occupation of the city on 4 November 1918, the Italian faction gradually assumed control, a process which was completed on 5 December when it took over the governorship.

AB  - We develop a stochastic spatial model for Aedes aegypti populations based on the life cycle of the mosquito and its dispersal. Our validation corresponds to a monitoring study performed in Buenos Aires. Lacking information with regard to the number of breeding sites per block, the corresponding parameter (BS) was adjusted to the data. The model is able to produce numerical data in very good agreement with field results during most of the year, the exception being the fall season. Possible causes of the disagreement are discussed. We analyzed the mosquito dispersal as an advantageous strategy of persistence in the city and simulated the dispersal of females from a source to the surroundings along a 3-year period observing that several processes occur simultaneously: local extinctions, recolonization processes (resulting from flight and the oviposition performed by flyers), and colonization processes resulting from the persistence of eggs during the winter season. In view of this process, we suggest that eradication campaigns in temperate climates should be performed during the winter time for higher efficiency.

AB  - The characteristics of the rice grain, particularly its hard, tight husk and nutrient content, make it an ideal grain to accompany migrating people. This paper discusses rice diversity and movement from a historical perspective by providing contrasting examples from the homeland of Asian rice, Madagascar and West Africa. The value of modern analytical techniques to understand the origin, diversification and movement of rice is discussed. The following points emerge:
   1. No evidence exists to support the center of origin and the center of diversity of rice being the same area, and molecular studies support multiple domestication events probably over a wide area.
   2. Inter-subspecific hybridization and diversification after a genetic bottleneck account for much of the traditional rice diversity of Madagascar.
   3. Introduction of Asian rice (O. sativa) to West Africa has resulted in partial replacement of indigenous African rice, O. glaberrima, introgression has occurred from Asian into African rice, and recently a new interspecific genepool has been developed by researchers with the aim of combining the best characters of both rice species. Finally, the recent consequences of human migration from rural to urban areas and the impact on the rice ecosystem are discussed with particular reference to Malaysia. The common trend of change from transplanting to direct seeding rice and accompanying ecological changes in rice fields are discussed.

AB  - The houbara bustard in the Canary Islands is included into the category 'Endangered' on the Spanish Bird Red List according to suspected declines in bird numbers, the loss of previously occupied areas and the suggested endemicity of the taxon. This paper deals with the population size and the distribution pattern of the houbara bustard in Fuerteventura (the largest island occupied by the species in the Canary archipelago, 1730 kin 2) and analyses its habitat use according to topography. soil. vegetation and human impact variables. We employ distance sampling on 1471 (early spring) and 602 (summer) 500-m transects and measure habitat characteristics within the transects to estimate local densities and population sizes and to test whether the features of the used habitats (as measured in transects where the species was recorded) differed from those available (measured in the whole sample). Topographic and anthropic features are the main determinants of the habitat use of the species, while other descriptors related to vegetation structure and substrate characteristics play a minor role in its habitat preferences. The slope of the terrain is the most important habitat feature constraining the occurrence of the houbara bustard. The proximity of urban areas. the density of paved roads and rural tracks and the extension of agricultural fields also adversely influence its distribution pattern in Fuerteventura. These habitat patterns does not change between summer and early spring considering the whole population of the species (i.e. without considering sexual or age-related differences). Population size is estimated at 177 birds for the whole Fuerteventura island during the breeding season (90% confidence interval: 108-258 birds). Only five areas comprising 247 km 2 include 80.8%, of the total population in this island, although four of them are not included into the regional network of protected natural sites.

AB  - Ecosystem-scale networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools, but their effectiveness is difficult to quantify in a time frame appropriate to species conservation because of uncertainties in the data available. The dugong (Dugong dugon) is a mobile marine species that occurs in shallow inshore waters of an ecosystem-scale network of MPAs (the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area [GBRWHA]). We developed a rapid approach to assess risk to dugongs in the region and evaluate options to ameliorate that risk. We used expert opinion and a Delphi technique to identify and rank 5 human factors with the potential to adversely affect dugongs and their sea grass habitats: netting, indigenous hunting, trawling, vessel traffic, and poor-quality terrestrial runoff. We then quantified and compared the distribution of these factors with a spatially explicit model of dugong distribution. We estimated that approximately 96% of habitat of high conservation value for dugongs in the GBRWHA is at low risk from human activities. Using a sensitivity analysis, we found that to decrease risk, commercial netting or indigenous bunting bad to be reduced in remote areas and the effects of vessel traffic, terrestrial runoff and commercial netting had to be reduced in urban areas. Ibis approach enabled us to compare and rank risks so as to identify the most severe risks and locate specific sites that require further management attention.

AB  - Urban landscapes vary greatly across North America and long-term data on the nesting biology of Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) from a variety of urban environments will improve our understanding of these poorly studied populations. We studied Cooper's hawks nesting in the metropolitan Milwaukee area, Wisconsin, USA, over a 12-year period, 1993-2004. Nesting success for 254 first nesting attempts averaged 64.6% with means of 2.27 young per laying pair and 3.53 young per successful pair. For 8 second nesting attempts (i.e., re-nests), nesting success averaged 87.5% with means of 2.57 young per laying pair and 3.00 young per successful pair. Productivity for first nesting attempts did not vary over the 12-year period, and productivity for re-nests did not differ from first nesting attempts. We documented evidence of nest predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor) and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis). On average, second year (SY [i.e., 1-yr-old]) Cooper's hawks comprised 14.6% (43 of 295 breeding birds; 21.5% [37 of 172] of F and 4.9% [6 of 123] of M) of the known breeding population. The percentage of SY breeders within this population declined over the 12-year period, suggesting a relatively young population. Cooper's hawks consistently reoccupied nest sites annually after initial discovery over an estimated 2 generations of breeding adults, suggesting that population density for our study was at least stable. We trapped 105 breeding adults, including 5 natal dispersal birds. Based on long-term, relatively high reproduction, repeated re-occupancy of nest sites, and confirmed recruitment from within this population, we suggest that these nesting areas were not marginal or inferior habitats and that urban Cooper's hawks in this study area were not a sink population. We recommend no active management of this population at this time; however, additional information for nesting Cooper's hawks from other urban environs will expand our knowledge base for these populations.

AB  - Pacific Northwest (PNW) streams in the United States were impacted by the 20th century development, when removal of instream structure and channelization degraded an aquatic habitat. The lower Kelley Creek in southeast Portland, USA was channelized during the 1930's Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects. Stream restoration reintroduced pool-riffle sequences and heterogeneous substrates to protect salmonids while mitigating impacts from flooding. We investigated whether the restored pool-riffle morphology changed substantially following effective discharge events. We examined channel forms for four reaches representing three time periods-pre-development (two reference reaches), development and restoration. We conducted thalweg profiles, cross-sections and pebble counts along the reaches to examine how channel geometry, residual pool dimensions and particle size distribution changed following effective discharge events. The effective discharge flows altered the restoration reach more substantially than the reference reaches. The restoration reach decreased in median particle size, and its cross-sectional geometry aggraded near its margins. However, the residual pool morphology remained in equilibrium. Richardson Creek's reference reach degraded at the substrate level, while Kelley Creek's reference reach remained in equilibrium. The restoration reach's aggradation may have resulted from sedimentation along the nearby Johnson Creek. In contrast, Richardson Creek's degradation occurred as upstream land use may have augmented flows. Stream channels with low gradient pool-riffle morphologies are ideal for salmonid spawning and rearing and should be protected and restored within urban corridors. The findings of our study suggest that the connectivity of streams and the dynamic fluvial geomorphology of stream channels should be considered for stream restoration projects in humid temperate climates.

AB  - The vehicle of urban transit is a complex system that consists of various electric, electronic, and mechanical equipments, and the maintenance cost of this complex and large-scale system generally occupies sixty percent of the LCC (Life Cycle Cost). For reasonable establishing of maintenance strategies, safety security and cost limitation must be considered at the same time. The concept of system reliability has been introduced and optimized as the key of reasonable maintenance strategies. For optimization, three preceding studies were accomplished; standardizing a maintenance classification, constructing RBD (Reliability Block Diagram) of VVVF (Variable Voltage Variable Frequency) urban transit, and developing a web based reliability evaluation system. Historical maintenance data in terms of reliability index can be derived from the web based reliability evaluation system. In this paper, we propose applying inverse problem analysis method and hybrid neuro-genetic algorithm to system reliability optimization for using historical maintenance data in database of web based system. Feed-forward multi-layer neural networks trained by back propagation are used to find out the relationship between several component reliability (input) and system reliability (output) of structural system. The inverse problem can be formulated by using neural network. One of the neural network training algorithms, the back propagation algorithm, can attain stable and quick convergence during training process. Genetic algorithm is used to find the minimum square error.

AB  - Cost-effective and permissible tunneling can occur only if ground movement prediction is refined to accommodate changes in both the urban environment and tunneling technology. As cities age, tunnels are being installed closer to existing structures and in increasingly complicated belowground conditions. The reality of stacked tunnels, abandoned facilities, and more extensive use of underground space raises the question of whether relationships derived for single open-shield tunnels in free-field conditions can adequately predict ground movement for modern tunneling techniques with more complicated site conditions. Traditional empirical methods to predict maximum surface settlements and the percentage of lost ground for paired tunnels of the new Austrian tunneling method (NATM) in noncohesive soils are evaluated. Predictive data are compared with field measurements for grouted and nongrouted sections. Results showed that the estimated maximum settlement values of an NATM tunnel were highly similar to those of an open shield tunnel for both the grouted and ungrouted sections, although in some cases the Gaussian shape significantly underestimated the depth of the settlement trough in the outer 30% to 40%. Grouting substantially altered the amount of settlement. The average percentage of volume of lost ground with grouting was 1.6%, whereas the value was 5.2 % where no grouting occurred. The empirical methods typically generated a fairly reasonable set of responses for an NATM tunnel.

AB  - This article explores the juxtaposition of the 1853 Irish Industrial Exhibition in Dublin and the dramatic rise of department stores in the city during the same decade. It analyses the aims, structure and reception of the 1853 Exhibition within the context of the Irish industrial movement, the economic modernity of the post-Famine era and the dramatic changes to consumer culture which were occurring during the 1850s. The article takes as its focus the hitherto neglected 'monster house' controversy - conducted in pamphlets and public lectures regarding the growth of Dublin's department stores. Coinciding with the 1853 Exhibition, the controversy rehearsed many of the same concerns regarding economic and social structures in Irish urban society in the wake of the Famine. Consideration of the 'monster house' controversy alongside the issues raised by the 1853 Exhibition allows a new perspective on the development of middle-class urban life in Dublin during the mid-nineteenth century.

AB  - This article illustrates the challenges and potential advantages associated with using a sequence-based method to describe the structure of individual residential mobility histories. The authors examine the existence and prevalence of distinctive patterns of residential mobility across a rural-suburban-urban place-type continuum. They identify a finite set of empirically common residential trajectories that describe patterns of movement across the geographic landscape. This approach reveals (1) a great deal of stability in patterns of residential attachment; (2) that residential movement is frequently organized in terms of place-type, rather than in terms of specific locations; and (3) that certain place-types are rarely linked together in residential histories, which suggests that the universe of place-types contains social boundaries. Combining the empirically observed residential trajectories with basic demographic characteristics of individuals confirms general expectations from the life course perspective about the roles and positions individuals occupy over different stages of adulthood.

Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod.

AB  - Ailanthus altissima has a long history of invasion in urban areas and is currently spreading into suburban and rural areas in the eastern U.S. The objectives of our study were to (1) determine whether A. altissima seed dispersal distance differed between populations on the edges of open fields and intact deciduous forest, and (2) determine whether dispersal differed for north and south winds. We also assessed the relationship between seed characteristics and distance from source populations in fields and forests, and whether seeds disperse at different rates throughout the dispersal season. Using two fields, two intact forest stands, and one partially harvested stand, we sampled the seed rain at 10 in intervals 100 in into each site from October to April 2002-2003. We compared seed density in field and intact forests using a three-way ANOVA with distance from source, wind direction, and environmental structure as independent variables. To assess the accuracy of common empirical dispersal models, mean seed density data at each site were fitted with alternative regression models. We found that mean seed dispersal distance depended on environmental structure and wind direction, a result driven in large part by dispersal at a single site where seed density did not decline with distance. The two alternative regression models fit each site's dispersal curve equally well. More seeds were dispersed early than in mid- or late-season. Large, heavy seeds traveled as far as small light seeds. Turbulent winds appear to be necessary for seed release, as indicated by a wind tunnel experiment. A. altissima is able to disperse long distances into fields and into mature forests, and can reach canopy gaps and other suitable habitats at least 100 in from the forest edge. It is an effective disperser and can spread rapidly in fragmented landscapes where edges and other high light environments occur. These conditions are increasingly common throughout the eastern U.S. and in other temperate regions worldwide.

AB  - Understanding mechanisms that inhibit population persistence in fragmentation-sensitive species is a key to conservation and management. It has become clear that species vary in their sensitivity to habitat fragmentation caused by urbanization and other land uses. We studied variation in avian reproductive success in coastal sage scrub habitat across a fragmentation gradient (interior of large habitat blocks ( > 2300 ha) --> edge of large habitat blocks --> large habitat fragments (37-80 ha) --> small habitat fragments (5-17 ha)) in urban southwestern California. We focused on four species of birds: the shrub-nesting wrentit (Chamaea fasciata) and California towhee (Pipilo crissalis) and the ground-nesting spotted towhee (P. maculatus) and rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps). Snake abundance was the best predictor of nest failure in the ground-nesting species, whereas abundance of avian predators (Corvidae, Mimidae) was associated with nest failure of the wrentit and a combination of snake and avian predator abundance was correlated with nest failure of the California towhee. Avian nest predator abundance increased across the fragmentation gradient; by contrast, snake abundance decreased across this gradient. As a result, top-down control of reproductive success in populations of the spotted towhee and rufous-crowned sparrow was largely absent in habitat fragments. These two species enjoyed much higher nest success on fragments yet, paradoxically, both species are sensitive to fragmentation whereas the shrub-nesting species are not. Our findings suggest that another process - perhaps differential survivorship or dispersal - yields reduced abundance of ground-nesting species in habitat fragments. Studies of top-down control and trophic cascades in fragmented landscapes should reflect that the strength of top-down forces across a landscape varies with characteristics of predator and prey and their autecological responses to ecological gradients.

AB  - We tested whether the landscape occupancy and local population size of the monophagous butterfly Cupido minimus can be predicted by patch size and isolation of its host plant or by other habitat characteristics. C mininius and its larval food plant Anthyllis vulneraria are classified as rare and endangered in northern Germany. Adults of C minimus are ranked as the most sedentary butterfly species in northern Europe.
   Around the city of Gottingen (Germany), we checked all known locations of A. vulneraria (n = 70) in June 2002 for butterfly eggs (in blooming flowerheads) and adult butterflies (within 20-min transects).
   We found eggs of C minimus or a high number of adults (>7) in all habitats with A. vulneraria (which are calcareous grasslands) even when isolated up to 2-4 km. In multiple regression analyses, local population size of adult butterflies was positively related to the cover of its larval food plant A. vulneraria explaining 65% of variance. Cover of A. vulneraria increased with increasing habitat area and increasing cover of plant species in flower and decreased with increasing cover of shrub layer. Habitat isolation and further factors describing habitat quality were not related to C. minimus population size or cover of its larval food plant.
   The results suggest that dispersal ability of C minimus is greater than expected and that management should focus to increase A. vulneraria patches. For conservation, low impact grazing once a year and removing of excessive shrubs in winter seems to be the most appropriate strategies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To assess whether urbanization influences the spatial ecology of a rare and protected venomous reptilian predator, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum, we compared home range (HR) size and movement parameters at three sites varying in degree of urbanization in the Sonoran Desert. We predicted that the urban population of H. suspectum would exhibit smaller HRs, avoid human structures and show less movement. Multivariate analysis indicated that males generally exhibited larger HRs and had higher movement rates and activity levels than females at all three sites. Contrary to our predictions, however, HR size and movement parameters did not vary across the sites in relation to the level of urbanization. At the urban site, individuals often crossed narrow roads and regularly used artificial structures as refuges for extended periods. Furthermore, the population sex ratio at the urban site was female-biased, consistent with the expectation that occupation of larger HRs and higher movement rates results in higher mortality for males in urbanized areas. Gila monsters did not appear to alter certain aspects of their spatial ecology in response to low levels of human activity but additional work will be required to assess population viability and possible effects in the long term and with higher levels of urbanization.

AB  - The diversity of native species assemblages and that of indigenous cultures that once characterized the temperate forests of southern Chile have experienced a process of homogenization ever since the Spanish conquest. Today this process continues to erode both biotic and cultural diversity. With the goal of linking ecological research with actions to conserve the biological and cultural richness of this region, we established the Institute of Ecological Research Chiloe. The Institute's philosophy and activities involve three approaches: (1) participation of professional ecologists in environmental education and decision making, through collaboration with the community at local, regional, and global scales. (2) programs of ecological education, which include planting indigenous trees in urban areas and creating a local botanical garden with representative Chilean forest species. (3) critical analyses of the narrow economic and utilitarian environmental ethics that currently prevail in Chile, and often in other Latin American nations, and examination of traditional or novel alternative ethics and perspectives that address multiple interrelations between biological and cultural dimensions.

AB  - Like other coastal zones around the world, the inland sea ecosystem of Washington (USA) and British Columbia (Canada), an area known as the Salish Sea, is changing under pressure from a growing human population, conversion of native forest and shoreline habitat to urban development, toxic contamination of sediments and species, and overharvest of resources. While billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore other coastal ecosystems around the world, there still is no successful model for restoring estuarine or marine ecosystems like the Salish Sea. Despite the lack of a guiding model, major ecological principles do exist that should be applied as people work to design the Salish Sea and other large marine ecosystems for the future. We suggest that the following 10 ecological principles serve as a foundation for educating the public and for designing a healthy Salish Sea and other coastal ecosystems for future generations: (1) Think ecosystem: political boundaries are arbitrary; (2) Account for ecosystem connectivity; (3) Understand the food web; (4) Avoid fragmentation; (5) Respect ecosystem integrity; (6) Support nature's resilience; (7) Value nature: it's money in your pocket; (8) Watch wildlife health; (9) Plan for extremes; and (10) Share the knowledge.

AB  - We propose all enhanced lightweight medium access control (eL-MAC) protocol which combines scheduled based MAC mechanism and adaptive multi-timeslot allocation (AMTA). Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of tiny wireless devices typically cooperate with each other to aggregate sensor data to the base station. It is increasingly being used in a wide range of environmental application. Such applications like habitat monitoring, large-scale industrial monitoring and urban population monitoring require years of operation period with low rate data transmission. Hence, providing a reliable data transmission and efficiency ill energy usage are critical in order to prolong the network lifetime. eL-MAC solves the problems that normally happen in WSN such as idle listening, over hearing and hidden terminal problem, by introducing a slotting communication mechanism where node only transmits in its own timeslot and sleep in other time slot if there is no activity. Furthermore, eL-MAC allows multiple timeslots to be Occupied by a node according to the traffic requirement. The Simulation result shows our protocol prolongs the network lifetime compared to LMAC mechanism, without reducing the channel utilization.

AB  - Stream restoration projects that aim to rehabilitate ecosystem health have not considered surface-subsurface linkages, although stream water and groundwater interaction has an important role in sustaining stream ecosystem functions. The present study examined the effect of constructed riffles and a step on hyporheic exchange flow and chemistry in restored reaches of several N-rich agricultural and urban streams in southern Ontario. Hydrometric data collected from a network of piezometers and conservative tracer releases indicated that the constructed riffles and steps were effective in inducing hyporheic exchange. However, despite the use of cobbles and boulders in the riffle construction, high stream dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were depleted rapidly with depth into the hyporheic zones. Differences between observed and predicted nitrate concentrations based on conservative ion concentration patterns indicated that these hyporheic zones were also nitrate sinks. Zones of low hydraulic conductivity and the occurrence of interstitial fines in the restored cobble-boulder layers suggest that siltation and clogging of the streambed may reduce the downwelling of oxygen- and nitrate-rich stream water. Increases in streambed DO levels and enhancement of habitat for hyporheic fauna that result from riffle-step construction projects may only be temporary in streams that receive increased sediment and nutrient inputs from urban areas and croplands.

T2  - CONTEMPORARY SOUTH ASIA
LA  - English
AB  - This article identifies the challenges the ulema (community of Muslim scholars) in Britain face if they are to connect with British Muslims from South Asian backgrounds, especially two groups of British Pakistanis; the disaffected, inner-city ` rude boys', and students on campus attracted to more radical groups. The diversity of expressions of Islam available on the Internet and in many large cities indicates the extent to which the ulema are but one centre of authority in a proliferating, polycentric, religious reality. Furthermore, British South Asians can now access Islamic groups with roots outside South Asia, whether Wahhabi/Salafi (early generations) traditions funded by Saudi petrol dollars or Hizb at-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), a movement with origins in Palestine. It is clear that the search for relevant expressions of Islam cannot be divorced from ` identity politics'. Thus, this article explores the dynamics of the latter and its interplay with Islam. Finally, four exceptional British-based ulema are depicted that, in different ways, are seeking to connect. Their different contexts and constituencies are considered. Cumulatively, they indicate both the vitality of their traditions, the pragmatism characteristic of much of their developing interaction with wider society, and the potential and pitfalls of such an engagement.

AB  - The free-flowing Clinch and Powell River Basin, located in southwestern Virginia, United States, historically had one of the richest assemblages of native fish and freshwater mussels in the world. Nearly half of the species once residing here are now extinct, threatened, or endangered. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's framework for conducting an ecological risk assessment was used to structure a watershed-scale analysis of human land use, in-stream habitat quality, and their relationship to native fish and mussel populations in order to develop future management strategies and prioritize areas in need of enhanced protection. Our analyses indicate that agricultural and urban land uses as well as proximity to mining activities and transportation corridors are inversely related to fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) and mussel species diversity. Forward stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that coal mining had the most impact on fish IBI followed by percent cropland and urban area in the riparian corridor (R-2 = 0.55, p = 0.02); however, these analyses suggest that other site-specific factors are important. Habitat quality measures accounted for as much as approximately half of the variability in fish IBI values if the analysis was limited to sites within a relatively narrow elevation range. These results, in addition to other data collected in this watershed, suggest that nonhabitat-related stressors (e.g., accidental chemical spills) also have significant effects on biota in this basin. The number of cooccurring human land uses was inversely related to fish IBI (r= -0.49, p < 0.01). Sites with greater than or equal to2 co-occurring land uses had > 90% probability of having <2 mussel species present. Our findings predict that many mussel concentration sites are vulnerable to future extirpation. In addition, our results suggest that protection and enhancement of naturally vegetated riparian corridors, better controls of mine effluents and urban runoff, and increased safeguards against accidental chemical spills, as well as reintroduction or augmentation of threatened and endangered species, may help sustain native fish and mussel populations in this watershed.

TI  - The shape of urban experience: a reevaluation of Lynch's five elements
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper I attempt to develop a comprehensive, robust model of urban morphology from a phenomenological and behavioral perspective. I do so by comparing the findings of two extensive empirical studies of users' experiences of urban public space: one primarily examining people's perceptions in relation to the practical task of wayfinding, and the other my own research into people's playful behavior in Melbourne, London, Berlin, and New York. Lynch himself called attention to "our delight... in ambiguity, mystery... surprise and disorder", but little is known about what role specific spatial conditions might have in framing such experiences, or indeed about the diversity of impractical activities people actually pursue in urban spaces. With this paper I seek to fill these gaps. Three elements common to both studies (paths, nodes, and edges) describe the fundamental topological structure of space in relation to movement and visibility. I focus on the four spatial elements which differ between the two models (landmarks, districts, thresholds, and props). Field observations illustrate ways in which the latter two spatial elements frame particular noninstrumental, 'playful' experiences which are characteristic of the urban condition: spontaneous encounters with strangers; unfamiliar and risky bodily experiences; distraction, and interpreting new meanings in the urban fabric.

AB  - The Peille earthquake (M-W = 3.4) occurred on 1st November 1999, 15 km to the north of the cities of Nice, Monaco and Menton. This event was very well recorded by 20 seismological stations located between 6 and 50 km from the epicenter. We used a non-linear location method and showed that the earthquake occurred at shallow depth (3 +/-1.5 km) close to the Peille-Laghet fault trace. Moreover the computed focal mechanism is consistent with the left lateral strike slip movement of this fault. An empirical Green's function deconvolution showed that the rupture occurred on a fault portion smaller than 600 m long. This earthquake was also the occasion to point out remarkable site effect amplifications in some areas of the city of Nice.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which preservice teachers participating in a semester of urban immersion would evidence a change in attitudes toward urban teaching based on their experiences in the program. The experiences of 22 program participants were examined to qualify potential change.
   Study methodology included analysis of student journals, content of focus groups conducted throughout the semester, student discussion observed in coursework, and personal interviews conducted at the end of the urban experience. Analysis revealed common themes including the importance of direct experience with diversity and personal reflection as critical components of multicultural growth. The experience served to dispel myths and stereotypes regarding urban teaching, to expand university students' understanding of privilege and power in society, and to encourage movement from a color denial perspective to an appreciation for and respect of cultural differences.
   The study illustrates the potential of urban immersion to alter attitudes toward working with diverse populations of children and families. Implications for the development of initiatives geared toward this end include the importance of cultural immersion, the provision of opportunities for critical self-reflection, and intentional efforts to encourage relationship building as deciding elements fostering multicultural growth.

AB  - Central reservations, also known as median strips, are strips of ground, usually paved or landscaped, that divide the carriageways of a highway. We trapped beetles in vegetated central reservations of three Ring Roads around the city of Helsinki, Finland, in 2002, and collected a total of 1512 individuals and 110 species. Ground beetles were the most abundant beetle family collected with 749 individuals and 29 species, followed by rove beetles (410 individuals, 31 species) and weevils (131 individuals, 15 species). Central reservations of the most recently constructed Ring Road II collected significantly more ground-beetle species and rove-beetle individuals than the two older roads (Ring Roads I and III). However, in Ring Road III we collected slightly more weevil individuals, and significantly more individuals of the rest of the beetles. As expected, most species collected were associated with open habitats, eurytopic and capable of flight. Regarding species characteristics, the three roads differed with respect to their catches of short-winged, saprophagous, predator/mixed-diet, small-sized (3.1-6 mm), common and nationally rare species, whereas the occurrences of long-winged, plant-eating, very small (< 3 mm), large (> 6 mm) and moderately common species were more even. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling demonstrated that the beetle community of the central reservations of Ring Road II was different from the communities of Ring Roads I and III. There appeared to be more within-road variation in community structure at these last two roads. Catches of the nationally vulnerable carabid Amara equestris, and several considered rare species, indicate that central reservations have conservation potential.

AB  - Whenever the channel coherence time is less than the symbol duration, a mobile station (MS) receiver can exploit time diversity to enhance its probability of error performance. One way to ensure a channel coherence time less than symbol duration Is by use of a carefully-controlled oscillating-beam antenna array at the base station (BS). Here, beam pattern movement creates small coherence times.
   In this paper, with an oscillating-beam-pattern antenna array at the BS, the time varying channel Is modeled to evaluate the channel coherence time and the available diversity In the MS. Here, a geometric-based stochastic channel model (GSCM) is used, and a circular coverage area is assumed. For a mid-sized city center, coherence times are shown to correspond to 1/7(th) the symbol duration, suggesting a 7-fold time diversity is available at the MS when the BS's antenna array pattern is carefully controlled.

TI  - HAWKING IN THE CREATIVE CITY Rice Rhapsody, sexuality and the cultural politics of New Asia in Singapore
T2  - FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - VALUES
AB  - The development of creative industries in Asia in recent years has seen the rise of Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore as post-modern centres of innovation. From the new co-produced pan-Asian horror and action film genres, to brands like Samsung and Creative Technology, to the branding of cities through new nationalisms, creative industries are transforming cultural industries by merging the arts with technology and business. Characterised by cluster, convergence, content creation and value-adding, creative industries not only enhance a country's economic wealth and promote international trade through intellectual property and tourism, they also produce new cultures that are more regional and less national and global.
   This paper critically examines how a regional queer Asian culture has emerged in Singapore as a result of its creative industry developments. Unlike the sex tourism of gay Bangkok or the social movement of queer Taiwan, queer Singapore is created by cultural and media policies, and gay and lesbian entrepreneurship. In a country that prosecutes homosexuality, queer commerce has flourished. The city-state is now recognised in the mainstream and the subculture as the new regional Mardi Gras centre of Asia. Queer Singapore shows how sexual recognition is constituted, not through the post-Stonewall politics of sexual rights, but through what I will argue as the Foucauldian ethics of identity.
   This paper will frame this approach against current studies in creative industries and map the changing field of cultural policy studies. Rather than accounting for the new sexual culture through the appeal to social diversity by benchmarking it as a gay index essential to the soft infrastructure of a creative city, this paper attempts to formulate a critical creative industry framework to understand how an expedient culture has been transformed into a pragmatic resource for determining action. Singapore's pragmatic approach to culture offers such a model to rethink how sexuality can function as a technology of cultural policy.

AB  - Unplanned urban occupation at Natal city (Rio Grande do Norte State) triggers problems with regard to landslide. This paper analyzes the slopes stability of a pilot area in a sand dune body in order to subsidize the planned use of the area. The study area is a densely occupied neighborhood (Bairro de Mae Luiza BML) and a protected park (Parque Estadual Dunas do Natal PEDN) adjacent to it. Field works were carried out in order to collect sedimentary samples and ground control points (GCP). Grain size analyses, direct shear tests and geoprocessing analyses were proceeding. Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and a slope map were generated. The stability analyses were based on the comparison between the friction angle obtained in laboratory and the slope value obtained from a DEM. We did cross sections in order to show the distribution of human occupation and dune morphology. A risk inventory of mass movement was carried out in the BML area through observation criteria of classification based on evidences of instability. The analysis of stability shows that the PEDN area, although not yet occupied, presents landslide risk due to high declination. The risk inventory of BML showed that most of the investigated area presented medium to high risk condition, mainly due to unplanned human intervention. Several signs of instability were found. With these analyses it's possible to infer what could happen to PEDN, if it is subjected to the same occupation process observed in its neighborhood. Therefore, it is necessary to preserve, monitor and inspect the PEDN area.

AB  - The occurrence of substantial quantities of black carbon (BC) in urban soil due to local dispersal following incomplete combustion of fossil fuel complicates the determination of labile soil organic carbon (SOC). Estimates of SOC content were made from loss on ignition (LOI) analyses undertaken on samples (0-15 cm depth) from comprehensive soil geochemical surveys of three UK urban areas. We randomly selected 10 samples from each decile of the LOI distribution for each of the surveys of Coventry (n = 808), Stoke-on-Trent (n = 737) and Glasgow (n = 1382) to investigate the proportions of labile SOC and BC. We determined their total organic carbon (TOC) and BC contents, and by difference the labile SOC content, and investigated the linear relationship of the latter with SOC estimates based on LOI analyses. There was no evidence for a difference in the slope of the regression for the three urban areas. We then used a linear regression of labile SOC based on LOI analyses (r(2) = 0.81) to predict labile SOC for all survey samples from the three urban areas. We attribute the significantly higher median BC concentrations in Glasgow (1.77%, compared with 0.46 and 0.59% in Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent) to greater dispersal of coal ash across the former. An analysis of the 30 samples showed that LOI at 450 degrees C accounts for a consistent proportion of BC in each sample (r(2) = 0.97). Differences between TOC (combustion at 1050 degrees C after removal of inorganic carbon) and an LOI estimate of SOC may be a cost-effective method for estimation of BC. Previous approaches to estimation of urban SOC contents based on half the mean SOC content of the equivalent associations under pasture, underestimate the empirical mean value.

AB  - Aim Sheetweb spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae, subfamily Linyphiinae) exemplify a highly mobile group of farmland arthropods with very variable abundances in crops within and between years. Despite their dominance in crops during summer, they overwinter predominantly in perennial non-crop habitats, and their densities in crops during spring should therefore depend on the amount of favourable overwintering habitat in the surrounding landscape. We tested the effect of landscape composition on sheetweb spider abundance with special attention to the range of their aerial dispersal and weather dependence.
   Location The study was carried out in 18 non-overlapping landscape sectors of 3 km radius around the city of Gottingen (Germany), forming a gradient from structurally simple, with up to 85% arable land, to structurally complex, with high percentages of grassland and other non-crop habitats.
   Methods Sheetweb spider abundances in winter wheat fields were sampled during May and June 2001-2003 with a distance method. They were related to landscape composition at 11 spatial scales between 95 and 3000 m radius around the study sites.
   Results In 2001 and 2003, spider abundances were enhanced by high percentages of non-crop habitats in 1-3 km circumference (e.g. from 18 to 130 m(-2) in late May 2001), and multiplied during consecutive sampling periods (e.g. from on average 36 to 131 m(-2) between mid-May and late June 2001). Spider abundances were constantly low and unrelated to the landscape context in 2002. In that year, immigration appeared to be inhibited by factors connected to exceptionally high amounts of rain during May.
   Main conclusions Sheetweb spiders responded to landscape composition up to several kilometres away and the effects varied between years, demonstrating the need to consider large space and time-scales to understand their population dynamics. Semi-natural habitats should be preserved to enhance these important natural enemies of crop pests in agricultural landscapes.

We found that in the wastewater enriched Bow River, Alberta rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) biomass increased over 25-fold, and brown trout (Salmo trutta) biomass increased 5-fold, however total sportfish biomass did not increase below the nutrient input point source. This was due to a dramatic downstream decrease in mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) biomass to 2% of the average biomass upstream of the municipal effluent source. The spatial pattern over a 177-km river section encompassing the city of Calgary, showed that the increase in trout abundance approximately tracked the expected nutrient concentrations in the river, but with a downstream lag of 20-30 km. Mountain whitefish biomass over the 177 km was inversely related to the dominant trout species, rainbow trout. Invertebrate abundance, macrophyte biomass and phytoplankton biomass all increased below the wastewater treatment plant outfalls. However, periphyton data were highly variable and showed no response. We propose several hypotheses as regards the factors that may have led to the decrease in mountain whitefish, based on the data from all trophic levels and the spatial pattern for fish biomass. Proposed factors influencing the mountain whitefish decline were; altered competitive ability because of macrophyte abundance, ammonia toxicity and barriers to movement (weirs).

AB  - Cold climate imposes special requirements on urban drainage systems, arising from extended storage of precipitation and pollutants in the catchment showpack, processes occurring in the snowpack, and changes in catchment surface and transport network by snow and ice. Consequently, the resulting catchment response and runoff quantity differ from those experienced in snow- and ice-free seasons. Sources of pollutants entering urban snowpacks include airborne fallout, pavement and roadside deposits, and applications of de-icing and anti-skid agents. In the snowpack, snow, water and chemicals are subject to various processes, which affect their movement through the pack and eventual release during the melting process. Soluble constituents are flushed from the snowpack early during the melt; hydrophobic substances generally stay in the pack until the very end of melt and coarse solids with adsorbed pollutants stay on the ground after the melt is finished. The impacts of snowmelt on receiving waters have been measured mostly by the snowmelt chemical composition and inferences about its environmental significance. Recently, snowmelt has been tested by standard bioassays and often found toxic. Toxicity was attributed mostly to chloride and trace metals, and contributed to reduced diversity of benthic and plant communities. Thus, snowmelt and winter runoff discharged from urban drainage threaten aquatic ecosystems in many locations and require further studies with respect to advancing their understanding and development of best management practices.

AB  - In August 2002, the presence of the Puma concolor began to be detected near Itapua State Park (PEI), in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre. This study aimed at: registering the species in the regions using indirect methods; accessing the perception of local inhabitants about the recently-settled species, using free interviews based on semi-structured questionnaires; and identifying potential dispersion routes used by the species to reach the region, using spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS), evaluating the concentration of remaining forests in the areas surrounding the park. Field outings were conducted between September 2002 and May 2004 and twelve properties in the area immediately surrounding PEI were visited. Thirty-one traces of the species were recorded in the region. Most of the interviewed families proved to be detached from PEI's conservationist interests and unreceptive to the presence of the puma in the area, revealing the urgency in implementing educational programs geared towards the local community. Spatial analyses demonstrate the high probability of finding the puma in the northeast corner of PEI, generating subsidies for implementing corridors of wildlife that connect the region of the park to other remaining forests in the state.

AB  - Meiofauna are known to live on hard substrates in association with periphytic and epiphytic algae and attached epibiota; however, the abundance, diversity and colonizing abilities of hard-substrate meiofauna have been poorly documented. We quantified meiofauna living on microalgal-covered pilings associated with a wood pier in a shallow (< 2 m deep) estuarine embayment with the use of a suction sampler, and compared colonization of pier-piling and sediment-dwelling meiofauna onto collectors that capture suspended meiofauna from the water column. Collectors were small mesh pads (159 cm 3) suspended at mid-water depth, and their size and structural complexity were similar to floating or drifting masses of macroalgae that may be colonized by meiofauna. Sediment was collected by coring, and copepod (to species) and nematode (to genera) colonists on mesh pads were compared with pier-piling and sediment communities. Abundance of total meiofauna averaged 124 +/- 13.6 (S.E.) on pier pilings, compared to 2092 +/- 274.6 individuals 10 cm(-2) in surrounding sediment. Phytal copepods (free-living copepods with prehensile first legs and dorsoventrally and laterally compressed body forms) and copepod nauplii dominated pier-piling collections, but nematodes were dominant on faunal collectors and in sediment. Phytal copepods also were abundant on faunal collectors but were rare in sediments. Copepod and nematode diversities were similar, but species composition was largely nonoverlapping, in pier pilings and sediments. Net recruitment of meiofauna to faunal collectors averaged about 900 individuals collector(-1) day(-1) during the 1-week experiment. Nematode and copepod colonists on faunal collectors were both much more similar to pier-piling than to sediment assemblages. These data suggest that meiofauna are abundant and diverse on algal-covered pier pilings, and they may become more important to marine ecology as artificial hard substrates increase with increasing urbanization. Furthermore, pier-piling meiofauna appear to readily migrate into the water column and probably contribute to a rapidly dispersing pool of mciofauna in estuaries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Plant species composition in the highway intersections and along the highways and urban and rural roads was compared with that of field habitats (abandoned fields and field verges) and semi-natural grasslands in order to ascertain the importance of road verges as alternative habitats for the grassland flora. Species composition varied more within than between the road types. The mean number and cover of the indicator species of the semi-natural grassland vegetation in roadside habitats fell somewhere between the values obtained for field habitats and semi-natural grasslands. Plant species composition of the road verge vegetation was rarely comparable to that of seminatural grasslands due to the young age of the verges, disturbance from road maintenance, and too intensive management, especially along the urban roads. However, sites with a good grassland vegetation were found along all road types in old verges on nutrient poor and sandy soil. Those variables were independent of the size of the road, whereas the variables related to the road size (verge width, pH, Na, Ca) proved less important for the grassland species.

AB  - This article discusses the legacy of the colonial labour movement in Indonesia under five broad headings; labour unions and the development of political consciousness; labour unions as socio-economic institutions; leaders, followers and the development of worker leadership; organisations and structural legacies; and class, ethnic and religious divisions.
   For over three decades after the first labour union was created in 1908, union leaders struggled to build organisations that cut across the ethnic, linguistic and social class divisions of Indonesian workplaces. They had limited success. Nevertheless, labour unions did have an important role in increasing workers ' wages, representing their grievances to employers and forcing the colonial government to pressure employers to improve both wages and conditions. They were central to the development of political consciousness, creating opportunities for Indonesians to acquire organisational skills and providing a channel for many to join nationalist political parties. In 1941, on the eve of the Japanese occupation, labour unions were among the strongest Indonesian organisations in the colonial towns and cities. In the aftermath of independence in August 1945 labour unions were quickly re-formed and, freed from many of the restrictions of the colonial states, recruited large numbers of urban workers. The successes and failures of the colonial labour movement were part of the collective memory of many leaders and members, influencing the direction of post-independence activities.

AB  - For decades, Black and multiracial feminist theories of intersectionality, which establish major systems of power and privilege with relation to race, class gender and sexuality as interlocking and mutually reinforcing, have promised to end reductive debates about which is "the ultimate" oppression and provide the basis for coalitional, multi-issue activism on the Left.

T2  - CHINA REVIEW-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON GREATER CHINA
LA  - English
AB  - This paper examines the wave of large-scale demonstrations which occurred in Hong Kong between 2003 and 2007, and which can be considered as forming the core of a reinvigorated pro-democracy movement in the city. The paper discusses the macro-, meso-, and microlevel factors which contributed to the rise of the demonstrations. At the macro-level, it is argued that changing political opportunities in the city have led to the formation of an alliance between political elites within the institutions and movement activists "on the streets." Organizationally, evidence from onsite surveys illustrates the "self-mobilization" processes behind the demonstrations. While movement organizations are important in organizing the protests, media and interpersonal channels are more important in actually encouraging people to participate. At the microlevel, evidence from both onsite and population surveys is used to examine the social psychological factors behind protest participation. It is argued that the current wave of demonstrations has shown signs of sustainability. Yet the limitations of their actual influence are also discussed.

AB  - Hypotheses: Animals often thrive in a variety of habitats where they face very different challenges and opportunities. We hypothesized: (1) As a consequence of higher squirrel density, the squirrels in an urban residential habitat (Oak Park, Illinois) experience greater food limitation than tree squirrels occupying a semi-natural habitat (Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois). (2) Due to higher densities of natural predators, squirrels experience a higher foraging cost of predation at the Morton Arboretum than squirrels inhabiting Oak Park. Furthermore, (3) we expected the residential squirrels to place a higher premium on cacheable foods as a consequence of few oak and nut-producing trees in Oak Park compared with the much higher availability of acorns and nuts at the Arboretum.
   Methods and predictions: By measuring giving-up densities in depletable food patches, we anticipated that at the Arboretum: (1) overall giving-up densities should be higher, (2) the difference in giving-up densities between risky and safe microhabitats should be higher, and (3) the difference in giving-up densities between cacheable food (hazelnuts in their shell) and less cacheable food (hazelnuts with shells removed) should be lower.
   Results: Interestingly, the first prediction depended on the interaction between site and season. In Oak Park, giving-up densities were highest in summer and lowest in winter, the exact opposite of the Arboretum. Our second hypothesis was refuted, and the third supported.
   Conclusions: A lack of cacheable food and an abundance of less cacheable human-derived summer food likely result in easy summers but hard winters for Oak Park squirrels. An abundance of cacheable foods and a summer lull in natural foods produces the opposite situation for the Arboretum squirrels. Less lethal, but more persistent, harassment by pets and people probably explain the higher cost of predation in Oak Park.

AB  - Fifty Nerodia sipedon living along two kilometers of an urban stream In northeastern Pennsylvania were radio-tracked over three activity seasons, yielding more than 2520 relocations. Half the stream length Is urbanized, flowing through a city park at the head of the study area and an industrial area at the downstream end; the half between Is relatively natural, flowing through a conservation corridor. Individual snakes exhibited high site fidelity. For 82% of relocations, snakes were within a one-meter radius of places they had previously occupied, most often using exactly the same hole, rock, branch, or cover object. Snakes were found to have moved to a different site at 27% of relocations. When snakes moved, they returned to previously occupied places 56% of the time. Females exhibited significantly greater site fidelity than males, and snakes occupying the urban half of the study site exhibited significantly greater site fidelity than snakes found in the natural half. Individuals varied greatly in the amount of space they utilized. Snakes had a mean minimum convex polygon (MCP) activity area of 1.13 ha. Snakes appeared to use the stream to travel between locations separated by more than 100 meters. Original MCPs overestimated space use by including large terrestrial areas that were never occupied by and were unsuitable to snakes. Fixed kernel methods underestimated space use by producing multiple small, disjunct contours. Both methods often largely or completely excluded the stream. To address these problems, we provide additional estimates of space use that sum the MCPs encompassing all of a snake's locations within 100 meters of each other and add the area of stream connecting the most upstream and downstream locations.

The hypocenters distribute linearly over about 20 km in parallel with a line 3.5 km west of the geological Bam fault and extend from the south of Bam city to the heavily damaged area in the eastern part of the city including the historical mud brick citadel " Arg- e- Bam''. Based on the hypocenter distribution, we propose a schematic 3- D structural model of a new fault that we have named the Arg- e- Bam fault. We suggest that the Bam earthquake occurred not in the Bam fault but in the Arg- e- Bam fault. Bam city is located just above northern part of the Arg- e-Bam fault and also on the rupture propagation direction from the asperity. This may be one of the main reasons why eastern part of Bam city suffered the heaviest damage.

AB  - In order to estimate accurately spatial processing techniques such as Adaptive Array Antenna and space diversity techniques in wideband mobile communications, the time-space path model in which both characteristics of the delay profile and of the spatial arrival angle profile for traveling wave can be analyzed at. the same time is required. In this paper, we propose "a static timespace path model" taking the arrangement of buildings in the city part into account and "a dynamic time-space path model" considering the movement of the mobile station. We show that the analysis using the dynamic time-space path model well agree with the field measurement results.

AB  - We examine the logic of designing nature reserves to understand better how to integrate the concepts of representativeness and persistence. Simple models of viability are used to evaluate how the expected number of species in the reserve system changes with variation in the risk of extinction among species, their rate of occurrence, and the distribution of species. The optimal size of individual reserves increased with the mean and variance of the probability of extinction among species and with the rate at which the risk of extinction declines with the cost of each reserve. In contrast, the rate of occurrence of species within reserves and their rate of accumulation with increasing reserve area had a relatively minor influence on the optimal size of reserves. Patterns of endemism were most important for the location of reserves. Including differences among species in the analysis reduced the optimal number of individual reserves (and increased the size of each) when operating under a fixed budget compared with reserve designs based on single species. A case study in the city of Melbourne, Australia, demonstrates the conservation value of small (similar to 1 ha) grassland reserves and the underrepresentation of Melbourne's volcanic plains in the region's conservation network.

CP  - International Conference on Sustainable Construction, Materials and Practices
AB  - This paper provides details of the South Capitol Street project, a case study in urban sustainability. The planning and design process for the project was geared to achieving sustainable infrastructure and involved regular meetings of concerned agencies, selection of multidisciplinary consultant teams, regular briefings of politicians at the municipal and federal levels, and comprehensive public engagement. Major thesis of the paper, demonstrated in the case study, is that early collaboration between planners, designers, and engineers, with a mix of disciplines, and steady coordination with political interests, is crucial to urban sustainability. Washington DC, although the capitol of the United States, has been long divided by out-dated infrastructure planned and built at a time when the explicit goal was to clear out blight. Little thought was given to neighborhoods marginalized in the wake of such building. In the new millennium the southeast and Southwest quadrants of the city are poised to be redeveloped as thriving urban nodes, and are among the last few places where major redevelopment call occur. However, the existing transportation infrastructure is deteriorated, performs poorly, fails to provide logical connections, and fences off prime developable parcels. In addition, this infrastructure is a barrier to access to the city's unique environmental asset, the Anacostia River. As one of the top ten polluted waters in the United States, it must daily absorb untreated urban Pollution and runoff from roads and development in its watershed. It is in need of immediate attention. The Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI) is a unique partnership of federal and local agencies and is a significant revitalization effort for Washington DC. The AWI Framework Plan laid out specific ways that the corridor could be revitalized, including sustainable infrastructure. Improving the health of the river, rebuilding the landscape, and creating vibrant, sustainable communities will contribute to economic development and environmental quality that will be enjoyed by all of the city's residents. South Capitol Street project is underway and part of the AWL The award-winning South Capitol Street project was planned, designed and will be constructed using several sustainability principles. As a piece of sustainable transportation infrastructure it will address the new context for the corridor while meeting the triple bottom line. Among other innovations, the facilities are designed to treat stormwater runoff onsite and low-impact design features arc integrated into the streetscape (environmental). The District Department of Transportation has developed new standards and specifications for the AWI area that include permeable pavers, planting zones, solar-powered lights, and maintenance practices that improve environmental quality. The timing of the infrastructure improvements is carefully coordinated with developers to ensure minimum disruption to the completed facilities by future development and to maximize service to new development (financial). In addition to environmental benefits to the community, project includes training and outreach centers in the project neighborhood (community).

AB  - In most regions of the world removal of environmental stress facilitates regeneration of native plants and habitats. However, in many of New Zealand's modified landscapes, exotic species are likely to respond first to any reduction in stress because these fast-growing species are prevalent in local vegetation and dominate seed banks. Given the trend in agriculture towards intensive management on larger units, the indigenous character in New Zealand landscapes is being marginalised and there is the risk that further reduction in visibility of native vegetation may be perpetuated by a growing familiarity and identification with ubiquitous exotic species. Alternative landscapes, based on an understanding of ecosystem processes, need to be explored if biodiversity coals set by international convention and national resource management law are to be achieved. This study provides a set of predictions and pathways, backed by field observations, to underpin a restoration strategy at patch to landscape scales. A forest model, LINKNZ, is employed to simulate species succession under New Zealand conditions. The incorporation of disturbance regimes and species dispersal processes in the model permits a wide range of scenarios to be investigated encompassing indigenous forest development, exotic species interactions with indigenous forest ecosystems, management of mixed introduced-indigenous forests, and landscape dynamics. The results illustrate an approach that identifies potential biosecurity threats and provides additional options for integrating nature and production in New Zealand's rural and urban landscapes.

AB  - In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2) of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.

AB  - Statistical models of environment-abundance relationships may be influenced by spatial autocorrelation in abundance, environmental variables, or both, Failure to account for spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding both the absolute and relative importance of environmental variables as determinants of abundance. We consider several classes of statistical models that are appropriate for modeling environment-abundance relationships in the presence of spatial autocorrelation, and apply these to three case studies: 1) abundance of voles in relation to habitat characteristics; 2) a plant competition experiment; and 3) abundance of Orbatid mites along environmental gradients. We find that when spatial pattern is accounted for in the modeling process, conclusions about environmental control over abundance can change dramatically. We conclude with five lessons: 1) spatial models are easy to calculate with several of the most common statistical packages; 2) results from spatially-structured models may point to conclusions radically different from those suggested by a spatially independent model; 3) not all spatial autocorrelation in abundances results from spatial population dynamics; it may also result from abundance associations with environmental variables not included in the model; 4) the different spatial models do have different mechanistic interpretations in terms of ecological processes - thus ecological model selection should take primacy over statistical model selection; 5) the conclusions of the different spatial models are typically fairly similar - making any correction is more important than quibbling about which correction to make.

AB  - This study focuses on driver eye movements and vehicle control behaviour, factors implicated in the human errors that are considered to be important factors that may cause traffic accidents. Some curved sections of urban motorways have a comparatively high frequency of accident occurrence. The authors attempted to link three factors, namely eye movement, roadway alignment, and driver speed and steering control. In order to analyse the factors that lead to human error, an in-car experiment was carried out on some routes with curved sections of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. This study focuses on single-car collisions occurring primarily in free-flow regions. Using the results of the experiment, the authors were able to analyse the factors that produce human error in relation to motorway alignment, eye movement, and centrifugal acceleration in the curved sections. As a result, the authors proposed a model that evaluates the risk of curved sections in relation to the driver's eye movement and driving behaviour.

AB  - Since the pine wood nematode (PWN) was discovered in Jiangsu Province in 1982, it has occurred in seven provinces in China. The long distance spread of PWN is via the transport of infected logs and products made from infected pine wood from other countries or other places inside China where pine wood nematode is present. PWN is an enormous potential threat to pine forests in South and Central China, because the temperature in this area is favourable, the vector beetle is present, the pine species are susceptible and PWN already occurs in some places. Pines have been very important forestry trees in China. The area of planted pines is about 20% of total forestry. Pines are considered as the symbol of longevity for the Chinese people, who are consequently very fond of them. Since the pine wood nematode was discovered at Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, this nematode has occurred in 59 counties (or cities) in six provinces. The federal and local governments have paid great attention to this disease, because pine wood nematode has destroyed about 20 million pine trees in 75 000 ha, and this nematode is spreading further.

AB  - Fifty-six brown trout Salmo trutta were implanted with transmitters in an urbanized portion of Rapid Creek within the city limits of Rapid City, South Dakota, to determine habitat use and seasonal movement behavior by radiotelemetry. Fish locations were determined twice weekly during daylight hours from September 2000 to September 2001 by triangulating the signal from shore. During the yearlong tracking period, 1,153 individual fish locations were recorded. Gross movement distance averaged 506 in and ranged from 22 to 2,554 m. The net movement averaged 49.4 in downstream and ranged from 774 in downstream to 188 in upstream. The movement for individual fish averaged 23 in and ranged from 2 to 150 in. Gross movement was greatest in fall and then spring, whereas the greatest net movement (downstream) occurred in spring. Fish moved a greater distance during the fall spawning period than they did during summer, spring, or winter. Runs and pools were used more frequently than riffles in fall and winter, but runs were used much more than either pools or riffles in spring. No difference in habitat use was evident during the summer. Fish occurrence in riffles was greater in the fall than in all other seasons. Overall, brown trout in this highly urbanized section of stream had similar movement patterns and general habitat distribution during daylight hours as their counterparts in norturbanized streams described previously in published literature.

AB  - Changes that are current in the area of religious studies-the break-up of a single movement into a multitude of geographically dispersed locations, of small size-lead us to study the Murid movement in many places at the same time. But the great place of pilgrimage of the Murid brotherhood is today considered to be the Grand Magal of Touba. Murid of Senegal scattered around the world long to visit Touba, Muridism's holy city, on the holy day which commemorates the exile imposed by the colonists on the founder of the brotherhood, and the beginning of trials visited upon them all by the Almighty. This great event in the holy city of Touba-which with its 300,000 inhabitants has become the second largest city in Senegal-will be our analytical touchstone for the changes which have occurred in modern Muridism.

AB  - Little information is available on the ecology of Aedes aegypti Linnaeus at the southern extreme of its distribution (Buenos Aires, Argentina), particularly on microhabitat suitability. The aim of our study was to identify at a detailed scale, microhabitat factors that correlate with the presence of preimaginal stages of the mosquito. In March 2001, we performed a spatial census of all containers located in a 1 ha patch within a cemetery in Buenos Aires City. On a reference map (1:700) we plotted the position of graves and surrounding corridors, the location of containers, the shade projected by each plant between 10:00 and 16:00 h and vegetation cover. We classified vegetation by height, substrate by composition and shadow by level of exposure to sunlight. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with nine constructed independent variables, some of them at scales of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 m. Of 850 receptacles examined, 101 contained preimaginal stages of Ae. aegypti. Level of exposure to sunlight, type of substratum, vegetation height and distance of containers to vegetation were significantly associated with the presence of breeding sites at the studied scales. Final multivariate models were significant at scales of 2 m (chi(2)((3)) 25.693, p<0.001), and 3m (chi(2)((3)) = 26.440, p < 0.001), and 65.9 and 66.8% of our data were correctly classified, respectively, for each scale. Our results suggest that sites less exposed to sunlight, with taller and closer vegetation, and in shaded and vegetated neighbourhoods were the most favourable microhabitats for Ae. aegypti breeding.

AB  - In Queensland, Australia, in response to isolated cases of dengue infection, larval control of the vector Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is targeted at breeding sites within 200 m of a case and interior spraying with a pyrethroid adulticide is targeted at premises within 100 m. To ascertain whether these limits are appropriate, we conducted a mark-release-recapture study to measure the dispersal of female Ae. aegypti in the city of Cairns where transmission occurs. Female mosquitoes reared from wild collected eggs were differentially marked with fluorescent dust depending on whether they were to be released blood-fed or non-blood-fed, and a total of 1948 females was released. A total of 132 sticky ovitraps was set at 64 premises within a 200 m radius and collections of trapped adults were made at 5-15 days post-release. Sixty-seven females (3.4%) were recaptured, with the furthest being caught 200 m from the release point, and the mean distance travelled was 78 m. Overall, 23.1% of the recaptures outside the release site were taken beyond 100 m by day 15. Dispersal was comparable for both blood-fed and non-blood-fed releases. There was a significant tendency for dispersal to be in a north-westerly direction, probably because of the presence of numerous containers and heavy shading by trees in this direction and a busy road to the south of the release point that appeared to inhibit dispersal. The results suggest that adulticiding may have to be extended beyond 100 m if more than 8 days have elapsed since female Ae. aegypti could have fed upon a viraemic dengue case. The study also shows that dispersal is not random, and that it may be possible to maximize vector control by taking into account environmental factors that affect the direction of female mosquito flight.

AB  - Bonanza-grade orebodies in epithermal-style mineral deposits characteristically occur as discrete zones within spatially more extensive fault and/or fracture systems. Empirically, the segregation of such systems into compartments of higher and lower permeability appears to be a key process necessary for high-grade ore formation and, most commonly, it is such concentrations of metals that make an epithermal vein district world class. in the world-class silver- and gold-producing Comstock mining district, Nevada, several lines of evidence lead to the conclusion that the Comstock lode is localized in an extensional stepover between right-lateral fault zones. This evidence includes fault geometries, kinematic indicators of slip, the hydraulic connectivity of faults as demonstrated by veins and dikes along faults, and the opening of a normal-fault-bounded, asymmetric basin between two parallel and overlapping northwest-striking, lateral- to lateral-oblique-slip fault zones.
   During basin opening, thick, generally subeconomic, banded quartz-adularia veins were deposited in the normal fault zone, the Comstock fault, and along one of the bounding lateral fault zones, the Silver City fault. As deformation continued, the intrusion of dikes and small plugs into the hanging wall of the Comstock fault zone may have impeded the ability of the stepover to accommodate displacement on the bounding strike-slip faults through extension within the stepover. A transient period of transpressional deformation of the Comstock fault zone ensued, and the early-stage veins were deformed through boudinaging and hydraulic fragmentation, fault-motion inversion, and high- and low-angle axial rotations of segments of the fault planes and some fault-bounded wedges. This deformation led to the formation of spatially restricted compartments of high vertical permeability and hydraulic connectivity and low lateral hydraulic connectivity. Bonanza orebodies were formed in the compartmentalized zones of high permeability and hydraulic connectivity.
   As heat flow and related hydrothermal activity waned along the Comstock fault zone, extension was reactivated in the stepover along the Occidental zone of normal faults east of the Comstock fault zone. Volcanic and related intrusive activity in this part of the stepover led to a new episode of hydrothermal activity and formation of the Occidental lodes.

AB  - This article explores the experiences of asylum seekers who have been housed in Glasgow under the government's dispersal policy. It notes the work of the Audit Commission in identifying those factors which may be considered when assessing the suitability of areas for asylum-seeker settlement. These factors are then discussed in detail in relation to the Glasgow case study, using information derived from interviews with asylum seekers themselves, with service providers and various community and voluntary organizations. The article notes the impact of additional factors such as media coverage, which were not considered by the Audit Commission. The article discusses the appropriateness of cities such as Glasgow, with relatively small minority ethnic populations, as locations for asylum-seeker settlement, and explores the impact of devolution. It concludes by suggesting that areas such as Glasgow may, with the appropriate commitment, become places where asylum seekers may successfully settle, once they have received refugee status, with new multicultural communities being created.

AB  - Community currency originated as a means to empower the economically marginalized. This paper studies the US population of community currency systems using locally printed money. Eighty-two systems are identified that have been attempted in the United States since 1991. Internet searches and contact with system coordinators indicate that only 20.7% of all systems are active. Regions in which they occur are described; more than one quarter are in Pacific states. City-level Census 2000 data are employed in analyses of environmental conduciveness to determine in which types of social environments local currencies emerge and survive within. Social movement theory is engaged to identify general, population-based resources for local movements. Economic marginality and labor-market-independence hypotheses are also formulated and tested. The major findings indicate that cities with local currencies are characterized by populations with lower household incomes, higher poverty rates, higher unemployment rates, and larger self-employment sectors. Evidence is also presented indicating that community currencies tend to survive in places with younger populations, higher educational attainment, fewer married people, and less residential stability. Implications concerning the future of the community currency movement and its ability to empower the marginalized are drawn.

AB  - A population genetic analysis was conducted among 20 Aedes aegypti collections from 19 cities along the south Pacific coast in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas and in Coatepeque, Guatemala. Genetic variation was scored at 131 random amplified polymorphic DNA loci. The amount of genetic differentiation among collections was similar to3 times as great as detected among collections in an earlier study in northeastern Mexico. Regression analysis of linear or road distances on linearized F-ST indicated that collections are genetically isolated by distance. Cluster analysis failed to group collections in geographic proximity, and there was as much genetic variation among collections 60 km apart as there was among all collections (similar to900-km range). The large genetic differentiation in southern Mexico reflects reduced gene flow among mosquitoes arising in a greater diversity of habitats and altitudes than exists among northeastern collections. It is likely that dispersal via human commerce in the northeast confounds patterns of natural gene flow.

AB  - Information about the interaction between behavior and landscape resources is key to directing conservation management for endangered species. We studied multi-scale occurrence, habitat use, and selection in a cooperatively breeding population of Micronesian kingfishers (Todiramphus cinnamominus) on the island of Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. At the landscape level, point-transect surveys resulted in kingfisher detection frequencies that were higher than those reported in 1994, although they remained 15-40% lower than 1983 indices. Integration of spatially explicit vegetation information with survey results indicated that kingfisher detections were positively associated with the amount of wet forest and grass-urban vegetative cover, and they were negatively associated with agricultural forest, secondary vegetation, and upland forest cover types. We used radiotelemetry and remote sensing to evaluate habitat use by individual kingfishers at the home-range scale. A comparison of habitats in Micronesian kingfisher home ranges with those in randomly placed polygons illustrated that birds used more forested areas than were randomly available in the immediate surrounding area. Further, members of cooperatively breeding groups included more forest in their home ranges than birds in pair-breeding territories, and forested portions of study areas appeared to be saturated with territories. Together, these results suggested that forest habitats were limited for Micronesian kingfishers. Thus, protecting and managing forests is important for the restoration of Micronesian kingfishers to the island of Guam (United States Territory), where they are currently extirpated, as well as to maintaining kingfisher populations on the islands of Pohnpei and Palau. Results further indicated that limited forest resources may restrict dispersal opportunities and, therefore, play a role in delayed dispersal and cooperative behaviors in Micronesian kingfishers.

AB  - The Indian house crow (Corvus splendens) has successfully invaded tropical and subtropical regions well beyond its native range, reaching pest proportions in many areas. The invasive population of house crows in Singapore (Southeast Asia) has increased at least 30-fold since 1985 and now numbers in excess of 130,000 birds. To understand the population ecology and behavior of the house crow in Singapore, we undertook regular population size and roost surveys, dissections of birds shot (to provide age structure and breeding status), detailed nestsite observations, and monitoring of coastal dispersal. Using a discrete-time, density-dependent population model to synthesize this information, we demonstrated that at least 41,000 crows will need to be culled in the first year of a control program, and equivalent effort committed each year thereafter, to be confident of suppressing the Singapore population from its 2001 density of 190 birds/km(2) to the management target of <10 birds/km(2) within a 10-year period. This figure drops to 32,000 if culling is combined with other management strategies such as resource limitation and nest destruction. Complete eradication of the house crow from Singapore may be an unrealistic goal due to potential difficulties in detecting crows at IOW population densities and influx of migrants from neighboring Malaysia. Our study has implications for pest-bird management in other cities in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and presents it surrogate population-dynamics management tool for use in regions where the house crow has become established as a pest species, but where limited local field data is available.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
LA  - English
AB  - The interactions that take place between individuals, and the reciprocity networks and trust that people negotiate daily, are important assets that reduce socioeconomic vulnerability and increase opportunities. However, the pressures of economic change can exert opposing forces on social capital-strengthening it, as reciprocity networks are increasingly called into play, and eroding it, as households' ability to cope deteriorates and trust breaks down. Drawing on the above, I examine the complex ways in which individuals in Koforidua, Ghana network for resources identity, and space by using their social interactions. I focus specifically on how networks are employed as assets to guard against and alleviate the hardships of a changing socioeconomic landscape. Network interactions are explored through four key lenses: (a) household, kin, and neighborhood ties; (b) alumni ties; (c) occupational ties; and (d) religious associations. I conclude that the ongoing networks, symbolizing different scales of social space, are what guide individuals to appropriate forums. They make survival possible. They also encapsulate and communicate identity.

AB  - If, as Joseph argues, there is so little evidence that mixed-income development alleviates poverty, why does it enjoy such wide acceptance as a method of delivering affordable housing? I argue that such development, while still small in scale, is largely faithful to the economic integration that occurs organically in most urban neighborhoods today. Moreover, the greater degree of social control and higher quality of public and private services in mixed-income versus high-poverty neighborhoods provide benefits for residents and local governments alike. For these and other reasons, many European nations have embraced mixed-income strategies even more actively than the United States has.
   Although additional research is surely needed, Joseph's findings on mixed-income urban developments should be viewed in the wider context of what we know about "dispersal" and "inclusionary" housing strategies that embrace economic integration as a viable antidote to concentrated urban poverty.

AB  - The Rufous-crowned Sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) is a nonmigratory passerine that displays an area-sensitive distribution pattern of abundance in fragmented coastal sage-scrub habitat of southern California. To determine if habitat fragmentation negatively affected adult survival, we used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to compare annual survival probabilities of adult sparrows breeding in habitat adjacent to urban-developed edges to those of birds breeding in the interior of large habitat expanses in San Diego County, 1997-2000. During that period, an El Nino event brought heavy rainfall to the study area, and a La Nina event brought drought. Annual survival probabilities were relatively high for a small passerine (females: 0.69 +/- 0.05 SE; males: 0.74 +/- 0.04 SE) but, given our data, did not differ between habitat types or with rainfall. Annual resighting probabilities for the birds were strongly associated with variation in rainfall, being high in the wet year and low in the dry year. Mate- and site-fidelity were apparently high, and surveys during the nonbreeding season documented that the sparrows stayed paired and on territories year-round. We hypothesize that the high apparent survivorship of this species is related to its nonmigratory habit and its tendency to curtail reproductive effort during periods of food scarcity. Although Our survivorship analysis suggests that the urban-wildland interface does not adversely affect survival of territorial Rufous-crowned Sparrows, our power to detect an effect of habitat edge on survival was low. Thus, we urge caution in concluding that edge effects do not have an ecologically important influence on survival rates in this species.

TI  - Gurdwaras and community-building among British Sikhs
T2  - CONTEMPORARY SOUTH ASIA
LA  - English
AB  - This paper examines the role of gurdwaras (temples) in community-building among British Sikhs since the early twentieth century. Like the Punjab, Britain has witnessed the emergence of a modern gurdwara movement that now embraces almost 250 institutions, and has succeeded in establishing distinct sacred spaces in the inner-city, some of which resemble Golden Temple-like structures. These institutions increasingly reflect the internal and denominational diversity within Sikhism, a characteristic that has contributed significantly to their growth. The paper examines the patterns of growth and geographical distribution of gurdwaras, as well as the resources they are able to generate. The functions of these institutions, it is argued, are changing as result of pressure to adapt to both new conditions of faith in the inner-city and generational changes within the Sikh community itself. Additionally, in a post-9/11 and post-7/7 world where minority religious institutions are now easily associated with transnational terrorism, gurdwaras, like Muslim mosques and Hindu mandirs (temples), face new challenges of close state monitoring.

AB  - 1. Commensal mammals live in habitats that appear to provide both benefits and costs compared with natural and semi-natural (non-commensal) habitats. These commensal habitats offer potentially rich food resources but are also characterized by instability in time and space. We expected to demonstrate that animals in these habitats have high reproductive rates to counter high mortality rates and show flexibility in spatial organization. House mice (Mus musculus domesticus) are unusual because they are able to persist entirely in both commensal and non-commensal habitats, and so can provide a test of the distinctiveness of commensal populations.
   2. We studied populations of commensal house mice on two neighbouring farms in North Yorkshire, UK, for 2 years by capture-mark-recapture using the robust design. A total of 568 house mice were captured, with a total of 1053 recaptures. Population size varied from nine to 93 individuals, estimated with closed population models. Apparent survival was surprisingly low (0.54 per month) and was best modelled as constant across age, sex and time.
   3. In situ reproductive recruitment occurred throughout the study and was numerically more important than immigration. Immigration was important during only two intervals and was probably from untrappable areas within the study site. Breeding throughout the year allowed the population to persist despite low survival rates. The results suggested that births and deaths had more influence on the overall population dynamics than movement.
   4. The population was divided into subgroups to represent the territorial, demic structure known to be present in commensal house mouse populations. Dispersal between subgroups within the population was limited, representing only 6.6% of recaptures. The low rates of dispersal suggested that house mice responded to their environment as consisting of aggregated patches of suitable habitat.
   5. In comparison, non-commensal house mice have lower mortality, seasonal breeding, and individuals move more frequently and further than commensal house mice.
   6. These differences illustrate the responses of house mice to the specific opportunities and demands of commensal habitats and demonstrate the importance of a flexible life-history strategy for animals exploiting these habitats.

KW  - FISHES
AB  - The existence of cavernicolous sculpin (here allocated to Cottus carolinae, banded sculpin, and referred to as grotto sculpin), in the karst regions of Perry County, Missouri, first came to our attention in 1991. Examination of 35 caves in Missouri, 96 in Illinois, 17 in Tennessee, two in Indiana, and 11 in Arkansas revealed that banded sculpin are common in cave habitats; however, grotto sculpin are limited to two karst areas of Perry County, Missouri, where they are known from only six cave systems. These caves and their streams are extensive and apparently provide a unique habitat compared to other karst systems; this may be a critical factor in the present restricted distribution of the grotto sculpin. Grotto sculpin occupy pools and riffles of cave streams, and occur over a variety of substrates, from sediment to breakdown. Density estimates in Mystery and Running Bull caves were 0.29 and 0.63 individuals m(-2), respectively. Grotto sculpin have small eyes (1-6% SL vs. 6-10% SL in epigean samples), significantly reduced pigmentation (including nearly complete loss of dorsal saddles), a reduction in pelvic fin ray number (from 4+4 elements to often 4+3 , or 3+3), and enlarged cephalic lateralis pores (e.g., mandibular pores of cavernicolous samples are 2-3 times those of epigean stream samples). Multivariate analyses of body shape revealed statistically significant separation of epigean and hypogean samples, with eye size highly variable, but smallest in the Running Bull Cave population. We interpret these results as representative of losses associated with long-term cave habitation. Caves of Perry County provide ample habitat for grotto sculpin, but because the caves are located downgradient of the city of Perryville and an intensively farmed landscape, point and non-point source pollution threaten their continued existence. Escape of farm-pond fishes through the extensive sinkhole network in Perry County has increased potential predation pressure on grotto sculpin by channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, and other species normally excluded from cave environments.

TI  - Reallocating road space to buses and high occupancy vehicles in Leeds
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER
LA  - English
AB  - Securing the most efficient use of existing road space to maximise the efficient and sustainable movement of people and goods has emerged as one of the key issues for urban transport planners. For over ten years Leeds has been implementing an integrated transport strategy, a central part of which is to secure greater efficiency from the existing road network. This paper outlines these policies and focuses on the practical aspects of reallocating road space and traffic capacity by reference to three different projects in Leeds. The measures discussed cover traffic management in the city centre and priority issues on major radial corridors, including the various approaches being adopted within a' quality bus initiative' on a busy radial corridor. The example of the pioneering A647 scheme is used to show how high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes can not only assist public transport but also benefit motorists.

AB  - When natural or human-induced disasters strike an urban area, buildings are always being considered as one of the critical physical infrastructures (CPIs). Information regarding the building and its occupants is critical to disaster response operations, particularly when civil engineers need to make reliable decisions in term of the structural integrity of the building. However, as the experience of the 9/11 terrorist attack showed, access to accurate building information is often limited and inefficient due to the lack of on-site preservation of building documentation and inability to communicate with building systems. To address these issues, this paper presents a conceptual design, initial prototype and preliminary testing results of a building blackbox system to bridge the gap between first responders and building systems and to provide reliable and accurate building information over a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). By maintaining a building information database and incorporating building sensing and control systems, the building blackbox system can provide building information on site as well as monitoring real-time building functional conditions. In order to protect the critical information from disastrous events, the building blackbox system is designed to be disaster-survivable by utilizing state-of-the-art high temperature and high strength geopolymer material and insulation technology. Additionally, sufficient data redundancy mechanisms such as information replication in a decentralized network are also employed to ensure the availability, completeness, and reliability of critical information and its access. To validate the survivability and accessibility of the building blackbox system, a series of required fire tests, strength tests, drop tests, and communication tests were conducted on the prototype according to ASTM, FAA, and EUROCAE standards. The results from the tests confirmed the potential of such building blackbox systems in supporting and improving the disaster response efforts. These preliminary tests also provide insight to the final design of the building blackbox system.

AB  - The exotic tree Muntingia calabura L. (Muntingiaceae), a species native to Central America, is used as fish feed and fiber and cellulose production in Brazil. This study was carried out in urban areas and verified the reproductive biology of this plant species. Flower and fruit morphology, compatibility system, reproductive phenology, pollination and frugivore animals, and germination of disseminated seeds were recorded by standard field and laboratory procedures. This tree is self-compatible and autonomously self-pollinated, with its flowers being mainly visited by bees and its fruits consumed by birds and bats. Germination of its dispersed seeds is fast and occurs at a high rate. The results of this work suggest that M. calabura is very adaptable to cultivated areas, thus being an excellent choice for urban reforestation. However, its reproductive characteristics place this plant as an invasive species with significant potential in southeastern Brazil.

CP  - Symposium on Protection and Restoration of Urban and Rural Streams
AB  - The Turkey Creek watershed in Johnson and Wyandotte Counties in the Kansas City, Kansas area has long been plagued with recurring flooding. Major flood control projects on this waterway include an early 1900's diversion of the creek at its confluence with the Kansas River through the construction of a tunnel.
   Providing a relatively flat corridor in an area of rolling hills, the Turkey Creek floodplain in the southwest region of Kansas City has been a target of transportation related development since the 1800's. The stream corridor includes a rail, highway and interstate system. Many changes have occurred to the stream system over time that have resulted in environmental degradation. These changes include floodplain filling, channel straightening, concrete lining, channel enclosures, filling in of on-stream lakes, and disruptions due to numerous road and utility crossings.
   Based on a U.S. House of Representatives resolution adopted February 2000, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reconnaissance Study was authorized to evaluate the federal interest in solutions to recurring flood damages, environmental degradation and related water and land resource needs and opportunities. An expedited Reconnaissance Study was completed in July 2001. It recommended a number of different strategies to restore this urban stream and reduce flood damages. The environmental strategies included methods to stop stream downcutting, removing blockages to fish passage, retrofitting basins and swales for water quality benefits, acquiring remaining areas of open space, removing channel linings, reconnecting the floodplain and channel, emphasizing stormwater storage and infiltration systems over stormwater and floodwater conveyance systems, and implementing public information/awareness campaigns. The environmental strategies were complimented by flood damage reduction strategies that emphasized detention, relocations, flood proofing, and flood warning systems, in addition to structural flood protection.
   A Project Management Plan was prepared and the sponsors signed an agreement to proceed in June 2002. Local agencies are focused on developing a basin-wide multi-jurisdictional approach in this approximately 90% urbanized watershed. Baseline information is currently being prepared for an expected summer 2003 Feasibility Scoping Meeting. The Feasibility Study will identify a multi-purpose plan for flood damage reduction and environmental enhancement in the Turkey Creek watershed considering both existing and future conditions. The project integrates biological and water quality data prepared for a use attainability analysis with engineering principles and hydrologic and hydraulic models to develop an urban stream restoration plan to return wildlife to and increase public appreciation of the Turkey Creek corridor.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have weakened biogeographical barriers to dispersal resulting in the global spread and establishment of an increasing number of non-native species. We examine the broad-scale consequences of this phenomenon based on an analysis of compositional similarity across urban floras in the northeastern United States and Europe. We test the prediction that homogenization of species composition is uniquely defined within vs. between continents based on the time and place of origin of non-native species. In this case, for archaeophytes and neophytes in Europe (introduced before and after AD 1500, respectively) and non-native species originating from within and outside the United States. More species in urban floras were shared within than between continents. Within Europe, archaeophytes shared more species across urban floras compared with neophytes; strong associations were not observed for non-native species across US urban floras. Between the two continents, non-native species in the United States that originated from outside the United States shared species primarily with archaeophytes but also with European natives and neophytes. These results suggest that the direction of biotic interchange was unidirectional with species moving primarily from Europe to the United States with archaeophytes playing a primary and non-native species originating from outside the two continents a secondary role as a homogenizing source. Archaeophytes, based on combination of biogeographical, evolutionary, and ecological factors in association with a long history of anthropogenic influence, appear to have played a prominent role in the continental and intercontinental homogenization of species composition. This suggests that the uniform homogenization of the Earth's biota is not imminent and is presently directed by a combination of biogeographically defined anthropogenic and historical factors.

AB  - Introduced saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima, T. chinensis, and their hybrids) reaches its northward distribution in the Great Plains in Montana, USA. We mapped the locations, patterns of abundance, and ages of saltcedar along the Musselshell River and Fort Peck Reservoir in northeastern Montana to identify concentrations of plants that could be used to infer introduction location, establishment year, and mechanisms of dispersal. We estimated the presence of 24,500 plants on the Musselshell River over a river distance of 240 km, with concentrations at three nodes close to Roundup (2,000 plants, seedlings to 24 years), Melstone' (6,000 plants, seedlings to 23 years), and the mouth of the river at Fort Peck Reservoir (10,000 plants, seedlings to at least 11 years). Concentrations at Roundup and Melstone probably originated from urban plantings in the 1960s. The third concentration may have established from seeds and plant pieces washed downriver during floods and deposited in the hydraulic backwater of the Musselshell River delta at Fort Peck Reservoir. We believe there may be one-half to one million plants on Fort Peck Reservoir, with concentration nodes at recreation areas on the south shore. We estimated 3,500 mature saltcedar to be present at the Devils Creek Recreation Area, more than 11,000 plants at Hell Creek Recreation Area, and more than 40,000 plants at 6 sites at the south end of Dry Arm close to the Nelson Creek Recreation Area and mouth of Big Dry Creek. The oldest plants on the reservoir were 21 to 33 years old in 2001. Based on these ages, we suggest that saltcedar arrived at the south shore of Fort Peck Reservoir in the mid- to late 1960s, which means that it must have dispersed from the Bighorn/Yellowstone River system soon after it became established in southern Montana. Although wind dispersal and ornamental plantings cannot be ruled out as primary transport mechanisms to the reservoir, the concentrations and ages of saltcedar at recreation areas suggest that seeds and other plant propagules were also transported to the reservoir by earth-moving equipment during site construction between 1966 and the mid-1980s and later by boats and their towing vehicles. Saltcedar was dispersed away from these nodes by wind and water. As Tamarix ramosissima and T. chinensis originated in the cold dry deserts of northeastern Asia, saltcedar may not be limited in its northward expansion by the cold winters, short growing seasons, and periodic droughts characteristic of the northern Great Plains in Canada.

AB  - We studied a fringe area (of 104 ha) between urban and agricultural landscapes in the eastern part of the town of Milan, around the Lambro river. This area is characterised by a small-scale mosaic of fields, factories, and residential elements. The increasing level of urbanization has nearly completely extinguished the natural elements. At the moment the remaining natural elements are a few hedgerows, their ecological condition being highly variable. In this paper, we developed a model to predict the occurrence of forest species in hedgerows based on previous knowledge. Environmental factors likely to affect the occurrence of forest species have been weighted. The model was tested on the 19 hedgerows and we find a relation (R-adj(2) 0.61) between the presence of forest species (selected by their ecological needs) and the variables considered in the model. On the basis of these first results, we suggest this methodology is relevant to evaluate the potential ecological quality of hedgerows and can be useful in projects of nature restoration.

AB  - The diverse ecological roles played by different rodent species mean that the loss of some species and superabundance of others could potentially influence a wide range of ecological processes. Hong Kong (22 degrees N, 114 degrees E), with seven million people in a land area of 1100 km(2), could be considered a `worst case scenario' for the survival of mammalian diversity. Existing information on rodents in Hong Kong was compiled from previous published and unpublished studies, and additional trapping was conducted at 17 non-urban sites. The rodent fauna of modern Hong Kong consists of eight species of rats and mice (Bandicota indica, Mus caroli, M. musculus, Niviventer fulvescens, Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, R. tanezumi, R. sikkimensis: Muridae), one porcupine (Hystrix brachyura: Hystricidae), and one recently introduced tree squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus: Sciuridae). Six of the murids are urban or agricultural commensals, so only the porcupine and two murids, N. fulvescens and R. sikkimensis, are likely survivors of Hong Kong's pre-deforestation native rodent fauna. The two murids co-dominate in forest and shrubland, but can also move through grassland, which has probably enabled their survival through repeated cycles of fragmentation and regrowth. Additional forest rodents that may have inhabited Hong Kong in the past are tentatively identified from information on their recent distributions in the region. One possible ecological consequence of Hong Kong's depleted rodent fauna is a shift in the balance between seed predation and seed dispersal, in favor of the former.

AB  - American wildcelery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a valuable submersed aquatic plant that was negatively affected by pollution and urban runoff in the lower Detroit River for much of the 20th century. Following 25 years of water-pollution and urban- runoff abatement initiated in the early 1970s, we postulated that water clarity had increased and that this would allow restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, water clarity increased in the late 1980s due to waterfiltration and particulate removal by exotic dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis), which could contribute to potential wildcelery restoration. We sampled wildcelery in 1996-97 and compared these data to wildcelery data from 1950-51 and 1984-85. Over the 48-year period of comparison, areal density of wildcelery tubers decreased 72% (from 51.2 million to 14.4 million tubers) between 1950-51 and 1984-85 then increased 251% (from 14.4 million to 50.5 million tubers) between 1984-85 and 1996-97. As a result, overall areal abundance was about the same in 1950-51 as in fall 1996-97. However, tuber densities in spring 1996 were similar to historical low abundances in springs of 1984-85. Then between spring and fall 1996, tuber densities increased 333% and remained relatively abundant through October 1997 indicating the beginning of the restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, we believe further reductions of turbidity through continued pollution-abatement programs and water filtration by dreissenid mussels combined with habitat protection and active management of wildcelery will contribute even further to the restoration of wildcelery in the Detroit River in the 21st century.

AB  - On 25 April 1998, the mineral waste retaining wall at the Swedish-owned pyrite mine at Aznalcollar (Seville, Spain) burst, 2 causing the most harmful environmental and socio-economic disaster in the history of the River Guadiamar basin. The damage was so great that the regional government decided in May 1998 to finance a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research initiative with the objective of eradicating or at least minimising all of the negative social, economic and environmental impacts. This paper utilises a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to identify eight strategic measures aimed at providing policymakers with key guidelines on implementing a sustainable development model, in a broad sense. Empirical evidence, though, reveals that, to date, major efforts to tackle the negative impacts have centred on environmental concerns and that the socio-economic consequences have not been completely mitigated.

AB  - Introduction. A specialised unit may influence favourably primary levels of health system by alerting physicians and patients on the existence of those pathologies most commonly seen. Objectives. To determine demographic changes and referral patterns observed in a hospital-based monographic outpatient clinic on Parkinson's disease and movement disorders along an eight-year period (1991-1998). Patients and methods. Database analysis of 2,471 patients attending a specialised unit covering an urban and rural population of 630,000 people in South-East Madrid city and county. Results. We observed a slight, albeit non-significant reduction in the incidence of secondary parkinsonisms (40% of all parkinsonisms observed). This occurred despite a drastic reduction in drug-induced parkinsonisms, particularly those caused by cinnarizine/flunarizine and flupentixol. The reduction was balanced by a relative increase in neurodegenerative parkinsonisms, particularly Lewy body dementia. There was a sustained decrease in the time elapsed between onset of symptoms and identification of parkinsonisms as well as identification of its primary or symptomatic nature. The incidence of tardive dystonia (46, 70% of all symptomatic dystonias) remained unchanged Essential tremor referrals markedly increased along the study period. Conclusions. Demographics features of patients attending a Parkinson's disease and movement disorder unit are submitted to changes over time. These probably reflect better awareness about these renditions by patients and physicians, ready access to hospital-based specialised units, and a greater demand for specialised care by the aged.

TI  - Religious control of schooling in England: diversity and division
T2  - INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION
LA  - English
KW  - faith schools
KW  - school diversity
KW  - religious education
KW  - social cohesion
AB  - Britain is a multicultural, multifaith and multiracial society overlaid by white institutional racism. The race riots in the northern cities of England in 2001 and in 2005 signal that social and ethnic divisions are prominent. This article considers the state schooling in England and the role which state-funded faith schools play in government policy to promote diversity in education. It is suggested that the divisive nature of education in Britain is borne of religious beliefs and the relationship of the State to the established Church. Given the decline in the church-going population, it might be anticipated that the interest in state-funded religious education would decline. However, recent government policy has been designed to promote their increase and the number of faith schools has grown. The article is written from the perspective of a liberal theory of education: that all children should have the opportunity to grow into autonomous thinking adults and to which religious proselytizing is a barrier. It is argued that, in the interests of social cohesion, instead of providing a diversity of schools, state education should provide inclusive schools which provide for the diversity of society within it. This is not a balanced review of the advantages and disadvantages of faith schools, which has already been undertaken (Jackson 2003. British Journal of Religious Education 25, no. 2: 89-102; Cush, D. 2003. Religious Education (PCfRE) 25, no. 2: 10-15). Rather, it is intended to contribute to and to strengthen the critical opposition to what is currently a powerful movement at both state and community levels.

AB  - We developed and applied a simple population model to examine the relation between abundance of wolves in a wilderness area and the numbers that emigrate into adjacent agricultural areas and that may need to be removed on an annual basis. The model was applied using Minnesota wolf (Canis lupus) data. The gray wolf is emigrating from northern wilderness areas in the State of Minnesota (USA) into adjacent agricultural and urban areas to the south, and the costs of both wolf control and compensation to farmers for lost livestock is increasing as the number of wolves increases. Emigration reduces the number of wolves on a refuge to about 85% of the carrying capacity, and the number of wolves that emigrate into the agricultural area is 6% of the number on the refuge. With control on the refuge the number of wolves killed is about 10% of the carrying capacity or 24% of the wolves on the refuge, but control on the refuge results in less emigration. A conservative control strategy, in which abundance on the refuge is closer to the carrying capacity and emigration increases slightly, can increase the number of wolves on the refuge with a small increase in emigration.

AB  - Koala dispersal was investigated as part of a detailed ecological study of a nationally significant koala population located 20 km south-east of Brisbane, Queensland. From 1996 to 2000, 195 koalas from three sites were captured and fitted with radio-collars. A total of 40 koalas ( 23 males and 17 females) dispersed from these sites. Most (93%) dispersing individuals were 20 - 36 months of age. Three adult females ( more than 36 months old) dispersed and no adult males dispersed during the study. A significantly higher proportion of young males dispersed than females. Dispersal occurred between June and December, with most dispersal of males commencing in July and August and that of females commencing between September and November prior to, and early in, the annual breeding season. The mean straight-line distance between the natal and breeding home ranges for males and females was similar and was measured at 3.5 km ( range 1.1 - 9.7 km) and 3.4 km ( range 0.3 - 10.6 km) respectively. Dispersing males and females tended to successfully disperse south and west of their natal home ranges and were generally unable to successfully disperse to urban areas within the study area, as a high proportion of the mortality of dispersing koalas was associated with attacks by domestic dogs and with collisions with vehicles on roads. Information from other studies indicates that most young koalas disperse from their natal areas. It is likely that the social behaviour and mating systems of koala populations provide mechanisms for young koalas to disperse. The potential role of dispersal in the dynamics of regional koala populations is discussed.

For this end, a geographical corridor objective study of the river Consota in the Pereira municipality, is assumed. The analysis pretends to recognize the factors and relationships that have impacted in the environmental dynamics resultant from the human settlements' territorialization and space occupation. By this mean, the decisive social, economic, political, cultural and biophysical causes in the transformation and environmental degradation are incorporated. Equally, the analysis facilitates to overcome the traditional environmental management, restricted to proposals from the engineering and the architectural focuses (civil, sanitary and environmental).

AB  - In this paper we use a four-sector, two-region model to investigate the impact of an increase in capital on regional income inequality. We also analyze its impact on wages, and rents on capital and land. These changes occur due to a movement in the internal terms of trade - a worsening of the relative price of rural non-traded goods to urban non-traded goods - as distinct from the international terms of trade. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, an increase in urban capital necessarily immiserizes the rural region and thereby increases inequality among regions.

AB  - Experimental releases of female Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus were performed in August and September 1999, in an urban area of Nova Iguacu, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to estimate their-flight range in a circular area of 1,600 in where 1,472 ovitraps were set. Releases of 3,055 Ae. aegypti and 2,225 Ae. albopictus females, fed with rubidium (Rb)-marked blood and surgically prevented from subsequent blood-feeding, were separated by 11 days. Rb was detected in ovitrap-collected eggs by atomic emission spectrophotometry Rb-marked eggs of both species were detected up to 800 m from the release point. Eggs of Ae. albopictus were more numerous and more heterogeneously distributed in the area than those of Ae. aegypti. Eggs positively marked for Rb were found at all borders of the study area, suggesting that egg laying also occurred beyond these limits. Results from this study suggest that females can fly at least 800 in in 6 days and, if infected, potentially spread virus rapidly.

AB  - The public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) research agenda has explored the issue of equitable access and use of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial data among traditionally marginalized citizens, in order to facilitate effective citizen participation in inner-city revitalization activities. However, prior research indicates that PPGIS is a complex process, with uneven outcomes. The author contends that such unevenness can be explained by use of a new theoretical framework drawn from the literature of politics of scale and networks. The author contends that the PPGIS process occurs in 'spaces of dependence', containing localized social relations and place-specific conditions. The politics of securing this space leads to the creation of 'spaces of engagement' at multiple scales. Within these spaces, networks of association evolve to connect multiple actors from public and private sectors with community organizations. Such networks can contain structural inequities, hierarchical dominance, and fluctuating resources. But these networks also transcend political boundaries and are dynamic and flexible, enabling individuals to manipulate and modify them. In trying to control the revitalization agendas and the material resources required, the actors and community organizations construct politics of scale. For some community organizations, such scalar politics and creative alliances with critical actors allow them to navigate territorially scaled networks of power skillfully in order to gain an effective voice in decisionmaking activities. But other community organizations lag behind, and are not able to form relationships in order to secure their urban space. By the use of new empirical data, coupled with a new theoretical framework, the author aims to contribute both to greater theorization and to better understanding of the uneven and contradictory nature of PPGIS processes.

AB  - Other than co-operation, competition is a central issue in industry and commerce today, which always exists among enterprises that provide homogeneous products or services. The competitive relationships of enterprises determine the rivalry nature of dominant interactions among them; that is, rivalry actions are the main interactions while co-operation actions generally occur on an occasional basis and do not essentially change this competitive nature of their relationships. This paper reports a detailed study of a competitive relationship network of 578 certified Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) in Guangzhou city, China, which shows some prominent scale-free (SF) structural properties and complex dynamical behaviors. In this report, the economic background and the significance the competitive relationship network model will be described; the underlying dynamical mechanism of the network model will be analyzed, showing some advantages of the new model for industrial organization theory (10) over the traditional ones. Finally, some related issues, such as the static properties of the competitive relationship network and some of its graph properties, will be discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analysed levels of genetic differentiation between nine local urban colonies of stray cats using eight coat colour and nine microsatellite loci. Both types of markers revealed a strong differentiation between colonies (F-ST = 0.15 and 0.09 for coat colour and microsatellite loci, respectively). Three coat colour loci showed extreme levels of genetic differentiation comparatively to other loci and are strongly suspected to be under divergent selective pressures. Microsatellite loci showed significant heterozygote deficiency within colonies (F-IS = 0.14), suggesting that coat colour loci are not appropriate to investigate genetic structure at a fine scale because coat colour allele frequencies are based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The reported pattern conformed to that predicted from the social structuring of cat colonies: aggressive exclusion of immigrants, inbreeding and very low dispersal rate.

AB  - At the southernmost part of South America there is Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve where the Magellanic sub-Antarctic evergreen unfragmented the Nothofagus forests still persist. This zone has been considered as one of the world's most pristine regions and this area is currently subject to increasing development pressures from new connectivity, urban expansion and tourism development. Using a biocultural approach we found that the Magellanic Woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) is the favorite bird for the community of Puerto Williams, the world's southernmost town and the biggest human centre in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Although, significant differences (P < 0,05) exists between the preferences of the sociocultural groups toward birds, all groups agreed in their preferences toward the Magellanic woodpecker. This species of bird was the preferred for the people who have been longer in Cape Horn: the members of the Yahgan Indigenous Community and long time residents. The analysis of these results as well as the discovery of ten attributes that this species of picid presents which in addition is the largest of South America, have taken us to consider it like a charismatic or emblematic species with a high potential for the conservation of the austral forests of Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. For this previous reasons the Magellanic woodpecker could be transformed into a symbol or a charismatic species for the conservation of the pristine austral forest. Between the year 2005 and 2007 we developed the Magellanic Woodpecker Implementation Program with the objective to increase both its intrinsic value and habitat valuation and the knowledge from the local community. The discovery of this species potential as well as their later implementation may contribute to the conservation of the fragile, singular and beautiful austral forests and its singular biological and cultural diversity.

AB  - The pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, originates from Eastern North America and was introduced to the Netherlands in 1902 as an aquarium and garden pond fish. At present the pumpkinseed is widely spread throughout the Netherlands and occurs in a variety of aquatic habitats. It is especially abundant in moorland pools, fishing ponds and urban waters. Strong population development of the pumpkinseed appears to be facilitated by nature management practices in existing ponds (the removal of accumulated organic matter and macrophytes) and by creating new ponds. These measures enhance suitable breeding habitats that are free of competitors and predators. Isolated waters harbouring pumpkinseed were more often situated close to human habitation and infrastructure than could be expected based on the distribution of randomly selected isolated waters, identifying introductions as an important dispersal mechanism. In order to minimize the chances of introductions, planning of nature management practices should be done at distances over 250 m from human habitation and 100 m from infrastructure. Macroinvertebrate abundance in pools populated by pumpkinseed was eighty three percent lower than in pools without pumpkinseed, probably due to opportunistic feeding and high pumpkinseed abundances. Currently there is little experience with pumpkinseed control. However, options to be explored include: decreasing depth of colonized waters by filling them with soil allowing them to occasionally dry up, introducing native competitors and predators and the use of biodegradable piscicides. In addition, limitation of the sale of pumpkinseed is required as well as public education on the consequences of introducing exotic species.

AB  - Since the 1960's green movement, green roofs have 're-emerged' as a viable solution to address pressing environmental issues like increased storm water runoff, the urban heat island effect, deterioration of air and water quality, and loss of habitat and biodiversity facing urban centres. Increasingly becoming popular worldwide, green roofs are still not an area local builders are keen to take on. Despite the availability of materials and suitability of climate here, they are held back partly by concerns pertaining to costs. The objectives of this study are to highlight the economic benefits of green roofs that can offset the initial costs; to examine the initial cost implications of having a green roof as compared to a conventional flat roof; to compute and compare the life cycle costs of roof gardens and average flat roofs; and to incorporate economic benefits by incorporating energy costs into life cycle costs. It is observed that life cycle costs of extensive green roofs with or without consideration for energy costs, are lower than that of exposed flat roofs, despite its higher initial costs. However, for accessible rooftops, even life cycle (energy) costs of intensive system are not less than the normal build-up flat roof. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We are moving away from the year 2000, and the goal of "health for all" remains distant. Economic globalization, which many consider to be one of the most serious threats to health, moves ahead, along with globalization of international health policies. A small number of powerful actors are in charge of setting the agenda, and they relegate to an inferior position the World Health Organization, which has moved away from the goal of "health for all." All of this has helped to promote a neoliberal mentality in the field of health. The People's Health Movement was created with the objective of reestablishing the right to comprehensive health and to development with equity as principal priorities of health policies at the local, national, and international levels. The People's Health Movement uses as a strategy the People's Charter for Health, which was approved at the first People's Health Assembly, which was held in Bangladesh in 2000. The Charter expresses collective concerns and the belief in a better and healthier world as a meeting point in order to promote a world health movement and a call for radical action. In July 2005 the People's Health Movement will hold the People's Health Assembly 2, in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. The slogan of that meeting will be "The voices of the earth are calling!-let's build a healthy world." Among the topics that will be examined at the meeting are: health as a fundamental human right; militarization and occupation; environmental degradation; emerging and reemerging pandemics; equity, poverty, and health; the importance of cultural diversity; social and political violence; health in the hands of the people; health at work; traditional medicine and bioenergetic medicine; gender; and health sector reform. The objective of the People's Health Movement is to help to reach the Millennium Development Goals and to smooth the path toward attaining health for all, in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as in the rest of the world.

AB  - Throughout its history, L'viv has belonged to different empires. Its multi-ethnic population consisted primarily of Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians. Western historians and emigres romanticise the city as a multi-cultural metropolis. In fact - whether under Polish rule, during Nazi occupation, or in the Soviet Union, or nowadays as the centre of western Ukraine - the city has always been the site of aggressive identity policies that excluded segments of the population. A differentiated appraisal of the past is not taking place. The local elites are engaged in a politics of memory in which dubious traditions of the Ukrainian nationalist movement are being exalted, and the Jews and the Poles are being eliminated for a second time.

AB  - The western population of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to extensive population declines. Declines have been linked to site conversion of native pine (Pinus spp.) forests for urban development, agriculture, and commercial forest management. We conducted surveys to detect tortoise burrows on corporate timberlands in southern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama during summer 1994. We surveyed 2,759 0.5-ha strip transects on soil types of 9 different suitability categories for gopher tortoises. We found 460 active and 264 abandoned burrows on the 1,380 ha surveyed. Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and midstory canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing midstory canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils and open overstory canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire, midstory control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are recommended on gopher tortoise conservation areas and connective corridor habitats on commercial timberlands. We theorize that restoration of longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests on sandy ridges can produce desirable core habitats and dispersal corridors for gopher tortoises in landscapes dominated by intensively managed pine plantations.

AB  - Conservation of private land through conservation easements, development agreements, and clustered housing has increased greatly as have criticisms of the laws, public programs, and incentives that motivate landowners to use them. Rapid land-use change at the urban-rural interface in Larimer County, Colorado, has given rise to programs that provide a variety of land-conservation options for landowners. As of January 2005, roughly 60% of Larimer County was publicly owned, and 3% or 16,200 ha was privately owned with some form of protection. We used document analysis, a landowner survey, targeted interviews, and a landscape-level spatial analysis to analyze the patterns, quantities, and qualities of private land conservation. We created a jurisdiction-specific typology of desired benefits from local government-planning documents to help evaluate conservation parcels. Most easements and other conservation documents used general terms and did not describe the site-specific values of the land being conserved. Landowners were able to describe some benefits not included in parcel-specific documents, and our spatial analysis revealed parcel-specific and cumulative conservation benefits such as the amount of buffering, infill, connectivity, protected agricultural land, riparian protection, and other benefits not referenced by either documents or landowners. Conservation benefits provided by a parcel varied depending on its geographic location, the specific institution such as a land trust or open space program that a landowner worked with, and the conservation mechanism used, such as voluntary easement or residential clustering requirements. The methods we used provide a template for jurisdictions wishing to undertake a similar analysis. Our findings may assist other jurisdictions and institutions interested in improving bow land-conservation benefits are described; justify and inform future investments in private land conservation; assist local governments and other institutions with the assessment of program effectiveness; and be useful for conservation planners who wish to become more involved in on-the-ground implementation of conservation actions.

AB  - Social relationships result from the organization of actions of individuals as they interactin a society. In other words, social relationships are created from the communication of two or more persons or groups, which in turn constitute the core of social life. For analyzing social relationships, we need to find out the needs and objectives of individuals developing such relationships, how, in what space and what time, such relationships are developed and what are their consequences. Therefore, social relationships need to be visible to be analyzed. In order for neighbor contacts and various forms of communal activities to develop beyond a superficial level, a meaningful common denominator must exist.
   Social and cultural relationships occur in a certain time and space. Physical and functional division of the space may increase or decrease the opportunities for developing relationships. The main requirement is individuals getting together in a certain location and time. Design at different scales consists of urban planning, site design and design of details can have a significant influence on people gathering in outdoor spaces. The present paper describes briefly a project aiming at assessing the influence of the design of urban passage-ways on enhancing people's participation in outdoor activities and its influence on active and passive social relationships. The research was based on both theoretical and field studies. The field studies were performed in Iran capital, Tehran. The results were presented as a recommendation of some principals in three levels: network design, site design, and detail design.

TI  - "We Have Wines of All Kinds: Red, White, and Green": Romanian reactions to the Hungarian uprising in 1956
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Drawing on memoirs, archival documents, and recent scholarship, this article examines the reverberations of the Hungarian revolution of 1956 in three Romanian cities, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Timisoara. Before the collapse of communism in Romania in 1989, a stereotype prevailed that, in contrast to the youth in Hungary, as well as in Poland and Czechoslovakia, Romanian students were too "cowardly" to voice their opinion of the events of the 1950s, including the Hungarian revolt. After the communist regime's collapse, Romanian scholars working with new archival documents debunked this conception, claiming that a student protest "movement" and widespread "demonstrations" (manifestarile) did indeed occur throughout Romania. The truth lies somewhere in-between. Romanian university students were neither too "timid" to speak their minds about the need for reforms, nor tightly united in a movement with a central leadership and specific agenda.

AB  - Truck/Freight traffic occupied a significant portion of the capacity of the transport infrastructure system in Los Angeles region. On the other hand, freight transportation is not only a critical element of the local economy; it is also of national significance. Freight transportation links the large consumer market, the major manufacturing industry sector, and the international trade network of Los Angeles to the rest of the US and the world. As the agency responsible for transportation planning and programming in the county, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs comprehensive tools for understanding the demands of the freight transportation sector and the impacts of transportation investment on this sector.
   Traditional travel demand modeling tools only deal with passenger movements on the macroscopic level. They do not address the movement of freight and truck appropriately. A modeling tool is required to model the multimodal movement of freight and service truck flow in the urban area. To date, Cube Cargo is the only software tool specifically designed to model the movement of freight and truck.
   Traffic microsimulation tools typically focus on the movements of vehicles on a microscopic level. Integration of macroscopic and microscopic modeling tools will provide transport planners more powerful tool to analyze and solve the congestion problems in the urban area. This paper describes an integrated modeling approach to model the regional passenger movement and the truck/freight movement for the greater Los Angeles region first in a macroscopic level than focused in to a section of the I-710 expressway to conduct corridor level microsimulation using Cube.

AB  - Conservation buffers can have a tremendously positive impact on the ecological health of rural landscapes by reducing erosion, improving water quality, increasing biodiversity, and expanding wildlife habitats. Yet, in spite of our knowledge of their value, conservation buffers have not been fully embraced by landowners, or even by policy makers in the United States (US). In this critical review, we examine why conservation buffers remain underutilized in US agroecosystems. We examine the literature on the environmental benefits of buffers, the economic issues related to buffer adoption, and the importance of the aesthetic quality and design of buffers. We propose that many questions related to buffer design and management remain unanswered, and suggest a variety of areas in which future research is necessary to improve buffer functionality and adoption. The implications of this synthesis for designers, planners, scientists, policy makers, and citizens are discussed. Recommendations include: modifying policies to better reflect the preferences of landowners and society, studying buffer systems at the watershed scale using multidisciplinary approaches, and designing buffers that consider aesthetic preferences and regional variation.

AB  - Understanding distribution and diversity of invasive weeds is essential for the development of efficient control measures against it. In the present study, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to assess the biogeographic relationships among populations of the invasive Crofton weed (Ageratina adenophora (Spreng.)) during 2004-2006 in China. A total of 100 ISSR primers with di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide repeats were screened, from which 20 polymorphic and informative primers were selected. Amplification of the 20 primers generated a total of 479 polymorphic bands among the 64 weed populations, and a high level of genetic diversity (H(E)=0.1541 +/- 0.0193) was detected in A. adenophora. Neighbor-joining (NJ) cluster analysis based on genetic distances among populations grouped the populations according to their geographical origin, i.e. (1) populations of southwestern Guizhou, (2) populations of Liangshan city in Sichuan, (3) populations of western Guizhou, (4) Guangxi populations plus Chongqing populations, (5) populations of southern Yunnan, and (6) populations of Yangtze River Valleys in Sichuan plus populations of western Yunnan. A significant positive correlation between geographical and genetic distance was detected by the Mantel test (r=0.183, p=0.0012). Based on the divergence relationships revealed by ISSR markers, it was assumed that A. adenophora mainly dispersed through wind and water in China.

AB  - Aim To analyse the zoogeography of the shallow-water holothuroids of the western Indian Ocean (WIO). Based on this analysis we ask to what extent differences in species' ability to disperse across potential barriers provide an explanation for holothuroid zoogeography.
   Location Shallow-waters (50 m isobaths) of the WIO, extending from Suez to Cape Town and from the coastline of East Africa upward to 65 degrees E.
   Methods Data for the analysis were obtained from Samyn's (2003) monograph on the shallow-water sea cucumbers of the WIO. A species presence/absence matrix with a resolution of 1 degrees latitude/longitude was constructed. These cells were assigned to eight coarser operational geographical units, which were delimited on the basis of published faunistic and geological borders. The analytical zoogeographical methods employed were cluster analysis on several beta-diversity coefficients and parsimony analyses of endemicity. The influence of life-history strategies on the distribution pattern was analysed through examination of latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, and by plotting cumulative curves for species number against range size.
   Results The shallow-water holothuroid fauna of the WIO can be split into several biogeographical units. To the north, we found evidence that the northern Red Sea holothuroid fauna differs from that of the southern Red Sea. The latter has closest affinity with south-east Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and thus the biogeographical barrier of Bab-el-Mandab nowadays seems to be of minor importance. The cold upwelling at the east coast of Somalia forms an effective barrier for holothuroids and especially those with lecitothrophic (short-lived) larvae. Even though the circumtropical biogeographical pattern is not well resolved, important taxonomic turnovers suggest that it is composed of several distinct subprovinces. Taxonomic turnover is at least partially dictated by the dispersion capacity of the different orders.
   Main conclusions This study concludes that the WIO is best split into at least three biogeographical realms: (1) the Red Sea and associated Arab Basin, (2) the asymmetrical circumtropical region stretching from the horn of Africa to southern Mozambique, and (3) southern Africa. Conspicuous differences in dispersal abilities of the three dominant orders are identified. The biogeography of the WIO is best explained by: (1) species' dispersion ability, (2) the prevalent current patterns, and (3) to a lesser, geographically limited extent, recent geological history. As a serendipitous discovery, we found that Rapoport's rule does not hold in the WIO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitalists, defined as hospital-based physicians who take responsibility for managing the medical needs of inpatients, represent a significant trend in physician specialization. However, only limited anecdotal data quantifying the status of hospital medicine groups around the country is available.
   OBJECTIVE: To better understand the extent and nature of the hospitalist movement, utilizing data from the 2003 Annual Survey of the American Hospital Association (AHA).
   STUDY POPULATION: 4895 acute care hospitals in the United States.
   MEASUREMENTS: Number and percentage of hospitals with hospital medicine groups; mean number of hospitalists per group; hospitalists per average daily census (ADC) of 100 patients; distribution of groups by employment model.
   DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES: Census region; rural/urban status; number of beds; organizational control; teaching status.
   RESULTS: There are approximately 1415 hospital medicine groups and 11 159 hospitalists in the United States. The overall penetration of hospital medicine groups at hospitals is 29% (55% at hospitals with 200 or more beds), and the in-hospital impact at hospitals with hospital medicine groups is 3.93 hospitalists per 100 ADC. The average hospital medicine group has 7.9 hospitalists. There is a fairly equal distribution among the 3 major employment models for hospital medicine groups: hospital employees, independent provider groups, and physician groups. All these measures can vary substantially, depending on the characteristics of individual hospitals.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hospital medicine appears to have become part of the mainstream delivery of health care in the United States. No employment model of hospital medicine group appears to dominate this specialty. We expect there will continue to be growth and diversity in the implementation of hospital medicine groups.

AB  - Abundance and seasonality of Histeridae (Coleoptera) associated to brooding hen excrement in the northeast region of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Programs for biological control are usually based on the release of predators and parasites so that no hazard is posed to the natural environment. Coleoptera of the Histeridae family feed on the larvae of synantropic diptera, enabling their use in the control of such flies. The objective of this work was to carry out a survey of the Histeridae species present at a poultry house situated in the city of Sao Joao da Boa Vista, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, aiming to describe their seasonality and the possible associations between the adult specimens. Samples were collected from the poultry houses from January 2001 to December 2002, using two collection methods: soil traps and Berlese funnel. The following Histeridae species were encountered: Euspilostus modestus, Euspilostus spp., Carcinops troglodytes and Hololepta quadridentata. The number of specimens found for each species depended on the collecting method. In the case of the soil trap, E. modestus corresponded to 87.01% of the total number of collected individuals. On Berlese funnel, method C. troglodytes corresponded to 84.38% of the total number of collected beetles. The presence of E. modestus and H. quadridentata was significantly correlated to climatic variations, and positively especialy rainfall (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 for E. modestus and H. quadridentata, respectively).

AB  - The common asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi (Linnaeus) and the twelve-spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata (Linnaeus) are introduced Palearctic leaf beetles that feed exclusively on asparagus. The introduction history of these species in North America is reviewed and their dispersal to and distribution in the Maritime Provinces of Canada are described. Both species were first reported in Canada in 1899 in asparagus production areas in Queenston, Ontario, and other parts of the Niagara Peninsula where they caused serious crop damage. However, we discovered that both species were already found around Quebec City 22 years earlier. Populations now established in the Maritime Provinces of Canada probably originated from southwestern Ontario where most commercial asparagus production in Canada began and now occurs. Crioceris asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata spread steadily throughout eastern Canada by adult flight dispersal abetted by wind, by the dissemination of seeds by birds, and by commercial movement of root crowns and spears of asparagus. Asparagus escaped from cultivation, growing along transportation corridors (such as railway tracks, power utility right-of-ways and roads) and in vacant lands, which facilitated the spread and establishment of C. asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata throughout North America. Now, both these adventive pest species occur wherever asparagus is grown. Both C. asparagi and C duodecimpunctata are confirmed to occur in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but not Newfoundland and Labrador. However, C duodecimpunctata is newly recorded from Prince Edward Island. These introduced beetles are not regulated by Canada or by the U.S.A., and they are readily controlled at economically acceptable damage thresholds.

In this paper, we design a warning method in traffic video monitoring through analyzing vehicle states. This method is based on image analysis and processing technology, extracting the information of the characteristics of the movement of vehicles through detecting and tracking moving vehicles in video image sequence. Then, with the characteristics of the movement of vehicles, we can approximate the trajectory of the vehicle by polynomial and predict the movement of vehicles. According to the velocity vectors of vehicles, we build models to determine the relationship between vehicles and warn the accident that may occur.

AB  - In spite of growing demands for research into the pedestrian movement characteristics of large multilevel spaces, research attempted so far has featured fragmented approaches lacking reference to spatial preference in the process of route choice and decision behavior. This article investigates how multiple design factors, such as attractors and generators of movement, grade separation by multiple levels, and local visual factors of transition spaces, affect the patterns of individual route choice and movement behavior. More specifically, this study explores the dynamic interactions occurring between the internal route structure, the degree of familiarity, and the level changes of the two multilevel systems. This investigation aimed to determine which design factor is more vital for understanding how multilevel systems work in general. The two case studies studied have demonstrated that there are certain hierarchical interactions among those design factors that contribute to route choice and decision behavior in multilevel urban complexes.

TI  - The impact of the crisis on internal population movement in Indonesia
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - One of the ways in which Indonesians have adapted to economic change over recent decades is through permanent and temporary movement within and outside the country. This paper focuses on the effects which the crisis that started in 1997 has had upon population mobility among different groups and in different areas within the country. It begins by summarising the employment effects of the crisis, as indicated by the 1997 and 1998 National Labour Force Surveys. It then uses results from a number of surveys to identify the changes that have occurred in population mobility in Indonesia during the crisis. In particular it looks at the extent and nature of urban to rural movement, and at patterns of movement between Java and the Outer Islands. Although comprehensive data are lacking, it is argued that population mobility has become an important coping mechanism for confronting the crisis.

AB  - A population of urban free-ranging dogs Canis familiaris Linnaeus, 1758 was studied in Katwa, West Bengal, India. The analysis of changes in the density of the dog population over a period of 4 years revealed a considerable stability of this population. Mean (+/- SD) seasonal population density was 185 +/- 19 dogs/km(2), ranging from 156 to 214 dogs/km(2). A sex ratio of 1.37:1 in favour of male was recorded in this study. High mortality (67%) occurred under the age of 4 months, and 82% mortality occurred within the age of 1 year. Among the adults, 24% mortality under the age of 2.6 year was recorded. Only a single breeding cycle and synchronization of breeding was observed. Immigration was observed as a crucial factor affecting the stability of this population.

AB  - The Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident occurred in 1986. The phone from the explosions and fires was highly radioactive and resulted in very high exposure levels in the surrounding regions. This paper describes how the people in Kiev, Ukraine, a city, 120 km (90 miles) south of Chernobyl, and in particular one individual in that city Professor Vitaly Eremenko, became aware of the threat before the official announcement and the steps he took to mitigate potential impacts to his immediate family. The combination of being informed and using available resources led to greatly reduced consequences for his family and, in particular, his newborn granddaughter. He notes how quickly word of the some aspects of the hazard spread in the city and how other aspects appear to not have been understood. Although these events are being recalled as the 20(th) anniversary of the terrible event approaches, the lessons are still pertinent today. Threats of possible terrorist use of radiation dispersal devices makes knowledge of effective individual actions for self-protection from radiation exposures a topic of current interest.

AB  - Areas of the landscape that are priorities for conservation should be those that are both vulnerable to threatening processes and that if lost or degraded, will result in conservation targets being compromised. While much attention is directed towards understanding the patterns of biodiversity, much less is given to determining the areas of the landscape most vulnerable to threats. We assessed the relative vulnerability of remaining areas of native forest to conversion to plantations in the ecologically significant temperate rainforest region of south central Chile. The area of the study region is 4.2 million ha and the extent of plantations is approximately 200000 ha. First, the spatial distribution of native forest conversion to plantations was determined. The variables related to the spatial distribution of this threatening process were identified through the development of a classification tree and the generation of a multivariate. spatially explicit, statistical model. The model of native forest conversion explained 43% of the deviance and the discrimination ability of the model was high. Predictions were made of where native forest conversion is likely to occur in the future. Due to patterns of climate, topography, soils and proximity to infrastructure and towns, remaining forest areas differ in their relative risk of being converted to plantations. Another factor that may increase the vulnerability of remaining native forest in a subset of the study region is the proposed construction of a highway. We found that 90% of the area of existing plantations within this region is within 2.5 km of roads. When the predictions of native forest conversion were recalculated accounting for the construction of this highway, it was found that: approximately 27000 ha of native forest had an increased probability of conversion. The areas of native forest identified to be vulnerable to conversion are outside of the existing reserve network. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All tights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the interconnected issues of mobility, power and meaning in the context of rural homelessness. It explores two common assumptions relating to these interconnections: that rural homeless people move to cities thereby transposing homelessness into an urban problem; and that mobility is deeply implicated in the mapping of moral codes in rural areas. Drawing on a range of interviews with homeless people, and workers with homelessness agencies in the rural areas of Gloucestershire and Somerset, the paper discusses four types of movement: 'local' homeless people moving out of rural areas; 'local' homeless people Moving within rural areas; homeless 'incomers' moving to rural areas; and itinerant/transient homeless people moving through rural areas. The complex mobilities of rural homeless people influence common ideas about where homelessness occurs and how it is experienced. These mobilities also affect how homelessness is 'made known' in rural areas, as different elements of the mobility of homeless people are discursively scattered amongst identity labels and policy arenas other than homelessness. Finally, homeless mobilities problematise the adequacy and nature of policy responses to homelessness in rural areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A growing number of educators worldwide have become convinced that geotechnologies - including geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and remote sensing - are key technologies to prepare students to be tomorrow's decision makers. Grappling with local, regional, and global issues of the 21(st) century requires people who think spatially and who can use geotechnologies. Some educators teach geotechnologies as a discipline, emphasising skills. Other educators use geotechnologies as a tool to teach content, such as geography, history, environmental studies, Earth Science, biology, mathematics, economics and other disciplines. Issues such as traffic, population growth, urban sprawl, energy, water, crime, human health, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture are growing in complexity, exist at every scale and increasingly affect people's everyday lives. Each of these issues has a spatial component. Drivers for geotechnology education include educational content standards, constructivism, the school-to-career movement, active learning, citizenship education, authentic practice and assessment, interdisciplinary education, community connections and a sustained, increasing demand for GIS professionals. Digital Earth is an ideal framework for contextualising domains of inquiry. The Digital Earth community can have a significant impact on the growth of geotechnologies in education, and conversely, the growth of geotechnologies in education and society can foster the forward movement of Earth systems concepts.

AB  - The inmigration process in Spain has been developing in very explosive way during the last years. The city of Seville has been involved in this process, becoming an important center of foreign population attraction. In this movement, the group of Ecuatorians has been the pioneer and they still represent the majority. In this study we try to explain this population arrival process and its settlement in the city of Seville. We analyze the causes of migration, its evolution in time, the demographic characteristics of these groups and the settlement patterns in the city. This article is part of a resarch project founded by the R&D National Plan of Spain, that studies the specific problems of the territorial occupation by the foreign population and the foundation of inmigrant neighbourhoods.

AB  - Mining is considered as activity dramatically damaging environment. However, there are numerous examples of its favorable impact on environment. Opencast mining allows - in some cases - for replacement of unfertile soils by fertile ones formed due to reclamation process, as well as for formation of new attractive landscape forms (rocky fences, hills in flat monotonous terrains, water ponds), formation of new wildlife refuges in the case of abandoned self-reclamated pits.
   Such examples allow to recognize mining also as the activity forming new values of environment and conditions for its protection. Such approach to mining is the mission of Kielce Mineral Mines Enterprise (KKSM), managing its mining activity with the aim to support the environment protection and increase its value. It is: support to forestry, support of wildlife protection through formation of wildlife refuges (e.g. for Nature 2000 network), attractive landscape shaping and formation of recreational sites. KKSM exploits deposits of limestone and dolomite for crushed stone production, and also sand. Rock fences exposed in the abandoned "Korzecko" quarry are recognized as protected area due to landscape value and exposed geological features. 20 bird species are located in that area, with two of them protected ones - according to the Nature 2000 network - occurring directly in the former quarry. On the site of exploited "Mojcza" sand deposit the lake was formed, which increased the landscape value. The recovery of sand from the "Sukow" deposit allows recently to form the lake beautifully located in forested hilly landscape. Beyond the worked area, it is informally used as valuable recreational, swimming pool site near to town agglomeration of Kielce. Sand quarrying of "Nieswin" deposit, located in the middle of Konskie forest complex, is the best example of cooperation of mining and environment management. It is supported by Forest Service, because it allows to remove old forest and replace it by the new one, of higher value due to better soil quality below the removed sand and due to lower distance to underground water level. Such examples demonstrate that mining can fulfill the requirements of sustainable development.

AB  - A survey conducted in Lagoa Arroio Corrente, located in Jaguaruna in the southern coast of Santa Catarina State, makes an assessment of the environmental perception of the residents of Lagoa Arroio Corrente, and indicates important elements of environmental education for the region. This search has a qualitative approach, with support from quantitative elements, and uses a questionnaire to collect data. The results indicate that the coexistence of native to the lake creates links of affection between them, and encourages movement to preserve the area. Furthermore, although they do not use the lake's water for drinking or for domestic purposes, they indicate the lagoon as an excellent hydric resource for the region. They consider the area important for recreation, biodiversity and tourism development for the city. However, the waste disposal in the area and the reduction of the water level are pointed out as major environmental problems facing the region. In future environmental education works in the region, it is important to consider the potential of these residents as possible agents of awareness among vacationers.

However, subway can also cause environmental disturbance during its construction or after operation. The dynamic condition of ground water and the circulation-and movement of soil-water system call also be changed. Geological conditions, especially the in-situ stress condition in bedrock can be altered notably. Consequently, a series of environment hazards, such as surface subsidence, ground splitting, spring disappearance, drainage systems collapse will occur in neighboring area and operating noise will also be the main concerns. The author takes Nanjing subway for an example to demonstrate environmental effects of subway.

AB  - This article takes issue with the common belief that a major cause of fascism in countries like Germany, Italy and Japan was late economic development. In contrast to the suggestion that national exceptionalism occurs where a bourgeois revolution has failed, this article maintains that capitalist development has generally followed the same kind of path in many different national contexts. For this reason it is wrong to exaggerate German exceptionalism. Also challenged here is the notion of fascism as a rural movement which grows in underdeveloped societies. Nazism in particular, it is argued, was an urban-based movement operating in a modern capitalist economy.

AB  - This annotated checklist is the third major compilation for Singapore. It lists the current status of all bird species ever recorded in the wild in Singapore. A total of 404 species have been recorded, including 44 species which are now extinct or have not been recorded for the last 50 years. Some of the latter species have been recorded again as non-breeding visitors. There are now 342 species that occur naturally in Singapore and another 22 species that were introduced by man. Fifty-eight families of birds are represented. There are 121 resident species with proven breeding records and 21 other presumed residents. One hundred and fifty-four species are winter visitors and/or passage migrants, with another 25 species listed as non-breeding visitors and 21 others that occur in Singapore as vagrants.
   Census data since 1991 shows that the total number of birds in Singapore has declined by 40 % and the number of species has declined by nearly 17 %. The most abundant bird species Is a migrant, the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva). The most important site in terms of bird population is Sungei Mandai, an unprotected mudflat and mangrove ecosystem while Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Pulau Ubin are important in having the highest diversities of birds. The loss of mudflats through reclamation, damming of estuaries, and canalisation of rivers has resulted in a decline in waterbird density and diversity as shown in the Annual Waterfowl Census. The current total shorebird population in Singapore is only 4,000 - 5,000 birds, a vast decrease from the large wintering population of 10,000 birds at a single site, the Serangoon Estuary, in 1985.
   Forty-one of the 44 extinct species were resident forest birds, of which, 34 (82.9 %) went extinct between 1900 and 1950. This equates to 3.4 species lost every five years, an alarming rate of extinction for a small island like Singapore. The most susceptible families are the Trogonidae and Eurylaimidae, with 100 % species loss, and Picidae, with 56.3 % species loss. The susceptible bird families are predominantly those of the forest, whereas the resistant families exist largely in open country and scrub. In fact, only three extinct species were not largely dependent on tropical rainforests for their existence. Forest species such as the Green Broadbill (Calyptomena viridis) became extinct from the forests as recently as 1941. This emphasises the role that habitat destruction has played in shaping Singapore's avifauna.
   Fifty-four species of birds are at risk of extinction, of which 34 species (63 %) live in the forest. The remaining patches of forest in Singapore are mostly protected in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that should provide a safe haven for the forest birds. However, the forests are too fragmented, small and constantly disturbed by thousands of visitors. By connecting the smaller Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to the much larger Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the forest patch size can be increased and might allow more movement of animals and plants between the two patches. Many forest birds are secretive or weak fliers and are reluctant to cross open spaces. A green corridor might encourage them to do so. Another 16 species (29.6 %) of threatened birds are specialists of mangroves and wetlands. Preservation of these most-threatened of ecosystems in Singapore is of utmost importance to the survival of the birds found in these special habitats. With improvement in the quality of habitats, we could perhaps slow down the rate of local extinction of the avifauna of Singapore. Our remaining habitats need to be protected and laws protecting wildlife must be strictly enforced, so that the birds may have a chance to coexist with us.

AB  - With the spread of AA as a social movement and a treatment philosophy within and across nations of the world in dealing with problems of drinking, a growing sensitivity to diversity has emerged. This in turn has created a need to delve into contextually influenced responses to AA and the nuances of culture in responding to AA. The purpose of this qualitative research exercise was to explore the beginnings of AA and the unfolding of meanings of its prescriptions for recovery, as experienced and shared by members in a metropolitan city, in South India. A clear indigenization process was traced in the way AA is interpreted and applied in practice. The study also revealed selective attention to the 12 steps and the use of initiative in adapting various features to suit local beliefs.

LA  - English
CP  - Annual Conference of the Society-for-Post-Medieval-Archaeology
AB  - The late 17th century saw the emergence in England of the notion of polite urban space. Materially it manifested itself in the introduction of classical architecture, the reform of the street and a growing investment in refined public buildings and venues. These changes were driven by a combination of practical and cultural forces, the latter associated with the development of the town as the focus of an Enlightenment culture based on civility, sociability and improvement. Expressions of power were at the very heart of this urban Enlightenment. It was intended that the lower orders be excluded from polite space, while fashionable society who did occupy it deployed it to establish or sustain their authority and status. From the late 18th century the primacy of polite space began to decline under the impact of rapid economic and urban growth, the rise of romanticism and the withdrawal of fashionable society itself. In the loth century, especially during the final decades, the idea of the classical town and polite urban space saw a revival, and today it supports not only an influential conservation movement, but also provides the inspiration for new shopping centres, small suburban estates, and - in the case of Poundbury on the edge of Dorchester - what is virtually a new town. Though the tendency now is to emphasise the idealistic aspects of classicism and the Enlightenment, the modern revival of polite urban space also draws on the darker side of the Georgian inheritance, offering - no less than in the 18th century - an avenue for the pursuit of power and status.

AB  - Challenges facing urban planners and governments continue to mount as populations in urban areas increase, pressure on the world's resources reaches critical levels and degradation of ecosystems around the world becomes increasingly apparent. The movement towards sustainable development has been met with enthusiasm by decision-makers, although exactly how to achieve this target, or even measure progress towards it, is not entirely evident. This paper explores how complex urban systems can be modelled holistically using a multi-agent based framework, and their sustainability assessed using a systems approach.
   There are numerous subsystems and corresponding resources (natural, financial, human and man-made) within an urban development such as water, energy, transport, waste, economic and social systems. All of these subsystems and their interrelations can be modelled using multi-agent systems, along with effects of human behaviour, both spatially and temporally, in order to provide planners, developers and decision-makers with a better platform for understanding the complexities of the urban form.
   As well as the presentation of a general overview of how the complexities of urban systems can be best captured using integrated modelling techniques such as multi-agent systems, the AUSTIME methodology, "Assessment of Urban Sustainability Through Integrated Modelling and Exploration", will be briefly presented. This methodology is designed to show how quantifiable sustainability assessment, based on system resource thresholds, and multi-agent based modelling, can be integrated into a framework that can be used for decision making and management relating to policy, regulation, planning, design and development of urban systems. The framework is designed to form part of a cyclic process, such as an adaptive management and learning or total quality management cycle that can explicitly include stakeholder participation and ongoing evaluation.
   Specific examples of the implementation of this methodology are provided from a case study of Christie Walk, an eco-development in inner-city Adelaide, Australia. The case study involves the development of a prototype multi-agent based model coupled with a sustainability assessment framework that allows quantifiable sustainability comparisons for a range of indicators between the Christie Walk development and the larger Adelaide metropolitan area. Simulation results show that the eco-development performs significantly better than the majority of Adelaide metropolitan developments, specifically in carbon dioxide production, where the development's occupants rate below the 5(th) percentile of all Adelaide residents. The model is subsequently used to examine scenarios relating to changes in occupant behaviour, development infrastructure and location. Simulations comparing the relative impacts of car ownership and use behaviour, and infrastructure design changes (where air conditioners and heaters are required to regulate indoor temperatures), show that high in-house electricity use behaviour related to infrastructure changes to Christie Walk could have a greater effect on equivalent carbon dioxide production than increased car ownership and use (potentially due to a location change to an outer suburb of the Adelaide metropolitan area). This result is just one example that highlights the necessity for planners and governments to consider the relative importance and effects of all subsystems in urban areas on the overall system's sustainability before attempting to design and choose management options and plans.
   It is envisaged that the AUSTIME methodology and case study application will help provide an example of how integrated modelling and sustainability assessment can be built into adaptive management cycles and effectively used as a decision making tool to work towards the sustainable development of urban environments and their inhabitants.

AB  - The isolation of animal populations due to urban activities provides a useful framework for studying the consequences of landscape fragmentation. We studied a population of natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) in an urban park near Paris, France. In 2001 and 2002 we used radio-tracking to estimate the terrestrial movements of adults around their breeding sites. Twenty-four toads were equipped with internal transmitters in 2001 to record movements during and after the breeding period. In 2002, 19 males were released at 300 and 380 meters from their breeding ponds. Natterjack toad movements around and outside their breeding ponds were reduced compared to previous observations on this species. The only exchanges that were observed occurred between closely neighbouring breeding sites. During a translocation experiment in 2002, 58% of the displaced males returned to their site of capture and this happened mainly during the breeding period. The remaining 42% stayed close to the release site. There was no exchange of males between distant breeding sites. Natterjack toad conservation needs to take into account the high fidelity to a breeding site and the reduced breeding dispersal and homing ability of these animals. Conservation biology in urban landscapes constitutes a specific urban ecology with specific concepts such as 'population area'. Information from this study can assist land managers in establishing protected areas of high habitat quality around breeding ponds in urban areas, and managing parks for the protection of amphibian populations, particularly by facilitating exchanges between available areas.

AB  - HOW DO we describe city spaces? There has been, in recent years, a prolixity of differing views on the treatment of this question in which two opposing general tendencies stand out: the reductionist and the phenomenological positions. Reductionist theorists argue that a city is no more than a lattice of physical enclosures, apertures, planes, intersections bound together by the regulatory force of the Cartesian grid. A phenomenological approach, on the other hand, can provide a theory of wider scope; it can include in the description of a city's attributes the corporeal, the sensual and psychological aspects of subjective experience, as well as the broader cultural characteristics of the different communities and subcultures which contribute to the diversity of city spaces. From this point of view, the reductionist position appears locked within its own rigidity, creating ossified spaces by relying on the method of deductive analysis, rather than on direct sensory experience. Non-reductive theories (of which there are many different kinds) align themselves with the notion that a city is not just the sum total of buildings and streets; indeed, it is not generated by the neat ontological division of container and contained: metaphorical space can supervene upon the physical divisions of the urban metropolis.
   The phenomenological view adopts a body-centred paradigm in which there is no clear dichotomy between the experiencing subject and the external world. On this reading, time and space are perceived as fluid rather than immutably constituted. Space does not have an a priori character; it is defined and moulded by the subjectivity and social consciousness of those who experience and inhabit it. This has significant implications for understanding the role of sound as a component of urban experience. For the phenomenologist there is no veil of sense-data interposed between the epistemological subject and the objects of perception. Instead of space in the abstract, we may invoke the much more mercurial concept of place. Place allows particular localities to be defined in terms of their history and social use, investing them with cultural meanings and values and making them available for active intervention and transformation.
   Place can be used as a concept to define a geographical area on the scale of nation-states, or the intimate domain of the home. It can mean the reconfiguring of social boundaries. For a Jewish community, for example, the demarcation of the Eruv redefines an existing public space and creates a sanctuary as an extension of the sacred space of home or the synagogue. Ritual and custom are attributes that have the effect of strengthening attachment to places. A sense of place can also be generated through subeultural re-appropriation, such as the use of the concrete ramps and steps underneath London's South Bank centre by skateboarders. Place fuses the real with the mythical, the virtual with the actual; it is a space which encourages flights of imagination, as for instance in Robert J. Yudell's description of the Chrysler building 'Here we have not only the vertical differentiation of the building but chunky setbacks which conjure landscapes or grand stairways. We can imagine scaling, leaping and occupying its surface and interstices' (Bloomer and Moore, 1977). The essential point, I think, of this phenomenological approach, is to show that it is not the space itself that changes; rather it implies a transformation in attitude to space and how we define it.
   Our climate, culturally speaking, is increasingly defined in terms of visual space. Media and communication for the most part are equated with billboards, television and recently DVD. Aural space has, for the moment, become merely a ubiquitous presence, to be registered peripherally.
   However, I will argue that sound, especially within the context of the urban environment, is never a neutral phenomenon. Each sound is imbued with its own lexical code: sound as sign, symbol, index; as ostensibly defining a personal territory in the case of the ghettoblaster or car stereo; as creating a portable soundscape in the case of the Walkman.
   Phenomenology has the potential to play a critical role in contributing towards an aural definition of space, but its impact has yet to be fully realized. There has been, however, a group of practitioners who have sought to articulate a humanist account of the sonic environment. Essentially, soundscape design alms to increase people's awareness of their own sonic environment in order that they might play an active role in its subsequent transformation: eliminating noise which desensitizes the ear, while preserving sounds whose semantic signals play a defining role for a community or churches respect the need for quiet contemplation. Churches and cathedral spaces are particularly interesting in cities because they are among the few spaces which stretch time. Long reverberation times affect actions within the space, slowing movement and speech; small incidental sounds are magnified, allowing the listener to appreciate internal harmonic fluctuations as the tone decays. The acoustic ability to stretch sound has several different effects: speech which allows time for the words to hang in the air before evaporating out of audible range can appear more weighty and monumental, even rhetorical. Within these spaces incidental sound material, sounds which we may treat as aural dust, footfalls or the occasional cough, are also given heightened presence through filtering and natural amplification. Lengthening a sound's life has invested it with a reverential sanctity that is usually reserved for ecclesiastical objects. The church as acoustic vessel tends to give the worshipper a multi-sensory experience of the sacred. Music theorist Kurt Blaukopf has suggested that sound could be seen as a mediator between congregation and sacred ritual. Low-frequency non-directional sound helps to bind a community together:
   This directness of sounds that cannot be located contributes significantly to the social effect of the musical-liturgical event. The anonymity of the sound source built into the architecture is the acoustic guarantee for the internalizing of church norms and, at the same time, the basis for the view that comprehends church liturgy as part of the heavenly liturgy. (Blaukopf, 1982: 182)
   So, what is an urban soundscape? I have described various aspects of what constitutes an urban sonic fabric. Schafer's approach has merit insofar as it has defined terms which enable a listener to decipher the aural landscape. However, embedded in his work is a romantic bias towards antiquarian or rural soundscapes, as if these are assumed to be more refined than their modern-day equivalents. While Schafer's energy is spent defending the case for cleaning up urban pollutants, other issues, such as whether sound can aid our understanding of social relationships between communities, get left aside. These aspects are examined in the work of both Corbin and Stoekfeld, and surprisingly these reveal similar tendencies in asserting the significance of acoustic territory.
   Important for me is the notion that aural space is both tactile and ephemeral: it cannot be contained within fixed boundaries. Sound objects can be electronically magnified, replicated and scattered like dust over an entire cityscape. Aural space should be celebrated as the most liquid of spaces, offering a model for the kind of fluidity that a whole range of other disciplines aspire to.

T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - COMMUNITY
AB  - California's watersheds supply water for drinking, recreation, industry, and farming and at the same time provide critical habitat for a wide variety of animal species. Conceptually, a watershed is any sloping surface that sheds water, such as a creek, lake, slough, or estuary. In California, rapid population growth in watersheds has led to increased conflict between human users of natural resources, dramatic loss of native diversity, and general decline in the health of ecosystems. California ranks second in the country in the number of listed endangered and threatened species.
   With information from survey respondents on their views, beliefs, and perceptions about nature, technology, science, and political issues, this article explores California watershed-based organizations and their activities. We describe the primary sources of the watershed-based movement in the state of California, the many facets of "institutionalization" of watershed activity, the diversity of the movement, and the value and role of science in watershed organization and activity. We find that institutionalization is influenced by the presence of public land ownership within the watershed, the human population and location of the watershed, the age of the watershed group, and the presence or absence of listed endangered species. Our analysis shows that the bulk of watershed organizations are located in northern California and along the coast. Most watershed groups are located in urban settings with relatively high population density. Those areas without watershed-based organizations appear to have slightly poorer overall water quality and fewer aquatic species at risk. There is a fairly strong association between the number of endangered species within a watershed and the extent of watershed group activity. We find that one primary reason activists are involved in watershed-based activities is their residential rootedness. Watershed activism can be broadly understood as a type of place-based activism. It combines science with place-based sensibility.

AB  - Clay slurries, mixed in seawater, were deposited on intertidal mudflats in two contrasting estuaries in an experiment designed to evaluate the potential impact of soil erosion from adjacent urban developments on the biodiversity of the benthic communities, and the subsequent recovery mechanisms. Profiles of the natural abundance of stable isotopes from sediment cores where examined to determine immediate and longer-term impacts of the clay on the ambient sediments. The source clays with delta C-13 values of about -26 parts per thousand were easily distinguished from natural sediments with delta C-13 values of -19.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand at site OK and -14.2 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand at site WP, and bioturbation was seen to generate a gradient between these values. Physical processes of burial, or erosion and dispersal by estuarine flows initiated the recovery process. Repeated drying cycles left the clay surface cracked and able to trap natural sediments and food on the otherwise barren surface, Colonisation of the clay plots by the mud crab, Helice crassa, was important to the recovery process and depended on proximity to adjacent crab colonies. Burrowing activity by larger crabs enhanced the erosion of the clay surface while the resultant bioturbation blended the clay into the underlying sediments. Smaller crabs had less effect on erosion and bioturbation from their burrowing was mostly confined within the clay layer. Where the clay was more than 3 cm thick, they did not break through the bottom of the clay and the interface between clay and sediment was still sharp after 12 months. C-13 variations also indicated that crab burrows and cracking of the clay surface moved natural sediment deep into the plots where it could be worked into the clay by subsequent crab burrowing activities thus enhancing recovery from the clay impact.

AB  - The northern Great Pains, including the Canadian Prairies, were opened for commercial agriculture by the spread of railways. In the process a characteristic railway landscape or "railscape" was developed in the region. Despite the inroads of the truck and the automobile, much of this railscape still survived in 1970; it was based on an extensive network of branchlines serving large numbers of small wooden grain elevators. By the year 2000, however, major changes in the railscape have occurred and more were on the horizon. The rail net shrank considerably, and the elevator rows along the tracks that had anchored many small towns and villages largely disappeared. These landscape changes are reviewed here over the period 1970 to 2000, organized in terms of main-line landscapes, other active railscapes, and railscapes of abandonment.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide occurs in high concentration (10-200 mg/l) in different parts of Kuwait City and its suburbs at relatively shallow depths (15-40 m from the surface). This was revealed by drilling through the aquifer system underlying the city and sampling and analyzing the ground water at the drilled locations. The near-absence of coliform bacteria in the sulfide-rich zones, the presence of sulfur-reducing bacteria in the deep (> 80 m) Dammam Formation aquifer and a linear positive relation between the concentration of hydrogen sulfide and the total dissolved solids content suggested non-anthropogenic origin of the sulfide in the ground water of Kuwait. The upward movement of sulfide-rich water from depth and its differential flushing by surface recharge through outcrops of the aquifers appear to have given rise to the present distribution of hydrogen sulfide in the aquifers underlying the Kuwait City.

AB  - Short-term forecasting of traffic parameters such as flow and occupancy is an essential element of modern Intelligent Transportation Systems research and practice. Although many different methodologies have been used for short-term predictions, literature suggests neural networks as one of the best alternatives for modeling and predicting traffic parameters. However, because of limited knowledge regarding a network's optimal structure given a specific dataset, researchers have to rely on time consuming and questionably efficient rules-of-thumb when developing them. This paper extends past research by providing an advanced, genetic algorithm based, multilayered structural optimization strategy that can assist both in the proper representation of traffic flow data with temporal and spatial characteristics as well as in the selection of the appropriate neural network structure. Further, it evaluates the performance of the developed network by applying it to both univariate and multivariate traffic flow data from an urban signalized arterial. The results show that the capabilities of a simple static neural network, with genetically optimized step size, momentum and number of hidden units, are very satisfactory when modeling both univariate and multivariate traffic data.

AB  - Several house gecko species of the genus Hemidactylus are almost cosmopolitan lizards, with distributions that have probably been shaped by natural transoceanic dispersal as well as by more recent human introductions. Here we revise the Hemidactylus populations of Madagascar and compare them genetically with populations from other sites in the Indian Ocean region. Morphological data strongly confirm the occurrence of three Hemidactylus species on Madagascar: Hemidactylus frenatus, distributed along the western coast of Madagascar; H. platycephalus, restricted to the north-west and the widespread H. mercatorius that occurs throughout the island, including coastal areas at sea level as well as big cities (Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa) at altitudes of 1200-1300 m above sea level. Analyses of partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene in 46 Hemidactylus specimens from Madagascar, East Africa, South Asia, and the Comoro and Mascarene archipelagos demonstrated the presence of a fourth species, H. brooki, on the Mascarenes (Reunion, Rodrigues, and Mauritius) and Comoros (Moheli). The Malagasy populations of H. platycephalus were genetically uniform and differentiated from the African and Comoroan specimens studied. H. frenatus had a relatively low genetic differentiation over the whole region with no recognizable phylogeographical structure, indicating more recent colonizations or introductions. In contrast, H. mercatorius showed a strong phylogeographical structure of haplotypes, with two distinctly different lineages in Madagascar. Moreover, all Malagasy specimens differed strongly from the single African specimen included. This indicates that populations of H. mercatorius in Madagascar have a long history that predates human settlement. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - A column study was conducted to determine the effect of city compost, lime, gypsum, and phosphate on cadmium (Cd) mobility in three well-recognized benchmark soils of India [viz., (Islamnagar) Vertisol, (Amarpur) Inceptisol, and (Khala) Alfisol]. Columns made of PVC were filled with soil treated with different treatment doses [viz., 0.5% city compost, 1% city compost, 2% city compost, 2.5t lime/ha, 5t lime/ha, 2.5t lime/ha + 0.5% city compost, 2.5t gypsum/ha, 2.5t gypsum/ha + 0.5% city compost, and 100kg P2O5/ha as potassium phosphate (KH2PO4). The columns were leached with 100mg L-1 Cd under saturated condition. The amount of water moving through the soils was measured as the pore volume. A delayed breakthrough curve (BTC) of Cd in the presence of lime has been observed in all the studied benchmark soil series. Among the treatments, lime application reduced the movement of Cd from surface soil to lower depth of soil to a large extent resulted in 9, 25, and 45% more retention of Cd in surface soil of the Islamnagar, Amarpur, and Khala series respectively. Explanation for reduced Cd mobility in limed soil can be derived from pH changes of soils. In comparison to control soil, phosphate application caused 6, 21, and 30% more retention of Cd in surface soil in the Islamnagar, Amarpur, and Khala series, respectively. Combined application of lime and city compost reduced the movement of Cd in the soil profile. It appears that organic matter controls the sorption of Cd in soils. The amount of Cd sorbed increased with increasing organic carbon content, but gypsum application may leach Cd beyond the root-zone depth. A rapid breakthrough curve was observed under gypsum-treated soils. Retardation factor revealed that a somewhat lower degree of Cd retention occurred in the Khala series, which might possibly be attributed to less clay content and low pH. Overall, the column study indicated that total Cd accumulation occurred up to depths of 5-7.5cm, 7.5-10cm, and 10-15cm in soils of Islamnagar, Amarpur, and Khala series, respectively.

AB  - A mark-release-recapture of Culex pipiens pallens was conducted in an urban area of Japan during June 26-29, 2007. Larvae naturally occurring in rain gutters were collected and reared to adults in a laboratory. A total of 10,183 emerging female Cx. pipiens pallens of 4-8 days old were marked with fluorescent dye and released from one site. Recapture was made on 4 consecutive days using 41 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traps with I kg of dry ice and human landing collection, and 121 marked females were recaptured. The overall recapture rate was 0.01. The mean distance traveled by the recaptured females was estimated as 470, 287, 326, and 517 in on days 1-4, respectively. The maximum flight distance of host-seeking Cx. pipiens pallens was estimated as 1,217 in based on the relationship between distance from the release site to the collection site and the total number of recaptures/traps. The population size of female Cx. pipiens pallens in the study area was estimated as 100,904 +/- 8,509. The size of operational area for the control of Cx. pipiens pallens in urban area is discussed.

AB  - [1] Pipe breaks are used as indicators of the structural state of pipe network. The approach used considers times to failure between pipe breaks as random variables. Pipe lifespan is divided into two periods, the first one characterized by time-dependent hazard functions (nonexponential period) and the second one characterized by constant hazard functions (exponential period). Closed-form expressions have been derived for probability density functions of occurrence of breaks for all break orders as well as expressions for the time evolution of the average number of pipe breaks per unit time. An optimal replacement criterion is defined on a pipe-to-pipe basis based on a cost function using conditional probabilities to estimate the expected future costs. Minimization of this cost function leads to a replacement criterion involving hazard functions. When applied to models with constant hazard functions, this criterion identifies a critical pipe break order at which replacement should be made.

AB  - An examination of the links between migration and development using census micro data for 15 Latin American countries reveals that: (i) internal migration is diminishing, which was not foreseen in the specialist literature, (ii) internal migration, while apparently helpful for individuals and beneficial for successful regions, erodes the human resources of poorer regions, and (iii) as a result of increasing urbanization, urban-urban migration is replacing rural to urban migration as the predominant flow and other types of migration are on the increase, an example being intrametropolitan migration which, unlike the traditional kind, is driven by residential and not occupational factors. Where policy is concerned, the governing principle is freedom of movement within a country's borders, without restrictions or resettlements. Governments have to resort to incentives and indirect measures if they wish to influence migration decisions; however, local measures and regulations do influence intrametropolitan migration choices.

AB  - This article describes the structure of the adolescent romantic and sexual network in a population of over 800 adolescents residing in a midsized town in the midwestern United States. Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social policy are explored.

AB  - Twenty-plus years of reform have brought about a highly complex system of housing tenure in urban China. Although the traditional work unit housing under rental occupancy remains the dominating tenure mode, an increasing number of urban households have become owners under various forms of subsidized homeownership. The author analyzes data derived from a survey conducted in 1996 of movers to newly completed "commodity housing" in Beijing and Guangzhou. Findings show that despite the many attempts at privatization and commodification, private housing in Beijing has become almost nonexistent. In Guangzhou, the open-market sector is better developed, and a sizable number of households have opted to move from subsidized to nonsubsidized housing. The findings also reveal that although the direction of movement is significantly related to the current tenure, it is unrelated to whether the move involves a change in tenure status.

AB  - Amazonian varzea forests are floodplains inundated by nutrient-rich white-water rivers occurring along the Amazon River. They are regularly flooded for up to 2 10 days per year by water columns of 10-15 m. Topographic variation results in different flooding amplitudes and durations along the flooding gradient, where the different tolerance to flooding of different plant species results in a vegetation zonation. We made a review of literature about the vegetation composition of varzea floodplain forests of Brazilian Amazonia along the Amazon River. Twenty-two studies were selected. Basing on the distribution of inventories which are concentrated in three main areas around the three larger cities Belem, Manaus and Tefe, we classified the inventories into three regions: (A) Estuary region with flooding regime influenced by daily inundations linked to the tides; (B) Central Amazonia near Manaus; (C) Western part of Brazilian Amazonia bordering Peru and Colombia, including Tefe and the "Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentavel Mamiraua". Summarizing the analyzed species lists, 36 tree species were registered in all sampled regions including the estuary. The regions A + C have 63 species in common, region B + C 143, and A + B 50. In the inventories analyzed here, an increase in species numbers from East to West can be confirmed, but it is difficult to state whether this is not an artefact due to local sampling. Vertical zonation patterns are difficult to discuss due to the lack of comparable data. The inventoried areas are small, and there is an urgent need for comparable floristic inventories throughout the basin. Destruction is spreading rapidly and the traditional use of forests and its resources is changing to a destructive exploitation that already has changed much of the physiognomy and diversity of this unique ecosystem.

AB  - In the mid-1950s, the City of Cape Town was part of a wider area demarcated as a Coloured Labour Preference Area. The free movement of African people into the city was strictly controlled and the residential areas were segregated along racial lines. In terms of Apartheid's grand design, an area designated Mitchell's Plain was demarcated for occupation by Coloured people in 1973 while another designated Khayelitsha was allocated for African people in 1984. The two areas were incorporated in one magisterial district, Mitchell's Plain, in the mid-1980s. A sample survey of the area was conducted in late November and early December 2000 with a focus on labour market issues. Its aim was to capture occupants of households aged 18 or older. The survey data has been interrogated to describe the connections between migration, poverty and health in a city where recent rapid urbanisation is changing the demographic profile significantly. As a consequence, the need to provide adequate infrastructure, decent housing and employment poses a daunting challenge ten years after the new democracy has been ushered in.

AB  - Soil and radish (Raphanus Sp) samples from areas treated with organic compost of recyclable urban garbage were quantitatively analyzed by using tube-excited energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis. Soils treated with 10, 20 and 30 t/ha of recyclable urban garbage and control soil were analyzed. The layer soils were collected at 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60cm depth. It was possible simultaneously to determine the elemental concentration of various elements: K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr and Pb in recyclable urban garbage, soil treated with organic compost of recyclable urban garbage and radish plants cultivated in these soils. The elemental concentration of K, Ca, Ti and Fe were determined at percent level (macro-elements) and the other elements at ppm level (micro-elements). It was also possible to observe a significant increase in the contents of K, Ca, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr and Pb in the soil treated in comparison with the control soil and it was also verified whether the transport of these elements to radish plants cultivated in these soils occurred.

AB  - In this article, we suggest a system that automatically constructs knowledge based artificial neural networks (KBANN) for the holistic recognition of handwritten Arabic words in limited lexicons. To build a neuro-symbolic KBANN classifier for a given vocabulary, ideal samples of its words are first submitted to a structural feature extraction module. The analysis of the presence and possible occurrence numbers for these features in the considered lexicon enables to generate a symbolic knowledge base reflecting a hierarchical classification of the words. A rules-to-network translation algorithm uses this knowledge to build a multilayer neural network. It determines precisely its architecture and initializes its connections with specific values rather than random values, as is the case in classical neural networks. This construction approach provides the network with theoretical knowledge and reduces the training stage, which remains necessary because of styles and writing conditions variability. After this empirical training stage using real examples, the network acquires a final topology, which allows it to recognize new handwritten words. The proposed method has been tested on the automated construction of neuro-symbolic classifiers for two Arabic lexicons: literal amounts and city names. The application of this approach to the recognition of handwritten words or characters in different scripts and languages is also considered.

TI  - The transformation of landscape ecological structure following the land privatisation in Hungary since 1989
T2  - CONSEQUENCES OF LAND USE CHANGES
LA  - English
CP  - Symposium on Ecological and Socio-Economic Consequences of Land Use Changes
AB  - The portion of privately owned lands in Hungary has increased from 2% to 56% since the political and social changes in 1989. Land ownership by the cooperative farms has undergone a significant transformation and today they cultivate 26% of the arable land. Only 18% of the land has remained the property of the state.
   This significant change in proprietorship has considerably modified the landscape ecological structure of Hungary. However, the character of transformation has varied according to the dominant type of land use of a given area. For example, large tillage has been repressed on the arable lands of the Great Hungarian Plain. The amount of land in the private sector was notable in the Tokaj wine-region even before the changes. Of the forests in the wooded range of mountains and hills, 65% is still in the hands of the state. The use of ecological corridors has changed due to nature conservation motives. The free market price of land surrounding urban settlements determines the land use to a greater extent now than earlier.
   In the first section, this paper introduces the general tendencies that characterise the whole country. This is followed by a description of landscape ecological changes which have occurred in the most characteristic types of landscape. In addition to the changes in landscape structure, attention is also given to the consequences of other changes that affected the ecological features of the typified landscapes. Some of the phenomena can be explained hy socioeconomic reasons. For example, a significant part of the privatised land is cultivated by people who were forced to the agricultural sector as a result of industrial unemployment. The use of fertilisers, chemicals and irrigation has declined due to the owners' lack of capital. The privatised woods are in great ecological danger; there are too many abandoned fields, and the recreational demands are in constant conflict with protection of the wet ecotopes along the lakes and rivers.
   The effects of joining the European Union increasingly influence the structure of land use and the landscape as well. According to preliminary calculations, at least 25% of the arable land will change land use type - from intensive plough to pasture or wood, or from meadows to extensive pasture or wood production - which constitutes 2 million hectares in Hungary.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS-based integrated analvsis of coastal changes and their environmental impacts in Lingding Bay, Pearl River Estuary, South China
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Substantial changes are taking place in the coastal landscape as a result of rapid urbanization. A series of environmental and resource problems have emerged owing to rapid urban development, including encroachment of agricultural land, land reclamation, silt deposition in rivers, and severe flooding. These problems have had a significant impact on sustainable development in Lingding Bay, the largest estuary of the Pearl River. This paper demonstrates that remote sensing can be effective in monitoring the dynamics of coastal zones, such as coastline movement, urban expansion, land-use changes, and migration of shoals and deep-water channels. Remote sensing data from 1978 to 1998 were used to detect the accelerating changes that have taken place in the study area. A hybrid approach has proved to be an effective way of improving remote sensing image classification, with multi-temporal compound imaging, for coastal change analysis. Geographic information system (Intergraph's modular GIS environment, MGE) software was used to assist planners in the analysis of such changes, by combining the maps from 1974, 1989 to 1997 and integrating the multiple (spatial and attribute) databases. The result demonstrates that: (1) the Pearl River estuary is being reclaimed, estuarine waterways are getting narrower; the area of water near Humen town has narrowed by 4-6 km; (2) shoals in Lingding Bay have reduced the area of water by 114 km(2) over the past 23 years; the area of deep-water channels has declined by similar to 24 km(2), even with dredging; on average, the area of water has decreased by 5.9 km(2) annually; western channels migrated eastwards 0.8 and 1.1 km during the first and second 10-year period, respectively; according to this scenario, the western channel will disappear from Lingding Bay in approximately 183 years; (3) land-use changes: 92% of shoal reclamation occurred in the 1980s and 80% of waterway reclamation happened during the 1990s; Panyu District of Guangzhou city leads the table in land reclamation, Zhongshan city is second, and Zhuhai city third; the area of reclamation in the last 10 years is slightly more (1.18 times) than in the previous 10 years, in particular, there was a 1.6- and 1.8-fold increase, respectively, for the Zhongshan and Zhuhai coastal regions; at the current rate of reclamation, Tangjia Bay in Zhuhai and Jiaoyi Bay in Dongwan will vanish in approximately 25 and 70 years, respectively; the decline of the bays will cause large-scale destruction of the aquatic environment-the consequences should not be ignored. The impact of such changes on flood control and prevention, and coastal planning, are also discussed. We stress the importance of regulating and controlling the long-term development of coastal areas in the Pearl River Delta. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2003 - 2005, systematic studies in four contrasting hydrogeologic settings were undertaken to improve understanding of source and transport controls on nitrate movement to public supply wells (PSW) in principal aquifers of the United States. Chemical, isotopic, and age tracer data show that agricultural fertilizers and urban septic leachate were the primary sources of large nitrate concentrations in PSW capture zones at Modesto, California ( Central Valley aquifer system) and York, Nebraska ( High Plains aquifer). Urban septic leachate and fertilizer ( possibly nonfarm) were the primary sources of large nitrate concentrations in PSW capture zones at Woodbury, Connecticut ( glacial aquifer system), and Tampa, Florida (Floridan aquifer system), respectively. Nitrate fluxes to the water table were larger in agricultural settings than urban settings, indicating that it would be beneficial to reduce PSW capture zone areas in agricultural regions. Mixing calculations indicate that about 50 to 85% of the nitrate in water from the PSW could be from those modern anthropogenic sources, with the remainder coming from sources in old (> 50 years) recharge or sources in young recharge in undisturbed settings such as forests. Excess N-2 concentrations and age tracers showed that denitrification at Modesto occurred gradually (first-order rate constant of 0.02/a) in a thick reaction zone following a similar to 30-year lag time after recharge. Denitrification generally was not an important nitrate sink at Woodbury. At York and Tampa, denitrification occurred rapidly ( 0.5 to 6/a) in thin reaction zones in fine-grained sediments that separated the anoxic PSW producing zones from overlying oxic, high-nitrate ground water. Particle tracking showed that a major pathway by which anthropogenic nitrate reached the York and Tampa PSW was by movement through long well screens crossing multiple hydrogeologic units ( York) and by movement through karst features (Tampa), processes which reduced ground water residence times in the denitrifying zones. These results illustrate how PSW vulnerability to nitrate contamination depends on complex variations and interactions between contaminant sources, reaction rates, transit times, mixing, and perturbation of ground water flow in contrasting hydrogeologic settings.

TI  - Interbasin underflow between closed Altiplano Basins in Chile
T2  - GROUND WATER
LA  - English
AB  - Interbasin ground water movement of 200 to 240 L/sec occurs as underflow beneath a mountainous surface water divide separating the topographically higher Salar de Michincha from the topographically lower Salar de Coposa internally drained basins in the Altiplano of northern Chile. Salt-encrusted flats (salars) and saline lakes occur on the lowest parts of the basin floors and comprise the principal evaporative discharge areas for the basins. Because a surface water divide separates the basins, surface water drainage boundaries do not coincide with ground water drainage boundaries. In the region, interbasin ground water movement is usually not recognized, but occurs for selected basins, and at places is an important component of ground water budgets. With increasing development of water for mining industry and potential exportation of ground water from the Altiplano for use at coastal cities, demonstration and quantification of interbasin movement is important for assessment of sustainable ground water development in a region of extreme aridity. Recognition and quantification of interbasin ground water underflow will assist in management of ground water resources in the and Chilean Altiplano environment.

AB  - Landslides in the city of La Paz, Bolivia are complex in space and time. Their distribution within the city is differentiated by geographical variations in slope gradient, the nature of overlying surface deposits, and drainage density patterns. When mapped, the distribution of the most landslide-prone locations in the city coincides with the most mobile surface deposits on the higher and steeper slopes of the city. The timing of landslides is triggered when slope materials become saturated with moisture by rainfall, stream water, water seepage from high surrounding water tables, and from domestic sources. Landslide frequencies over the last 40 years show the role of inter-annual variations in summer rainfalls, especially the late summer period (Jan-Mar), and rising water tables connected to Lake Titicaca. Associations with ENSO events, both warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina), prove negative, pointing to the importance of moisture sources from the north, south and east (Amazon) but not from the west (Pacific). The most vulnerable group exposed to the landslide hazard comprise the inhabitants of the self-built informal housing areas who occupy the more elevated steeper slopes of the northern part of the city. But societal vulnerability to earth movement in the city is widespread and interconnected. Higher income groups in the southern part of the city are affected by slower, if less dramatic, forms of land failure, and rich housing in downstream areas of the city are impacted by flash flooding encouraged by deforestation on the northern hill slopes where the poor live. Two case studies highlight the vulnerability and plight of the inhabitants of the self-built settlements in the aftermath of a major landslide, and a brief discussion of hazard mitigation and the importance of building hazard resilient communities concludes the paper.

AB  - Drawing on data relating to some 500 households, taken from local government records and questionnaire surveys, this paper examines the processes of migration and social change associated with the resale of former local authority dwellings in a rural part of the East Midlands, England, UK. Legislative change principally stemming From the Housing Act (1980) has given tenants a 'right to buy' their rented dwelling from the local authority landlord. By focussing on the longer term impact of this process the findings of this study reveal a radical discontinuity with the past, as new households with contrasting characteristics to previous occupants move in when these dwellings are resold on the open market. The study shows that the relative affordability of the dwellings in a highly competitive rural housing market is creating an opportunity for comparatively young, dual-career and largely urban families to move to the countryside. Their movement into former local authority dwellings has important implications for the future provision of local needs housing in rural areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To offer high quality services, when users are increasingly demanding and competition more and more hard, is now a major problem that transportation companies are faced with. So, ensuring a regular traffic needs to identify the randomly occurring disturbances that affect the transportation system and to eliminate or reduce their impacts on the traffic.
   This paper presents a decision support system TRSS (Traffic Regulation Support System). TRSS is a supervision environment for the regulation of urban transportation System. TRSS (train and bus) is based on the regulation operator decision-making process. It provides the operator with the information lie needs to identify disturbances and evaluate potential corrective actions to be carried out, according to the regulation strategy lie has selected.
   The first part of the paper presents the decision model we work with. The second part deals with the functional model used in the decision Support system. Decision Support system for transportation and characteristics of a DSS for a transportation system are described in the third pail. In the fourth pail, we present the components of the decision-making TRSS supervision tool. In the fifth part, we present the criteria of evaluation and the sixth part is devoted to the presentation of the results.

AB  - The selective use of Australian native plants for urban landscape designs in Australia has lead to the development of urban landscapes with a uniquely Australian style. This trend has occurred principally in the last 3 - 4 decades. Hesitancy accompanied early plantings of different native plants as people experimented, unsure of how they would grow and adapt to the constraints of the Australian urban setting, or how they would be accepted. Through the persistence of nurserymen and the creativity of early pioneers of Australian landscape design using native plants, the movement toward the 'natural garden' style continued to grow and expand. In conjunction with the parallel national movements of Australian Landcare and Aboriginal reconciliation, a greater appreciation of the Australian natural landscape and the subtle qualities of its unique, native vegetation has led to increased acceptance and popularity of native plants in urban settings. Designers continue to explore the subtle attributes of native plants in a wider selection of design applications. People are more confident about planting natives having greater understanding of their growth requirements, such as low nutrient regimes, specific light and soil pH requirements, or salinity tolerance or sensitivity. Native plants are now used in a broad range of urban landscapes, from residential through to commercial and industrial sites and increasingly in public spaces. The evolution of an Australian style in urban landscape design based on the use of Australian plants is on the brink, with the vast potential of Australian plants still to be more widely explored, valued and understood.

TI  - The adjustment of supply chains to new states: A qualitative assessment of decision relationships with reference to congestion charging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS
LA  - English
AB  - As part of an ongoing inquiry into the decision making processes in urban freight distribution chains in the retail sector, a series of in-depth interviews with buyers and sellers of freight services in Sydney (Australia), complemented by a review of the broader literature, were undertaken with industry leaders. The specific focus is on identification of the role played by agents in the chain, especially in terms of their influence in decisions made, and the nature and extent of diversity in the profile of freight contracts and associated behavioural responses to transport-related policy. Senior managers of suppliers, retailers and freight firms discussed their general operations, the manner in which freight contracts are established and maintained, and their responses to unforeseen changes in factors within and outside of the control of the firms under contract. A particular focus is on the positions likely to be taken as behavioural responses to congestion charging schemes that are increasingly being discussed by government agencies. Existing experience with the growing network of toll roads in Sydney was used as a reference context within which to open up a dialogue of pricing of the road network. Toll roads are compared with congestion charging, to consider the potential effects of congestion charging on urban goods movement.

CP  - 5th International Conference on Behaviour of Steel Structures in Seismic Areas
AB  - The seismic inelastic behavior of two 7 and 17 levels buildings with structural steel frames, located in zones transition (II) and soft (III) in the Mexico City, is been calculated and compared. The dynamic analysis step by step in time dominion is used for the inelastic responses calculations, with the obtained resistances of the modal spectral analysis. For the transition zone the VIVE-EW-85 and ROMA-EW-89 accelerograms are employed, this last one affected by a 3.29 factor that allows to give an approximation of the action that might have occurred during the 1985 earthquake in that specific place in the city. For the soft zone the record SCT-EW-85 is used. It is determined how the seismic inelastic response variation of the structural steel buildings, so much global as local, as long as the vibrations periods of each studied building approach or separate, according to the dominating period of the soil movement.

AB  - Individual differences in behaviour are a phenomenon that is more and more attracting the attention of scientists. Among the other reasons, behavioural individuality occurs because selection favours the adoption of different tactics by individuals. It is now widely recognized that within many vertebrate species, individuals vary along an axis the extremes of which are represented by individuals 'bold' and 'shy', sometimes called 'proactive' and 'reactive'. Here we present the case of feral domestic cats (Felis catus L.) living in group in the urban environment where showing bold attitudes is linked to the benefit of a high annual reproductive success but, on the other hand, to a high probability to be infected by the Feline Immunoficiency Virus (FIV), a lethal disease caused by a retrovirus. In this species, natural selection has probably favoured proactive temperament in spite of the cost represented by getting the disease. In fact, proactive individuals, even if FIV positive, reproduce more than reactive individuals before the last stage of FIV-infection (AIDS) characterized by a loss of immunological defences and subsequent opportunistic infections. Evolutionary implications are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a xylem-limited bacterial pathogen that causes leaf scorch symptoms in numerous plant species in urban, agricultural, and natural ecosystems worldwide. The exact mechanism of hydraulic disruption and systemic colonization of xylem byXf remains elusive across all host plants. To understand both processes better, the functional and structural characteristics of xylem in different organs of both healthy andXf-infected trees of severalQuercus species were studied. Hydraulic conductivity (K-s) inXf-infected petioles ofQ. palustris andQ. rubra decreased significantly compared with healthy trees as the season progressed and plummeted to zero with the onset of scorch symptoms. Prior to the onset of symptoms, embolism was as much as 3.7 times higher inXf-infected petioles compared with healthy controls and preceded significant reductions inK(s). Embolism likely resulted from pit membrane degradation during colonization of new petiole xylem and triggered the process that eventually led to vessel occlusion. Pit membrane porosity was studied using the following four methods to determine if a pathway exists in the xylem network of woody stems that allows for passiveXf migration: (i) calculations based on vulnerability to cavitation data, (ii) scanning electron micrographs, (iii) microsphere injections, and (iv) air seeding thresholds on individual vessels. All four methods consistently demonstrated that large pit membrane pores (i.e. greater than the diameter of individualXf) occur frequently throughout the secondary stem xylem in severalQuercus species. These large pores probably facilitate systemic colonization of the secondary xylem network and contribute to the high susceptibility to bacterial leaf scorch exhibited among these species.

TI  - Story-telling and history construction: rereading George Cadbury's Bournville Model Village
T2  - JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA  - English
AB  - In 1895, an innovation in the provision of model housing by manufacturers occurred with the development by George Cadbury of Bournville Model Village. This was the first model settlement to provide low-density housing not restricted to factory employees. This paper uses the Bournville archives to explore the accepted history of this settlement. It is argued that the accepted history is a particular reading of this planning experiment. The paper explores the construction of the `accepted history', identifies some of the authors behind the history and uses the minute books and secretary reports of Bournville Village Trust to construct an alternative historical narrative. The alternative history is one in which Bournville begins as a building estate rather than as a model village. The building estate was provided with no community facilities, and the houses were targeted at the lower- and upper- middle classes. Cadbury repackaged the building estate by appropriating the garden city movement, in return the garden city movement also appropriated Bournville by using it as a working example of a model garden village. The paper makes a contribution to theoretical debate by linking a literature from organizational studies concerned with story-telling and construction to historical geography.

AB  - Community networks help build place-based community by offering individual citizens and organizations access to the Internet, the ability to post information online, and opportunities to discuss community affairs. Community networks are inspired by a dynamic vision of community that incorporates a global sense of place. A global sense of place is valuable because it helps to illuminate a place's connections with the world and may therefore enable scale-jumping forms of activism. This article analyzes interviews with participants in four U.S. community networks to explore how networks combine a politics of mobility, a politics of access, and a politics of place to construct a global sense of place. The degree to which each network emphasizes mobility, access, and place varies. This variation has implications for both community activism and issues of diversity in community. Networks that fail to link mobility, access, and place may increase, rather than decrease, inequalities in access to electronic communications as well as to forms of political power.

AB  - As we enter the new millennium, wildlife professionals, hunters, and trappers are increasingly challenged by an influential animal rights movement opposed to many of the values and behaviors associated with traditional wildlife harvest and management. We argue that the emergence of the animal rights movement is related to profound sociocultural and demographic shifts occurring within modern society. It is a product of broad macro-structural conditions that, having converged in advanced industrial societies of the late twentieth century, provide fertile ground for the rapid rise and powerful influence of this philosophy. We begin by tracing the development of the philosophy of sportsmanship and the rise of the North American conservation movement. We then discuss animal rights values within the con text of 4 social precursors necessary for the widespread adoption of animal rights ideology: 1) an urban epistemology (or world view) disconnected from the reality of wild nature; 2) a popularized interpretation of science which, for many people, provides evidence for a belief in animal rights; 3) anthropomorphism, or the projection of human traits and characteristics onto nonhuman animals; and 4) egalitarianism, in which the concept of rights is extended to the nonhuman animal world. Finally, we discuss the implications of the animal rights movement for the fu hunting and trapping.

AB  - In relation to the increase in population movement in the Asia-Pacific region in the last decade, research and policy interest has focused on the increase in contract labor migration, mostly for unskilled work. The movement of skilled migrants, either temporarily or permanently, has also increased significantly. The major trends and patterns are examined within the various policy frameworks that enable such movements to occur. Issues of transferability of skills and protection of jobs for nationals are examined within this context. Regional agreements and the possible creation of a regional labor market under APEC are discussed. Finally, the issues facing policymakers in sending and receiving countries and the need for greater regional dialogue and cooperation are canvassed.

AB  - A model of soil variability as a continuous background process with superimposed point contamination was applied to 569 measurements of metal concentrations (Cr, Ni and Pb) in the topsoils of Sheffield, England. Robust estimators of the variogram were shown to be required to describe spatial variation of the metal concentrations at most sampled locations. This is diagnostic of the presence of a contaminant process. Values of the standardized kriging error from the cross-validation of each datum were used to identify spatial outliers for each metal. The ordinary kriged estimates of Cr, Ni and Pb were mapped after removing the outliers to estimate the background variation. Each of the 35 spatial outliers that occured in gardens have concentrations exceeding their Soil Guideline Value for residential land use with plant uptake, highlighting a potentially significant exposure pathway. The frequent observation of coal and furnace waste at these sites suggests that their dispersal, following domestic use and industrial processes, respectively, represents a significant point contaminant process. There was no evidence for spatial clustering of the point process. However, the spatial outliers of Cr and Ni showed a significant association with disturbed sites identified from historical land use maps, in part due to their prevalence in areas of historical steel manufacture. The magnitude of diffuse pollution for each metal in the urban soil was estimated by removing the spatial outliers and comparing robust measures of location with those from a survey of soils developed over the same parent materials in adjacent rural and peri-urban environments. The Winsorized mean Pb concentrations in urban topsoil (203 mg kg(-1)) were twice the value in the rural environment (101 mg kg(-1)), highlighting a very substantial diffuse Pb load to urban soils. The equivalent estimated diffuse components in urban soils for Cr and Ni were, respectively, 25% and 14% higher than the rural soils.

AB  - Debris flows, landslides and rock falls are severe abrupt mass movement hazards, whose recorded occurrence in China has increased markedly in the past two decades. With the county- and city-based data, the debris flow hazard zonation for China was accomplished using the Rapid Zonation of Abrupt Mass-movement Hazard (RZAMH) approach, whose principles are described in the Part I companion paper. The entire area of China was classified into five regions with different degrees of hazard. Landslide and rock-fall hazard zonations for China were also presented. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the RZAMH approach. Direct validation was made with comparison of the zonation results and historical recordings on occurrence distribution of debris flows. The zonations produced by the RZAMH approach and other methods were compared by similarity analysis and paired-sample t-tests for the indirect validation of the accuracy of the RZAMH approach.

AB  - We present here a detailed analysis of a seismic data set recorded by a dense seismological network installed over 6 months in the southeast of France. This experiment was set-up at the boundary between the Ligurian basin and the southern subalpine thrust belt (the Nice arc), which is a complex tectonic region that undergoes low to moderate seismicity. We recorded more than 500 microearthquakes, among which 348 occurred exactly in the centre of the network during a very active seismic sequence that lasted mainly over 2 months.
   We performed an absolute location of all of the events and calculated the magnitudes. Then we applied a cross-correlation technique to gather similar events and to relocate relatively few of them. This method revealed a very clear alignment of 19 events in a direction N120 degrees oblique to the N20 degrees general trend of seismicity. Focal mechanisms were determined for the four largest events and composite solutions for 32 smaller ones. Both the alignments of the earthquakes and the focal solutions revealed that two oblique segments of the fault were activated during the crisis.
   The main segment (8 km long) that was oriented NNE with a left-lateral strike slip movement is called the Blausasc fault. Taking into account the tectonic evolution and the relationships between surface structures and the distribution of earthquakes, and through a paleaoreconstruction of the tectonic evolution, we propose that the Blausasc fault is the hidden root of the Peille-Laghet fault, which has a mapped length of at least 15 km. The smaller segment (0.6 km long) that was activated during the crisis could be interpreted as an antithetic Riedel fracture.
   The active Blausasc fault is located in a densely populated zone, at only 10 km from the crowded cities of Monaco and Nice. It is thus particularly interesting to analyse it for hazard assessment. In the last section, we present a simulation that is aimed at predicting what the ground motion in the city of Nice would be like if an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 occurs on this fault. For this, we used the recordings of the largest event of the seismic sequence (Ml = 3.2) and an empirical Green's function summation scheme to simulate the ground motion at two stations situated in urban environments. The values obtained show that especially on soft soil sites, the effects of such an earthquake would be considerable in the city of Nice.

AB  - Studies of biological invasions indicate that natural recruitment of new species can occur as a "nucleation" phenomenon, in which scattered colonization. fuci spread and coalesce. Ecological reclamation of damaged lands might make use of this potential for enhanced natural dispersal, by inoculating sites with multiple small plantings to attract animal dispersers and other mutualists from nearby remnants of natural habitat. We conducted an experimental test of this proposition.
   On a 6-ha section of an abandoned municipal landfill in the New Jersey Meadowlands, we installed 16 clusters of 21 trees and shrubs in an array of fenced plots. Clusters contained seven native species known to: (1) attract bird dispersers to introduce propagules from remnants of off-site habitat; (2) contribute propagules by virtue of high reproductive output and clonal growth; and (3) accelerate woodland succession on open, degraded habitats. Average plant size was varied, with half the plots receiving larger tries and shrubs, to test whether woody plant size would enhance any attractive function. An additional eight empty plots were studied to estimate background rates of recruitment and to test for a fencing effect. Site preparation included the addition of 90 cm of fresh substrate, including organic matter, and a cover crop of annual grasses. Recruitment of woody plants inside and surrounding the experimental plots was examined fur five years, and results were compared on the basis of treatment and recruitment mode (avian, wind, or clonal dispersal).
   Woody plant recruitment into experimental plots was rapid and substantial, primarily via dispersal from natural sources. Plots with larger plants attracted significantly more recruits at the outset. but this difference diminished over time. Fall seed rain samples yielded a mean estimate of 426 seeds/m(2) within plots. However size distributions of recruiting woody species increasingly shifted toward larger individuals each year. Experimental manipulations that opened seed beds for woody plant recruitment had short-lived effects. indicating a narrow window of opportunity for establishment. Spread of the planted species themselves was generally weak, although clonal growth contributed substantially to spread on the margins of plots.
   Most recruitment outside experimental plots was from external sources. A strong proximity component was found fur bird-dispersed recruits, which were highly clustered near planted plots, with the highest densities near source populations on the site margin. Wind-dispersed trees and shrubs, by contrast, were nor associated with planted plots and were concentrated near one corner of the site. Discounting plot interiors, total recruitment density for the site after 5 yr was similar to 800 woody stems/ha, 36% via avian dispersal. 10% via clonal spread, and the remainder via wind-borne propagules. New recruits represented 26 woody plant species, all but four from external sources, and only five common species contributed more than a few recruits. We conclude that techniques for manipulating natural seed dispersal hold promise for ecological restoration, provided that background populations are available to supply colonists.

TI  - Auxiliary fronting in Peranakan Javanese
T2  - JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
LA  - English
AB  - Peranakan Javanese (PNJ) is a relatively undescribed variety of Javanese spoken primarily by ethnic Chinese native speakers of Javanese in the city of Semarang in Central Java (Indonesia). PNJ makes a structural distinction between auxiliaries and main verbs. Auxiliaries are unique in that they undergo optional head movement to C. Not only do single auxiliaries move to C, as in familiar languages, but sequences of two or three auxiliaries can move to C as well. Significantly, the order of the moved auxiliaries is always the same as the order in their unmoved position. The distribution Of auxiliaries in PNJ is predicted if a 'tucking in' (Richards 1997) analysis of head movement similar to that of Collins (2002) is adopted. The PNJ facts are of special interest not only because they are an example of an additional language/construction that shows the distribution expected oil the basis of 'tucking in', but also because PNJ provides evidence that helps to distinguish between a HEAD MOVEMENT analysis and the 'standard' version of the RFMNANT MOVEMENT analysis, in which adverbs occupy fixed positions in the clause. It is quite difficult to distinguish between these approaches empirically, so the PNJ auxiliary facts are important in this regard.

AB  - To determine periods of incremental landslide movement and their possible relationship to regional seismic events, the tree-ring records of 32 tilted and damaged conifers at three sites on landslides in the Gravelly Range of southwestern Montana were examined. Several signs of disturbance in the tree-ring record indicating landslide movement were observed. Commonly, the tree-ring record displayed a marked reduction in annual ring width and/or the reaction wood formation. The tree-ring records from the three landslide sites indicate multiple periods of movement during the 20th century. Many of the periods of movement indicated by the strongest signals (most trees) at the sites occurred the year following significant earthquakes in the region. Those seismic events for which evidence in the tree-ring record was found at one or more of the three sites are the 1983 Borah Peak, 1959 Hebgen Lake, 1935 Helena, 1925 Clarkson, and 1908 Virginia City earthquakes. This Study suggests that many of the landslide movements were triggered by, or are coincident with, earthquakes as much as 200 km from the study area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - Background: The prevalence of tic disorders in children varies from 1% to 29% depending on the characteristics of the study population, the diagnostic criteria, and the study design and methods.
   Aims: To calculate the prevalence of tic disorders among primary school children in Italy.
   Methods: The study population comprised 2347 primary school children from the city of Pavia ( pop. 80 073), Northern Italy. Using trained school teachers as the source of cases, all children with motor or vocal tics occurring intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity were accepted. The type, frequency, and circumstances of tic disorders were noted. School performance was correlated to the presence of tics.
   Results: A total of 68 children ( 56 boys, 12 girls) aged 6 - 11 years were identified with tic disorders. The period prevalence was 2.9% ( 95% CI 2.3 to 3.7). The prevalence was 4.4% in boys and 1.1% in girls, with no detectable trends at age 6 - 11. Motor tics were present in 46 cases, vocal tics in 6, and motor and vocal tics in 16. Situation related tics were noted in 37 cases. A significant correlation was found between the presence of tic disorders and impaired school performance.
   Discussions: Tic disorders are a fairly uncommon but disabling clinical disorder among primary school children from an urban community. The fairly low prevalence of this clinical condition, as compared to other reports, can be explained by the choice of stringent diagnostic criteria and the exclusion of patients with other movement disorders.

AB  - Professional visual artists have always enjoyed considerable latitude in the selection of a place of work and residence. Recent decades have witnessed their growing presence within the Canadian countryside. This paper seeks to provide an interpretation of this phenomenon by exploring two sub-objectives. First is to determine whether artists who establish themselves in rural communities can be considered to be part of the counter-urbanisation movement, involving the relocation of urban residents down the settlement hierarchy. Second is to identify what types of migration are occurring and why. Our surveys of visual artists residing in the southern Ontario communities of Elora and Parry Sound reveal that most participants are part of a movement involving the decision to take up both residence and employment in a rural locale. We further find that the relocation of visual artists is driven to some extent by a strong attachment to natural landscapes. By way of conclusions, we briefly speculate about the broader population of urban residents. We remind ourselves that artists often have been harbingers of new movements and that today there are growing numbers of workers outside the artistic community who also have increasing latitude in regards to choosing where to live and work. Overall, our findings suggest that there is ongoing blurring of geographic boundaries-between space and place, between place of work and place of residence and, of course, between rural and urban.

LA  - English
CP  - 79th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - Travel-related and damage-avoidance benefits and costs of conducting seismic retrofit improvements to arterial bridges are examined, with consideration of the risk posed by a relatively low probability but high damage earthquake (a design level event). The city of Seattle's arterial bridges and viaduct structures serve as vital components of the urban road network, providing for the ongoing transportation needs of citizens and commerce. Failure of these bridges in the event of an earthquake would have significant negative impacts for the movement of people and goods, and thus on the local economy. Shoring up the city's bridges to resist earthquake damage would clearly bring benefits, thereby preventing the impassable arterial bottlenecks that would otherwise occur. The question is whether or not the potential benefits of seismic retrofit improvements warrant their investment costs, thereby providing an economically efficient use of public dollars. For the purpose of addressing this question, a methodology for evaluating the potential benefits and costs associated with bridge seismic retrofit improvements is presented, quantifying these impacts for a two-phase retrofit program and considering the results in light of risk and uncertainty. The evaluation procedures developed consider a major earthquake with defined probability and compare the travel-related and damage-avoidance benefits that would be generated by retrofit improvements with their associated implementation costs. Emphasis is placed on travel impacts because researchers would find nontransportation economic impacts extremely difficult to quantify without knowing all of the other physical, built environment impacts that would occur with a major seismic event. Standard measures of economic feasibility are reported, and in the case of Seattle, seismic retrofit improvements demonstrate moderate positive economic rates of return. The implications posed by expected utility theory for risk-averse decision makers in such cases involving earthquake uncertainty are also discussed.

AB  - Many studies have estimated the parameters of metapopulation dynamics by assuming a steady-state habitat-occupation pattern by organisms. However, metapopulations of woody plants in suburban landscapes rarely attain a steady state owing to the long life spans of individuals. We constructed a colonization model for woody plants based on the distance from a seed-source patch containing mother trees. It is easy to determine colonization parameters with this method, which makes the method useful for conservation planning. Distance from the seed source was the most important factor for predicting the presence of juveniles in a destination patch. The probability of colonization was estimated as a logistic function of the distance from the nearest seed source. Patch-level simulations using actual colonization parameters and forest distributions (based on field measurements) showed that about half the species studied in Yokohama (Japan) would fail to recolonize the studied region for at least 20 generations. Moreover, patch density was too sparse for 30% of the studied species, which will thus be unable to expand their distributions and reverse local extinctions. Dominant species of the region's climax forest will not reach vacant patches, and normal vegetation succession will be obstructed.

AB  - The United States has a highly varied landscape because of wide-ranging differences in combinations of climatic, geologic, edaphic, hydrologic, vegetative, and human management (land use) factors. Land uses are dynamic, with the types and rates of change dependent on a host of variables, including land accessibility, economic considerations, and the internal increase and movement of the human population. There is a convergence of evidence that ecoregions are very useful for organizing, interpreting, and reporting information about land-use dynamics. Ecoregion boundaries correspond well with patterns of land cover, urban settlement, agricultural variables, and resource-based industries. We implemented an ecoregion framework to document trends in contemporary land-cover and land-use dynamics over the conterminous United States from 1973 to 2000. Examples of results from six eastern ecoregions show that the relative abundance, grain of pattern, and human alteration of land-cover types organize well by ecoregion and that these characteristics of change, themselves, change through time.

AB  - Regardless of what the actuality of Brazil's role as a global soft commodities supplier may be, the importance of the agrarian sector in the country's economic structure has declined continuously in the last hundred years (GDP, employees). The increase in industrialization and urbanization was accompanied by deagrarianization. This left capital-intensive agribusiness enterprises producing for the global market and also left agricultural workers, who are only successful sporadically with demands for their own land. Simultaneously, rural communities and customs gained more and more importance culturally. In the 1920s, a search began for Brazils own roots in these ruralities. Urban elites tried to compensate for the loss of rural lifestyle by romanticizing the rain forests, indigenous people, Gauchos, Sertanejos and the landless. In this way they intended to calm and museumize them. The diversity of Brazil made the mysticizing of a standardized figure such as the Gaucho (Argentina), Cowboy (USA), Campesino (Mexico) or Bauer (Germany) difficult.

AB  - This article examines the conditions under which, in June 1975, a marginalized, stigmatized population -the prostitutes of the French city of Lyon- took the step of collective action, occupying a church for more than a week to protest against police repression. It highlights the difficulties these politically inexperienced women encountered in mobilizing, namely preventing defections and choosing an appropriate mode of action; difficulties they were able to surmount thanks to resources provided by outside supporters endowed with practical knowledge in matters of collective action (activists in a group with close ties to the broad movement known as catholicisme social((1)) and feminists). Despite this assistance, however, the prostitutes' mobilization quickly declined and soon expired, in part because of the leaders' defection.

LA  - English
CP  - 2nd International FLAC Symposium
AB  - As a result of increased importance of highway traffic between Tokyo Metropolitan and Osaka city, there is increasing need for a new highway line connecting these cities. However, land use intensity in Japan is so seriously overcrowded that a site selection of bridges for a new highway line is too difficult to take into account suitable geological condition and/or favorable work condition. Therefore, it often occurs that bridge piers are constructed in extreme areas. Yamakiri No.1 Viaduct bridge is also one of the 2(nd) Toumei highway bridge, constructed near the center of Shimizu City. In this construction work, a caisson pile pier with 8 m diameter is to be excavated after completion of an ascending bridge pier 28 m in height, and they have only 5.6 m between them. So, a problem resulting from neighboring work might be encountered. A large deformation at the top of a neighboring bridge pier is one of the most critical problems and it must be considered in design practices. A numerical study using FLAC3D has been conducted in order to estimate an interacted behavior among them. This study shows that a small ground movement due to excavation of a caisson pile pier may take a large deformation at the top of a neighboring pier, and a small land slide may also occur when a bridge pier is constructed on inclined ground. These phenomena are mainly due to two conditions. One is the existence of a weak sand layer near the surface, and the second is a stress concentration due to the dead weight of the neighboring bridge pier. When these two conditions meet, excavation work for the caisson pile pier may have great effect on the stability of the neighboring bridge pile. This can be easily investigated with the use of 3-dimentional analysis.

AB  - The number and abundance of exotic weeds in native forest fragments are known to correlate with the distance to the nearest large town. This is of concern as land near lowland forest is increasingly being subdivided for housing throughout much of New Zealand. We quantified the relationship between settlements and exotic plants for the coastal forests in eastern Northland, New Zealand. Exotic plant species were sampled in 18 coastal forest areas of varying size, and related to attributes of nearby settlements (housing proximity, density, age, and the exotic plant species present). All settlement attributes were significantly related to the number of exotic species present in neighbouring forest fragments, unlike fragment size. The exotic species found in a particular forest area were significantly more likely to be present in the neighbouring settlement than in other settlements. The number of houses within 250 m of a forest area, alone, explained 66.8% of the variation in the number of exotic plant species in these forests. Our results suggest that proximity and size of settlements are currently the dominant factors controlling the number of exotic plant species in these forest areas, rather than ecological conditions within the forests. Properly managing the locations and densities of new subdivisions, as well as the species grown in gardens in existing and new subdivisions near forest reserves, will reduce the weed pressure and subsequent cost of weed control in these reserves.

AB  - In past works the authors set up a refined model for electric power networks under earthquake action. The procedure models the fragility of components with respect to earthquake action, the complex behaviour of the stations and the network, the power flow, the network capability to feed the nodes in a damaged condition, the earthquake damage on the territory, the need to deliver electric power to the municipalities where most damage has occurred. In later works the method was improved towards design goals: nonetheless complexity of the network seismic behaviour, a procedure to maximize safety of selected nodes and minimize economic expenses was constructed, allowing identification of which components, within each station, had to be upgraded to obtain the maximum economic convenience. The procedure was programmed within the ASK4ELP computer code (National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, U.S.A., 1999) using late 1990s state-of-the-art knowledge for both the earthquake and the structural behaviour models.
   Recently the method has gone through a thorough updating, partially still in progress. Among the results, it is now more clear how important is a correct soil geotechnical model to predict the system response and safety. This paper presents, together with a short summary of the ASK4ELP procedure, these latest advancements and results and shows, through a real example, the sensitivity of the predicted safety to soil modelling.

AB  - The seismic elastic and inelastic behavior of two 7 and 17 levels buildings with structural steel frames, located in zones transition (II) and soft (III) in the Mexico city, is been calculated and compared. The buildings design is done according to the specifications of the Construction Code in Mexico city, employed since 1993 (RDF-93). The dynamic analysis step by step in time dominion is used for the inelastic responses calculations, with the obtained resistances of the modal spectral analysis. For the transition zone the VIVE-EW-85 and ROMA-EW-89 acceleration registers are employed, this last one affected by a 3.29 factor that allows to give an approximation of the action that might have occurred during the 1985 earthquake in that specific place in the city. For the soft zone the register SCT-EW-85 is used. It is determined how the seismic inelastic response variation of the structural steel buildings, so much global as local, as long as the vibrations periods of each studied building approach or separate, according to the dominating period of the soil movement.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2002)
AB  - In some Japanese urban motorway system, there exist two kinds of S letter shape curve (S curve) sections at where traffic accidents often occurred and a few traffic accidents occurred. Both kinds of S curve sections, however, are almost the same geometric features.
   Therefore, authors thought that the factors affected the causes of traffic accidents, which occurred such S curve sections, might be not only geometric features but also some other factors such as drivers' mental and/or physiological factors, landscape factors along S curve sections, and so on.
   Running car tests were conducted in some S curve sections of the actual urban motorway. The purpose of this running car test was to measure speed of a vehicle, steering wheel operation, eye movement and heartbeat of a driver, and so on in an S curve section passage.
   A comparative analysis was done to explain difference in the driving behavior in two kinds of S curve section passage, where traffic accidents often occurred and not.

AB  - In Kenya knowledge of the relative severity of threats to protected areas and the vulnerability of these areas to any threats is lacking. Such information is required, however, for assessment of the effectiveness of management of the country's protected areas, and to help identify critical management and policy weaknesses and priorities for improving management and allocating resources. We therefore studied the relative severity of threats to Kenya's 50 protected areas and their relative vulnerability to such threats based on the perceptions of protected area managers. Ten threats were identified by these managers, of which the most severe were illegal bushmeat hunting, poaching of large mammals, human-wildlife conflicts, human encroachment, and loss of migration corridors and dispersal areas. Thirty-two (64%) protected areas were vulnerable to over half of the threats, 54% vulnerable to over six of the threats and 32% vulnerable to over seven of the threats. Protected areas in marine, forested/montane and inland wetland ecosystems were regarded as highly vulnerable to the perceived threats. Protected areas adjacent to urban/industrial and agricultural areas were vulnerable to most of the threats. Our findings demonstrate that protected areas in Kenya are increasingly threatened, that major threats needs to be mitigated, and that prioritization of protected areas for strategic actions is required for effective management.

AB  - The Kathmandu Valley is a bowl-shaped intermontane basin, which occupies an area of 583 km(2) in the heart of the Himalayas, with its floor at approximate to1400 m and the surrounding mountains attaining a height of 2000-2800 m. It is inhabited by approximate to1.5 million people, concentrated mostly in three cities, Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. Due to rapid but uncontrolled urbanisation and factors such as traffic movement, emissions from brick-kilns, cement factories, waste disposal and biomass burning, environmental pollution has been constantly increasing; adversely affecting land, water, air and biological systems.
   In order to quantify the degree of environmental pollution using magnetic methods, magnetic susceptibility of soils, sediments and roadside materials, in and outside the Kathmandu urban area has been measured. In areas far from roads or industry, median magnetic susceptibility is between 3 and 35 x 10(-5) SI, similar to that observed in the valley-filling elastic sediments and hence consistent with geologic or pedogenic origin. In traverses of in situ susceptibility across roads, a 5-m wide zone situated on either side of the asphalt-paved road exhibits an enhancement zone with maximum susceptibility of 240-850 x 10(-5) SI occurring 0.5-2.5 m from the road edge. In urban recreational areas, magnetic susceptibility varies within a broad range (3 to > 100 x 10(-5) SI) with lowest values occurring approximate to50 m from surrounding roads, in areas least disturbed by human activity. A systematic increase in susceptibility towards the roads or industrial sites is observed. Within urban areas, in the vicinity of heavy traffic or industrial sites, the upper 30-50 cm of soil profiles exhibit frequent enhancement in susceptibility, of one or two orders of magnitude, higher than those expected from geologic input. Such enhancement is attributed to input from anthropogenic or industrial sources. Magneto-mineralogical analyses and scanning electron microscopy on magnetic extracts, grain size fractions or bulk samples of road dust and soils, suggest lithogenic magnetite-like minerals and anthropogenic magnetic spherules to be the dominant contributors to the magnetic susceptibility signal.
   As the soils, sediments and roadside material exhibit significant susceptibility contrasts, which are most effective in identifying traffic-related pollution "hotspots", it is highly desirable that the potential of susceptibility maps of the entire area affected by urbanisation, be fully explored to assess the status of environmental degradation.

AB  - 1. We present in this review a general description of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the northwestern Mediterranean and some general principles for the establishment of protected areas, including their size, location, biotope composition, regulation, and management.
   2. Many Mediterranean MPAs are located around or adjacent to islands, but the placement of a marine reserve close to a large urban area is not necessarily a handicap, as has been demonstrated by some examples. It is not, therefore, necessary to restrict future MPAs solely to regions of low human density.
   3. The conceptual question of MPA size (single large or several small SLOSS debate) has never been explicitly considered in the selection of Mediterranenan MPAs. However, studies of fish recruitment in MPAs, and the development of a network of small MPAs between Spain and France have highlighted the importance and value of small sized MPAs (200-2000 ha).
   4. Whatever the location of a future MPA. its success as measured in terms of stock restoration will depend on whether (i) sufficient suitable habitat is available, (ii) the variety and abundance of prey species are adequate and (iii) the possibilities for recruitment of the biota are reasonable.
   5. The initial choices of zonation and legislation regulating the management of any future MPA are of primary importance. The zonation plan should be as simple as possible (gradation of 2 or 3 levels) and it should be acknowledged that the significance of management conflicts within a MPA will be inversely proportional to the extent of preliminary consultations: with all of the users, both professional and amateur.
   6. The examples of semi-protected areas where professional fishing is still allowed demonstrate without ambiguity the negative impact of spear-fishing, and the limited impacts from regulated professional activities: on fish assemblage. The means of regulating consist essentially of (i) a prohibition of certain type of fishing methods (trawling): and (ii) a limitation of the numbers of Fishermen by a system of restriction or authorization.
   7. In the MPAs examined. there is a great diversity of situations in relation to the size of and distribution of duties between staff assigned to their management. However. the single most important factor underlying whether or not a MPA will be successful and beneficial is the presence of a dedicated staff. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The demographic, risk-taking, psychological, and social network characteristics of HIV+ patients receiving and not receiving antiretroviral therapy were compared to those characteristics in HIV+ and HIV- persons who are not in care. In this cohort study, we enrolled patients from the Grady Infectious Disease Program (IDP) Clinic in Atlanta, GA, defining group membership by their use of antiretroviral therapy at the time of ascertainment. We also enrolled HIV+ and HIV- persons from inner city neighbourhoods of Atlanta. We collected extensive survey information from both groups, as well as clinic and follow-up information from the Clinic groups. We attempted to interview each participant four times over a period of two years. We used scores for Risk, for Social Stress and for Psychological Distress to compare the groups. Persons receiving antiretroviral therapy continued to display risky behaviour and to experience a substantial degree of social stress and psychological distress. HIV+ persons in the community, however, had the most prominent profile for HIV-transmission risk, social stress, and psychological distress and display considerable cross-over in their patterns of risk-taking. Men who have sex with men appear to play a dominant role, through their risk behaviour and network affiliations, in the maintenance of HIV endemicity. Current approaches fail to give sufficient attention to the admixture of risk that occurs in inner city communities. Reaching HIV+ persons with antiretroviral therapy in such communities faces considerable social, structural, and psychological barriers that may be more important than simple adherence to medication.

AB  - This paper brings together a multidisciplinary initiative to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for analyzing, assessing, and extracting information from raster maps. This information will provide a rigorous foundation to address a wide range of applications including disease mapping, emerging infectious diseases, landscape ecological assessment, land cover trends and change detection, watershed assessment, and map accuracy assessment. It will develop an advanced map analysis system that integrates these techniques with an advanced visualization toolbox, and use the system to conduct large case studies using rich sets of raster data, primarily from remotely sensed imagery. As a result, it will be possible to study and evaluate raster maps of societal, ecological, and environmental variables to facilitate quantitative characterization and comparative analysis of geospatial trends, patterns, and phenomena. In addition to environmental and ecological studies, these techniques and tools can be used for policy decisions at national, state, and local levels, crisis management, and protection of infrastructure.
   Geospatial data form the foundation of an information-based society. Remote sensing has been a vastly under-utilized resource involving a multi-million dollar investment at the national levels. Even when utilized, the credibility has been at stake, largely because of lack of tools that can assess, visualize, and communicate accuracy and reliability in timely manner and at desired confidence levels.
   Consider an imminent 21st century scenario: What message does a multi-categorical map have about the large landscape it represents? And at what scale, and at what level of detail? Does the spatial pattern of the map reveal any societal, ecological, environmental condition of the landscape? And therefore can it be an indicator of change? How do you automate the assessment of the spatial structure and behavior of change to discover critical areas, hot spots, and their corridors? Is the map accurate? How accurate is it? How do you assess the accuracy of the map? How do we evaluate a temporal change map for change detection? What are the implications of the kind and amount of change and accuracy on what matters, whether climate change, carbon emission, water resources, urban sprawl, biodiversity, indicator species, human health, or early warning? And with what confidence? The proposed research initiative is expected to find answers to these questions and a few more that involve multi-categorical raster maps based on remote sensing and other geospatial data. It includes the development of techniques for map modeling and analysis using Markov Random Fields, geospatial statistics, accuracy assessment and change detection, upper echelons of surfaces, advanced computational techniques for geospatial data mining, and advanced visualization techniques.

TI  - SOME KEYS ASPECTS OF THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE PROVINCE OF CORDOBA, ARGENTINA
T2  - REVISTA DE SALUD PUBLICA-CORDOBA
LA  - Spanish
AB  - Objective: to describe the Hospital System of the Cordoba Province, as regards availability of human resources, output of services, and role of the provincial system of reference. A qualitative approach was selected, using participant observation of official secondary document sources for the description of personnel structure, service output and interhospital transfer flow, plus depth interviews and key informants. The study is of the descriptive type, with a transversal retrospective design. The conceptual framework Healthcare Management, with an emphasis on Clinical Government, including process management of pathologies and non-clinical channels, and networking between hospitals and between hospitals and primary care centers, two current problem areas in the provincial hospital system. There is a fragmentation of the system outside Cordoba city. In the capital city, activity concentrates in a smaller number of establishments, with more rational bed occupation, higher density of specialized profiles and better allocation of human resources to those with higher demand and service output, a contrast with the rest of the province. However, a deficient articulation of the institutional hospital network hampers coordination of the system, despite individual efforts by institutions. Availability of human resources matches healthcare demands. By restrictive criteria measuring only external consultation, releases, treatments and operations, hospitals are working at two-thirds of their capacity, with marked disparities between regions and establishments. Main deficiencies in human resources are related to profesionalization, exhaustion, dating of operative skills, and disparities in specialized professional training. This state of affairs is made worse by faulty network coordination, lack of organization in pathology management, disparities between formal and functional organization of establishments and restrictions arising from the system public regulatory framework.

T2  - REVUE D HISTOIRE DE L AMERIQUE FRANCAISE

AB  - This article describes the transition to a new conception of municipal land use planning in Montreal, in which surface water, initially viewed as an unavoidable natural phenomenon, became seen as something that could and should be flushed out and drained away, even hidden (inside pipes). This transition occurred during the first decades of the 19(th) century, at a time when public health concerns were compounded by issues related to the movement of people and goods. Thanks to local public action, this transition was achieved through the development of urban infrastructures and public works. In the end, the work done to control and get rid of surface water provided a new way of looking at the urban environment, at the same time that it imposed a new environmental reality.

AB  - In this review, we present a detailed account of Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligatorweed), including A. philoxeroides description, intraspecific variation from native to introduced regions, its life history strategies, invasion mechanisms, and management strategies. Alternanthera philoxeroides is a herbaceous amphibious weed of Amaranthaceae, native to South America, distributed from Buenos Aires Province (39 degrees S) to south Brazil. It was first described by Martius in 1826, and consists of several taxa in both its native and non-native ranges. Current knowledge indicates that two forms of alligator weed exist in Argentina: A. philoxeroides f. philoxeroides in the southern range and A. philoxeroides f. angustifolia in the northern range. In Argentina, both forms set fruits and produce viable seeds. Alternanthera philoxeroides is now found as a serious weed from tropical to warm temperate regions, including the USA, China, India, South-East Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It is thought to have been brought to China during the 1930s, and later widely cultivated and spread in southern China as fodder during 1950s. The invasions of alligatorweed in China have caused considerable concerns, and now it is one of the 12 most harmful alien invasive species in China. Alligatorweed is found on stationary and slow moving water bodies, creeks, channels, riverbanks and associated areas that are occasionally flooded. It can also be found in terrestrial habitats as a pasture weed within urban environments. Alligatorweed does not produce viable seed in China and reproduces vegetatively from vegetative fragments (stems, rhizome or root tubes), which can be transported by water movement, boats, machinery and vehicles, and in hay. Movement between river catchments is common because of the human activities. Alligatorweed forms a floating mass which spreads out over the water. Its growth disrupts the ecology of banks and shallows and crowds out other plant species, restricts water flow, increases sedimentation, aggravates flooding, limits access and use by man and provides a favorable breeding area for disease vectors. We need better understanding of the biology and ecology of alligatorweed to assess the efficiency of control methods in any theoretical framework. According to the knowledge of the life history strategy of alligatorweed, we suggest that metapopulation theory is a good tool to improve management efficiency from watershed and regional perspectives.

AB  - Knowledge of the movement patterns of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in suburban landscapes is important in developing management strategies and assessing results of management programs. We determined annual and seasonal home ranges and core-area use during the winter, winter-spring transition, fawn-rearing, and breeding sea sons for 25 female deer in a residential community. We determined distance from deer core areas to residential development, number of houses within core areas, and spatial and temporal use of residential development by deer. Mean annual home-range and core-area sizes were 43.2 and 7.3 ha, respectively. Home-range and core-area size did not differ among seasons. More houses were located in core areas during winter than during the fawn-rearing season. Likewise, core areas were closer to the community in winter than during the fawn-rearing season. For all seasons, the community comprised 23-34% of deer home ranges and 18-33% of core areas. Deer core areas included more residential development during the winter-spring transition than during the fawn-rearing season. Birdfeeders in residential areas may provide urban deer with a supplemental food source and may increase deer visitation rates in communities. Our results suggest that urban deer are more likely to use residential development during the winter and winter-spring transition seasons when food may be limiting. Capturing or removing deer in residential areas for research or management would be most effective during March. In March, deer use of the community peaked one to 4 hours after sunset, with a secondary peak occurring 3-5 hours before sunrise. Small annual home ranges of deer suggest that localized management efforts would provide residents relief from damage associated with local deer populations.

TI  - "Is it just so my right?" Women repossessing breastfeeding
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BREASTFEEDING JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Infant feeding occurs in the context of continued gender inequities and in the context of a feminist movement that left women vulnerable to a system that defined the male body and mind as the norm. This paper draws from a qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with women artists at the 2005 Mamapalooza music festival in New York City, and conference participants at the 2005 La Leche League International and International Lactation Consultant Association Conferences and at the 2007 Reproductive Freedom Conference to understand our collective alienation from breastfeeding and to outline a process for how we might repossess breastfeeding as a positive function in women's lives. These women find power in honoring and validating their own experiences, in claiming those experiences as legitimate feminist actions, and then drawing on these experiences to seek new meanings, customs and norms that similarly honor, value and support their rights to those experiences. They argue that we need a feminist movement that fully incorporates women's needs as biological and reproductive social beings, alongside their needs as productive beings, and a movement that defines the female body and mind as the norm.

AB  - 1. The influence of spatial structure on population dynamics within river-stream networks is poorly understood. Utilizing spatially explicit analyses of temporal genetic variance, we tested whether persistence of central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) reflects differences in habitat quality and location within a highly modified urban catchment in southwestern Ohio, U.S.A.
   2. Estimates of genetic diversity did not vary with habitat quality. Nevertheless, evidence of weak but temporally stable genetic structure, location-dependent effective population sizes and rates of immigration among sites, together suggest that persistence of central stonerollers within the catchment may be attributable to source-sink dynamics driven by habitat heterogeneity.
   3. Under this scenario, migrant-pool colonization from areas of relatively high habitat quality in the upper catchment sustains the presence of central stonerollers at degraded sites in the main stem and dampens population subdivision within the catchment. However, because intact habitat is restricted to the upper portion of the catchment, it is not possible to preclude net downstream dispersal as a mechanism contributing to source-sink dynamics. The slight genetic structure that persists appears to reflect weak isolation by distance diminished by high rates of immigration.
   4. This study suggests that without a systems perspective of the conditions that sustain populations in degraded waterways, environmental assessments may underestimate levels of impairment. Conservation and management of stream fishes could be improved by maintaining habitat in areas that are net exporters of migrants or by remediation of impaired habitat.

AB  - Every human activity that demands movement is predicated on transport. Its supply depicts a fairly rigid framework on which very flexible sub systems depend. Building without speculating for its future expansion is an invitation to chaos for Nigeria, the most populous black nation in the world. Abuia, the federal capital, is only 13 years old. The city CBD is serviced by a grid road network. The zone services commuters from the satellite neighbourhoods located radially within a range of 3-80km. Entry and exit points of the city are basically dual carriageways which receive free and fast flowing traffic from several other dual carriages. Within the city centre, peak periods are characterised by stagnant jams while the linkage access roads observe as many as 60-100 vehicles per minute at any given point. Centroids are used to evaluate travel time and distance which vary from zone to zone. This method is effective in compensating for minor differences in distances travelled by residents within the same neighbourhoods. The bulk of traffic is of car owner status. Origin (source) - destination matrices are established to confirm the volume and direction of flow.
   The city transport system lacks inter modal integration. It is characterised by physical engineering weaknesses and journey hazards, which increase the cost and time of travel. Absence of mass transit operations account for greater congestion especially at peak hour periods. These occur twice a day.

AB  - Above 90 percent of city gas pipelines are underground, and they drill through some broad districts where terrain is complex and soil quality is very different. Occurrences of accidents do not take on obvious because of inflammable, explosive and high-pressure medium. In order to transport gas safely and high-efficiency, improving prediction ability to accidents is very important. This article takes the gas enterprise of Handan for example, firstly simplifying the loss using the rough set theory and then using the method of DEA's whole effective preside's movement to compose the synthesis risk case of every pipeline and to forecast the tendency of the risk's development or find the practical direction of the risk decreasing. thus, supplying the information of reducing risk for the great risk sections of pipeline and the model sample.

AB  - The Dawson City Landslide is located at the northern edge of Dawson City, Yukon and took place prior to 1740 years B.P. The landslide occurred at the contact between the metasedimentary rocks of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane and the overlying altered ultrarnafic rocks of the Slide Mountain Terrane. The main part of the failure comprises altered ultramafic rocks, which have a lower Geological Strength Index (rock mass quality) than the underlying metasedimentary sequence. Division of the study area into smaller structural domains identified discontinuity sets associated with faulting along the contact of the two lithological units. A kinematic analysis of the identified discontinuity sets suggests that a toppling failure mechanism may be feasible. Due to the highly fractured nature of the ultrarnafic rock mass, a circular failure controlled by the low strength of the rock mass is considered a potential mechanism for the Dawson City Landslide. Limit equilibrium and finite difference numerical modelling codes support a circular failure mechanism hypothesis. However, a combination of high pore water pressure (ru-0.3), and seismic loading are required to produce a factor of safety < 1.0.
   The dominant trends of linear geomorphic features (tension cracks, trenches, anti-slope scarps, ridges) correspond to a discontinuity set recognised in the headscarp, of the failure. Tension cracks exposing roots and split trees indicate recent movement of a small section of the headscarp that is potentially Unstable. The downslope risk represented by this unstable block is difficult to assess due to the uncertainties related to entrainment of talus material and potential travel distance over the rough and irregular surface of the middle coarse debris material. The movement rate of this block should be monitored and the surrounding area routinely investigated for the development of other potentially unstable sections of the landslide. Sheared trenches, stretched roots and split trees suggest that the middle to lower section of the debris is currently moving. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to evaluate the dispersal pattern of airborne fluoride emissions, from a single source in the city of Ouro Preto, Brazil, the fluoride impact on some herbaceous plant species was studied using the plants as passive bioindicators. Foliar fluoride contents of eight species collected at different distances from an aluminium smelter were analyzed. The plant species were: Baccaharis dracunculifolia, Bidens pilosa, Borreria verticillata, Calopogonium mucunoides, Erigeron bonariensis, Hedychium coronarium, Ipomoea purpurea and Ipomoea cairica. In all species the fluoride accumulation decreased exponentially with the distance from the emission source. There was specific and distinct variation in fluoride accumulation among the species, a group of high-accumulator species (B. dracunculifolia and Bidens pilosa) and a group of low-accumulator species (I. cairica, H. coronarium and Borreria verticillata). C. mucunoides and E. bonariensis occupied an intermediate position. There was a pattern of plant contamination response during the periods analyzed. The plants nearest to the emission source, between 0.4 km northwest and 1.1 km east, showed fluoride contamination traits in leaves reaching values between 100 and 500 mu g g(-1). Moreover, fluoride contents higher than 1000 mu g g(-1) were found in these plants. At the most distant stations, situated 2.9 km northwest and 6 km east from the factory, the fluoride content of the dry matter was less than 10 mu g g(-1) showing that plants at those distances were submitted to minimum contamination. There were different patterns of tolerance among the species analyzed. While B. dracunculifolia accumulated fluoride up to 1500 mu g g(-1) in dry matter without any signs of injury, Borreria verticillata showed severe necrosis in leaves, but the fluoride content found was not higher than 120 mu g g(-1).

AB  - This note investigates different procedures to improve radar-based estimates of rainfall accumulation, using the City of Winnipeg, Canada, as an example. Specific contributions include the implementation assessment of an advection scheme to track the movement of storms, a scheme to account for wind-induced drift, and an attenuation correction scheme that includes a simple hail identification method. It was found that a combination of these schemes improved the correlation between gauge radar 10-min accumulations from 0.48 to 0.86 for six rainfall events that occurred in the summer of 2000 in Winnipeg.

AB  - The article traces the development of a building and the spatial relations that it helped to structure, which shaped the daily life of its occupants according to a particular world view. More specifically, the article analyses the Hospice Saint-Joseph, located in Beauharnois. The hospice was a charitable institution established by the Sisters of Charity of Montreal General Hospital, known as the Grey Nuns. The sisters established the institution in the mid-nineteenth century based on a social concept and using the tools of space relations. The Grey Nuns were required to work both within the framework of the Canadian Catholic Church and society, and were called upon to conform to a patriarchal hierarchy, while at the same time, carving their own place within the social order. At different periods in its history, the design of the building reflected the institution's wealth (or lack thereof), which was dependent upon the city's industrialization and the Catholic Church's destiny vis-A-vis modernism and liberalism. In fact, the history of the building echoes the history of the hospice, the rise and fall of a Quebec and Canadian institutional charitable network, and the place occupied by Catholicism in the contemporary landscape.

AB  - Humans fragment landscapes to the detriment of wildlife. We review why fragmentation is detrimental to wildlife (especially birds), review the effects of urbanization on birds inhabiting nearby native habitats, suggest how restoration ecologists can minimize these effects, and discuss future research needs. We emphasize the importance of individual fitness to determining community composition. This means that reproduction, survivorship, and dispersal (not simply community composition) must be maintained, restored, and monitored. We suggest that the severity of the effects of fragmentation are determined by (1) the natural disturbance regime, (2) the similarity of the anthropogenic matrix to the natural matrix, and (3) the persistence of the anthropogenic change. As a result, urbanization is likely to produce greater effects of fragmentation than either agriculture or timber harvest. Restoration ecologists, land managers, and urban planners can help maintain native birds in fragmented landscapes by a combination of short- and long-term actions designed to restore ecological function (not just shape and structure) to fragments, including: (1) maintaining native vegetation, deadwood, and other nesting structures in the fragment, (2) managing the landscape surrounding the fragment (matrix), not just the fragment, (3) making the matrix more like the native habitat fragments, (4) increasing the foliage height diversity within fragments, (5) designing buffers that reduce penetration of undesirable agents from the matrix, (6) recognizing that human activity is not compatible with interior conditions, (7) actively managing mammal populations in fragments, (8) discouraging open lawn on public and private property, (9) providing statutory recognition of the value of complexes of small wetlands, (10) integrating urban parks into the native habitat system, (11) anticipating urbanization and seeking creative ways to increase native habitat and manage it collectively, (12) reducing the growing effects of urbanization on once remote natural areas, (13) realizing that fragments may be best suited to conserve only a few species, (14) developing monitoring programs that measure fitness, and (15) developing a new educational paradigm.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of paraovarian pelvic mass mobility as an indicator of mass identity, corpus luteum versus other, in ruling out ectopic pregnancy. Methods. This was a retrospective study of all pelvic sonographic examinations on patients with first-trimester complications seen over an 18-month period at a large urban emergency department. All pregnant patients with signs or symptoms of concern for ectopic pregnancy were scanned to evaluate for intrauterine pregnancy. Masses suggestive of either a corpus luteum or an ectopic pregnancy were separated from the ovary with abdominal palpation and endovaginal transducer movement. The ultrasound director and assistant director reviewed videos of all scans. Results of mass separation and outcome were recorded. Independent movement of a mass and ovary was defined as movement of the mass away from the ovary, sliding past the ovary or rotation past the ovary. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, inter-rater reliability, the Fisher exact test, and sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values. Results. A total of 78 patient scans fit the criteria, and in 27 of them, the mass separated from the ovary. Twenty-three patients had ectopic pregnancy as the final diagnosis, and in 2 of these, no independent mass movement occurred. Lack of independent movement of the mass and ovary was significantly more common in patients without a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (P <.0001). The negative predictive value was 96.1%. Conclusions. Lack of independent movement of an adjacent mass and, ovary was strongly associated with absence of ectopic pregnancy.

AB  - Numbers of Kelp Gulls recorded within the Port Elizabeth area peaked in the austral autumn, and on average comprised approximately 4% of the southern African population. Between 66% and 80% of Kelp Gulls recorded around Port Elizabeth were in adult plumage. It is assumed that adults breeding outside of the Port Elizabeth area move into the area after breeding. During their first year Kelp Gulls showed distinct periods of influx - thought to be due to the fledging of local birds followed by a movement of birds into the region from further west. Birds are thought to be attracted to the urban environment by sources of human-provided foodstuffs available at the harbour and at a municipal rubbish tip. Seasonal patterns differed across sites in the Port Elizabeth area and were rarely the same for all age categories at any one site. Numbers of birds at roosts did not appear to be correlated to the state of the tide, but numbers foraging on the Swartkops estuary were. Numbers of adult Kelp Gulls at Bird Island peaked during the breeding season. Juvenile birds left the island soon after fledging.

AB  - Coastal areas play a crucial role in the economical, social and political development of most countries; they support diverse and productive coastal ecosystems that provide valuable goods and services. Globally flooding and coastal erosion represent serious threats along many coastlines, and will become more serious as a consequence of human-induced changes and accelerated sea-level rise. Over the past century, hard coastal defence structures have become ubiquitous features of coastal landscapes as a response to these threats. The proliferation of defence works can affect over half of the shoreline in some regions and results in dramatic changes to the coastal environment. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to the ecological consequences of coastal defence. Results from the DELOS (Environmental Design of Low Crested Coastal Defence Structures, EVK3-CT-2000-00041) project indicate that the construction of coastal defence structures will affect coastal ecosystems. The consequences can be seen on a local scale, as disruption of surrounding soft-bottom environments and introduction of new artificial hard-bottom habitats, with consequent changes to the native assemblages of the areas. Proliferation of coastal defence structures can also have critical impacts on regional species diversity, removing isolating barriers, favouring the spread of non-native species and increasing habitat heterogeneity. Knowledge of the environmental context in which coastal defence structures are placed is fundamental to an effective management of these structures as, while there are some general consequences of such construction, many effects are site specific. Advice is provided to meet specific management goals, which include mitigating specific impacts on the environment, such as minimising changes to surrounding sediments, spread of exotic species or growth of nuisance species, and/or enhancing specific natural resources, for example enhancing fish recruitment or promoting diverse assemblages for eco-tourism. The DELOS project points out that the downstream effects of defence structures on coastal processes and regional-scale impacts on biodiversity necessitate planning and management at a regional (large coastline) scale. To effectively understand and manage coastal defences, environmental management goals must be clearly stated and incorporated into the planning, construction, and monitoring stages.

AB  - The Santa Clara River delivers nutrient rich runoff to the eastern Santa Barbara Channel during brief (similar to1-3 day) episodic events. Using both river and oceanographic measurements, we evaluate river loading and dispersal of dissolved macronutrients (silicate, inorganic N and P) and comment on the biological implications of these nutrient contributions. Both river and ocean observations suggest that river nutrient concentrations are inversely related to river flow rates. Land use is suggested to influence these concentrations, since runoff from a subwatershed with substantial agriculture and urban areas had much higher nitrate than runoff from a wooded subwatershed. During runoff events, river nutrients were observed to conservatively mix into the buoyant, surface plume immediately seaward of the Santa Clara River mouth. Dispersal of these river nutrients extended 10s of kin into the channel. Growth of phytoplankton and nutrient uptake was low during our observations (1-3 days following runoff), presumably due to the very low light levels resulting from high turbidity. However, nutrient quality of runoff (Si:N:P = 16:5: 1) was found to be significantly different than upwelling inputs (13:10:1), which may influence different algal responses once sediments settle. Evaluation of total river nitrate loads suggests that most of the annual river nutrient fluxes to the ocean occur during the brief winter flooding events. Wet winters (such as El Nino) contribute nutrients at rates approximately an order-of-magnitude greater than "average" winters. Although total river nitrate delivery is considerably less than that supplied by upwelling, the timing and location of these types of events are very different, with river discharge (upwelling) occurring predominantly in the winter (summer) and in the eastern (western) channel.

AB  - Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) populations have declined extensively throughout much of North America, and modeling demography may assist conservation. However, few studies have estimated adult survival, and fewer still have determined juvenile survival. In 2003 and 2004 we monitored survival of 40 radio-tagged juveniles during the postfledging period in the Little Missouri National Grassland, North Dakota, where owls nested in black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies. Survival averaged 0.57 (95% CI: 0.41-0.73) prior to autumn migration. Mortality was highest during the first two weeks after nest departure when juveniles were flightless, and two to three weeks later when juveniles became independent. Predation or starvation was implicated in most deaths. Distribution and abundance of escape cover (number of prairie dog burrows within 30 m of nests and size of the natal prairie dog colony) did not affect survival. Body condition and brood size at the time of radio-tagging also did not influence survival. Juvenile owls exhibited nest-centered dispersal, and averaged 108 +/- 21 (SE) m and 82 +/- 17 m from nests at initiation of migration in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Mean dates of departure from the study area were 2 September (+/- 3 days) 2003 and 24 August (+/- 2 days) 2004. Mortality during the postfledging period accounted for approximately two-thirds of mortality in the first year of life.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to measure habitual physical activity in a group of Sereer adolescent females from Senegal. The hypothesis tested was that physical activity levels of adolescent Senegalese girls differ according to location and living conditions and may have a negative impact on growth and nutritional status.
   Design: Studies of physical activity within the framework of a longitudinal study of growth during puberty.
   Methods: All the adolescents were born and had been raised in the same rural communities, but some worked as maids in the cities during the dry season (migrants) while the others remained in the villages all year round in order to help their families in daily domestic and agricultural tasks (non-migrants). The study was undertaken in both rural and urban settings on a subsample of 40 migrant and 40 non-migrant girls aged 13.4-15.3, drawn from a cohort of 406 adolescents followed up since 1995. Nutritional status was estimated from anthropometric measurements; sexual maturation was based on stage of breast development and occurrence of menarche. Intensity and patterns of physical activity were derived from movement registration by accelerometry for a 3-day period. The nature and frequency of daily tasks were evaluated by questionnaires.
   Results: As a whole, the adolescents studied here were smaller, thinner and less mature than girls of the same age from developed countries. Migrants weighed 3.5 kg more than nonmigrants and had more muscularity and a thicker fat subcutaneous layer. The day-to-day reliability of accelerometry counts was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85-0.93). Mean daily (24 h) physical activity counts were higher for migrants than for non-migrants. Migrants spent more time engaged in moderate to heavy activity than did non-migrants (9.3 h/24 h versus 6.1 h/24 h). Non-migrants slept or were inactive for a longer period than migrants (7.6 h/24 h versus 6.3 h/24 h). They also rested for a longer period of the day (2.1 h/24 h versus 0.8 h/24 h). When examining the influence of maturational status on physical activity, there was a clear difference between the two groups: the less mature migrants were more active, whereas the reverse was true in villages, where girls at the end of puberty reached higher intensity indices.
   Conclusions and implications: In both situations, the activity level was high. The nutritional status of migrants was better despite a heavier work load. Differences could be explained by better living conditions and food intake in cities.

TI  - North Norwegians sail south - The Nordland fishing industry in transition, c1890-1920
T2  - HISTORISK TIDSSKRIFT
LA  - English
AB  - Around 1870 the spring herring deserted the waters of Western Norway, while Nordland and Troms experienced abundant catches. Merchants and fishermen from Western Norway followed the herring northward. Many of these people settled in the northern counties, contributing to their rapid population growth during this period. From the 1890s, however, an opposite movement began: led by steamers from Vesteralen, fishermen from the north covered great distances in search of 'the silver of the seas' off the coast of Western Norway. The root causes of this drift were dramatic regional changes in fishing resources along the Norwegian coast. Nordland's share of the value of total landings was greatly reduced. a decisive turning point was reached int he years 1896-7. From that time onward both the cod and herring fisheries of the county suffered serious reverses. In the same period the winter herring returned in abundance to the western coasts. The combined effect of these push and pull factors was to spur fishermen from Nordland to move south. Along with the impact of urbanization and dawning industrialization, this expansion into new fisheries largely explains why participation in the Lofoten fisheries went into sharp decline during this period. The combination of a resource crisis in Nordland and ample income opportunities in the south also triggered extensive permanent migration to Souther Norway. In 1920 one in 10 persons born in Nordland and living in Norway had settled int he souther part of the country, concentrated in the cities there. Apart from promoting migration from the county, both seasonal and permanent, the crisis provided motivation for the modernization of Nordland's fisheries. This included investments in steam vessels and more efficient fishing gear, the improvement of communications, including direct contacts with markets abroad, and the establishment of industrial plants. A major objective of these efforts was to free the county from its perpetual economic dependence on the cities of Southern Norway.

AB  - Analysis of the Byzantine primary and secondary sources for identifying the historical earthquakes in Syria and Lebanon reveals that a large earthquake (Ms = 7.2) occurred in July 9, 551 AD along the Lebanese littoral and was felt over a very large area in the eastern Mediterranean region. It was a shallow-focus earthquake, associated with a regional tsunami along the Lebanese coast, a local landslide near Al-Batron town, and a large fire in Beirut. It caused heavy destruction with great loss of lives to several Lebanese cities, mainly Beirut, with a maximum intensity between IX-X (EMS-92). The proposed epicentre of the event is offshore of Beirut at about 34.00 degreesN, 35.50 degreesE, indicating that the earthquake appears to be the result of movement along the strike-slip left-lateral Roum fault in southern Lebanon.

AB  - The influence of land use changes on flood occurrence and severity in the Bisagno River (Thyrrenian Liguria, N.W. Italy is investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach (Rulli and Rosso, 2002). High resolution land-use maps for the area were reconstructed and scenario simulations were made for a pre-industrial (1878), an intermediate (1930) and a current (1980) year. Land-use effects were explored to assess the consequences of distributed changes in land use due to agricultural practice and urbanisation. Hydraulic conveyance effects were considered, to assess the consequences of channel modifications associated with engineering works in the lower Bisagno River network. Flood frequency analyses of the annual flood series, retrieved from the simulations, were used to examine the effect of land-use change and river conveyance on flood regime. The impact of these effects proved to be negligible in the upper Bisagno River, moderate in the downstream river and severe in the small tributaries in the lower Bisagno valley that drain densely populated urban areas. The simulation approach is shown to be capable of incorporating historical data on landscape and river patterns into quantitative methods for risk assessment.

AB  - To have an effective barrier against invading termites around building structures and to assess the potential risks to the urban environment and human beings, we need to understand the fate of termiticides applied in urban soil. The movement and degradation of a new termiticide, fipronil, were investigated in Australian soils following standard termiticide treatment methods (surface application under slab and trenching treatments along walls). Surface application studies in three field sites showed slow dissipation and little movement for fipronil in all three soils under the simulated slab during a three-year period. The greatest mass of the chemical residues remained in the quartzite sand layer (thickness, 5 cm), and only small amounts of these were found to have migrated into the soil layers (depth, 0-15 cm) underneath the quartzite sand layer. Of the three metabolites (desulfinyl, sulfide, and sulfone) found in the soils, the sulfone derivative had the highest concentration. Persistence of fipronil was affected by application rate. The time for 50% loss of the total toxic components (fipronil plus its metabolites) in the quartzite sand layer (thickness, 5 cm) ranged from 200 to 326 d for the low rate (0.15 g active ingredient/m(2)) and from 633 to 674 d for the high application rate (3 active ingredient/m(2)). One-year trenching studies at two sites in Adelaide (Roseworthy Farm [RF] and Terretfield [TF]; South Australia, Australia) showed that vertical movement and dissipation of fipronil occurred in the soils. The average concentration of fipronil in the trenches (depth, 0-30 cm) decreased from 33.7 to 14.9 mg/kg in the loam soil at the RF site and from 39.4 to 14.6 mg/kg in the clay soil at the TF site over the year. With time under the natural weather condition, fipronil and its derivatives were found in the deeper soil sections without treatment (depth, 20-30 cm). However, laboratory studies using repacked soil columns showed low mobility in the loam soil from the RF site and a variably charged clay soil from Malanda (Queensland, Australia) under intermittent wetting and drying conditions.

AB  - Migration and urbanization are two complementarily categories on populations distribution analysis over the territory. Migration is a natural society process, as movement it shows diverse territory dimensions and different causes for it, but always related to the search of protection or better life conditions. Colombia intern migration, especially in the 60's and 70's, described a new population distribution map, which configured a new urban country where forced migration has played an important role during history.
   This article valuates the urbanization process, the relation of it with the migration phenomenon and the violence impact in the population migration towards urban areas; areas which have had to adjust its size by growing to receive the new inhabitants. These facts create particular urbanization conditions that the author advices, studies and characterizes to reach a better comprehension of the phenomenon in the country.

AB  - Intense rainfall conditions and seismic activity commonly trigger fluidised landslides which are characterized by rapid movement and long run-out. They are potentially a very dangerous form of landslide phenomena and may result in extensive damage due to their sudden movement. Until now, photogrammetry has been used to produce maps and investigate such landslides in areas where these disasters occur. Recently, however, airborne laser scanning technology has become a promising technique for making topographical maps and investigating the micro topographic details of these landslide disasters, particularly on slopes around urban areas where the potential risk is high. In this study, airborne laser scanning was carried out in the Tama Hills, near Tokyo, Japan, which is extensively affected by this type of landsliding. The effectiveness of this technique was tested and compared with a laser contour map and aerial photograph interpretations.

AB  - This article describes a case study based on data from 2 surveys and 2 retrospective interviews with 2 preservice teachers and 1 interview with their 2 mentors. All 4 teachers worked in the same classroom in a field-based, postbaccalaureate, urban teacher certification program. I observation was also conducted in the classroom of each preservice teacher after she began teaching. Although the preservice teachers worked with mentors who modeled standards-based writing instruction, movement toward such teaching did not occur when preservice teachers' beliefs about learning and teaching were inconsistent with mentors' beliefs. Conceptual development of 1 preservice teacher was a process of gradual socialization, whereas the other experienced conceptual conflict. Preservice teachers' initial beliefs, mentors' teaching and mentoring practices, and school contexts influenced preservice teachers' conceptual development.

AB  - The Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) is federally listed as endangered and is found in only a small number of caves in eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas. Previous studies suggested site fidelity of females to maternity caves; however, males are solitary most of the year, and thus specific information on their behavior and roosting patterns is lacking. Population genetic variation often provides the necessary data to make inferences about gene flow or mating behavior within that population. We used 2 types of molecular data: DNA sequences from the mitochondrial D loop and alleles at 5 microsatellite loci. Approximately 5% of the population, 24 males and 39 females (63 individuals), were sampled. No significant differentiation between 5 sites was present in nuclear microsatellite variation, but distribution of variation in maternally inherited markers differed among sites. This suggests limited dispersal of female Ozark big-eared bats and natal philopatry. Areas that experience local extinctions are unlikely to be recolonized by species that show strong site fidelity. These results provide a greater understanding of the population dynamics of Ozark big-eared bats and highlight the importance of cave protection relative to maintaining genetic integrity during recovery activities for this listed species.

AB  - The present work intends to verify if the phenomenon of stress clash resolution is subject to the conditions of a variable rule, demonstrating which factors favor the application of the rule(s). The stress clash occurs when two stressed syllables are adjacent. This clash can be solved by the movement of one of the stresses, by the reduction of one of the prominences or still by the insertion of pause. Results of previous researches had shown that these structures of clash are solved most of the time. In the present research we analyze the phenomenon in two cities of RS: Porto Alegre and Sao Borja. We consider the main types of solution: movement to the left and to the right, pause, reduction, and permanence. The data were analyzed by the package of programs VARBRUL, GoldVarb- windows version. Our first results show that the phenomenon of stress clash resolution is subject to the conditions of a variable rule, showing that the reduction of prominence is the most often used solution by the speakers.

AB  - The authors draw on Klinenberg (2002) ethnography and recent neighborhood theory to explain community-level variation in mortality during the July 1995 Chicago heat wave. They examine the impact of neighborhood structural disadvantage on heat wave mortality and consider three possible intervening mechanisms: social network interaction, collective efficacy, and commercial conditions. Combining Census and mortality data with the 1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Community Survey and Systematic Social Observation, the authors estimate hierarchical Poisson models of death rates both during the 1995 heat wave and comparable, temporally proximate July weeks (1990-94, 1996). They find that neighborhood affluence was negatively associated with heat wave mortality. Consistent with Klinenberg ethnographic study of the Chicago heat wave, commercial decline was positively associated with heat wave mortality and explains the affluence effect. Where commercial decline was low, neighborhoods were largely protected from heat-related mortality. Although social network interaction and collective efficacy did not influence heat wave mortality, collective efficacy was negatively associated with mortality during comparable July weeks (when no heat wave occurred). Unequal distribution of community-based resources had important implications for geographic differences in survival rates during the Chicago heat wave, and may be relevant for other disasters.

AB  - Decentralization, the intrametropolitan movement of people and activity away from dense centers toward less developed suburbs, occurs when dispersive forces are greater than agglomerative forces for any metropolitan area. Two mathematical tools, the regional dispersion index and the Hoover index, are used to measure the movement of population, employment, and retail activity in the Hartford, Connecticut, metropolitan region from 1900 to 2000. The approach used differs from other research in that it does not assume a parametric density function, and it allows decentralization for a multicentered region to be measured. Between 1900 and 1930, population concentrated toward Hartford and other regional centers. The trend reversed around 1940, and for the remainder of the century population decentralized away from both Hartford and regional centers. Economic activity bore the same overall pattern with a lag. The results presented here are consistent with existing theories of decentralization and previous empirical work.

AB  - Wastewater irrigation was initiated as early as 1958 in the suburb of Shijiazhuang, China. This has resulted in groundwater becoming contaminated by nitrate to a depth of about 100 m with an average concentration of 40 mg NO3-/L. The annual average irrigation rate of wastewater in this area is about 430 mm, and the water table is relatively stable in contrast to the surrounding area, where no wastewater has been used. Although different in composition, wastewater and old groundwater are found to be well mixed based on the linearity of delta O-18 and Cl-. Wastewater has relatively high Cl-, but has no detectable nitrate. Dominance of delta N-15 in the range of 7-11 parts per thousand AIR (referred to atmospheric N-2 standard) confirms that the nitrate present in contaminated groundwater originates from the wastewater. Nitrate was then used as a tracer to estimate roughly groundwater movement rates, yielding a vertical rate of 2.0-2.5 m/y and a horizontal rate of 41.8-62.5 m/y. Denitrification could occur in a zone 2 km from the wastewater canal, in which the fraction contributed from wastewater was calculated to be 76%. Health concerns should be raised regarding wastewater. irrigation, which is a common practice in the suburbs of principal cities of China, especially in and and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Highlands and islands are the underdeveloped and marginalized areas of Greece in which a series of crucial planning and development problems occur. The paper attempts a description of those areas not only in terms of physical spatial structure but also in terms of socio-economic dependence from the developed 'integrated'-regions of the country (urban and industrial areas). It is essential to describe the structural features of these areas in order to understand their true needs, so that efforts can be made towards the creation of a planning model, which will integrate these areas, using the benefits provided by new technologies. To this purpose the paper investigates an implementation example (pilot project), in the central Mediterranean Sea, which has been developed in the framework of EU trans-national cooperation programs, in the field of spatial and environmental planning matters in order to show that ITC advanced technologies can reinforce participatory planning processes in the new 'network society'.

AB  - This paper reports on the measurements taken of horizontal movement during the excavation of a 5-m deep and 7-m wide trench created for the installation of 5 x 3 metre concrete caissons to channel water from two streams running in the vicinity. The alluvial deposit in the stream at the excavation site consists of gravel with a sufficiently thick clayey matrix to enable a sheet pile cut-off wall to be sunk over three metres down. The construction process used consisted of driving the sheet pile in by vibration to a depth of over 3 m beneath the bottom of the excavation, digging an 0.60-m pit to fix bracing at the head of the cut-off and excavating down to 5 metres. Once the caissons were in place, the trench was refilled and the sheet pile removed. The excavation site was on an urban street, making it necessary to assess the extent and scale of any possible horizontal movement, in order to take the appropriate steps to prevent problems occurring in adjoining buildings. Measurements were taken during the excavation work of the horizontal movement occurring. The paper reports on the results.

AB  - Ross River flows through the Townsville/Thuringowa urban area in north Queensland, Australia. which has a dry tropical climate characterized by high inter-annual rainfall variation. Unregulated rivers in the Ross catchment basin deliver freshwater flows to their estuaries during both strong and weak wet seasons. The construction of a series of dams and weirs on Ross River means the wet-dry cycle is accentuated, leading to constant marine salinities throughout the estuary becoming the norm, with a lack of freshwater flow for five or more years at a time. The fish fauna of Ross River estuary was sampled in the post wet and dry seasons during an extremely dry climatic period (1994) and extremely wet climatic period (2000) using a,small mesh (6 mm) pocket seine net. The fish fauna seemed to reflect seasonal differences. Catches from 1994 (dry period) were comprised entirely of 88 marine and euryhaline species, while the 69 species captured in 2000 (wet period) included 13 freshwater species. However, the freshwater species in the upper estuary were individuals washed over the weir, rather than part of a functional faunal gradient. During 1994 faunal composition was related more to site identity than to the position of the site along an upstream gradient. In contrast, during 2000 there were clear upstream faunal gradients with compositions in upstream sites heavily influenced by freshwater species, and marine and euryhaline species dominating downstream sites. Patterns of species dominance also varied between years. In contrast, trophic composition showed consistent shifts in both years, from high proportions of herbivores, carnivores and benthoplanktivores in May towards high proportions of benthivores in August. Not only do faunal composition, seasonal faunal change and ecological connectivity seem to be impaired, but ecological processes in the estuary that rely on seasonal freshwater flows are likely to be unable to operate normally in most years. The extreme seasonality in Ross River may serve as a model for many of the changes that will be experienced in dry tropics estuaries under global climate change scenarios of more extreme seasonality.

AB  - The growth and development that the Municipality of Almada (Portugal) has had, an area with an extensive coastal line, both Atlantic and estuary, translates directly into morpho-functional changes and specific spatial dynamics, with these spaces acquiring more and more complex semantic meanings. The modelling of spatially dynamic and naturally complex phenomena, such as those occurring in the coastal areas, are important for the definition of an innovative strategy of physical planning and environmental management in these coastal areas. In this spirit we have undertaken the development of innovative methods aimed at this modelling, which enable the understanding of the land use and occupation phenomenon in coastal areas subjected to strong urban pressure. The results of which will be discussed. This paper presents a method to simulate the coastline evolution (integrating land use/cover), linking neural networks and cellular automata in a GIS environment. Such alterations simulated solely by means of cellular automata are not suitable, because these models, in their more conventional structure, contain limitations in their spatial parameters and transition rules. In this paper, a neural network is used to calibrate the degree of importance that each prediction variable (probability) has on the geographic constraints (weights). All these variables are handled within a GIS environment.

AB  - Three earthquakes of magnitudes 4.6, 4.3 and 3.7 occurred in 2002 May at two locations 20 km from the pilgrimage city of Lourdes in the French Pyrenees. They were well recorded by the permanent Pyrenean seismic networks, by a temporary local network, as well as by accelerometric stations. In order to understand their tectonic contexts, and to come to a better evaluation of the seismic risk at Lourdes, a detailed analysis of these events is performed.
   The first two events are located south of Lourdes in an area where only a few earthquakes have occurred up to now. Their focal solutions derived from first-motion polarities indicate reverse faulting, with a N110degreesE strike consistent with the geological structures. 10 aftershocks were recorded and relocated with respect to the main events, benefiting from the waveform similarity of the various events. This analysis reveals that the two main events concern probably the same fault, the second rupture being in the prolongation of the first one, whereas the other small aftershocks are located on fault segments in the vicinity of the hypocentre of the second event.
   The third large event, located to the SE of Lourdes, involves a normal mechanism with a N120degreesE plane parallel to the main geological structures. It occurred in a region of intense activity, including in particular an event of maximum macroseismic intensity IX in 1660.
   The first two events are at the boundary of a large quiet zone. In order to understand the related structural context, a new crustal tomographic model has been computed. It reveals that this quiet zone coincides with a block of high P-velocity. In contrast, the seismicity appears to be stronger at the northern and eastern boundaries of this block.
   The accelerometric data of the three main events recorded at Lourdes have been used to estimate the maximum peak ground accelerations in this city if a large event occurred, similar to those which damaged the city in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Horizontal accelerations of 0.25 +/- 0.07 g are predicted in the frequency domain 1-5 Hz at the location of the Sanctuary for a magnitude 6 event occurring 10 km away from the city. Taking into account the error bars, these values could in some cases exceed those specified by the building codes in this region.

AB  - The evaluation of interactive systems has been an active subject of research for many years. Many methods and tools have been proposed but most of them do not take architectural specificities of agent-based interactive systems into account. In addition, electronic informers are popular evaluation tools but current ones have often some limits. In order to solve these problems, we propose an electronic informer to evaluate agent-based interactive systems. This tool captures interaction events occurred in agent-based interactive systems and then, based on such captured data, it realizes treatments such as calculations, statistics and generates Petri Nets (PNs) to assist evaluators in evaluating three aspects of the system: user interface, non-functional properties (e.g. response time, reliability, etc.) and user's properties (e.g. abilities, preferences, etc.). The approach has been validated by applying it to evaluate an agent-based interactive system used for the supervision of urban transport network.

AB  - 1. Counts of road traffic casualties (RTCs) have been proposed as one potential method of monitoring changes in the abundance of several mammal species in Britain. However, before such schemes are implemented, it is vital that the relationship between animal density and RTCs is verified and quantified. In this paper, we analyse data collected as part of a long-term study of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in Bristol, UK to determine whether RTCs reflected changes in fox numbers.
   2. Associations between fox density and RTC counts were examined using data collected from throughout Bristol during 1978-84 (spatial model) and from an intensive longitudinal study in the north-west of the city during 1990-94 (temporal model). For both sets of data, there was a significant relationship between fox density and RTCs; in the case of the temporal model, this was only evident after the data had been manipulated by calculating running means across seasons. These regression models only explained 58% and 43% of the variance observed in the data, respectively.
   3. In both analyses, there was a significant difference between the distribution of casualties and the availability of different road types; more foxes were killed on major category roads (e.g. motorways, A-roads). Incorporating the length of each road category in each region in the spatial model improved the variance explained to 81%. This level of precision would be sufficient for a national monitoring programme. However, we were able to minimize or eliminate a number of factors that could potentially confound the use of RTCs for a national monitoring programme; these factors are discussed in detail. At present, we conclude that further investigation into the validity and precision of this technique is required for a range of mammal species before it could be used in a national monitoring programme.

AB  - We investigated the aquatic macroinvertebrate fauna of 76 ponds and small pools in an urban fringe landscape, and related the presence of ten species to measures of water permanence, pond area and environmental conditions using logistic models. The incidence of all the species was strongly associated with variation in hydroperiod, but patterns were more variable with the other explanatory variables. To determine whether the presence of a species at neighbouring ponds increased its probability of occurance at a pond we constructed a series of autologistic models, that differed from the aspatial logistic model in that they included a spatial autocovariate in the predictor terms. The improvement of model fit on inclusion of this autocovariate, measured as the decline in deviance compared to the aspatial models, was determined across a range of lag distances. In seven of the ten species, the autologistic models explained the incidence of the species amongst the ponds better than the aspatial models. Spatial effects were typically over short distances (< 200 m) before declining, but in two species appeared to reach an asymptote, and we propose that variation in dispersal ability is the most likely factor producing these spatial effects. We conclude that it is essential that some measure of spatial autocorrelation is considered when evaluating the distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates at small or medium scales.

AB  - A multimedia model has been developed to account for the movement of semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs) in an urban environment. The model, based on a Level III fugacity model of D. Mackay (Multimedia Environmental Models: The Fugacity Approach, Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL, 1991), consists of six compartments: air, surface water, sediment, soil, vegetation, and an organic film that coats impervious surfaces. The latter is a newly identified compartment into which gas-phase SOCs partition and particle-phase SOCs are believed to be efficiently captured (M.L. Diamond, S.E. Gingrich, K. Fertuck, B.E. McCarry, G.A. Stern, B. Billeck, B. Grift, D. Brooker, T.D. Yager, Environ. Sci. Technol., 34 (2000a), 2900-2908). The model, parameterized for downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and run with an illustrative emission rate for selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and homologues of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, indicates that the film achieves the highest concentrations among media but that soils are the greatest sink for all but the least hydrophobic chemicals. The film "reflects" the more volatile chemicals into air, facilitates removal to surface waters by wash-off, and provides a surface on which photolytic degradation can occur. As such, the film is a transient sink that increases chemical mobility in urban areas by increasing air concentrations and the cycling of these compounds between air and urban surfaces and increasing water concentrations. Vegetation also accumulates SOCs, a portion of which is transferred to soil that reduces chemical mobility. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A cohort study of family practice residency graduates in a predominantly rural state: Initial practice site selection and trajectories of practice movement
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Limited information is available on long-term patterns of practice location choice among family physicians, although these patterns will significantly affect the quantity, quality, and continuity of health care provided in rural areas. From 1992 through 2000, five biennial surveys were administered to graduates of three family practice residency programs. Graduates were asked the location of their current and previous practice site locations, specific practice information, and global satisfaction with family practice.
   Identifiable practice sites were assigned a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural-urban continuum code based on the county in which the practice was located. The use of rural-urban continuum codes as a measure of rurality was believed to be particularly applicable to the small rural and frontier counties typical of the Great Plains region. For purposes of this study, practice locations were considered rural if they were in rural-urban continuum codes 7,8, or 9.
   Of 593 graduates, 514 (87%) returned at least one questionnaire. Overall, about one-third of graduates had chosen their first practice sites in counties with rural-urban continuum codes of 7, 8, or 9. While most graduates remained in their initial practice site, almost half moved at least once. Those who left nonmetropolitan practices tended to move to less rural locations, though a few moved against this gradient. Moves away from the initial practice site occurred after a median of 3 years, and the likelihood of a first move decreased rapidly 5 to 6 years after graduation. Much remains to be learned about decisions to enter or leave practice in rural-urban continuum code 7,8, and 9 counties.

AB  - Previous research demonstrates the role of religious beliefs practices, and people in a wide variety of social movement snuggles. In most cases, religious resource mobilization seems to occur in a relatively straightforward, uncomplicated manner and with positive outcomes for the movement in question. Little attention has been paid to the challenges that exist to mobilizing religious resources and building coalitions with religious supporters. This essay examines the problematic nature of religious resource mobilization as part of union strategies to win a strike/lockout against Detroit's two newspapers, the News and the Free Press, between 1995-2000. Intensive interviews with strikers, union spokespersons, and religious activists, illustrate how religious resources contributed to union strength during the strike. However, these contributions; were limited by the internal dynamics in the relationship between the unions and religious supporters as well as by the power disparities between these local coalitions and the multinational corporations they struggled against.

The dominant characteristics of the studied area are steep slopes of the deeply incised, narrow valleys, strong fragmentation of the bedrock composed of various types of gneisses and obvious structural influence on the valley network plan. Based on the analysis of the occurrence, parameters and relative position of selected landforms, which have significance for documenting certain processes, as well as other inputs, the relief of the studied area was divided into eight genetic types of relief segments: structural, erosional, erosional-structural, structural-denudational and erosional-denudational slopes, flat denudational ridges and planation surface remnants and finally the valley floors with the floodplain.

AB  - Satellite sensor images usually contain many complex factors and mixed pixels, so a high classification accuracy is not easy to attain. Especially, for a nonhomogeneous region, gray values of satellite sensor images vary greatly and thus, direct statistic gray values fail to do the categorization task correctly. The goal of this paper is to develop a cascaded architecture of neural fuzzy networks with feature mapping (CNFM) to help the clustering of satellite sensor images, In the CNFM, a Kohonen's self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is used as a preprocessing layer for the reduction of feature domain, which combines original multi-spectral gray values, structural measurements from co-occurrence matrices, and spectrum features from wavelet decomposition. In addition to the benefit of dimensional reduction of feature space, Kohonen's SOFM can remove some noisy areas and prevent the following training process from being overoriented to the training patterns, The condensed measurements are then forwarded into a neural fuzzy network, which performs supervised learning for pattern classification. The proposed cascaded approach is an appropriate technique for handling the classification problem in areas that exhibit large spatial variation and interclass heterogeneity (e.g., urban-rural infringing areas). The CNFM is a general and useful structure that can give us favorable results in terms of classification accuracy and learning speed, Experimental results indicate that our structure can retain high accuracy of classification (90% in average), while the training time is substantially reduced if our system is compared to the commonly used backpropagation network. The CNFM appears to be more reasonable and practical than the conventional implementation.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) has caused repeated large-scale human epidemics in North America since it was first detected in 1999 and is now the dominant vector-borne disease in this continent. Understanding the factors that determine the intensity of the spillover of this zoonotic pathogen from birds to humans (via mosquitoes) is a prerequisite for predicting and preventing human epidemics. We integrated mosquito feeding behavior with data on the population dynamics and WNV epidemiology of mosquitoes, birds, and humans. We show that Culex pipiens, the dominant enzootic (bird-to-bird) and bridge (bird-to-human) vector of WNV in urbanized areas in the northeast and north-central United States, shifted its feeding preferences from birds to humans by 7-fold during late summer and early fall, coinciding with the dispersal of its preferred host (American robins, Turdus migratorius) and the rise in human WNV infections. We also show that feeding shifts in Cx. tarsalis amplify human WNV epidemics in Colorado and California and occur during periods of robin dispersal and migration. Our results provide a direct explanation for the timing and intensity of human WNV epidemics. Shifts in feeding from competent avian hosts early in an epidemic to incompetent humans after mosquito infection prevalences are high result in synergistic effects that greatly amplify the number of human infections of this and other pathogens. Our results underscore the dramatic effects of vector behavior in driving the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans.

AB  - Data from the eradication of the incursion of Bactrocera papayae Drew and Hancock (Dipt.: Tephritidae) in Australia (1995-1998) are used to assess the significance of various aspects of invasion theory, including the influence of towns on establishment, influence of propagule pressure on the pattern of establishment, and the existence of source-sink dynamics. Because there were no sentinel traps in place, considerable spread had occurred before the eradication campaign started. The distribution of fly density around the epicentre in the town of Cairns and a transect along the main traffic routes to the north and south fitted a Cauchy model with a tail having the same slope as a power model with an exponent of -2.4 extending to 160 km. The Cauchy model indicated that 50% of the flies on the transect would have occurred within 3.2 km of the epicentre, 90% within 13.2 km, and 99% within 60 km. The two major satellites at Mareeba (35 km from the epicentre in Cairns) and Mossman (65 km) were not used for the transect data and had respectively 15 and 30 times the density predicted by the model. The proportion of traps that caught flies (a measure of site occupancy) fell with distance from the epicentre. B. papayae was trapped consistently on only three of the 16 rainforest transects that were surveyed and these were relatively close to urban areas where eradication efforts were intense. Despite there being no eradication effort in the rainforest, the trends to extinction were similar to those in adjacent areas. The strategy of initially concentrating eradication efforts on the core and major satellites while maintaining a quarantine barrier at the airport and the boundaries of the infested area appears to be the key to the containment and rapid eradication of the incursion.

AB  - The result of long-term environmental and human interaction is a variety of potential human responses to major natural crises: population aggregation or dispersal, changes in economic strategies and land-use patterns, restructuring of social organization, increase in the incidence of conflict and warfare, and, in some instances, urban abandonment and cultural collapse. In the context of pre-industrial societies, two social processes with the greatest potential impact on the environment and on changing human-environmental interaction are urbanization and the development of diversified, regional-scale production systems such as intensive agriculture, pastoralism and exploitation of maritime resources. This paper employs archaeological and geological data from the Jequetepeque and Zana valleys on the north coast desert of Peru to study: (1) the specific responses of Moche, Chimu and Inca societies (c. AD 250-1553) to major episodes of drought, El Nino flooding, and desertification; (2) the social processes of urban-rural relations and economic diversification; and (3) how these processes interacted within the dynamic and north coast. Our research focuses on changing palaeoenvironmental regimes, agricultural infrastructures and domestic occupations to explore the complex interplay of cultural and natural forces that shaped the variable human responses and the history of urban-rural systems. Understanding the problem of how pre-industrial systems were sustained or failed in the context of interrelated social and environmental crises is an interdisciplinary objective, one that requires the integration of analytical techniques and theoretical frameworks of both the natural and social sciences as delineated in this study.

AB  - A current pattern of seasonal migration, particularly among smallholders, is marked by movement between the Amazon River floodplain and upland bluffs near the city of Santarem, Brazil. Nearly fifty years of jute cultivation "subsidized" residents of the floodplain, enabling them to remain there year-round. Without this subsidy, annual flooding and the concomitant seasonal dearth of cash-economy activities make permanent occupancy difficult. The present-day seasonal migration and complementary use of both upland and floodplain environments has broad implications for theories about past patterns of settlement and for the region's future sustainable development.

AB  - The recent Argentinian crisis, initiated at the end of 2001, induced to a particular and new condition of activation in the expresion's way of the society, Although with the course of time that renewal in social practices was re-absorbed by the institutional structure and the same political class that initiated the crisis, some advances have been registered in the social production of habitat issue.
   The approval of the Law 341 in the City of Buenos Aires allowed the delivery of subsidies for the construction of social housing by the National State to cooperatives and intermediate organizations, which changed the axis of their actions for enlist into significant construction's projects to face the present situation of residence deficit of his members.
   In this way, groups of diverse origins in the social field, related in another time with the occupation of real estate as the MOI (Movement of Occupants and Tenants), groups of the block "piquetero" as the MTL (Territorial Movement of Liberation) or the Plaza de Mayo Mothers, nowadays are in full activity for the production of social housing.
   From this perspective, the present work tries to realize the recent experiences of counterurbanization, wich have in essence an argumentative spirit to the new forms of distinguishing expansion of the city. It is a question of self-administration construction of social housing that put into practice actions and instruments for containment and inclusion, with the intention of mitigating the effects of these asymmetries.

AB  - Successional patches are a large component of forest ecosystems throughout the world and their vegetation composition is conditioned by multiple factors such as land use history, disturbances, environmental conditions and landscape context. We investigated the relative contribution of historical, environmental, biotic and spatial factors in determining vegetation composition and invasion by exotic species in secondary forest patches of Sierra de San Javier, Tucuman, Argentina. We estimated canopy cover for shrub, vine and tree species distributed over 51 patches with known land use history. We also recorded environmental, historical and spatial variables and used multivariate techniques to explore the relationship between forest composition and explanatory variables. Land use, time since abandonment, altitude, slope and cover of different strata were related to the vegetation pattern in the study site, and they were all significantly structured over space. Exotic species appeared to differ from natives in their response to explanatory variables. Overall, exotic species were dominant on the edges of young patches originated from herbaceous crops, but the total number of exotic species was related to the distance to urban areas and small farms identified as potential sources of exotic propagules. Vegetation composition of secondary forests in NW Argentina was related to historical and environmental factors, but spatial variables strongly influenced vegetation composition as well as the variation in explanatory variables.

CP  - 5th International Conference on Getechnical Aspects of Underground Construction in Soft Ground
AB  - The assessment of building deformation due to tunnel induced ground movement has become an essential part in the planning and construction process of any tunnelling project in an urban environment. in current engineering practice the building is normally represented by a plane strain structure on which a settlement profile is imposed. This approach does not account for any three-dimensional (3D) deformation mode of the building. Recently published case studies, however, have demonstrated that 3D deformation such as twist occurs in buildings subjected to tunnel construction. Results from a 3D Finite Element (FE) parametric study are presented in which a building is represented by elastic shell elements. All buildings were in plan perpendicular to the tunnel axis while their stiffness, their size (width and length) and the tunnel depth were varied. It is shown how these different parameters influence the twist deformation. The study reveals a similar trend between twist and building size, building stiffness and tunnel depth as found by Potts & Addenbrooke (1997) for deflection ratio and horizontal building strain.

TI  - Artists, aestheticisation and the field of gentrification
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Gentrification involves the transition of inner-city neighbourhoods from a status of relative poverty and limited property investment to a state of commodification and reinvestment. This paper reconsiders the role of artists as agents, and aestheticisation as a process, in contributing to gentrification, an argument illustrated with empirical data from Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Because some poverty neighbourhoods may be candidates for occupation by artists, who value their affordability and mundane, off-centre status, the study also considers the movement of districts from a position of high cultural capital and low economic capital to a position of steadily rising economic capital. The paper makes extensive use of Bourdieu's conceptualisation of the field of cultural production, including his discussion of the uneasy relations of economic and cultural capitals, the power of the aesthetic disposition to valorise the mundane and the appropriation of cultural capital by market forces. Bourdieu's thinking is extended to the field of gentrification in an account that interprets the enhanced valuation of cultural capital since the 1960s, encouraging spatial proximity by other professionals to the inner-city habitus of the artist. This approach offers some reconciliation to theoretical debates in the gentrification literature about the roles of structure and agency and economic and cultural explanations. It also casts a more critical historical perspective on current writing lauding the rise of the cultural economy and the creative city.

AB  - Biological invasions are one of the major threats to both ecosystem and economic functioning. Their management typically involves culling of the pest or removal of its habitat. The Asiatic red-bellied beautiful squirrel Callosciurus erythraeus is the first known introduction of a squirrel into South America. It established from five releases in 1973, using exotic trees to spread through Argentinean Pampas. It now causes substantial economic damage in agricultural and urban areas across > 680 km(2), and its continued spread threatens indigenous species. We developed a spatially explicit model of the invasion for the likely range of life-history parameters, matched against empirical data on patch occupancy in 2004. The two best-fitting models suggest the current population to be on the cusp of an explosive expansion. These models were used to predict future trends under alternative scenarios of strategic culling or habitat removal aimed at slowing the spread. The predictions for 18 yr into the future were that 1) the present lack of systematic management will lead to a 5-fold increase in area of occupancy, 2) removal of habitat down to half carrying capacity will thin the population but accelerate its spread, 3) 10 yr of culling above the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) will precipitate declines in abundance and patch occupancy towards extinction, but with immediate recovery upon cessation of the cull. We recommend continuous culling above the MSY in priority patches, aimed at slowing arrival to valuable conservation areas. This study demonstrates the need for prompt action to terminate invasions before they establish. The squirrel invasion is now irreversible after 30 yr of slow spread across fragmented habitat. Although culling requires public awareness campaigns and sustained governmental commitment, it is now the best feasible strategy for managing this invasion.

AB  - Oceanic islands, such as Juan Fernandez in Chile, are the home for particular biotas that have evolved in isolation over a long period. The anthropogenic introduction of allochtonous plants is one of many problems for the conservation of endemic elements. In this paper, we present the new additions to the introduced flora of the Juan Fernandez Islands, adding some comments about their life form, origin, morphological characteristics, ecology, distribution, abundance, and their potential of invasion. We cited 27 new species, 12 new genera, and three new families for the Juan Fernandez flora (Amaryllidaceae. Commelinaceae and Violaceae). Most genera belonged to Asteraceae (seven species). Fifty-nine percent of taxa were perennial herbs, followed by annual or biennial herbs. Wind was the main vector of propagule dispersal (42 %), followed by vegetative dispersal (23 %). Fifty-two percent of the species were weeds and 44 % were plants with dual behaviour: garden-weed plant. Eurasia was the most frequent area of plant origin (70 %). Ninety-four percent of the taxa with known geographic range are in the V Region of mainland Chile, which is the main region of export of plants and materials to the archipelago, suggesting that this may have been the immediate origin of these introductions. Sixty-three percent of the species were only found in the San Juan Bautista urban area, while the remaining taxa were also (22 %) or exclusively (15 %) found in other places of the main island (Robinson Crusoe). Sixteen species (59 %) are considered as noxious weeds in Juan Fernandez or elsewhere, and they should be a focus of attention and, eventually, control. Summing our findings to previous lists of introduced taxa. we obtained 260 non-native taxa in Juan Fernandez. This number is greater than the native taxa (2 11), which demonstrate how the human intentional and non-intentional action can dramatically change the floristic composition of an oceanic archipelago. We strongly recommend the installation of a sanitary control in Robinson Crusoe Island or in Valparaiso, in association with quarantine procedures with the food vegetables, and biological products in general.

AB  - Shou-Shan landslides located at Kaohsiung in southwestern Taiwan have been recognized as serious problems by the public concern. It is of primary importance to realize the situation of sliding areas become unstable and identify the factors trigger the slope movement in these limestone areas. The geological structure of slope, the lithology of rock, the intensity of heavy rainfall and the stage of morphological development around these areas determine susceptibility to Shou-Shan landslides. Only an accurate diagnosis can make it possible to propose effective remedial measures. As a result, both field investigations and laboratory examinations have been conducted since 1995. Also, the great variety of intensive land use in these areas reflects the diversity of factors that may disturb the stabilization of Shou-Shan sliding areas.
   This project has been conducted for three year. Two sliding areas in these regions have been selected as experiment districts due to their scale and history of sediment disaster occurrence. Geological investigation, soil mechanical properties determination, groundwater table observation, meteorological data collection and GIS/RS application were required for this study. The critical failure surface of sliding zone can be determined by slope stability analysis and boring test in the field. Also, the potential sliding zones can be estimated roughly by using GPS/GIS/RS integration. All results were presented graphically. It is expected that the result can be used as an indication applied on the stabilization for Shou-Shan sliding areas at Kaohsiung city in southwestern Taiwan.

CP  - 2nd International FLAC Symposium
KW  - SOIL
AB  - The prediction of ground movements above and around tunnels is becoming increasingly important as more tunneling is carried out in urban areas and more demand is put on the underground spaces to be constructed. To date the best method of predicting the ground movement around tunnels has been to use empirical techniques that are primarily based upon past tunneling experience. However, this approach is difficult to apply when there are unusual ground conditions or when using new construction techniques. Two-dimensional plane strain numerical analyses have frequently been used to predict tunnel induced ground movements. However these analyses suffer from the fundamental limitation that a significant amount of ground movement occurs ahead of the tunnel face and that a component of this movement is parallel to the axis of the tunnel. The magnitude of this movement ahead of the tunnel has to be assumed and can have a significant affect on the result of the analysis. This paper discusses recent work carried out using FLAC(3D) to assess the ground movements caused by NATM tunnels constructed at shallow depth in a stiff overconsolidated clay deposit. The clay was represented by a non-linear elasto-plastic model that considered the small-strain stiffness of the soil. The effectiveness of various face stabilization measures in reducing the ground movements was assessed. The analyses showed that the response of the clay is significantly stiffer titan shown by high quality laboratory test data. The analyses also showed that early closure of the shotcrete ring was the most effective method of reducing the ground movements caused by the tunneling.

AB  - High concentrations of lower atmospheric ozone can adversely affect the health of humans, plants, and animals. Over the past decade, unhealthy levels of ozone across the Phoenix, Arizona (USA) urban area have been a focus of attention for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local government agencies. As ozone concentrations exceeding the standard set forth by the EPA occur in a preferred location within the Phoenix Metropolitan area (eastern suburb of Mesa), it has become important to gain an understanding of the mechanisms that transport ozone within Phoenix and its suburbs. The objective of the study that is presented here was to examine the climatic factors that contributed to the spatial distribution of lower atmospheric ozone across the eastern portion of the Phoenix metropolitan area in mid-to-late summer 1998. Microclimatic and synoptic scale atmospheric contributors were linked to the mesoscale transport of ozone. Forty-three study days were stratified into 3 categories: high ozone days (exceeded the EPA standard), moderate ozone days (approached the EPA standard), and low ozone days. Eleven days of high ozone were differentiated from the days of the remaining 2 categories by an atmosphere containing less water vapor, and therefore a greater surface receipt of insolation. This is not surprising given the fact that ozone production is a photochemical process. However, the movement of the lower atmospheric ozone is also an important issue. The results of the study suggest that the drier atmosphere and resultant high insolation at the surface were associated with a proximal area of high pressure aloft. Taken together, the result was warmer ground surface and overlying air temperatures, light winds, an apparent lack of turbulent lower atmospheric mixing, and light southwesterly winds at 850 mb that advected little moisture into the area. Associated with the light synoptic flow and warm surface condition on days of high ozone was a wind regime that appears to be the product of a mesoscale thermodynamic circulation. The daytime flow on high ozone days became directed upslope toward the higher elevations of the eastern Phoenix Valley. Embedded within the flow was a plume of high ozone concentrations that extended from an urban area of high ground traffic eastward into the eastern suburb of Mesa. Conversely, moderate and low ozone days were associated with an eastward displacement of high pressure aloft, greater advection of low-level moisture from the south and southeast, smaller insolation receipt, less surface heating, and a much less organized movement of lower atmospheric ozone than on high ozone days.

AB  - Disturbance frequently is implicated in the spread of invasive exotic plants. Disturbances may be broadly categorized as endogenous (e.g., digging by fossorial animals) or exogenous ( e. g., construction and maintenance of roads and trails), just as weedy species may be native or exotic in origin. The objective of this study was to characterize and compare exotic and native weedy plant occurrence in and near three classes of disturbance digging by prairie dogs ( an endogenous disturbance to which native plants have had the opportunity to adapt), paved or gravel roads ( an exogenous disturbance without natural precedent), and constructed trails ( an exogenous disturbance with a natural precedent in trails created by movement of large mammals) - in three geographically separate national park units. I used plant survey data from the North and South Units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Wind Cave National Park in the northern mixed-grass prairie of western North and South Dakota, USA, to characterize the distribution of weedy native and exotic plants with respect to the three disturbance classes as well as areas adjacent to them. There were differences both in the susceptibility of the disturbance classes to invasion and in the distributions of native weeds and exotic species among the disturbance classes. Both exotic and native weedy species richness were greatest in prairie dog towns and community composition there differed most from undisturbed areas. Exotic species were more likely to thrive near roadways, where native weedy species were infrequently encountered. Exotic species were more likely to have spread beyond the disturbed areas into native prairie than were weedy native species. The response of individual exotic plant species to the three types of disturbance was less consistent than that of native weedy species across the three park units.

AB  - Solitaires (Myadestes spp.) are montane-forest birds that are widely distributed throughout the New World, ranging from Alaska to northern Bolivia and including both Hawaii and the West Indies. To understand the origins of this impressive distribution, we used five mitochondrial gene sequences to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the genus. The resulting phylogeny indicates a rapid initial spread of the genus to occupy most of its contemporary continental range at least as far south as lower Mesoamerica, plus Hawaii and the Greater Antilles. The North American M. townsendi appears to be the sister taxon of the rest of Myadestes. Myadestes obscurus of Hawaii is more closely allied to Mesoamerican lineages than to M. townsendi. The strongly supported sister relationship of the two West Indian taxa, M. elisabeth and M. genibarbis, indicates a single colonization of the West Indies. A more recent node links the Andean M. ralloides to the Mesoamerican M. melanops and M. coloratus. A standard molecular clock calibration of 2% sequence divergence per million years for avian mitochondrial DNA suggests that the initial diversification of Myadestes occurred near the end of the Miocene (between 5 and 7.5 mya). Cooler temperatures and lower sea levels at that time would have increased the extent of montane forests and reduced overwater dispersal distances, possibly favoring range expansion and colonization of the West Indies. The split between South American and southern Mesoamerican lineages dates to similar to 3 mya, which suggests that Myadestes expanded its range to South America soon after the Pliocene rise of the Isthmus of Panama. Despite the demonstrated capacity of Myadestes for long-distance dispersal, several species of Myadestes are highly differentiated geographically. Phylogeographic structure was greatest in the West Indian M. genibarbis, which occurs on several islands in the Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles, and in the Andean M. ralloides. The phylogeographic differentiation within M. ralloides was not anticipated by previous taxonomic treatments and provides a further example of the importance of the Andes in the diversification of Neotropical birds. Overall, the historical biogeography of Myadestes suggests that range expansion and long-distance dispersal are transient population phases followed by persistent phases of population differentiation and limited dispersal.

AB  - This large-eddy simulation study investigates the effects of an idealised surface inhomogeneity of sensible heat flux on dispersion of a passive plume emitted from elevated sources into an urban convective boundary layer (UCBL). The results show that when Deardorff's translation is made to introduce a wind with its direction aligned with the centreline of park blocks, dispersion of such a passive plume is strongly affected by turbulent structure associated with the patchy pattern of surface heat flux. In comparison with a case with a homogeneous surface, when the point source is located above the central line across the park areas, the mean plume height Z(c) is lower, the vertical dispersal parameter S-z is smaller, the surface concentration Co is generally higher, and pollutant is less dispersed in the vertical direction. When the point source is aligned with the built-up area, however, the opposite situation occurs. The difference in surface concentration at a same downwind distance can be as large as 100% among the cases over a homogeneous surface, the location above built-up surface and the location above park surface in the idealised urban area. The extent to which the patchy pattern of surface heat flux influences the plume dispersion depends on two parameters: d/Z(i) and b/p, where d is the distance between the centres of two adjacent parks, b is the width of built-up area, p is the size of park, and Z(i) is the UCBL height. This study suggests that dispersion of a passive plume in a UCBL has different behaviour from that for a homogeneous surface in the previous studies. Estimate of pollutant concentration by the existing methods or models that are based on observations over a homogeneous surface cannot distinguish such differences revealed by the results in this paper.

AB  - This paper presents the results obtained from unannounced evacuations of four Marks and Spencer retail stores. By unannounced it is meant that the public and staff had no prior knowledge of the evacuations and were not informed during the evacuations by voice communication systems, The four IL tail stores participating in the study were chosen to represent three-storey city centre stores and single-storey out-of-town stores in different locations in the United Kingdom. The evacuations were video taped using in-house closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) orientated to cover pre-determined fields of view and additional portable cameras which were positioned and concealed when the stores were closed for business on the evenings before the evacuations. The evacuating customers were asked to complete a questionnaire by teams of researchers positioned outside, but not impeding, each emergency exit. Data sufficient for occupant characterisation and occupancy profiling for Marks and Spencer stores were obtained. Analysis of the video tapes also yielded information on total evacuation times and pre-movement nt times for each store. This research provided useful information, which informs the discussion in this paper of many issues relevant to the development of performance based codes, the profession and practice of fire safety engineering.

AB  - An environmental factor of particular importance to children's physical activity levels appears to be the presence of parks and open space. Thus, in promoting children's health, school grounds merit consideration as a potential setting for intervention. This paper explores how 'green' school grounds, which contain a greater diversity of landscaping and design features, affect the quantity and quality of physical activity among elementary school children. Teachers, parents and administrators associated with 59 schools across Canada completed questionnaires (n = 105). Analysis reveals that through greening, school grounds diversify the play repertoire, creating opportunities for boys and girls of all ages, interests and abilities to be more physically active. Complementing the rule-bound, competitive games supported by asphalt and turf playing fields, green school grounds invite children to jump, climb, dig, lift, rake, build, role play and generally get moving in ways that nurture all aspects of their health and development. Of particular significance is the potential to encourage moderate and light levels of physical activity by increasing the range of enjoyable, non-competitive, open-ended forms of play at school. Seen in this light, green school grounds stand to be an important intervention to be included in school health promotion initiatives.

T2  - ARCHEOLOGIA E CALCOLATORI
LA  - Italian
AB  - The ISCIMA-CNR has participated in the FIRB 2001 Project with research on "Trade dynamics in the ancient Mediterranean: the role of Etruria". This title raises a number of diverse issues: continuity and discontinuity in trading circuits in the Mediterranean Basin; structure of production and movement of goods; study of the relationship between urban and rural areas involved in their production and consumption; role of the Etruscan ports in the dynamic of trade. In order to conduct a diachronic analysis on this subject, the Etruscan metropolis of Cerveteri has been proposed as a sample area. Since the 1980s, in fact, Cerveteri has been investigated by the CNR Institute through systematic surveys and excavations, resulting in a better understanding of the urban area and the surrounding territory. In particular, within the FIRB Project, the results of the research activity come from the analysis of settlement models, the production of ceramic typological lists, the application of innovative ICT methods to field archaeology, together with archaeoastronomical and spatial analysis techniques, the use of archaeometric research tools to analyse ceramic and metallic objects. The article also describes in detail an integrated approach to define the typology and study the spatial distribution of specific classes of ceramics (in particular the archaic pottery), which have been found during excavations in the central part of the urban plateau, in an area occupied by an open-air elliptical building.

AB  - Migration is one of the major socio-economic characteristics of China since the country adopted the policy of economic reform in late 1970s. Many studies have been dedicated to understand why and how people move, and the consequences of their welfare. The purpose of this study is to investigate the environmental impacts of the large scale movement of population in China. We analyzed the trend in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) along with China migration data from the 1 percent national survey during 1982-1987, the 4(th) national census during 1985-1990 and the 5(th) national census during 1995 similar to 2000. We found that the internal migration in China has a statistically significant negative impact on vegetation growth at the provincial scale from 1982 to 2000 even though the overall vegetation abundance increased in China. The impact from migration (R-2=0.47, P=0.0001) on vegetation dynamics is the second strongest as among the factors considered, including changes in annual mean air temperature (R-2=0.50, P=0.0001) and annual total precipitation (R-2=0.30, P=0.0049) and gross domestic production (R-2=0.25, P=0.0102). The negative statistical relationship between the rate of increase in total migration and the change in vegetation abundance is stronger (R-2=0.56, P=0.0000) after controlling for the effects of changes in temperature and precipitation. In-migration dominates the impacts of migration on vegetation dynamics. Therefore, it is important for policy makers in China to take the impacts of migration on vegetation growth into account while making policies aiming at sustainable human-environment relations.

AB  - In this study, the potential saving of cooling energy by elevated air speed which can offset the impact of increased room air temperature on occupants' comfort, as recommended in the present standards (ASHRAE 55 2004, ISO 7730 2005 and EN 15251 2007), was quantified by means of simulations with EnergyPlus software. Fifty-four cases covering six cities (Helsinki, Berlin, Bordeaux, Rome, Jerusalem and Athens), three indoor environment categories I, II and III (according to standard EN 152512007) and three air velocities (<0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 m/s) were simulated. The required cooling/heating energy was calculated assuming a perfectly efficient HVAC system. A cooling energy saving between 17 and 48% and a reduction of the maximum cooling power in the range 10-28% has been obtained. The results reveal that the required power input of the fan is a critical factor for achieving energy saving at elevated room temperature. Under the assumptions of this study, the energy saving may not be achieved with the methods for air speed increase, such as ceiling, standing, tower and desk fans widely used today when the power consumption of the fan is higher than 20 W.

AB  - Being the interface of sea and land, the coast can be invaded by introduced species coming from either of these two worlds. Recent reviews of coastal invasions emphasize the human-mediated transport of non-indigenous marine plants and invertebrates, forgetting the potential role of invaders of terrestrial origin. By studying the diet of the introduced American mink (Mustela vison) on a rocky shore of southwestern Europe, we draw attention to the potential impact on intertidal communities of exotic species coming from inland. We analysed 199 mink faeces collected in August 1997 and August 1999 in Baiona, a coastal and urban area of northern Spain recently invaded by minks. The diet of the species was based almost exclusively on crabs (45.4% of individual prey) and fish (53.3%). Most crabs were marbled crabs (Pachygrapsus marmoratus) and most fish were adult blennies (Coryphoblennius galerita and Lipophrys pholis). Given its energy requirements (about 1250kJ/day), a single mink will consume during the month of August approximately 945 blennies and 496 crabs. Although we lack accurate data on mink abundance, a cautious estimation (4 mink/km before dispersal), supported by field observations, suggests that predation in August may reach 3780 blennies and 1984 crabs per km of shoreline. This predation pressure could affect the numbers of blennies and (less probably) crabs, indirectly benefiting the populations of their prey, that is, sessile invertebrates and snails. More field research is needed, but our results suggest that an exotic non-marine top predator such as the American mink could affect intertidal communities in Eurasia.

AB  - This paper critiques common depictions of the Evo Morales government in Bolivia as revolutionary socialist or radically reformist. It introduces the concept of indigenous ascendant populism to better understand the character of the Morales administration. It summarizes the historical significance of the electoral victory of the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS); situates contemporary Bolivian politics within the broader theoretical debates occurring within the Latin American left; and explains the trajectory of Latin American populism and the particularities of Bolivia's experiences within that trajectory. Against this theoretical and historical backdrop two popular mobilizations occurring in 2006 and 2007 are examined: a conflict in a Huanuni mine in October 2006 and the 'Cochabamba Conflict' of December 2006 and January 2007. Both events are found to substantiate the thesis of indigenous ascendant populism. The contention is made that a renewal of independent self-organization and strategic mobilization of the popular classes and indigenous nations is necessary so that social movements will not be trapped within the limited political horizons of the current government.

AB  - Policymakers recently have targeted teacher quality, and school systems have increased their attention to instructional reform through professional development. The purpose of this study was to examine teachers' views about the change process and professional development that supports change. Semi-structured focus-group data were gathered from 41 primary-grades teachers (students ages 5-9) across five schools in a high-poverty urban district that participated in a 2-year literacy-reform initiative. Results indicated that teachers viewed the change process from two stances: as learners and as change agents. Three conditions supported their professional growth: professional development embedded in school and classroom contexts, professional development focused on limited and clearly defined learning goals, and on-demand access to time and resources. Changes that occurred did so in three phases: movement from curriculum-centered to student-centered practices, increased collaboration, and requests for policy changes via teacher autonomy and advocacy for students.

AB  - Rubus canduliger is described as a new regional bramble species belonging to the series Discolores. It has been recognized in the Netherlands as a distinct species for more than 70 years but identified as the central European R. grabowskii. The latter, however, differs by its tapering prickles, regular leaves with longer petiolule of the terminal leaflet, broader, often pyramidal infloreseence, and white or pink flowers with carpels hairy at the top. R. canduliger has a well-defined range north of the Rhine river around Arnhem where it occurs in urban and other disturbed habitats. Historical events, e.g. transport of young trees in the 16th century may explain most records south of the Rhine river, 25-50 kin outside the main range. The ecology and phytosociology of the new bramble are discussed. Its distribution is compared to R. trichanthus, another regional species with a similar range as R. canduliger, but occurring in more natural habitats.
   In pseudogamous European blackberries (Rubus section Rubus = R. fruticosus agg.), range size is considered to be related to the age of the species. Several widespread species have disjunct distribution ranges that are suggested to be the result of long-distance dispersal by migratory birds but unintentional anthropogenic transport of seeds may be involved as well. We hypothesize that in northwestern Europe fragmentation of continuous ranges of widespread species was caused by ongoing deforestation and subsequent degradation (acidification) of originally base-rich sandy and loamy soils from the Iron Age onward. Many regional species, however, have originated and spread in the resulting man-made landscapes. A classification of range types of brambles differing in size and internal structure is presented.

TI  - Insurgency Theory and the Conflict in Algeria: A Theoretical Analysis
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
LA  - English
AB  - In the early nineties it was widely feared that Algeria was on the verge of an Islamic revolution. These fears proved to be unfounded. This article seeks to explain the failure of the insurgency to topple the current government through the use of three models of successful insurgency movements: urban insurrection, peasant-based guerrilla warfare and focoism. Analysis shows that the first two of these models cannot be applied to the situation in Algeria because of the nature of the Algerian topography, the lack of foreign sanctuaries for the insurgents and the authoritarian nature of the Algerian regime. The single success of the third model is a historical anomaly, unlikely to lead to the overthrow of the current Algerian government, but leading to a fourth and final model; urban terror. It is the clandestine nature of this fourth model which provides for the longevity of the current insurgency, yet because of its inability to meaningfully challenge the state, gain recruits, and maintain centralized control over the movement, the insurgency degenerates, perpetrating the seemingly senseless acts of violence currently occurring in Algeria today, the natural aftermath of a failed insurgency.

AB  - Background Relatively few studies have examined relationships between the social networks of people with psychotic disorder and other aspects of their functioning. The aim of this paper is to describe the social networks of people with psychosis and to investigate relationships between social networks arid personal and occupational functioning, taking account of illness course. Methods A two-phase epidemiological survey of persons with psychosis was conducted in four predominantly urban areas of Australia. A census and screen for psychosis was followed by a semi-structured interview of a stratified random sample of participants to assess their functioning. Data relating to functioning and social networks from 908 individuals (most with a diagnosis of schizophrenia) were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Results The majority of people with psychosis (67%) had a network comprising of family and friends, 15% were defined as having a family-dominated network, 11 % a friends-dominated network and 7% of participants were defined as socially isolated (no family or friends). Participants who had friends and family in their network (12%) or who had a family-dominated network (7%) were more likely to be in full-time employment compared with those with a friends-dominated network (4%) or those who were socially isolated (5%). Dysfunction in self-care was more frequently reported among socially isolated people (50%) and those with family-dominated networks (47%) than among those with friends-dominated networks (35%) and those who had friends and family in their social network (23%). SEM revealed a strong association between social integration and functioning (r=0.71), even after controlling for illness course. Social integration was defined as having contact with family and/or friends and functioning was defined as having employment and no difficulties in self-care. Male gender was associated with poorer self-care, and female gender was slightly, but significantly, associated with a greater likelihood of having friends. Conclusion There is a strong relationship between social networks and functioning after taking account of course of illness. That is, the presence of family and friends is generally associated with better self-care and employment. Interventions that are targeted at improving social relationships are likely to have a positive impact on self-care and occupational functioning (and vice versa).

AB  - Babadag, in the Denizli province of Turkey, is one of the oldest textile industry settlements. The town has suffered from a very slow slope movement for about 60 years. One-third of the population lives in the unstable area. The slope movement resulted in significant ground deformations and damage to buildings, roads and buried utilities, and negatively affects socioeconomic life in the town. This paper contributes to the understanding of the long-term plane shear slope movement at the town, analyzes the main causes of the movement, and describes the slope instability and its effects. Movement occurs at an annual rate of between 3.8 cm and 15 cm along weak bedding planes in the alternating marl and sandstone beds forming the slope. Engineering geological assessments based on movement, groundwater and rainfall monitoring data, laboratory testing, and stability analyses indicate the following main factors contributing to the movement: (a) the unfavorable orientations and low shear strength of the bedding planes, (b) variations in the groundwater table related to precipitation and waste water seeping from the damaged sewage system, and (c) undercutting at the toe of the slope by a creek. Particularly due to fluctuations in the groundwater table or variations in pore pressures, the slope movement exhibits increasing and decreasing rates of movement without catastrophic failure.

AB  - Using the data from the community-based longitudinal study of the elderly persons aged 65 or older, this study examined relationships between the occurrence of falls varied by their activity level and subsequent functional decline over time. Of the 705 respondents at baseline, 662 and 632 subjects were assessed at first and second follow-ups. Falling and homebound status at baseline and health function (self-rated general health, activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), intellectual activity, and social role) at baseline and follow-ups were assessed, and changes in each health function were compared among four groups defined by baseline falling/homebound status. Baseline falling/homebound status was significantly associated with subsequent decline in ADLs over 1 year, and in ADLs, IADLs, intellectual activity, and social role over 2 years. Being homebound might act as a stronger risk factor for ADLs disabilities rather than the occurrence of falls. Moreover, the homebound elderly with no experience of falls was at the greatest risk of the decline of social role. We consider that prevention program and home-based care for homebound elderly should be provided in the community. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The southern end of the Upper Rhine Graben is one of the zones in Switzerland where recent crustal movements can be expected because of ongoing seismotectonic processes as witnessed by seismicity clusters occurring in this region. Therefore, in 1973 a control network with levelling profiles across the eastern Rhine Graben fault was installed and measured in the vicinity of the city of Basel in order to measure relative vertical movements and investigate their relationship with seismic events. As a contribution to EUCOR-URGENT, the profiles were observed a third time in the years 2002 and 2003 and connected to the Swiss national levelling network. The results of these local measurements are discussed in terms of accuracy and significance. Furthermore, they are combined and interpreted together with the extensive data set of recent vertical movements in Switzerland (Jura Mountains, Central Plateau and the Alps). In order to be able to prove height changes with precise levelling, their values should amount to at least 3-4 mm (1 sigma). The present investigations, however, have not shown any significant vertical movements over the past 30 years.

AB  - Sandstorms are frequent in the northern Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico, an area characterized by open areas lacking vegetation, individual mesquite bushes, and mesquite coppice dunes. Field measurements of sand fluxes and wind velocities over a two year period provided a description of the area - suggesting that the "streets", the flat, elongated, non-vegetated areas aligned with the dominant wind directions are the principal sources of wind-dispersed soil and dust. However, since soil erosion and dust movement depend on the pattern, strength, and gradients in the wind field, modeling soil erosion and dust movement requires a continuous wind velocity field. Consequently, air flow patterns at this site were simulated using a semi-empirical mass-consistent diagnostic wind field model: QUIC version 3.5 (Quick Urban & Industrial Complex). Two hundred and fifty-one simulations were run encompassing several dust storms occurring in April 2003. Wind velocity vectors were compared between the model and field data at three heights for six locations and were found to correlate well for a majority of the situations suggesting that the flow patterns are consistent throughout the domain. In particular, good agreement was found for wind speeds at 0.75 m, the height for which the model was tuned. However, it overestimated velocities at 1.5 m (10%) and 3.15 m (13%). Generally, the model successfully identified locations of the highest wind velocities and wind stresses, predominately found in "streets" aligned with the driving wind, and locations of wake flow downwind of mesquite bushes where there was separation flow or otherwise shelter from the wind.

AB  - An integrated seismic monitoring system with a total of 53 channels of accelerometers is now operating in and at the nearby free-field site of the 20-story steel-framed Atwood Building in highly seismic Anchorage, Alaska. The building has a single-story basement and a reinforced concrete foundation without piles. The monitoring system comprises a 32-channel structural array and a 21-channel site array. Accelerometers are deployed on 10 levels of the building to assess translational, torsional, and rocking motions, interstory drift (displacement) between selected pairs of adjacent floors, and average drift between floors. The site array, located approximately a city block from the building, comprises seven triaxial accelerometers, one at the surface and six in boreholes ranging in depths from 15 to 200 feet (similar to 5-60 meters). The arrays have already recorded low-amplitude shaking responses of the building and the site caused by numerous earthquakes at distances ranging from tens to a couple of hundred kilometers. Data from an earthquake that occurred 186 km away traces the propagation of waves from the deepest borehole to the roof of the building in approximately 0.5 seconds. Fundamental structural frequencies [0.58 Hz (NS) and 0.47 Hz (EW)], low damping percentages (2-4%), mode coupling, and beating effects are identified. The fundamental site frequency at approximately 1.5 Hz is close to the second modal frequencies (1.83 Hz NS and 1.43 EW) of the building, which may cause resonance of the building. Additional earthquakes prove repeatability of these characteristics; however, stronger shaking may alter these conclusions.

AB  - A reliable estimate of the quantity of solid waste generation in the city is very important for proper solid waste planning and management. However, reported estimates of solid waste generation vary widely and lead to questionability. The reported values have been derived on the assumption of demography, standard rate of waste generation by households, density values, number of trucks engaged for waste transportation and monitoring of truck movement at dump sites, etc. This diverse nature of the available data and the question of accuracy necessitate a rigorous study that has tried to document the waste quantity in the recently formulated master plan of Dhaka City. The socio-economic parameters, behavioral characteristics, generation sources, seasonality, and per capita growth rate are considered in estimating the waste quantity along with its future projections. The findings from the estimation of waste quantities state that seasonal differences in the municipal solid waste stream are not substantial. The most seasonably variable material in the municipal solid waste stream is food waste. Residential waste is relatively homogeneous. Although there are some differences in waste generation depending on demographic and other local factors, most households dispose of essentially similar types of wastes. Variation occurs in waste composition dependent upon income levels and category of sources. Variation also occurs based upon the extent of source reduction and recycling opportunities. As opportunities exist to recycle wastes, the recycling facilities might have to grow at a similar pace to the generation of waste. Physical and chemical characteristics of solid waste are important to implement the waste disposal and management plan for the selection of resource and energy recovery potentials. A number of studies have been conducted to determine the composition of wastes including moisture content and calorific value. The data show that the moisture content in city waste is significantly higher and the calorific value is much lower, which determines the viability of composting or anaerobic digestions rather than waste combustion.

AB  - At present, forest cover in southwestern Ontario, Canada, remains at less than 5% due to intensive agricultural and urban land use. Although much of the extant forest is increasingly protected by legislation, remnants continue to be degraded by the spread of non-native plant species, overgrazing, and recreational use. Some parks in the region have adopted management programs aimed at mitigating this degradation. Over the last 35 years, cottages and roads at Point Pelee National Park have been removed and sites either passively restored (i.e. road or cottage eliminated and vegetation allowed to regenerate) or actively restored (i.e. road or cottage eliminated, exotic vegetation removed, and native species planted). In 1994 and 1995, we assessed the effectiveness of restoration by comparing the understorey plant communities in 28 restored sites with those in less disturbed reference sites. There was a significant increase (P < 0.0001) in the similarity of understorey plant communities between restored and reference sites as time-since-restoration increased. Soil moisture, canopy cover, distance to continuous forest, and site-shape all significantly affected plant species composition. Former road sites recovered significantly (P < 0.05) more rapidly than former cottage sites, and the former lawns of passively restored cottage sites were the slowest to recover. Five years following active restoration, non-native ruderal species continued to dominate restored sites. The observed recovery of understorey plant communities in restored sites is attributed to their proximity to natural vegetation, and its function as a seed source. In some sites, recovery is substantial and, assuming present trajectories of change are maintained, we predict that recovery could occur in many mesic sites within the next 20 years. Restoration activity facilitates forest recovery and would appear to have a valuable function in mitigating ongoing conflicts between conservation and human use in this region.

AB  - The following article summarizes the latest state-of-the-art information and best practices for pedestrian-related disaster preparedness and emergency evacuation planning. Although "walk-out plans" have been developed for selected cities, no facility and/or infrastructure planning, engineering, or implementation has yet occurred that was directly related to expediting or improving mass pedestrian evacuation safety and access. Since the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has pioneered the study of pedestrian infrastructure, and its impact on mass pedestrian evacuation, we recommend more support for this activity, and ongoing outreach efforts.(1) This article concludes with a brief critique based on a prior discussion of the impact of pedestrian evacuation on vehicle movement that was published in the first federal guidance exclusively on managing pedestrian evacuations.(2)

AB  - Recent studies have pointed to evidence that fine particles in the air could be significant contributors to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Epidemiologists looking at the health effects of particulate pollution need more information from various receptor locations to improve the understanding of this problem. Detailed information on temporal, spatial and size distributions of particulate pollution in urban areas is also important for air quality modellers as well as being an aid to decision and policy makers of local authorities. This paper presents a detailed analysis of temporal and seasonal variation of PM10 and PM2.5 levels at one urban roadside, one urban background and one rural monitoring location. Levels of PM10, PM2.5 and coarse fraction of particulates are compared. In addition, particulate levels are compared with NO2 and CO concentrations. The study concludes that PM10 and PM2.5 are closely related at urban locations. Diurnal variation in PM2.5/PM10 ratio shows the influence of vehicular emission and movement on size distribution. This ratio is higher in winter than in summer, indicating a build-up or longer residence time of finer particulates or washout due to wet weather in winter. In the second part of this study, a disease burden analysis is carried out based on the dose-response relationships recommended by the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution. The disease burden analysis indicates that if Marylebone Road (MR) levels of PM10 were prevalent all over London., it will result in around 2.5% increase in death rates due to all causes. Whereas, if Bloomsbury (BB) levels were prevalent in London, which is more likely to occur as this is more representative of the urban background environment to which people in London are likely to be exposed, the corresponding increase would be around 1.7%. Considering this, in London, at Bloomsbury levels, 973 deaths and 1515 respiratory hospital admissions (REA) are attributable to PM10 while 2140 RHA are attributable to NO,. After deducting the disease burden due to background levels at Rochester (RC), PM10 emission caused by anthropogenic activities in London equates to 273 additional deaths and 410 additional RHA, while NO2 account for additional 1205 incidences of RHA.

AB  - The spreading dynamic of the 2004 dengue fever outbreak that occurred in Tartagal, Northwestern Argentina, was investigated. 9 A total of 487 suspected dengue cases were recorded and geo-referenced. Maps of daily cases were generated for the 109 days of the outbreak. The epidemic affected the majority of the city within I I days. The age-distribution of the cases was different from the population age-distribution. The spatio-temporal clustering of the cases was analyzed using Knox test concept. Results of the space and time geo-referencing of the cases showed outbreak spotlights and spreading patterns that could be related to entomologic and epidemiologic factors. An environmental risk prediction model was developed based on a synthetic multi-band image created from LandSat 5 TM satellite image. The potential and limitations of remote sensing data and spatial statistics as landscape epidemiology tools for a dengue surveillance strategy and prevention are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban transportation is mainly seen as a challenging engineering and logistical task. However, the results of technically-installed infrastructure become part of the urban fabric, structured tectonics and, in the best case, architecture for short occupancy. In regard to the early 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, for whom architecture was "like a gesture and unlike every movement of the human body is a gesture, neither is every building architecture", the question remains as to how the infrastructural environment needs to perform beyond its primary function. This paper will illustrate how an architectonical approach on infrastructure can catalyze the social impact of infrastructural enterprises. Achievements of socially-responsive infrastructures will be demonstrated by two intercontinental case studies: the rethinking of the "Loop" in Chicago Illinois USA by graduate student Erin Mumm and the light rail station projects in Germany by her mentor Professor Martin Despang. In a collaborative way the authors Mumm and Despang, with his practice base in Hannover, Germany and his research and teaching platform at the College of Architecture in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, will point out the potential of specific architectural treatment in achieving an economical and social win/win affect. The study concludes that giving infrastructural concepts multiple meaning beyond the primary purpose of moving people can hopefully result in high public acceptance, which is the most fundamental requirement for a sustainable future of infrastructural investments. The paper presentation will point out the societal and economical challenges and the potential of architecturally-engineered infrastructure.

AB  - The drosophilid fauna is well documented in eastern Australia but is poorly known in other parts of the continent. This paper summarises what is known of this fauna in the Northern Territory (NT), and includes results from banana trapping in the humid and arid zones. The 42 recorded species include species that breed in fruit, fungi and/or flowers, and a larval predator of scale insects. Drosophilids occur in all three major climate zones (humid, semiarid and arid) but predominate in the humid zone. Banana-attracted species in the humid zone (wet-dry tropics) were common in all sampled habitats: urban, rainforest and open woodland. They included predominantly urban and/or rainforest species. Of the species collected in open woodland, some are likely to be breeding there, whereas others may have been intercepted during movement across the area. The semiarid fauna is a depauperate version of that found in the humid region. Only three species have been recorded in the arid region: an endemic arid specialist, and two cosmopolitan species (D. simulans and D. melanogaster ) in urban Alice Springs. Overall, the NT drosophilid fauna represents a depauperate version of that found in eastern Australia, probably because of climatic factors and natural barriers to range expansion. There is little evidence of regional endemism, with probably only one (and at most three) species endemic to the NT, and no evidence of independent, natural dispersion from nearby Indonesia.

AB  - Terrestrial habitats surrounding wetlands are critical to the management of natural resources. Although the protection of water resources from human activities such as agriculture, silviculture, and urban development is obvious, it is also apparent that terrestrial areas surrounding wetlands are core habitats for many semiaquatic species that depend on mesic ecotones to complete their life cycle. For purposes of conservation and management, it is important to define core habitats used by local breeding populations surrounding wetlands. Our objective was to provide an estimate of the biologically relevant size of core habitats surrounding wetlands for amphibians and reptiles. We summarize data from the literature on the use of terrestrial habitats by amphibians and reptiles associated with wetlands ( 19 frog and 13 salamander species representing 1363 individuals; 5 snake and 28 turtle species representing more than 2245 individuals). Core terrestrial habitat ranged from 159 to 290 m for amphibians and from 127 to 289 m for reptiles from the edge of the aquatic site. Data from these studies also indicated the importance of terrestrial habitats for feeding, overwintering, and nesting, and, thus, the biological interdependence between aquatic and terrestrial habitats that is essential for the persistence of populations. The minimum and maximum values for core habitats, depending on the level of protection needed, can be used to set biologically meaningful buffers for wetland and riparian habitats. These results indicate that large areas of terrestrial habitat surrounding wetlands are critical for maintaining biodiversity.

TI  - Origin and development of plains-type folds in the mid-continent (United States) during the late Paleozoic
T2  - AAPG BULLETIN
LA  - English
KW  - NORTH-AMERICA
KW  - DEFORMATION
KW  - OKLAHOMA
AB  - Plains-type folds are local, subtle anticlines formed in the thin sedimentary package overlying a shallow, crystalline basement on the craton. They are small in areal extent (usually less than 1-3 km(2) [0.4-1.2 mi(2)]), and their amplitude increases with depth (usually tens of meters), which is mainly the result of differential compaction of sediments (usually clastic units) over tilted, rigid, basement fault blocks. The development of these structural features by continuous but intermittent movement of the basement fault blocks in the late Paleozoic in the United States mid-continent is substantiated by a record of stratigraphic and sedimentological evidence.
   The recurrent structural movement, which reflects adjustment to external stresses, is expressed by the change in thickness of stratigraphic units over the crest of the fold compared to the flanks. By plotting the change in thickness for different stratigraphic units of anticlines on different fault blocks, it is possible to determine the timing of movement of the blocks that reflect structural adjustment. These readjustments are confirmed by sedimentological evidence, such as convolute, soft-sediment deformation features and small intraformational faults.
   The stratigraphic interval change in thickness for numerous structures in the Cherokee, Forest City, and Salina basins and on the Nemaha anticline of the mid-continent United States was determined and compared for location and timing of the adjustments. Most of the adjustment occurred during and after time of deposition of the Permian-Pennsylvanian clastic units, which, in turn, reflect tectonic disturbance in adjacent areas, and the largest amount of movement on the plains-type structures occurred on those nearest and semiparallel to major positive features, such as the Nemaha anticline.
   Depending on the time of origin and development of plains-type folds, they may control the entrapment and occurrence of oil and gas.

AB  - Inter-tidal marshes are dynamic diverse ecosystems at the transition zone between terrestrial and ocean environments. Geomorphologically, inter-tidal salt marshes are vegetated landforms at elevations slightly greater than mean tidal levels that have distributed channels formed under ebb (drainage) tidal flows that widen and deepen in the seaward direction. The drainage channels enable tidal flows to circulate sediments and nutrients through the marsh system during normal tidal events, while depositing sediments during storm or seismic events. This dynamic system encourages considerable biodiversity while simultaneously providing water quality enhancement features that service marsh terrestrial life and marine life in the estuary. Reservoir creation limiting sediment transport, anticipated large increases in sea levels as well as agricultural and urban development have resulted in significant loss of inter-tidal marshes and subsequent adverse impacts on waterfowl, infauna and fisheries. The complex and continuously changing marsh channel hydraulics and sedimentary processes have severely constrained quantitative modeling of these marsh systems such that restoration/creation efforts remain something of an empirical science and further assessments are needed. The purpose of this paper is to outline current understanding of salt marsh hydrodynamics, sediment accretion processes and subsequent response of marsh vegetation to set the stage for assessment of a marsh restoration effort along San Pablo Bay near San Francisco, California. Several kilometers of drainage channels were constructed in a 624 ha disturbed salt marsh to restore tidal circulation and vegetation so as to enhance habitat for threatened species (e.g. clapper rail, harvest mouse, delta smelt and potentially anadromous fish species). Two distinct drainage channel systems ('east' and 'west') were installed having similar channel dimensions common to salt marshes in the region, but having design bankfull tidal prism volumes differing by a factor of two. Following channel excavation, main channel tidal flows and sediment loads as well as marsh sediment accretion rates were monitored to assess the relative success of the excavation in restoring tidal circulation and vegetation (Salicornia spp.) to the marsh. Annual aerial surveys corroborated with ground-truthing indicated that marsh vegetation rapidly expanded, from 40 to 85% coverage several years following excavation. The 'east' channel intake was nearly completely silted in within three years. However, channel surveys and flow measurements indicated that the 'east' channel system tidal prism was only about 1200 m(3), more than an order of magnitude less than that of the stable 'west' channel system. Marsh sediment accretion rates were on the order of 7-8 mm yr(-1), a rate common to the Pacific coast region that exceeds estimated sea level rise rates of similar to2 mm yr(-1). East channel network siltation resulted in storm and spring tidal flood ponding such that marsh vegetation coverage decreased to 51% of the marsh area and related habitat expansion decreased. These results are considered in terms of the primary inter-tidal marsh factors affecting possible restoration/creation strategies.

AB  - How might revolutions and other processes of institutional disintegration inform political processes preceding them ? By mapping paths of agency through processes of institutional disintegration, the trajectory improvisation model of institutional breakdown overcomes "action-structure" binaries by framing political revolutions as possible outcomes of such disintegrative processes. The trajectory improvisation approach expands the trajectory adjustment model of social change developed by Gil Eyal, Ivan Szelenyi, and Eleanor Townsley. An overview of political revolution in Soviet Russia between 1989 and 1991 illustrates trajectory improvisation. The recent American invasion and occupation of Iraq shows alternative routes to institutional disintegration, indicating the independence of models of institutional breakdown from those of social movements. These cases illustrate both the diversity of situations the trajectory improvisation model speaks to, and the limitation of models of trajectory adjustment, improvisation, social movements, and invasions, illustrating why such models at best enable what are called "explanatory narratives" of actual historical processes.

AB  - Rapid urban development in hilly terrain, coupled with tropical storms with heavy rainfall, has led to the frequent occurrence of disastrous landslides in Hong Kong. This paper outlines several case histories of such disastrous landslides in Hong Kong and the major efforts that have been made to mitigate landslide hazards in Hong Kong since the mid-1970s. Factors that contributed to such landslides and their causative mechanisms are analyzed. Methods of predicting the runout distance and lateral extent of rainfall-induced slope failures are summarized. Slope maintenance requirements and stabilization measures are delineated, including the stabilization of loose fill slopes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES

AB  - This article analyses the power of peripheral urban spaces in the creation and dissemination of a culture of female militancy. I show how poor women in the Bombay slums, by affiliating themselves with the aggressive Shiv Sena movement, came to violently control a range of physical, material and social spaces, in the process moving away from positions of subordination to occupy roles that allowed them to affect the male exercise of authority. I explore the importance of women's oral narratives by analysing the stories of migrant Shiv Sena women and their crippling encounters with a harsh slum life. The slum became a complex space that redefined and reconceptualised social groupings, and migration and relocation. of unemployed people created new social and kinship networks. While sustaining a facade of being structurally muted within such an environment of constant transition, my ethnography illustrates how women (over two overlapping generations) tacitly and explicitly resisted naturalising discourses on femininity and 'the home'. I argue that slum women strategically chose to infuse their physical environments with the threat of conflict, as women's presence in (and patrolling of) these contested urban spaces became a source of real and symbolic power.

AB  - With the passage of No Child Left Behind and the start of the high-stakes accountability movement, it has become increasingly important that teachers are able to appropriately assess all students, including those who qualify for alternate assessments. If suitable assessment is occurring, teachers can use these data to help improve student performance to meet both individualized education program (IEP) goals and state standards. In this study, which was conducted with teachers in an urban system within a high-stakes accountability state, students' alternate assessment scores improved when teachers received training on instructional practices. In addition, students who did well on alternate assessments also showed growth in direct observation of performance of their IEP objectives.

AB  - This paper employs information from the advanced traffic management system (ATMS) of Kaohsiung, Taiwan to help differentiate those crash-prone intersections by discriminant analysis. From the 25,604 records of 2005, 1977 crashes that occurred at 119 intersections with traffic exposure data were compiled to calibrate and validate the model. The road attributes of crash records, traffic control devices and movement exposure are the three types of data used as predicting variables. The correct ratios for model calibration and validation range from 78.33% to 67.80%. If traffic movements are removed, the correct ratios become slightly lowered to 76.67% to 66.10%. Research findings reveal that with or without inclusion of exposure data in identifying high crash-prone intersections for an urban environment does not make a significant difference. In addition, layout and traffic control devices could possibly explain about 66.10 similar to 78.33% of the possibility that an intersection will become a high crash intersection. It suggests that the developed approach could be a countermeasure for budget constraints and difficulties in continuation of exposure data collection, and the information of ATMS could help identify crash-prone urban intersections.

The Kobe earthquake occurred at 5:46 a.m. (LT) on January 17, 1995 around the Hanshin area in Japan. The M7.2 earthquake strongly attacked Kobe City. On that early morning, two young persons on Mt. Rokko (northeast side of Kobe) saw a luminous object moving a few seconds before the main shock. Independently, fishermen working around Osaka Bay (opposite side of Mt. Rokko) also noticed a moving luminous object. The direction of movement and the orbit of the luminous object might coincide with the direction of the rupture. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Should an attack occur in an urban area with a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), guidance is available on the acceptable total dose equivalent for reentering the contaminated zone, and there is an accepted methodology for plume projection in the model used by the Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC). After initial characterization of the impact of the plume caused by an RDD, there will be considerable pressure from the public to allow them to return and quickly collect their belongings, and, eventually, to reoccupy residences and to reopen businesses. The FRMAC procedures principally deal with early and intermediate phase dose assessment, but do include late phase assessment procedures. However, the late phase assessments do not include complex geometries, such as the internal structure of buildings. This paper identifies areas where more specificity is needed to rapidly provide assessments to health officials and senior decision-makers. In this regard, there is no national consensus method to calculate projected dose inside buildings after an RDD event that addresses selecting the exposure pathways, scenarios, key parameters, etc. Therefore, to demonstrate an approach that exemplifies some of the technical and policy issues, which are unresolved, four exposure scenarios (residential, industrial, public park, park worker) were evaluated to determine the level of contamination that would deliver a dose equivalent of 10 mSv in the first year, excluding exposure during the first 4 d (emergency phase). In addition, the retrieval of personal belongings was simulated by assessing a 1-h exposure for the residential and industrial scenarios. RESRAD-BUILD was used to calculate the surface concentration of Co-60, Sr-90, (CS)-C-137, Ir-192, (226) Ra, Pu-238, Am-241, and Cf-252 that would lead to a 10 mSv reference dose for these exposure periods. These example studies are intended to provide insights and guidance on how a municipal health agency can begin to develop a response plan, and to understand how the assessment process will determine the dose impacts resulting from an RDD event. The model's predictions heavily depend on the choice of the model's parameters; for several key ones, there are large uncertainties about their appropriate values. To avoid having to make hasty decisions during an emergency after an RDD attack, this analysis demonstrates that a detailed protocol for calculating dose should be developed prospectively so that decision-makers already are fully familiar with the process and its ensuing products.

AB  - Approximately 70% less water flows through the Everglades ecosystem today compared with the historic Everglades, and the quality of the remaining water is often degraded. The regionally managed hydropattern does not follow the pre-drainage distribution, timing, and duration of the natural Everglades, nor can water move freely though the remaining Everglades. As a result, there have been significant reductions in wildlife and fish populations, their habitat, and the environmental services wetlands provide society. Both the problems of declining ecosystem health and the solutions to Everglades restoration center on restoring the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan consists of over 60 civil works projects that will be designed and implemented over a 30 year period. At an estimated cost of $7.8 billion, it seeks to correct an earlier attempt at water management in South Florida and improve water availability during the dry season and reduce flooding of urban and agricultural areas during the wet season. The plan calls for storage and controlled release from more than 217,000 acres of new reservoirs and wetland-based treatment areas and from over 300 underground aquifer storage and recovery wells. The plans assumes that during retention in stormwater treatment areas, the excess phosphorus, nitrogen, agrichemicals such as atrazine, diazinon, endosulfan, and other contaminants will be reduced before release into the natural areas. It also assumes that little or no change in water quality will occur during underground storage. To improve the hydraulic connectivity of natural areas, some of the extensive system of levees and canals within the Everglades will be removed in an effort to improve overland water flow. Most of the current planning has focused on water storage and restoring basic hydrology in the remnant natural areas and on phosphorus removal as a benchmark of water quality. The restoration plan, as approved by Congress, is conceptual and most of the details, including potential impacts of the plan on the natural system and the role of contaminants remain to be evaluated.

AB  - This study focuses on the 'yatsu' landscape of the southern Kanto Region, in central Japan. This agricultural landscape consists of narrow, branching valleys where rice is cultivated in irrigated paddies, and surrounding slopes and uplands devoted to a variety of landscape types, such as dry vegetable field, orchard, bamboo grove and coppice woodland. Two sites were selected, one with a long history of suburban development, and another just in the process of development. Changes in the landscape over a 30-year period, from 1960 to 1990, were identified and analyzed using aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software. In the more intensively developed site, total forest area decreased while patch size of grassland, residences and bare ground increased together with the total number of patches. These changes in landscape element type were caused primarily by direct conversion of one type to another. In the less developed site, the total area and mean patch size of deciduous broad-leaved forest increased, and the total number of patches did not change. Changes at this site were caused mostly by the abandonment of traditional land management practices. The results of this study indicate that not only landscape element types, but also boundary types are influenced by urbanization. Of particular importance is the finding that the ecological function of boundaries is reduced by human intervention. This means that forest-floor herbaceous plants and woody plants with low dispersal capability will likely be adversely affected as residential development expands. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Relationships between land use or land cover and embeddedness, a measure of fine sediment in spawning gravels, were examined at multiple scales across 54 streams in the Russian River Basin, California. The results suggest that coarse-scale measures of watershed land use can explain a large proportion of the variability in embeddedness and that the explanatory power of this relationship increases with watershed size. Agricultural and urban land uses and road density were positively associated with embeddedness, while the opposite was true for forest cover. The ability of land use and land cover to predict embeddedness varied among five zones of influence, with the greatest explanatory power occurring at the entire-watershed scale. Land use within a more restricted riparian corridor generally did not relate to embeddedness, suggesting that reach-scale riparian protection or restoration will have little influence on levels of fine sediment. The explanatory power of these models was greater when conducted among a subset of the largest watersheds (maximum r(2) = 0.73) than among the smallest watersheds (maximum r(2) = 0.46).

AB  - The twin city of Calcutta-Howrah is underlain by a succession of Quaternary sediments consisting of clay, silt, fine to coarse sand and occasional gravel. Below these sediments at depths beyond 296 m, there is a thick sequence of Pliocene clay. The top clay bed of Quaternary sequence contains peaty intercalations indicating bog or marshy condition at depths of 2 - 5 m and 12 - 12.6 m. The peal layers were deposited during the period c.3990 years B.P, to c. 7030 years B.P. Grain size analysis of the sandy horizons indicates that the sands were deposited in a fluvial environment. Lithofacies analysis of the Quaternary sediments indicates that the gravelly sand horizons occurring in E - W and NNE - SSW trends in the depth range of 80-120 m are potential aquifer zones. These two trends of deposition of very coarse sediments probably indicate the route of sediment movement where high energy condition prevailed. The sandy sediments at a depth span of 24 to 81 m are yellowish to brownish coloured suggesting oxidising conditions of deposition. The sediments occurring above and below this horizon are grey to light grey in colour indicating reducing conditions of deposition. The over-extraction of groundwater from the aquifer has resulted in the change of the groundwater flow pattern from an "open" system in 1956 to a "closed" one in 1993 with the formation of a groundwater trough in the south-central part of Calcutta. Based on depth of the aquifers, status of the piezometric surface, lithofacies and grain size ratio, an aquifer development plan has been proposed fora sustainable groundwater development in the twin city.

AB  - This study used airborne laser data to investigate spatial variations in shoreline migration, beach width, subaerial volume, and subaqueous volume change due to a hurricane event. Five separate airborne laser data sets of Panama City, FL area beaches were collected during a seven-month period before and after landfall of Hurricane Ivan. Contour shorelines were extracted from digital elevation models interpolated from these laser measurements and were used to measure changes in shoreline position and beach width. The shoreline migrated 16 in landward due to Hurricane Ivan and migrated 10 m seaward following Hurricane Ivan. No significant spatial relationship was found between shoreline migration before and after the hurricane. Linear relationships between a time series of beach width and subaerial volume were found at many locations. However, utilization of a single coefficient to represent all relationships is problematic due to the spatial variability in the linear relationship. Differences in two bathymetric data sets for summer and fall show that only a small portion of sediments were transported beyond an active zone and most sediments remain within the active zone despite the occurrence of a hurricane.

AB  - Roads and vehicles change the environmental conditions in which they occur. One way to categorize these effects is by the spatial scale of the cause and the impacts. Roads may be viewed from the perspective of road segments, the road network, or roads within land ownership or political boundaries such as counties. This paper examines the hypothesis that the observable impacts of roads on the environment depend on spatial resolution. To examine this hypothesis, the environmental impacts of vehicles and roads were considered at four scales in west central Georgia in and around Fort Benning: a second-order catchment, a third-order watershed, the entire military installation, and the five-county region including Fort Benning. Impacts from an experimental path made by a tracked vehicle were examined in the catchment. Land-cover changes discerned through remote sensing data over the past three decades were considered at the watershed and installation scales. A regional simulation model was used to project changes in land cover for the five-county region. Together these analyses provide a picture of the how environmental impacts of roads and vehicles can occur at different spatial scales. Following tracked vehicle impact with a D7 bulldozer, total vegetation cover responded quickly, but the plant species recovered differently. Soils were compacted in the top 10 cm and are likely to remain so for some time. Examining the watershed from 1974 to 1999 revealed that conversion from forest to nonforest was highest near unpaved roads and trails. At the installation scale, major roads as well as unpaved roads and trails were associated with most of the conversion from forest to nonforest. For the five-county region, most of the conversion from forest to nonforest is projected to be due to urban spread rather than direct road impacts. The study illustrates the value of examining the effects of roads at several scales of resolution and shows that road impacts in west central Georgia are most important at local to subregional scales. The insights from these analyses led to several questions about resource management at different spatial scales. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISTVS.

AB  - Subtropical coastal sand dune ecosystems have been greatly altered by agricultural use, invasive exotic encroachment, urban development, and beach raking, rendering several plant species endangered or threatened. Restoration planning of this ecosystem will benefit from a comprehensive study on how environmental variables change across the coast-to-inland gradient of this ecosystem and it is therefore presented here. We also examined the relationship between the environmental characteristics and plant species composition across the gradient. We used the two largest extents of remaining dune ecosystem on the southeastern coast of Florida, where relatively intact populations of endangered species occur. Vegetation and environmental data were collected from 97 3 x 8 m plots in two sand dune parks along the coast-inland gradient. Soil moisture, most nutrients, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter accumulation increased with distance from the coast, whereas pH and salt spray decreased. The number of species per plot was higher at further distances from the coast at one site only, and higher woody cover was associated With less species diversity at the other site. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed the importance of P, Mg, Ca, pH, cation exchange capacity, organic matter, estimated nitrogen release, and salt spray in affecting vegetation zonation. We conclude that soil chemistry is the most determinant factor of community zonation in these subtropical. dunes. Restoration planning should be site specific because of the differences in environmental factors between the two study sites.

TI  - From 'Ban-the-Bomb' to 'Ban-the-Increase': 1960s Street Politics in Pre-Civil Rights Belfast
T2  - IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This paper illuminates two forms of street politics - 'ban-the-bomb' and housing tenants' protests - prevalent in Belfast in the 1960s prior to the civil rights movement (CRM). This is done to highlight the role they played in developing forms of non-violent direct action which directly contributed to the repertoires of protest utilised by the CRM. This has hitherto been downplayed in existing literature on the development of CRM. The paper also contextualises the ambivalent position that these street politics occupied regarding the question of Northern Ireland's constitutional status, which meant that they could be co-opted by the metanarratives of groups representing nationalism and unionism. Finally, the extent to which such grassroots collective action can be viewed as part of 'right to the city' struggles is also examined.

AB  - Two principal models exist for reforming contemporary police departments: community policing and broken windows (or order maintenance) policing. Although the two types of reforms share some commonalities, they differ markedly in the level of citizen oversight they envision. It is thereby significant that the two movements are frequently conflated. I offer here an explanation for why this conflation occurs, focusing on three critical areas: police culture and organization, public attitudes about crime and criminal justice, and the activities of political elites. In each of these three domains, broken windows policing meshes more comfortably with established patterns of thought. As a result, broken windows policing supplants community policing as the dominant reform movement, with considerable consequences for the operations and oversight of contemporary police departments.

AB  - Relatively little work has been done on the housing experience of recent migrants from cultural backgrounds different to that of their host society. This absence is particularly marked for relatively high socio-economic status skilled migrants, many of whom have to negotiate housing markets significantly different from those in their countries of origin. Data obtained from a panel study of recent immigrants from three separate sources-China, India and South Africa-to New Zealand's main cities (primarily Auckland) are used to explore the nature of their housing experiences. Over a four-year period these migrants moved towards the New Zealand norm of owner occupied, detached dwellings, although more rapidly in some cases than others; the pace of movement reflected not only cultural differences among the three groups, relative to the New Zealand norms, but also experiences in the tabour market. These differences are reflected in levels of satisfaction with the decision to move to New Zealand.

TI  - Efficacy of a laser device for hazing Canada geese from urban areas of northeast Ohio
T2  - OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Complaints about Canada geese in Ohio have increased nearly 400% in the past decade, with 732 recorded in 2001. Harassment techniques such as pyrotechnics and mylar flagging have been used to reduce goose conflicts but are frequently ineffective, and initial experiments indicated that laser harassment may disperse Canada geese. We evaluated whether lasers could cause geese to abandon urban sites, the duration of site abandonment, and dispersal distance of harassed geese. one hundred ninety geese were banded and collared in June 2001 at 6 sites in northeast Ohio. Radio transmitters were attached to 40 collars. We conducted nocturnal laser harassment of geese in four 5-day periods from July 2001 through January 2002 at 3 treatment sites. No harassment occurred at 3 control sites. One-day surveys of collared geese were conducted 2 weeks prior to the 5-day hazing period, during the hazing period, and 2 weeks post-hazing. Geese were located through radio telemetry using air- and ground-based receivers during all 3 time periods. Laser harassment caused geese to leave the site after a mean of 4.6 (SE = 0.8) minutes of treatment. Over the 5-day treatment period, the mean number of geese observed at night decreased from 92 to 14; however, we found no differences between numbers of geese observed 2 weeks prior to initial harassment and those observed post-harassment. Telemetry indicated that geese moved <2.0 km from all but one banding site. Laser harassment was more effective in reducing goose numbers at night rather than reducing numbers during the day. Site characteristics such as ambient lighting, human disturbance, and size of pond appeared to be the primary factors determining the laser's effectiveness.

AB  - In actual mobile communication networks, the users' locations, the number of mobile communication users, and their behavior change depending on the time zone. This dependency affects the cell traffic; thus, the allocation of Base Stations (BSs) in the service area is an important problem to be investigated. In this paper we propose a new model for allocation of BSs in mobile communication networks, taking account of user distribution, user movement, channel occupancy, and handover. On the basis of this model, we developed a simulation system and carried out many simulations to evaluate the system performance. For simulations, we consider the actual location of road network and the population distribution in Yamagata City, Japan. We carried out many simulations for various scenarios and parameters. The performance evaluation shows that our simulation system makes a good BS allocation.

AB  - Legislation in the western world has led to the fitting of catalytic converters containing platinum-group elements to many cars, in order to reduce the toxic gases emitted from exhausts. Platinum (Pt) was the dominating precious metal used in automobile exhaust converters but in recent years a partial substitution of it by palladium (Pd) occurs in the US and, with some delay, in Western Europe. Platinum and Palladium emissions have led to an increase of their concentrations in different environmental matrices.
   Even though the data available today indicate no obvious health effects, continual further biomonitoring or monitoring of changes in Platinum Group Elements (PGE) levels in streets is recommended, to ensure that there is no dramatic increase from today's levels.
   The present investigation is the first report of the Pt and Pd concentrations in plants grown along the avenues of the city of Athens. As far as we know, similar study has not been conducted previously in any area of Greece. We further explore: a) the seasonal variation of the concentration of Pt and Pd in the leaves of the evergreen laurel shrub (Laurus nobilis L.) and b) the correlations between metal concentrations and traffic load, to evaluate the reliability of plant leaves to reflect traffic load.
   To this purpose, samples, of 40 leaves of Laurel shrubs each, were collected at the end of May- two months old leaves- and at the end of September-six months old leaves, from fifteen stations (S) along six main avenues and streets of Athens.
   The concentrations of both Pt and Pd in the washed leaves were below the detection limits of our method. In the unwashed leaves, the mean concentration (along with the standard error) of the 15 replications, for samples collected at the end of May were 1.06 +/- 0.23 and 1.20 +/- 0.23 (ppb) for Pt and Pd respectively, while for the samples collected at the end of September the concentrations were much more higher; 5.20 +/- 0.65 and 4.48 +/- 0.96 respectively.
   The higher levels of both elements measured in September were attributed to the accumulation of these elements during the summer season when the lack of rain restricted any leaching. This observation also suggests that the best season for biomonitoring the urban pollution in towns with Mediterranean climate, using evergreen plants, is the end of the dry season. Although positive, the correlation between elements concentrations and traffic load was not statistically significant; perhaps the turbulent effects of air movement in streets and stop-start nature of traffic in Athens confounded the relation.
   The obtained data can serve as a starting point for further biomonitoring of these metals in Athens and in other Greek towns.

AB  - We studied the population dynamics of the zebra longwing butterfly, Heliconius charithonia (Nymphalidae), in a 0.05 ha garden in Miami, Florida, for 2 years to answer the following questions: (1) How stable is a suburban, subtropical population of this widespread neotropical butterfly? (2) What are the major factors influencing its population dynamics? (3) What are the implications of adult mobility regarding gene flow within and between fragmented urban populations of this species? A mark-recapture study indicated that adult population size averaged 59 individuals (range: 9-115 individuals). Peak numbers occurred in mid-wet season (September) in 1996 and in the late dry and early wet seasons (April through June) in 1997. Fluctuations in size of the adult population paralleled changes in biomass of the larval food plant, Passiflora incense. Population sex ratio was consistently male-biased (68% males). Reproduction occurred year-round, and parasitism by a trichogrammatid wasp killed about 50% of Heliconius eggs throughout the year. Recruitment of adults from chrysalises produced in the garden and deaths, rather than immigration and emigration, accounted for most numerical changes. Both males and females apparently adjust their home range locations in response to changes in the biomass of Passiflora plants. Females search these plants for suitable oviposition sites, and males search them for female pupae (mates). In addition to relatively high mortality from egg parasitism, fluctuations in the number of suitable oviposition sites and amount of larval food limited recruitment into the adult butterfly population. High adult mobility probably results in substantial gene flow within and between populations of this butterfly in urban south Florida.

AB  - Conservation biologists, evolutionary ecologists and agricultural biologists require an improved understanding of how pollinators utilize space and share resources. Using microsatellite markers, we conducted a genetic analysis of space use and resource sharing at several spatial scales among workers of two ecologically dissimilar bumble bee species (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) foraging in an urban landscape (London, UK). At fine scales, the relatedness of workers visiting small patches of flowers did not differ significantly from zero. Therefore, colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not evolved as signals benefiting nestmates. To investigate space use at intermediate scales, we developed a program based on Thomas & Hill's maximum likelihood sibship reconstruction method to estimate the number of colonies utilizing single sites. The average number of colonies (95% confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of approximate to1 ha in area was 96 colonies (84-118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies (61-76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of bumble bee conservation. In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-bumble bee conservation requires landscape-scale action.

AB  - For those working in the field of landslide prevention, the estimation of hazard levels and the consequent production of thematic maps are principal objectives. They are achieved through careful analytical studies of the characteristics of landslide prone areas, thus, providing useful information regarding possible future phenomena. Such maps represent a fundamental step in the drawing up of adequate measures of landslide hazard mitigation. However, for a complete estimation of landslide hazard, meant as the degree of probability that a landslide occurs in a given area, within a given space of time, detailed and uniformly distributed data regarding their incidence and causes are required. This information, while obtainable through laborious historical research, is usually partial, incomplete and uneven, and hence, unsatisfactory for zoning on a regional scale. In order to carry this out effectively, the utilization of spatial estimation of the relative levels of landslide hazard in the various areas was considered opportune. These areas were classified according to their levels of proneness to landslide activity without taking recurrence periods into account. Various techniques were developed in order to obtain upheaval numerical estimates. The method used in this study, which was applied in the area of Potenza, is based on techniques derived from artificial intelligence (Artificial Neural Network-ANN). This method requires the definition of appropriate thematic layers, which parameterize the area under study. These are recognized by means of specific analyses in a functional relationship to the event itself. The parameters adopted are: slope gradient, slope aspect, topographical index, topographical shape, elevation, land use and lithology.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that bait movement and caching by foxes (Vulpes vulpes) may increase the potential risk of off-target effects from 1080 meat baits close to urban habitats. The M-44 ejector is an alternative way to deliver 1080 to foxes that will eliminate bait movement and caching. Whilst the M-44 ejector has been used for the control of foxes using cyanide in the United States, we investigated its use with 1080 as a toxicant. Exotic eutherian carnivores are generally more sensitive to 1080 than are most Australian endemic wildlife species, yet no useful difference in sensitivity to cyanide exists for these groups. The lower risk associated with occupational exposure to 1080 compared with cyanide suggests that it is a more desirable toxicant for fox control. Pen trials were undertaken in order to establish an appropriate capsule dose of 1080 to be used in the ejector. A minimum capsule dose of 2.7 mg of 1080 is estimated to be consistently lethal to foxes weighing up to 8.3 kg. The recommended dose is below the current meat bait dose of 3.0 mg 1080 used in Victoria. This may represent an improvement in occupational safety and a reduction in non-target risk.

AB  - The Kocaeli earthquake (M (w) = 7.4) of 17 August 1999 occurred in the Eastern Marmara Region of Turkey along the North Anadolu Fault and resulted in a very serious loss of life and property. One of the most important geotechnical issues of this event was the permanent ground deformations because of both liquefaction and faulting. These deformations occurred particularly along the southern shores of Izmit Bay and Sapanca Lake between the cities of Yalova and Adapazari in the west and east, respectively. In this study, three sites founded on delta fans, namely Degirmendere Nose, Yenikoy tea garden at Seymen on the coast of Izmit Bay, and Vakif Hotel site on the coast of Sapanca Lake were selected as typical cases. The main causes of the ground deformations at these sites were then investigated. Geotechnical characterization of the ground, derivation of displacement vectors from the pre- and post-earthquake aerial photographs, liquefaction assessments based on field performance data, and analyses carried out using the sliding body method have been fundamental in this study. The displacement vectors determined from photogrammetric evaluations conducted at Degirmendere and Seymen showed a combined movement of faulting and liquefaction. But except the movements in the close vicinity of shorelines, the dominant factor in this movement was faulting. The results obtained from the analyses suggested that the ground failure at Degirmendere was a submarine landslide mainly because of earthquake shaking rather than liquefaction. On the other hand, the ground failures at the Yenikoy tea garden on the coast of Seymen and the hotel area in Sapanca town resulted from liquefaction-induced lateral spreading. It was also obtained that the ground deformations estimated from the sliding body method were quite close to those measured by aerial photogrammetry technique.

AB  - The Abbotsford Landslide of 8 August 1979 occurred in an urban area of Dunedin, New Zealand, causing much damage to houses and urban infrastructure. Rapid failure occurred after weeks of preliminary movements, resulting in the formation of a approximately 5 million m(3) stop block slide. It caused the loss of 69 houses, with an overall cost of about NZ $10-13 million. After several months of investigations, a commission of inquiry found that unfavorable geology (weak clay layers in a 7-dip slope) was the underlying cause of the landslide. An old sand quarry at the toe of the slope and a leaking water main above the slide area were found to be man-made factors that contributed to the failure. Slope stability analysis showed that after sand excavation (approximately 300,000 m(3)), the water table had to rise 0.3 m less for failure to occur. Because the quarry closed 10 years before the landslide occurred, it is concluded that a long-term rise in groundwater levels because of the increased rainfall over the previous decade and leakage from the water main controlled the timing of the failure and, in this sense, are considered to have triggered the landslide.

AB  - Urbanization in the Chesapeake Bay watershed is having dramatic impacts on the streams and rivers that feed the Bay. Increasing imperviousness has led to higher peak flows and lower base flows. The movement of pollutants and other materials to receiving waters has increased and stream water temperatures have risen. These changes alter the structure and functioning of rivers, streams, and associated riparian corridors and result in changes in ecosystem services.
   We define a hydrologic disturbance index that indicates varying degrees of disturbance on a reach-by-reach basis, dependent on the aggregate amount of urbanization upstream of each reach. For current conditions this index is more variable than for future conditions, because current land use in the study watershed is more variable, containing mixtures of urban, agricultural, and forested land. In contrast, future land use is projected to be more uniformly urban, leading to a less variable but greater overall degree of hydrologic disturbance.
   Two effects of urbanization on fish are explored through ecological modeling: effects of streambed disturbance on food availability and effects of stream temperature on spawning. We tabulate food availability as a function of bed-mobility for 30 different fish species. We show that additional stress occurs with additional urbanization of the watershed. We show that the urban-related increase in stream temperatures may cause several warm-water species to actually gain opportunities to spawn in some cases. However, combining food availability and spawning day availability into a single index reveals highly stressful conditions for all fish species under the fully developed scenario.

AB  - Using methods of discontinuous deformation analysis and finite element (DDA+FEM), this paper simulates dynamic processes of the Tangshan earthquake of 1976, which occurred in the northern North China where its internal blocks apparently interacted. Studies focus upon both the movement and deformation of the blocks, in particular, the Ordos block, and variations of stress states on the boundary faults. The Tangshan earthquake was composed of three events: slipping motions of NNE-striking major fault, NE-striking fault near the northeastern end of the NNE-striking fault, and NW-striking fault on the southeastern side of the NNE-striking fault. Compared with previous studies, our model yields a result that is more agreeable with the configuration of aftershock distributions. A number of data are presented, such as the principle stress field during the earthquake, contours of the maximum shear stress, the strike-slip deformation between blocks near the earthquake focus, time-dependent variations of slips of earthquake-triggered faulting, the maximum slip distance, and stress drops. These results are in accord with the earthquake source mechanism, basic parameters from earthquake wave study, macro-isoseismic line, observed horizontal displacement vectors, etc. The Tangshan earthquake exerted different influences on the adjacent blocks and boundary faults between them, thus resulting in differential movement and deformation. The Ordos block seems to have experienced the small-scale counterclockwise rotation and deformation, but its northeast part, bounded on the east by the Taihangshan and on the north by the Yanshan and Yinshan belts, underwent relatively stronger deformation. The Tangshan earthquake also changed the stress state of boundary faults of the North China, leading to an increase in shear stress and a decrease in normal stress in the NW-trending Zhangjiakou-Penglai fault through Tangshan City and the northern border faults of the Ordos block, and therefore raises the potential risk of earthquake occurrence. This result is supported by the facts that a series of Ms greater than or equal to 6 earthquakes took place at the northern margin of the Ordos block after the Tangshan earthquake.

TI  - Climate change, so what? Implications for ground movement and landslide event frequency in the Ventnor Undercliff, Isle of Wight
T2  - LANDSLIDES AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
LA  - English
CP  - International Conference on Landslides and Climate Change
AB  - The town of Ventnor is located on the south coast of the Isle of Wight in an area of ancient coastal landslides known as the Undercliff. The ancient landslide complex is marginally stable and has been subject to ground movement and occasional landslide events in some locations causing significant damage to property and infrastructure. Since 1992, the local authority has made a significant investment in real-time monitoring and analysis of hydrogeological data at key sites, which has considerably advanced understanding about the relationships between climate and ground behaviour response. These data reveal close relationships between antecedent rainfall conditions, groundwater levels and ground movement rates, confirming that prolonged periods of heavy rainfall and associated elevated groundwater levels are a fundamental trigger of ground movement and landslide events. Latest climate change predictions point to significant increases in winter rainfall frequency, intensity and amount, drier summers and rising sea level which are likely to prove particularly challenging in terms of managing ground instability in the Undercliff. The implications of climate change predictions for the Undercliff are both spatial and temporal; firstly, there are concerns that hitherto marginally stable areas of the Undercliff may become unstable due to reactivation of ground movement and the occurrence of new landslides, secondly, in areas previously affected by ground movement or landslides, the frequency and rate of ground movement and landsliding is expected to increase. The paper presents historical and contemporary data to demonstrate the relationships between rainfall and ground movement and uses these to project the likely impacts of climate change predictions on the future stability of the Undercliff. The paper concludes that climate change poses a very real and significant challenge to the future management of the Undercliff and other similarly marginally stable ancient landslides in southern Britain.

AB  - Hyperextension of the head can cause injury to the vessels at the base of the brain. These lacerations are believed to be caused by stretching of the vessels due to the abrupt movement of the head and rotational acceleration of the brain within the cranium, and they usually occur in the intracranial portions of the vessels, producing a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is the case of a 35-year-old man who received a blow to the face that forcefully hyperextended and rotated his head to the left. Autopsy revealed an intracranial right internal carotid laceration extending from a calcified atherosclerotic plaque. This unusual injury may be due to a combination of blunt force applied to the head and the alteration of the vessel's structural and functional capacities secondary to atherosclerosis.

The tectonics as well as seismotectonics of Dahshour area is investigated. Three seismogenic faults that trend E-W, NW-SE and NE-SW affect the area. All these faults are normal faults; tensional stresses are predominant. The results obtained from the GPS measurements show significant horizontal movements during the period of observation about 8mm/year. The observed horizontal movements are comparable with the tensional stress obtained by fault plane solutions of earthquakes. The extensional and compressional strains are estimated to be +0.4 and -0.2 microstrain/y.

AB  - Before European settlement, 23% of Illinois (3.2 million of 14 million ha) was covered by wetlands. It is estimated that 90% of those wetlands Were lost during conversion of the landscape to agriculture and urban, use. Champaign County was one of the most extensively drained counties in Illinois, with 39-60% of original county area estimated to have been drained. Current and future efforts to conserve and restore wetlands would benefit from information on the number and distribution of former wetlands. We used GIS to estimate the spatial extent, density, pattern, and sizes of former and extant depressional wetlands in Champaign County. We derived several models of former wetlands; all models used hydric soils but varied by using Digital Raster Graphics (DRG), 30-m Digital Elevation Models (DEM), or Digital Orthophotography Quarter Quadrangles (DOQ). We also combined the DRG and DEM models, and we conducted visual field surveys for saturated or ponded conditions to test the models. The DRG model was conservative: it identified fewer and larger wetlands than the DEM model (the DOQ model was judged inadequate). Depending on the model selected, we estimated that 1077-4090 depressional wetlands formerly existed in the county, and that 78.6-91.6% were drained, accounting for 1108-2777 ha of lost wetland habitat in Champaign County alone. Thus, depressional wetlands accounted for the vast majority of historical wetland loss and should be a priority for wetland restoration efforts. Spatial pattern among wetlands also changed: an organism adapted to the former landscape had >50% probability of reaching another wetland within 260 m: today that same species faces a 7.8% probability at that distance. The modern landscape of Champaign County (and others like it) poses potential risk for remaining wetland metapopulations, and GIS models of precise former wetlands locations can be a valuable initial tool for wetland conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Federalism involves allocation of powers between units of government at different geographic levels. In local areas, changes in relationships between units of government may be effected through incorporation or disincorporation, annexation, formation of new layers of government, or interjurisdictional agreements. It may be difficult for residents who seek change to achieve it through alteration of jurisdictional boundaries or intergovernmental hierarchical relationships, however, they may gain similar benefits through intrajurisdictional arrangements such as neighborhood organizations. Such strategies of change front within are common, however, in an interesting variation, failed efforts at forming new jurisdictions through secession from the City of Los Angeles have occurred during startup of a neighborhood program intended to give greater voice to subjurisdictional areas. The article examines this situation, suggesting that formation of intrajurisdictional units may operate as an alternative form of local federalism.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The availability of an automated external defibrillator (AED) can improve the outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). On June 1, 2000, Taipei City became the first city in Taiwan to equip emergency medical services personnel with AEDs. This study was conducted to assess the performance of the AED machine in detecting ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the population, and to assess operator performance in its use.
   Methods: AED use in OHCA patients was assessed over a 1-year period. Electrocardiography and voice records retrieved from AED data cards were analyzed. A shockable rhythm was defined as either VF or VT. AED machine performance was assessed based on the correct identification of these rhythms. Operator performance was evaluated according to American Heart Association guidelines.
   Results: A total of 978 AED rhythm analyses were obtained for 653 OHCA patients. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting shockable rhythms by the AED machine were 90.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3% to 93.3%) and 100% (95% CI, 99.5% to 100%), respectively. Sensitivity for coarse VF, fine VF, rapid VT, and slow VT was 97.5%, 74.2%, 63.6% and 60.0%, respectively. An AED was deployed in 18 non-OHCA patients and in 119 patients after they had been moved into the ambulance. Non-compliance with standard procedures occurred during AED use in 162 patients, including interference of movement by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in progress in 69, untimely machine turn-off in 49, leads fell off or disconnected in 33, failure of shock delivery after charge in 28, and interference of movement other than CPR in 22.
   Conclusions. This study found that the AED machine has high specificity and high sensitivity in detecting VF and VT, especially coarse VF. Efforts are needed to improve the timing of AED deployment and emergency medical technician compliance with standard procedures.

TI  - An object simulation model for modeling hypothetical disease epidemics - EpiFlex
T2  - THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING
LA  - English
AB  - Background: EpiFlex is a flexible, easy to use computer model for a single computer, intended to be operated by one user who need not be an expert. Its purpose is to study in-silico the epidemic behavior of a wide variety of diseases, both known and theoretical, by simulating their spread at the level of individuals contracting and infecting others. To understand the system fully, this paper must be read together in conjunction with study of the software and its results. EpiFlex is evaluated using results from modeling influenza A epidemics and comparing them with a variety of field data sources and other types of modeling.
   EpiFlex is an object-oriented Monte Carlo system, allocating entities to correspond to individuals, disease vectors, diseases, and the locations that hosts may inhabit. EpiFlex defines eight different contact types available for a disease. Contacts occur inside locations within the model. Populations are composed of demographic groups, each of which has a cycle of movement between locations. Within locations, superspreading is defined by skewing of contact distributions.
   Results: EpiFlex indicates three phenomena of interest for public health: (1) R-0 is variable, and the smaller the population, the larger the infected fraction within that population will be; (2) significant compression/synchronization between cities by a factor of roughly 2 occurs between the early incubation phase of a multi-city epidemic and the major manifestation phase; (3) if better true morbidity data were available, more asymptomatic hosts would be seen to spread disease than we currently believe is the case for influenza. These results suggest that field research to study such phenomena, while expensive, should be worthwhile.
   Conclusion: Since EpiFlex shows all stages of disease progression, detailed insight into the progress of epidemics is possible. EpiFlex shows the characteristic multimodality and apparently random variation characteristic of real world data, but does so as an emergent property of a carefully constructed model of disease dynamics and is not simply a stochastic system. EpiFlex can provide a better understanding of infectious diseases and strategies for response.

AB  - Marked elevation of dioxin associated with the herbicide Agent Orange was recently found in 19 of 20 blood samples from persons living in Bien Hoa, a large city in southern Vietnam. This city is located near an air base that was used for Agent Orange spray missions between 1962 and 1970. A spill of Agent Orange occurred at this air base more than 30 years before blood samples were collected in 1999. Samples were collected, frozen, and sent to a World Health Organization-certified dioxin laboratory fm congener-specific analysis as part of a Vietnam Red Cross project. Previous analyses of more than 2200 pooled blood samples collected in the 1990s identified Bien Hoa as one of several southern Vietnam areas with persons having elevated blood dioxin levels from exposure to Agent Orange. In sharp contrast to this study, our previous research showed decreasing tissue dioxin levels over time since 1970. Only the dioxin that contaminated Agent Orange, 2,3, 7, 8-tetrachlmodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was elevated in the blood of 19 of 20 persons sampled from Bien Hoa. A comparison pooled sample from 100 residents of Hanoi, where Agent Orange was not used, measured blood TCDD levels of 2 parts per trillion (ppt). TCDD levels of up to 271 ppt, a 135-fold increase, were found in Bien Hoa residents. TCDD contamination was also found in some nearby soil and sediment samples. Persons new to this region and children born after Agent Orange spraying ended also had elevated TCDD levels. This TCDD uptake was recent and occurred decades after spraying ended. We hypothesize that a major route of current and past exposures is from the movement of dioxin from soil into river sediment, then into fish, and from fish consumption into people.

AB  - Homosexual culture has existed for several millennia, but due to the awkward plight of homosexuality in the society, the literary works reflecting such a phenomenon have long been concealed from the public view in the United States. It is in the recent half a century that American gay literature has attracted general attention. An examination of the process of its evolution reveals two turning points. The first one came about in the, mid-1950s, when the two treatises Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female were published. These two books by Alfred Kinsey provided scientific evidence for the fighting of gays and lesbians for equal rights. Meanwhile various literary works depicting homosexuality emerged, including The City and the Pillar, a novel by Gore Vidal. The second turning point occurred in 1969, when a riot broke out at Stonewall Bar in New York City, an event leading American gay literature out of the shadow of the Cold War ideology. The rebellion gave rise to the Gay Liberation Movement and ushered in the "coming-out" narrative represented by Rita Mae Brown's novel Rubyfruit Jungle. The emergent narrative in American literary circles cast off the way homosexuality had been relegated to a morbid mental or physiological state. By disintegrating the traditional portrayal of homosexuals as the "other," a myth enforced by the mainstream of the society, this new approach negated the binary mode of thought which regards heterosexuality and homosexuality as two identities entirely contrary to each other and mutually incompatible. These two turning-points had a far-reaching impact on America gay literature, marking its liberation first in theory and then in practice. However, homosexual literature has never been accepted by the mainstream of the American society, and the liberation it has won is no more than a freedom from the kind of persecution it suffered in the McCarthy Era.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION
LA  - English
KW  - ETHIOPIAN JEWS
KW  - CHILD
AB  - The way categories, labels, and taxonomies are used depends upon national ideologies and nationally specific conceptions of citizenship and normality. Ethnicity, differences, disability and deviance are social constructions. Underachievement or overachievement in social (cognitive) performance or overrepresentation in special educational placements of certain groups of students is as much the product of categorisation or definitional processes as it is the workings of institutional procedures, patterns, and intransigence. In particular, schools' inability to accommodate difference and diversity causes exclusion and alienation. Globalisation and hegemonic neo-liberal ideology make it difficult to create a genuinely inclusive society, to produce complete citizens, and to promote equity. This study analyses the placement of ethnic minority students in special education programmes. It begins with a review of empirical reports that problematise the phenomenon of overrepresentation of students with immigrant background in special schools for intellectually disabled students. The analysis that follows is conducted through the prism of a number of perspectives, including sociocultural/historical theory, the inclusive education movement, multicultural education, and critical pedagogical theories. While there is no evidence to suggest that such overrepresentation is nationwide, the phenomenon can be identified in large cities where there are concentrations of immigrants. Analysis demonstrates that the problem is related to, among other factors, unreliable assessment procedures and criteria for referral and placement; lack of culturally sensitive diagnostic tools; the static nature of tests, including embedded cultural bias; sociocultural problems, family factors, and language problems; lack of parental participation in decision-making; power differentials between parents and school authorities; institutional intransigence and prejudices; and large resource inequalities that run along lines of race and class.

AB  - Globalization is a key context for the study of social determinants of health (SDH): broadly stated, SDH are the conditions in which people live and work, and that affect their opportunities to lead healthy lives.
   In the first article in this three part series, we described the origins of the series in work conducted for the Globalization Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health and in the Commission's specific concern with health equity. We identified and defended a definition of globalization that gives primacy to the drivers and effects of transnational economic integration, and addressed a number of important conceptual and methodological issues in studying globalization's effects on SDH and their distribution, emphasizing the need for transdisciplinary approaches that reflect the complexity of the topic.
   In this second article, we identify and describe several, often interacting clusters of pathways leading from globalization to changes in SDH that are relevant to health equity. These involve: trade liberalization; the global reorganization of production and labour markets; debt crises and economic restructuring; financial liberalization; urban settings; influences that operate by way of the physical environment; and health systems changed by the global marketplace.

AB  - The distribution of the North American P group of Heterobasidion annosum s.l., recently reported from a Pinus pinea forest in the surroundings of Rome, was studied using mating tests and DNA fingerprinting (mitochondrial DNA, random amplified microsatellite technique and two group-specific markers). This fungus is present in several forests and small plantations along the Tyrrhenian coast of the Italian peninsula, within an area approximately 100 km long, extending from Fregene in the north to the National Park of Circeo in the south, and 27 km wide including the city of Rome. In pine forests of Castelporziano, Castel Fusano and Anzio, where US troops resided during the Second World War, the North American P group is more frequent than the European P group. The low number of mating alleles in the Italian population of the North American P group supports the hypothesis of its origin from a small number of introductions. The near 100% sexual compatibility between the North American and European P groups, together with inconsistencies in results obtained with different identification methods of these groups, suggests that hybridization between the North American and European P populations occurs occasionally.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between B. tulipae- and B. cinerea-induced Botrytis disease of tulip plants and the conidial densities in the air of an experimental field at Ibaraki University as well as of a tulip orchard in Kasumigaura Park (Tuchiura city, Ibaraki) in 2003. For two years prior to this investigation, the park was the focus of research, while the experimental field was cultivated with tulips for the first time. The dispersal of B. cinerea spores commenced in the early stages of tulip growth, while that of B. tulipae began just before flowering. For both Botrytis species, the number of dispersed spores increased with tulip plant growth. Differences in the development of Botrytis disease (formation of blight lesions) were observed between the two research sites. Numerous blight lesions formed on the leaves throughout the growth period of plants grown in the park. However, in the experimental field, relatively few lesions were observed and these occurred in the latter periods of growth, At both research sites, only B. tulipae was isolated from these lesions. Unlike in 2001 and 2002, when B. cinerea was isolated from the lesions, this fungus was not detected at either of the research sites in 2003.

AB  - According to accident statistics for Taiwan, the two most common traffic accident locations in urban areas are roadway segments and intersections. On roadway segments, most collisions are due to drivers not noticing the status of leading vehicle. At intersections, most collisions are due to the other driver failing to obey traffic signs. Using a driving simulator equipped with a collision warning system, this study investigated driving performance at different accident locations and between different alarm contents, and identified the relationship between crash occurrences and driving performance. Thirty participants, aged 20-29 years, were recruited in this study. Driving performance measures were perception-reaction time, movement-reaction time, speed and a crash. Experimental results indicated that due to different demands for processing information under different traffic conditions, driving performance differed at the two traffic accident locations. On a roadway segment, perception-reaction time for a beep was shorter than the time for a speech message. Nevertheless, at an intersection, a speech message was a great help to drivers and, thus, perception-reaction time was effectively reduced. In addition, logistic regression analysis indicates that perception-movement time had the greatest influence on crash occurrence. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increases in the number and size of enclaves of the new immigrant groups from Latin America and Asia during the 1980s have changed the ethnic composition of many American cities. I have classified primary and secondary enclave networks for each immigrant country of origin in order to examine changes in the geographic concentration of immigrants. First I calculated the Duncan index of dissimilarity for immigrants relative to natives at the metropolitan area level. I then use individual-level data to follow immigrant cohorts over time in order to examine how time in the United States is associated with movements from primary enclaves to other geographic areas in the immigrant networks. There is movement from the primary enclave to the periphery of the primary enclave, to areas of smaller groupings of immigrants from the same country of origin, and to areas that do not have large groupings of immigrants from the same country. It is significant that many of these changes in location occur quite late in the assimilation process.

AB  - The southern part of erstwhile Dhanushkodi township, Tamil Nadu, experienced subsidence and submergence during AD 1948-49. Shallow bathymetric and side-scan surveys together with sampling and underwater videography confirm the extent and quantum of subsidence. The studies reveal that a vertical tectonic movement (fault) parallel to the coastline with a displacement of similar to 5 m led to the subsidence of the southern part of the township. This fault movement has occurred 57 years ago and hence could be the latest neo-tectonic movement ever recorded along the east coast of India.

AB  - In recent years, closed circuit cameras have become a common feature of urban life. There are environments however where the movement of people needs to be monitored but high resolution imaging is not necessarily desirable: rooms where privacy is required and the occupants are not comfortable with the perceived intrusion. Examples might include domiciliary care environments, prisons and other secure facilities, and even large open plan offices. This paper discusses algorithms' that allow activity within this type of sensitive environment to be monitored using data from low resolution cameras (ones where all objects of interest are sub-pixel and cannot be resolved) and other non-intrusive sensors. The algorithms are based on techniques originally developed for wide area reconnaissance and surveillance applications. Of particular importance is determining the minimum spatial resolution that is required to provide a specific level of coverage and reliability.

AB  - The Indonesian occupation (1975-99) of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor was one of the most brutal in postwar history. Yet, despite the heavy Indonesian military presence, the East Timorese population was able to wage a highly effective resistance struggle. The emergence of an Indonesian-educated or 'new' generation was crucial here, enabling the development of an urban-based clandestine front which worked closely with the armed guerrillas in the mountains, and with the international solidarity movement and East Timorese diplomatic campaign overseas. Their knowledge of Indonesia and fluency in the Indonesian language, however, set them apart from the older - pre-1975 - Portuguese-educated generation, sparking political tensions which are still being worked out in post-independence East Timor.

AB  - Minor movements - of the order of 10 cm - of earth surface often precede landslides. Interferometric techniques have a potential of detecting such movements before a landslide occurs. An interferometric quantity - called triherence - was adopted for mapping of points where the interferometric phase is stable over at least one triplet consisting of three consecutive SAR scenes in suitable interferometric conditions. The results from JERS and ASAR triplets of the two study sites suggest that the triherence measure enables to pick up some points in the landscape where the phase behaviour of SAR pixels is stable. Most of the stable points were identified in urban areas but many of them can also be found in natural areas. The initial hypothesis, that in case of sparse vegetation or sparse forest cover, some highly coherent scatterers might be found, seems to be pertinent even if it still needs to be thoroughly checked on the ground.

AB  - The paper addresses the main uncertainties associated with the occurrence of rainfall induced landslides, Spatial variability of site conditions, local geology and rainfall contributes significantly to the uncertainty of landslide hazard. Urban landslide problems require the management of slopes of marginal stability. Assessment of hazard, vulnerability and risk require the use of observational approaches, the analysis of rainfall data and the relationship between rainfall magnitudes on the one hand and slope movement on the other. Details of research carried out in the Illawarra. area of New South Wales, Australia are provided. Reference is made to the comprehensive database enabling the determination of landslide frequencies. The concept of antecedent rainfall percentage exceedence time (ARPET) is explained. The use of inferred threshold rainfall magnitudes for real-time prediction and warning is explained. Uncertainties concerned with this approach are explored with particular reference to rainfall distributions in the study area.

AB  - The arcoid bivalve Anadara trapezia (Deshayes, 1840) is a eurythermal estuarine mollusc that flourishes at present in eastern Australia between Port Phillip Bay, Victoria and Townsville in northern Queensland. A. trapezia first appeared in the Australian Quaternary fossil record during Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 7. In New Zealand, where it is now extinct, the earliest known occurrences are in the Rangitawa "fossil beds" and in uppermost Castlecliffian strata west of Wanganui, North Island (OIS Il, ca. 400 ka). The species had an extensive distribution during the Last Interglacial Maximum (OIS 5e) in both Australia and New Zealand and appears to have had a slightly wider than present geographic range in southeastern Australia during the Middle Holocene, as shown by records from Tasmania and western Victoria, where it no longer lives. Apart from an isolated population inhabiting Oyster Harbour, Western Australia,A. trapezia has not been confirmed living in coastal waters west of Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. It became extinct in New Zealand sometime after OIS 5e. The extensive distribution and abundance of A. trapezia and other fauna of subtropical affinity during the Last Interglacial Maximum, in areas where both are now extinct, appears to be associated with an enhanced Leeuwin Current at that time, coinciding with higher, less seasonally concentrated levels of precipitation and river discharge. The arrival of A. trapezia in Australasian coastal waters may have been a consequence of planktonic dispersal from southern South America. A. bravardi del Rio, from the Middle Miocene Puerto Madryn Formation, on the Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, may be a possible ancestor for A. trapezia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Monitoring forest cover change and understanding the dynamic of forest cover is increasingly important in sustainable development and management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor forest cover change in Macka State Forest Enterprise (MSFE) located in NE of Turkey through 1975 to 2000 and then analyses spatial and temporal changes in forest cover by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and FRAGSTATS (TM). Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using RS and GIS. The results showed that total forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area increased while broadleaf forest area and non forest area decreased. Mixed forest and degraded forest increased during the first (1975-1987) period, but decreased during the second (1987-2000) period. During the whole study period, the annual forestation rate was 152 ha year(-1), equivalent to 0.27% year(-1) using the compound-interest-rate formula. The total number of patches increased from 36,204 to 48,092 (33%), and mean size of forest patch (MPS) decreased from 2.8 ha to 2.1 ha during a 25 year period. Number of smaller patches (patches in 0-100 ha size class) increased, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. While total population increased from 1975 to 2000 (3.7%), rural population constantly decreased. The increase of forest areas may well be explained by the fact that demographic movement of rural areas concentrated into Macka City Center. These figures also indicated that decrease in the rural population might likely lead to the release of human pressure to forest areas, probably resulting in a positive development of forest areas.

AB  - Resident Canada geese (Branta canadensis) nest or reside in the temperate latitudes of North America. In past years, translocation-the capture and subsequent release of geese at distant locations-has been used to establish resident goose populations and to reduce nuisance problems. However, with new special hunting seasons designed to target resident Canada geese, we can now evaluate translocation as a management tool when hunting is allowed at release sites. We selected 2 study sites, representative of urban and suburban locations with nuisance resident geese, in central and western New York, USA. In June 2003, we translocated 80 neck-banded adult geese, 14 radiomarked adult females, and 83 juveniles 150 km east and southwest from urban and suburban problem sites in western New York to state-owned Wildlife Management Areas. At these same capture sites, we used 151 neck-banded adult geese, 12 radiomarked females, and 100 juveniles as controls to compare dispersal movements and harvest vulnerability to translocated geese. All observations (n = 45) of translocated radiomarked geese were < 20 km from release sites, in areas where hunting was permitted. Only 25 of 538 observations (4.60%) of radiomarked geese at control sites were in areas open to hunting. The remainder of observations occurred at nonhunting locations within 10 km of control sites. More translocated adult geese (23.8%) were harvested than control geese (6.6%; chi(2) = 12,98, P = 0.0009). More translocated juvenile geese were harvested (22.9%) than juvenile controls (5.0%; chi(2) = 12.30, P = 0.0005). Only 7 (8.8%) translocated adult geese returned to the original capture sites during Canada goose hunting seasons. Translocation of adult and juvenile geese in family groups may alleviate nuisance problems at conflict sites through increased harvest, reducing the number of birds returning in subsequent years.

AB  - New highways are pervasive, pernicious threats to stream ecosystems because of their short- and long-term physical, chemical, and biological impacts. Unfortunately, standard environmental impact statements (EISs) and environmental assessments (EAs)focus narrowly on the initial direct impacts of construction and ignore other long-term indirect impacts. More thorough consideration of highway impacts, and, ultimately, better land use decisions may be facilitated by conceptualizing highway development in three stages: initial highway construction, highway presence, and eventual landscape urbanization. Highway construction is characterized by localized physical disturbances, which generally subside through time. In contrast, highway presence and landscape urbanization are characterized by physical and chemical impacts that are temporally persistent. Although the impacts of highway presence and landscape urbanization are of similar natures, the impacts are of a greater magnitude and more widespread in the urbanization phase. Our review reveals that the landscape urbanization stage is clearly the greatest threat to stream habitat and biota, as stream ecosystems are sensitive to even low levels (< 10%) of watershed urban development. Although highway construction is ongoing, pervasive, and has severe biological consequences, we found few published investigations of its impacts on Streams. Researchers know little about the occurrence, loading rates, and biotic responses to specific contaminants in highway runoff. Also needed is a detailed understanding of how highway crossings, especially culverts, affect fish populations via constraints on movement and how highway networks alter natural regimes (e.g., streamflow, temperature). Urbanization research topics that may yield especially useful results include a) the relative importance and biological effects of specific components of urban development-e.g., commercial or residential, b) the scenarios under which impacts are reversible; and c) the efficacy of mitigation measures-e.g., stormwater retention or treatment and forested buffers.

AB  - In Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, ethnic diversity and multiculturalism have been recognized in the last decade in both official discourse and the constitution. This change results in part from efforts by civil society and the political and scientific communities to highlight the condition of minorities, and the segregation and discrimination to which they are exposed, The south-west region of the country and its metropolis, Cali, with large Afro-Colombian and, to a lesser degree, indigenous populations, are central to this problem. Drawing on a survey carried out in Cali in 1998, this article examines the question of the measurement and analysis of racial segmentation and its relationship with spatial and social mobility. It suggests that in the context of a mixed race society. the phenotypic categories of ordinary language can be used to study the complex relationships between social and racial inequality, while analysis of residential locations and urban socio-economic living conditions, and of the perceptions and opinions of survey members, are the basis for an initial assessment of the situations of segregation and discrimination in Cali. The survey also reveals the strong heterogeneity of this population, closely linked to its diverse geographical origins and to the variety of historical and economic migration contexts. Finally, using logistic regression analysis of replies to questions on ethnic and phenotypic self-awareness. the article examines the determinants of the recently-emerged Afro-Colombian consciousness movement, which has led to a reconsideration of the position of blacks in Colombia's mixed race society.

AB  - This paper aims to meet part of the dynamics surrounding the Italian immigration to the region of state of Goias. This process is part of a movement of desterritorialization that had its start in Italy of the nineteenth century culminating with a new territory in a region known today as Mato Grosso de Goias, where they settled and founded the city of Nova Veneza. Thus, we intend to examine the way in which the integration of Italian immigrants in Nova Veneza occurred. For that, we used, broadly, the use of oral sources with the memory as the leitmotif of the whole process. The focus has been under the cultural geography taking into account the memories that the pioneers and their descendants report as evidence of life and the representations that their make of yours stories. In this study we sought rescue data from Italian culture, conveyed through reports of memories. We emphasized, however, one family in particular, that of Mr. Julho Eloy, making thus, a case study.

AB  - This article is a study of global athletic labor migration that examines the mechanisms through which some athletic migrant workers are recruited. The article adopts a critical case study which analyses the movement of Canadian workers into Britain's Elite Ice Hockey League ( EIHL) and synthesizes concepts derived from the sociology of sport and the sociology of highly skilled migration to explain these movements. Using a theoretical framework based on a figurational or process sociological approach, the article shows that the recruitment of migrant workers to EIHL teams need not be facilitated by a formal mediator such as an agent. Instead, informal communicative " friends- of- friends" networks and " bridgehead" contacts more commonly facilitate flows of information to the potential employer and potential migrant employee. Accordingly, mutually beneficial recruitments can be seen to be occurring as the result of human mediation facilitated by a series of informal interdependent networks of social relationships.

AB  - I review the existing literature on habitat fragmentation and its effects on avian populations in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitat in coastal southern California. Included in this review is a consideration of the effect of fragmentation on nest predators, brood parasites, food availability, and habitat structure and quality. Fragmentation and the creation of edge are extensive in this region. The primary contemporary fragmenting land-use is residential development. In comparison to forested landscapes in the East and Midwest, fragmentation in this region seems to cause more isolation in bird populations. Local extinctions in isolated habitat fragments are common among some species of the shrub habitat avifauna and colonizations are relatively rare. This difference may be due to more limited dispersal ability in the year-round residents that are characteristic of this region as compared to the long-distance migrants in the East and Midwest. Perhaps due to the semi-arid nature of the region, fragmentation may be accompanied by more habitat degradation than in mesic regions, which could contribute to the lack of successful colonization. In contrast to studies in the East and Midwest, the only demographic study of avian edge effects in this system indicates that nest predation and brood parasitism do not increase near anthropogenically-induced edges. In isolated habitat fragments mammalian mesopredators appear to undergo "mesopredator release" in the absence of coyotes (Canis latrans). In habitat fragments the availability of potential arthropod prey is positively related to fragment size and negatively related to fragment age, but does not appear to be a function of distance to edge. In large habitat blocks, however, the abundance of a number of arthropod taxa is lower near edges. A particularly striking edge effect is the invasion of non-native Argentine ants along urban edges. The effect of Argentine ants on native ants is severe but their effect on arthropods that are more important as avian prey is less clear.

TI  - Contradictions in Dam Building in Yunnan, China: Cultural Impacts versus Economic Growth
T2  - CHINA REPORT
LA  - English
AB  - When choosing the site of a dam, meeting the needs of the resettled local communities should be a key criterion in making any decision to build a dam. On the basis of a pilot study in Yunnan, China, this article finds that neither displacement into the area surrounding the dam nor movement to other towns, can meet the needs of the communities displaced by dams. This is because: (a) ideal areas for dam building often do not coincide with the factors necessary to restore the economy of the resettlement communities; and (b) cultural diversity exacerbates the impacts of displacement by a dam. It is concluded that overcoming the limitations of the contradictions between dam construction and resettlement is difficult. More work is needed on the resettlements in Yunnan. The cultural dimensions should be taken into consideration before further decisions on dam building and resettlement are made.

AB  - Mass movements and earthquakes represent two major geological hazards in the municipal territory of Caramanico Terme (south-central Apennines). Available records revealed the contemporaneous occurrence of earthquakes and slope failures on four occasions in the last four centuries (1627, 1706, 1933, and 1984). These events, with local intensities ranging from VI to IX, generated mass movements varying from a rotational slope failure to rock:block falls, All occurred in the southern periphery of the town and involved a thick carbonate megabreccia caprock and coarse colluvia which overlie a clayey substratum. Field investigation and review of historical records helped to delimit the areas susceptible to seismically triggered rockfalls. The mapping of historic and pre-historic rockfall deposits revealed their dispersal patterns and provided the basis for a determination of potential hazard zones. We approximate the temporal hazard assessment by relating the rockfall occurrence to the probability of earthquake triggering, Considering the VI degree triggering threshold indicated by local historical data, the statistical analysis of the regional seismic activity shows that events capable of inducing rockfalls have an approximately decennial recurrence in Caramanico. The approach presented could be readily applied to other potential risk areas of Italy by exploiting the rich long-term record of historical seismicity. In general, temporal hazard estimates at relatively low intensity levels will be possible even where the seismic history of the site is only well documented for a relatively limited time interval, provided that this interval is much longer than the recurrence time of the events exceeding the threshold considered.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that competitive asymmetries are causing the hybrid zones between hermit and Townsend's warblers to move, such that Townsend's warblers are replacing hermit warblers. Here we examine the contribution of male aggression to this competitive asymmetry by measuring aggressive responses to mounts. We presented male mounts of the two parental species to Townsend's and hermit warblers outside the zone and to hybrids within the zone. Outside the zone, Townsend's males are more aggressive to both conspecific and heterospecific mounts than are hermit males. This asymmetry should move the zone in the direction inferred from previous studies. Hybrids fall between parentals in their aggressiveness, which should accelerate the movement of the zone. Remarkably, we found no relationship between phenotype and aggression in individual males at a locality within the hybrid zone. The forces of selection and dispersal that maintain narrow hybrid zones should generate such a correlation if aggressive differences between the parental species are genetically controlled. We resolve this conflict by proposing a behavioral model of competitive sorting within localities. If birds are sorted across the hybrid zone according to competitive abilities, and competitive interactions within neighborhoods are more or less complete, then the correlation between phenotype and aggression within any given neighborhood will be eliminated. We tested this model by examining the relationship between phenotype and aggression across the zone. Warblers in hybrid neighbor-hoods on the Townsend's side of the zone are more aggressive than warblers in hybrid neighborhoods on the hermit side, indicating that competitive sorting is occurring.

AB  - Historic records indicate that structures built in and around the two harbours of Alexandria, Egypt, were periodically damaged by powerful events such as earthquakes and tsunamis. This geoarchaeological study reveals that human activity in nearshore and port settings has also triggered sediment deformation and construction failure. Analysis of radiocarbon-dated Holocene cores and submerged archaeological excavations record a significant incidence of sediment destabilization and mass movement in the ports since human occupation in the V millennium B.C. Anthropogenic substrate failure is documented from about the time of the city's founding by the Greeks in the 4(th) century B.C. to the present. Construction on unconsolidated sediment substrates was a factor of sediment destabilization, at times in conjunction with earthquakes, storm waves and tsunamis. Engineer reports on port construction during the past century, however, show substrate failure can also occur by building and other human activity, independently of high-energy natural events. Some recent failure and associated mass flows in the harbours were triggered by loading effects associated with emplacement of large structures on weak, water-saturated substrates. Slumps, debris flows and mudflows, initiated by substrate destabilization, caused lateral displacement of sediment and construction debris for tens of meters away from construction sites. Human-induced processes that triggered sediment failure in the ports from Greek to recent time are not likely to be unique to this sector, and findings here may help explain how some sites in coastal settings elsewhere were submerged.

AB  - Dengue fever recently reemerged in the Americas. Because vaccines are still under development, dengue prevention depends entirely on vector control. Since Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is the principal vector of this arbovirus, knowledge of the genetic structure of the insect is therefore required to maintain effective vector control strategies and to estimate levels of gene flow from which movement can be inferred. This preliminary study uses microsatellite and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, to provide insights into genetic diversity of A. aegypti populations from different districts of two towns, located in the north-west of Mexico. Hermosillo and Guaymas. Although the microsatellites used were found to display limited polymorphism, they allowed discrimination between mosquitoes from the northern and the southern districts of Hermosillo. Using AFLP markers, clustering of individuals from the same town and from the same district was observed. Data from microsatllite and AFLP markers analysis both suggest that reinvasion of A. aergypti probably occurs from Guaymas to Hermosillo. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We used stable isotope analysis to derive trophic relationships and movement patterns for components of the western Lake Superior food web. Trophic linkages implied by previous gut content studies were only marginally supported by stable isotope data. Siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet) were the top predators, and trophic overlap between siscowet and lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) was low. Exotic Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) occupied a lower trophic position than native piscivores because the latter relied more on coregonids. To evaluate spatial heterogeneity of the food web, we assumed that the adjacent cities of Duluth and Superior (DS) were a point source of N-15, and we measured isotopes of organisms close to and far from DS. Slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) were enriched in the DS area relative to other sites, implying that they are relatively sedentary. Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) showed no differences at any sites, implying high vagility. Other organisms showed differences that could not be attributed to DS, implying that other mechanisms, such as trophic ontogeny, were influencing their isotopic signatures.

TI  - A new, comprehensive normative database of lumbar spine ranges of motion
T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
LA  - English
AB  - Aims and objectives: To generate gender-specific and broadly based age-related indices for normative lumbar ranges of motion for all planes of movement.
   Design: This was a repeated measures prospective study of spinal range of motion in a sample of volunteer subjects utilizing a portable modified CA6000 Spine Motion Analyzer (Orthopedic Systems Inc., Union City, CA, USA).
   Setting: Data collection was carried out in a variety of community locations including fire, police and ambulance stations, offices and community centres.
   Subjects: A total of 405 asymptomatic subjects (196 female, 209 male) were recruited, aged 16-90 years, from sedentary, mixed and physically demanding occupations.
   Methodology: Indices of lumbar spine ranges of motion were measured in standing following a standardized protocol for sagittal flexion/extension, coronal lateral flexion and horizontal axial rotation movements.
   Results: Male and female normative flexion ranges declined by approximately 40% (72-40 degrees) across the age spectrum. Extension declined the greatest, by approximately 76% (29-6 degrees) overall. In lateral flexion male and female ranges declined approximately 43% (29-15 degrees) in each direction (total 58-30 degrees). In axial rotation no age-related decline was observed and ranges of motion remained at approximately 7 degrees in each direction (total 14 degrees) across all the ages of the subject group.
   Conclusions: Data have been generated that provide comprehensive, gender-specific, broadly based and age-related indices for normative lumbar ranges of motion in all planes of movement. These are applicable to individuals throughout adult life, from adolescence through to old age.

CP  - Conference on Study of African American Problems
AB  - In The Philadelphia Negro, W.E.B. Du Bois presented a four-class typology of the black community. Today the situation has changed greatly. The enormous social changes of the twentieth century, culminating in the civil rights movement and followed by civil disorders occurring on a wide scale in urban America, resulted in attempts by the wider society to incorporate black Americans through federally mandated social programs such as affirmative action, fair housing legislation, set-asides, and major civil rights legislation. These initiatives helped to defuse much of the tension of the 1960s, but they also set the stage for much greater black participation in American society, leading to tremendous growth in the black middle class. At the same time, these measures of black incorporation, as realized over the past 30 years, have greatly changed the traditional castelike system of race relations. In conjunction with deindustrialization and the simultaneous growth of the global economy, these changes have contributed to a more complex class configuration among blacks.

AB  - This review summarizes studies on the epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori published in peer-reviewed journals between April 2007 and March 2008. Infection with H. pylori often occurs in childhood, and once established, can persist lifelong if untreated. Prevalence of H. pylori infection is higher in developing countries when compared to developed countries, and can vary by ethnicity, place of birth, and socioeconomic factors even among persons living in the same country. Prevalence of infection is decreasing in many countries due to improvements in sanitation and living standards and the relatively recent movement of populations from rural to urban settings; however, post-treatment recurrence rates of H. pylori infection remain high in developing countries, and in given populations within developed countries. In addition, a number of recent studies have begun to explore the possible link between childhood infection with H. pylori and protection against asthma and allergy.

KW  - RESPONDENT ATTRITION
KW  - PARTICIPATION
KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - Birth to Ten now Birth to Twenty (BT20), is the largest and longest running longitudinal birth cohort study in Africa. In this paper, the methods, magnitude and significance of recruitment, follow-up and attrition are described. Although more than 5000 births were notified in the area in the 7-week enrolment period in early 1990, only 3275 children were established to have been born to women who were residents in the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan area for at least the first 6 months of the child's life. Seventy per cent of these children and their families have been followed up for more than 12 years, indicating an average attrition rate of less than 3% per annum, with most attrition occurring in the first 2 years of the study. The most common reason for attrition was movement out of the study area, although detailed follow-up, and the extent of contact re-established at later points, indicate very high levels of circular migration among women and young children between urban and rural areas, as well as very high levels of residential mobility within urban areas. There has been no differential loss of vulnerable families and children. African women living in Soweto are the most consistent participants in the study. A bias, by population group membership and residential area, was introduced in the recruitment phases of the project by the difficulty of enrolling the small proportion of people in the metropolis, largely Whites, who used private delivery services in 1989-90.

AB  - The heavy rains associated with Hurricane Mitch triggered off a number of slope instability processes in several Central American countries. Different instability processes have been acknowledged for the various mountainous regions of Nicaragua. An enormous movement of the Casita Volcano slopes resulted in numerous deaths and some deep movements have been reactivated. On the other hand, numerous shallow mass movements and debris flows have given rise to great material loss throughout a large part of Nicaraguan mountains. Mapping the shallow mass movements in an area of Central Nicaragua clearly reveals the close ties between their distribution and some geomorphological factors. A susceptibility model has been constructed for shallow mass movements based on field mapping of the shallow mass movement distribution, the geomorphological map as well as the digital slope and accumulated flow models. A logistical regression analysis was applied. The study area has been categorized into three classes of relative landslide susceptibility. Given that phenomena of this nature occur much more frequently in the high susceptibility class, 94% of the shallow mass movements that have been used to test the model are in the high and medium susceptibility classes . The geological and geomorphological conditions of the study area are representative of a large sector of the central Nicaraguan region. Consequently, the methodology followed in this paper is deemed to constitute a useful tool, both regarding the design of new infrastructures, and as a guide to the urban development of the area.

AB  - BFR burdens in abiotic media have been less studied than in biota. despite their essential value as an aide to identifying sources. temporal and geographic trends and exposure routes. Many polymer products consist of several percent by weight of BFRs. Global trade in these can result in rapid and wholesale BFR movement. Loss from ill-Use products of nonreactive BFRs may be important. particularly in respect to indoor exposure. In the case of BDE-209, discharges from publicly owned treatment Works may be substantial. BFR burdens in air, water and sewage sludge respond rapidly to changes in environmental BFR inputs. PBDEs have been the most widely studied. In many locales PBDE burdens in these media now surpass those of PCBs. Air and water near sources and urban areas are typically enriched relative to rural locales. The more volatile PBDEs dominate in the vapor phase, while BDE-209 typically predominates on particulates. Evidence exists for long-range transport of the more volatile PBDEs. A greater diversity of BFRs (mostly PBDEs, HBCD and TBBP-A) has been detected in sewage sludges. Land application Of these sludges oil agricultural fields is one conduit for soil contamination. In general, environmental concentrations of BDE-209 appear to be increasing. while perita-BDE burdens in Europe may have peaked. Sediments function as longer-term integrators of environmental burdens. Concentrations of common BFRs therein may be substantial near point sources. Evidence for debromination in the environment has been limited to date. However. some laboratory and field observations suggest it is possible to a limited extent. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Tipping point leadership
T2  - HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - When William Bratton was appointed police commissioner of New York City in 1994, turf wars over jurisdiction and funding were rife and crime was out of control. Yet in less than two years, and without an increase in his budget, Bratton turned New York into the safest large city in the nation. And the NYPD was only the latest of five law-enforcement agencies Bratton had turned around. In each case, he succeeded in record time despite limited resources, a demotivated staff, opposition from powerful vested interests, and an organization wedded to the status quo.
   Bratton's turnarounds demonstrate what the authors call tipping point leadership. The theory of tipping points hinges on the insight that in any organization, fundamental changes can occur quickly when the beliefs and energies of a critical mass of people create an epidemic movement toward an idea.
   Bratton begins by overcoming the cognitive hurdles that block organizations from recognizing the need for change. He does this by putting managers face-to-face with operational problems. Next, he manages around limitations on funds, staff, or equipment by concentrating resources on the areas that are most in need of change and that have the biggest payoffs. He meanwhile solves the motivation problem by singling out key influencers-people with disproportionate power due to their connections or persuasive abilities. Finally, he closes off resistance from powerful opponents.
   Not every CEO has the personality to be a Bill Bratton, but his successes are due to much more than his personality. He relies on a remarkably consistent method that any manager looking to turn around an organization can use to overcome the forces of inertia and reach the tipping point.

AB  - In Pacific Coastal States, especially in State of California, there is a subtle migration of families to suburbs as there is an influx of emigrants to the metropolitan areas. In this movement of people, population of small towns and cities are increasing. Few small towns are preparing for the increase. This increase helps the tax base but it places overloading problems on the sewage treatment plant. Many are overloaded and needs new facility to deal with the increasing waste. Due to stringent environmental laws in California, it is a very difficult proposition to expand a current site or build a new site, However, EM technology can alleviate overloading of waste without outlay of huge expenses to improve the present treatment sites. On the other hand, many other communities depend upon household septic tanks to alleviate pressure on centralized treatment facility. However, this too becomes a problem for the sewage treatment center Septic tanks are pumped once in three to five years to maintain them. This septage is delivered again to the sewage treatment facility. Again, this contributes to the overloading problem. The tipping fees that the septic service vendors pay, are huge and their operations become very expensive. In United States, a quarter of 109 million housing units has septic tanks. Of 25,635,000 septic tanks, 24,115,000 units are year around occupancy and 1,521,000 are seasonal occupancy. Then, in the year around occupancy, 22,296,000 are "occupied" and 1, 819, 000 are "vacant". Furthermore, 85% ("occupied") are owned and 15% are rented. In the central cities, there are 584,000 units; in outside major suburban area (rural), there are 11,364,000 units; and in the suburbs, there are 12,167,000 units. Just imagine the number of break-downs per year However, EM has begun to resolve this issue for one community. EM can remediate a septage (domestic wastewater and sewage) in three to four days into so call "dirty, water " Upon official inquity to State of California Water Quality Board, EM is not a regulated product and treated septage is allowed to go on to the field as irrigation water (for agricultural purpose). Me have conducted replicated field test to determine remediation of septage in three to four days. In addition, EM can eliminate the breakdowns of septic systems, Just imagine a functional septic system with a clear leachate pipes and fields where soil matrix are improved over period of months and years.

AB  - Salalah is situated on a fresh water aquifer that is replenished during the annual monsoon season. The aquifer is the only source of water in Salalah city. The rainfall and mist precipitation in the Jabal AlQara recharges the plain with significant renewable fresh groundwater that has allowed agricultural and industrial development to occur. In Salalah city where groundwater has been used extensively since the early 1980s for agricultural, industrial and municipal purposes, the groundwater has been withdrawn from the aquifer more rapidly than it can be replenished by natural recharge. The heavy withdrawal of large quantities of the groundwater from the aquifer has led to the intrusion of seawater. Agricultural activities utilize over 70% of the groundwater. For the study of the saltwater intrusion, the area has been divided into four strips, A, B, C and D, on the basis of land-use in the area. Water samples were collected from 18 water wells. Chemical analysis of major ions and pollution parameters in the groundwater was carried out and compared to the previous observed values. The electrical conductivity and chloride concentrations were highest in the agricultural and residential strips and Garziz grass farm. Before 1992 the aquifer was in a steady state, but presently (2005) the groundwater quality in most of the agricultural and residential strips does not meet drinking water standards. In addition, model simulations were developed with the computer code MODFLOW and MT3DMS for solute transport to determine the movement of the freshwater/saltwater interface. The study proposes the protection of the groundwater in Salalah plain aquifer from further encroachment by artificial recharge with reclaimed water, preferably along the Salalah coastal agricultural strip. This scheme can also be applied to other regions with similar conditions.

TI  - The Anabaptists in Munster, 1534-1535
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR GESCHIEDENIS
LA  - German
AB  - The 'Anabaptists' or 'wederdopers' were a religious movement which occurred throughout the whole of Europe during the first phase of the Reformation. They received their name because of their ritual of christening of adults, by which they believed to enter the community of Gods chosen people. In the catholic lands of the Habsburgs the Anabaptists were considered a heresy, and were therefore suppressed. In the Northern Netherlands they had a short but strong influence during the years 1533 - 1535, mainly because they managed to overcome the well protected city of Munster in Westphalia, from where they distributed their message of the end of times.
   In this article the author shows how a situation which started out as hopeless but nonviolent grew into a practice of structural violence. Many factors contributed to a building up of the pressure within the New Jerusalem. He argues that one of the reasons why the Anabaptists in Munster held out for almost one and a half year, was because of the strong leadership of their prophet, Jan van Leiden. Another important reason was the ruthlessness of the bishop of Munster, who had laid siege. If he had acted more humanely and more intelligently, he would have drawn many initial followers from the city. By doing so he would have had less difficulty in conquering Munster back. And he would have prevented the slaughter of many indigenous inhabitants of Munster, against whom most of the aggression of Jan van Leiden was directed.
   Jan van Leiden was as cruel a leader as he was clever. For this he deserves the black reputation he received from historians. But the author states that this dubious honour should be shared by Franz von Waldeck, bishop of Munster.

AB  - Naturally formed karst landforms and historical man-made underground cavities occur widely across the Chalk outcrop. Spatial analysis reveals the broad-scale pattern of occurrence and the influence of causal factors. The Chalk underlies many large towns and cities of southern and eastern England, and each year additional subsidence sinkholes and crown holes appear without warning, causing damage to the built environment. The situation puts residents at risk, raises concerns for local authorities and has financial implications for insurers. These subsidence problems are triggered mostly by the actions of man involving an escape of water or excessive loading at the surface. Similar subsidence behaviour is exhibited by other rock types in the UK and internationally, although detailed characteristics can vary. Field observations and intrusive investigations of chalk karst and man-made subsidence features show a variety of distinctive characteristics. Ground subsidence dimensions and geological setting often provide clues about the cause and nature of movement. Back-analysis of remedial ground stabilization provides data on the typical subsurface void space available within natural cavities. Using these results an interpretive ground model is proposed to explain how sinkholes of varying size occur upon the Chalk. This forms a basis for understanding the differences between the sizes of recently formed sinkholes and geologically old sinkholes. Assessment of recorded subsidence event dimensions and causes provides guidelines on the scale of karst and mining geohazards posed to sites underlain by chalk. These have implications for foundation construction advice and disposal of surface water drainage.

AB  - The great earthquake belt which stretches from the Mediterranean through the Middle East into Central Asia results from the ongoing collision between the Eurasian plate and the African, Arabian and Indian plates to the south. Through much of this belt, the topography is created and controlled by fault movement in earthquakes. Many habitations are located at the foot of the fault-controlled mountain range-fronts that bound inhospitable deserts or elevated plateaus, in positions that are favourable for trade-routes, strategic control of access or for water supply. As a result, they are vulnerable to earthquakes, which often seem to have targeted population centres precisely. For many centuries, an uneasy accommodation was reached between human needs and the earthquake-controlled landscape, sometimes brilliantly exploited by local hydrological engineering, as in Iran. Occasional earthquakes would occur, killing a shocking proportion of the population, but the populations of the settlements themselves would be relatively small. Many once-small rural communities have now grown into towns, cities or megacities, while retaining their vulnerability through poor building standards. Earthquakes that occur in these places today now kill many more than they did in the past, as we have witnessed in the last few years. Extreme catastrophes have been rare only because the exposure of modern megacities to earthquake hazards has been relatively short (approx. 50 years); an increase in the number of such catastrophes now seems to be inevitable.

AB  - In a network society, the increasing fragmentation of individual activity and travel patterns has a major impact on visitors' use of places and spaces throughout the day. The aim of this study is to determine the main dimensions underlying diurnal weekday variations in visitor populations in Dutch municipalities, and to identify the salient spatial and transportation-related features of these municipalities that contribute to the dimensions of these temporary populations. Using the 1998 Netherlands National Travel Survey for six representative one-hour time periods, we performed an exploratory factor analysis to capture the underlying dimensions. The solution comprised one dimension referring to participation in activities, two dimensions related to the size of the territory in which visitor Populations operate combined with the use of different transport modes, one dimension expressing the direction in which interlocal movement occurs, and three dimensions capturing different life-cycle stages within the visitor population. [Key words: visitor populations, factor analysis, the Netherlands.]

AB  - Given the media frenzy over Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential bid, and the ensuing questions about the state of feminism, it seems a serendipitous moment to feature two pieces-written by the women who conceived and performed them-that offer very different but complementary takes on agency identity and the conflation of the public and private as one's body becomes the locus of the gaze. Petra Kuppers's dramaturgical meditation on her experiences as part of Tiresias, a disability culture performance project, investigates erotics, change, mythology, and identity. A collaboration between photographers, writers, and dancers, the project, occurring over six months in 2007, posits the body as the site at which myth might be reshaped and movement might become poetry Lian Amaris critically analyzes her feminist public performance event Fashionably Late for the Relationship, which took place over three days in July 2007 on the Union Square traffic island in New York City. Informed by Judith Butler's citational production of gender, the piece focused on exposing and critiquing the marked visibility of gender construction and maintenance within ail extreme performance paradigm.

AB  - Atriplex centralasiatica, a salt-secreting herb in the family Chenopodiaceae, is one of the most economically important halophytes in China. Seeds were collected from Huanghua City and were separated to get humped-black. humped-brown, flat-black and flat-brown seeds on the basis of the type of bracteoles and seed coat color. The four kinds of seeds were screened for germination with NaCl solutions of different concentration. Results showed that the effects of fruit types were not significant on polymorphic seed germination. Multi-factorial nahsis of variance revealed significant differences in the effects of seed color, temperature, salinity, light and their interactions on seed germination. Maximum germination occurred in distilled water, and an increase in NaCl concentration progressively inhibited germination in all the four types of seeds, A temperature regime of 15/25 degrees C resulted in the maximum germination. Brown seeds had I higher germination percentage than black seeds in mild temperature regime and high salinity; while black seeds had I higher germination percentage than brown seeds in higher temperature and lower salinity. Germination of black seeds was sensitive to light ill NaCl solution but not of brown seeds. Attached bracteoles inhibited the germination of both black and brown seeds. The black seeds were more sensitive to presence of bracteoles than brown ones. In conclusion. the polymorphic seeds showed bet-hedging ecological strategies.

AB  - The Coisley Hill roundabout, a typical urban source for PGE in stream sediments, has anomalously high values of up to 408 ppb Pt, 444 ppb Pd and 113 ppb Rh in road dust, up to 416 ppb Pt and 278 ppb Pd in gulley sediment and up to 606 ppb Pt and 1050 ppb Pd in verge soil. For samples collected at the same time, the road dust values are much higher than in sediments in the Shire Brook stream, that drains the roundabout, with values of 3-64 ppb Pt, 4-57 ppb Pd and up to 7 ppb Rh. Downstream sediments from rivers Rother and Don have lower values of 2-35 ppb Pt, 2-14 ppb Pd and up to 3 ppb Rh. The Humber estuary values are low with 6-8 ppb Pt, 5-8 ppb Pd and 1-2 ppb Rh. Pt/Pd increases down catchment with Coisley Hill 0.8, Shire Brook 1.0, Trent and Don 13 and the Humber estuary 2.0. Pt/Rh and Pd/Rh also increase downstream. Precious metals are generally dispersed away from their vehicle catalytic source and Pd is dispersed more than Pt and Rh but Pt and Pd are re-concentrated in acid mine drainage in the Shire Brook, with concentrations varying with stream flow. Pt and Pd values are slightly elevated at the tidal limit and in mud deposited when the river is in spate.
   On Coisley Hill, values of 133 ppb Pt and 230 ppb Pd occur in dust from a new road surface (two weeks old when sampled). These are similar to those on much older road surfaces suggesting that Pt and Pd collect and disperse rapidly from roads. Au is low in road dust and higher values in conurbations suggest the presence of more Au. sources in urban rather than in rural areas. Au values are not diluted downstream as much as PGE suggesting different processes of dispersion and sedimentation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study design: To compare results obtained with a variety of locomotor rating scales in Th9/10 spinal cord transected (Tx) mice.
   Objectives: To assess spontaneous recovery with a variety of rating scales to find the most sensitive methods for assessing recovery levels in Tx mice and differences associated with gender and condition.
   Setting: Laval University Medical Center, Neuroscience Unit & Laval University, Department of Anatomy and Physiology, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: Scales including the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB), the Basso Mouse Score (BMS), the Antri, Orsal and Barthe (AOB), the Motor Function Score (MFS) and the Averaged Combined Score (ACOS) were used to assess, in open-field and treadmill conditions, spontaneous locomotor recovery in male and female Tx mice.
   Results: The ACOS scale revealed a progressive increase of spontaneous recovery during 5-weeks post-Tx. The other methods detected a progressive increase for the first 2-3 weeks post-Tx without any significant progress in weeks 4 and 5. Generally, scores obtained with each method were nonsignificantly different between males and females or between open-field and treadmill conditions.
   Conclusion: These results further confirm the existence of a limited but significant increase of locomotor function recovery, occurring without intervention, in Tx animals. Although each method could detect small levels of recovery, the ACOS method was discriminative enough to detect progressive changes up to 5 weeks post-Tx. In conclusion, the ACOS rating scale was the most discriminative method for assessing the spontaneous return of hindlimb movements found in Tx mice, both in open-field and treadmill conditions.

AB  - The Azraq basin in Jordan is considered to be one of the most important basins that supply Jodanian major cities with drinking water. There are three aquifers in the basin, the upper one is the most important, due to its low drilling cost and good quality of ground-water. The average annual infiltration for the period 1965/66-1994/95 was 35 x 10(6) m(3), which comprises about 3% of the total annual rainfall. Around 1 x 10(6) m(3) flows through the Sirhan structure into the adjacent areas, and approximately 9x10(6) m(3) is lost by evapotranspiration, meaning that the net recharge is about 25 x 10(6) m(3) Due to an increase in demand for drinking water (55 x 10(6) m(3)), the basin started to suffer from a depletion of ground-water levels. As a result, the Azraq oasis is now completely dry. This study indicates that pumping wells are irregularly distributed, especially in the well field area which is where most of the pumping occurs. Saline water intrusion has started and is predicted to accelerate in the near future. The ground-water balance of the model shows that the underflow recharge from the north is about 35 x 106 m3, the upward movement is nearly 1 x 10(6) m(3), nd the downward leakage is approximately 0.13 x 10(6) m(3). Increasing ground-water pumping accelerates the upward movement and causes a decrease in the downward leakage. The safe yield of the basin was calculated to be around 25 x 10(6)m(3). Dividing the basin into three zones (well field, northern part and eastern part) shows that any reduction in pumping of the sub-basin or zone, particularly in the well field, has a positive effect on the other two zones.

AB  - Golf is said to be among the most rapidly increasing forms of land use, yet little is known of the effects of golf courses and golf playing on wildlife. A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather (Calluna vulgaris] heath with scattered, small Scots pines [Pinus sylvestris]) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P= 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.

AB  - Identifying the sources and impacts of organic and inorganic contaminants at the watershed scale is a complex challenge because of the multitude of processes occurring in time and space. Investigation of geochemical transformations requires a systematic evaluation of hydrologic, landscape, and anthropogenic factors. The 1160 km(2) Boulder Creek Watershed in the Colorado Front Range encompasses a gradient of geology, ecotypes, climate, and urbanization. Streamflow originates primarily as snowmelt and shows substantial annual variation. Water samples were collected along a 70-km transect during spring-runoff and base-flow conditions, and analyzed for major elements, trace elements, bulk organics, organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs), and pesticides. Major-element and trace-element concentrations were low in the headwaters, increased through the urban corridor, and had a step increase downstream from the first major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Boron, gadolinium, and lithium were useful inorganic tracers of anthropogenic inputs. Effluent from the WWTP accounted for as much as 75% of the flow in Boulder Creek and was the largest chemical input. Under both hydrological conditions, OWCs and pesticides were detected in Boulder Creek downstream from the WWTP outfall as well as in the headwater region, and loads of anthropogenic-derived contaminants increased as basin population density increased. This report documents a suite of potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals in a reach of stream with native fish populations showing indication of endocrine disruption.

AB  - Beginning around 1800, but primarily since the early and mid-twentieth century, the giant African snail, Achatina (Lissachatina) fulica Bowdich, 1822, has been introduced throughout the tropics and subtropics and has been considered the most important snail pest in these regions. In Brasil, specimens probably brought from Indonesia were introduced into the state of Parana in the 1980s for commercial purposes ("escargot" farming) that were not successful. Achatina fulica is now widespread in at least 23 out of 26 Brasilian states and the Federal District, including the Amazonian region and natural reserves. Among the reasons for the species' rapid invasion are its high reproductive capacity and the tendency for people to release the snails into the wild. Achatina fulica occurs in dense populations in urban areas where it is a pest in ornamental gardens, vegetable gardens, and small-scale agriculture. Also of concern is the damage caused to the environment, and potential competition with native terrestrial mollusks. It can also act as an intermediate host of Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode that can cause meningoencephalitis in people, and it may be a potential host of A. costaricensis, which causes abdominal angiostrongylosis, a zoonosis that occurs from the southern United States to northern Argentina. Management and control measures for A. fulica are under way in Brasil through a national plan implemented by the Brasilian government.

AB  - In a study of male song in the orange-tufted sunbird (Nectarinia osea) in an urban neighbor hood in Ramat-Aviv, Israel, we discovered the occurrence of song variation on a microgeographic scale in the form of two distinct dialects with a sharp boundary between them. The main distinction between the two song dialects is the frequency of the trill, which comprises the terminal part of the song. A large difference of 2-3 Id-It in the peak frequency of the trill was discovered between the two dialects, which could be easily distinguished by ear. Thirty seven males were recorded singing the 'low' dialect and 21 birds sang the 'high' dialect. Four other birds sang both dialects or 'hybrid' songs. Along the boundary that separated the two dialect populations. neighboring birds sang different dialect songs, although they were only 20-30 meters apart. All four 'bilingual' birds occupied territories near the dialect boundary. The historical processes leading to the formation of this dialect system may result from the pattern of human settlement at the time of the establishment of this neighborhood in the early 1950's. The spatial distribution of the two sunbird dialect populations. and the apparent low dispersal rates of birds from their natal dialect areal suggest the existence of a mechanism, which currently maintains these dialects at the current boundaries.

TI  - Inlaid decorations and late antiquity tendencies in Romanesque architecture of the middle Rhone Valley
T2  - GESTA-INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF MEDIEVAL ART
LA  - French
AB  - Inlaid decorations - inlays of mortar or putty in an incised stone support - resurrect an aesthetic and techniques belonging to the architecture of late antiquity. In the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries such decorations saw a notable revival in church architecture and liturgical furniture. The revival occurred in the east as well as the west, beginning earlier in Greece and later in the western kingdoms. The geographic distribution of these decorations is spotty and fragmentary, however, just a few buildings in Greece, in the middle Rhone valley, in the north of France, and in England. At Vienne and Lyon, in the heart of Burgundy and part of the empire, the development of these inlaid decorations in Romanesque architecture of the second half of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries participated in a larger protorenaissance, as the Rhone valley surrounding these cities saw several clear examples of the renaissance of ancient forms both in architecture and in decoration. While the early Christian or Byzantine origin of these inlays may be elusive, the aesthetic of costliness which defines them permits a better understanding of the role played by this revival in the artistic politics of the archbishops. Before studying what the influences upon them might been, it is advisable to clearly define the aesthetic collegiate church of Saint-Andre-le-Bas and the old cathedral of Saint-Maurice, and at Lyon the cathedral of Saint-Jean-Baptiste; in this way one can avoid historical contradictions in interpreting the comparisons. Furthermore, the chronological revisions suggested by recent research are the basis of a new understanding of the position of these two cities in late Romanesque art and of their relation to Burgundy, as a major monument of Romanesque art of the mid-twelfth century, the tomb of St.-Lazare, evidently played a significant role in the constitution of this revivalist aesthetic. The inlays of Autun belong to this movement. The inlays further demonstrate the large part played by Vienne, a part well established for sculpture.

TI  - Pedestrian Road Traffic Injuries in Urban Peruvian Children and Adolescents: Case Control Analyses of Personal and Environmental Risk Factors
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Child pedestrian road traffic injuries (RTIs) are an important cause of death and disability in poorer nations, however RTI prevention strategies in those countries largely draw upon studies conducted in wealthier countries. This research investigated personal and environmental risk factors for child pedestrian RTIs relevant to an urban, developing world setting.
   Methods: This is a case control study of personal and environmental risk factors for child pedestrian RTIs in San Juan de Miraflores, Lima, Peru. The analysis of personal risk factors included 100 cases of serious pedestrian RTIs and 200 age and gender matched controls. Demographic, socioeconomic, and injury data were collected. The environmental risk factor study evaluated vehicle and pedestrian movement and infrastructure at the sites in which 40 of the above case RTIs occurred and 80 control sites.
   Findings: After adjustment, factors associated with increased risk of child pedestrian RTIs included high vehicle volume (OR 7.88, 95%CI 1.97-31.52), absent lane demarcations (OR 6.59, 95%CI 1.65-26.26), high vehicle speed (OR 5.35, 95%CI 1.55-18.54, ), high street vendor density (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.01-1.55), and more children living in the home (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.00-1.56). Protective factors included more hours/day spent in school (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.33-0.82) and years of family residence in the same home (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.95-0.99).
   Conclusion: Reducing traffic volumes and speeds, limiting the number of street vendors on a given stretch of road, and improving lane demarcation should be evaluated as components of child pedestrian RTI interventions in poorer countries.

KW  - SOUTH DEVON
AB  - Problems with shallow foundations are unusually common in Torbay. Subsidence cases run at perhaps twice tile rate (per head Of population) of other urban areas in South West England. The distribution of cases in Torbay is controlled by the underlying geology. Dramatic problems are associated with solution features in the Devonian limestones, but although these can be severe, they are not common, and the firm silty clays developed on the limestones do not normally give rise to problems. (;round conditions on the Devonian slates, sandstones and igneous rocks are generally good, although movement due to shrink-swell of residual highly plastic silty clay soils is known locally. Problems associated with soils developed on Permian breccias are but h very common and often severe: these are sometimes associated with loess horizons within the soil profile. Amongst the breccias, problems arc much more common on the Oddicombe Breccia than on the Watcombe Breccia. The worst ground conditions occur, where thick colluvial deposits are developed on lower hillslopes on the Oddicombe Breccia: the colluvial soils are unconsolidated sandy silts, which are very susceptible to loss of strength on wetting.

AB  - This paper analyse some aspects of land use and occupation of the south littoral of Espirito Santo's state, Brazil, region composed by eleven municipalities, five of them included in Grande Vitoria's metropolitan region. Justifies, initially, the territorial contour adopted and to present an historical approach of this occupation, that is articulated to the general movement of the space organization in Espirito Santo's state. Discusses, based in analyses of tables, the demographic and urban dynamics, infra-structurals aspects and social and economics indicators. Finally, points out some future tendencies and sceneries, with emphasis on recent off-shore oil exploration, economic force that promotes a new space organization. This paper is an result of the research developped by Espirito Santo's team of thematic sub-group "Land Use and Occupation", of thematic group "Modeling and Monitoring of the Coastal Erosion and Occupation" of the "Instituto do Milenio" (Milenio-Recos-MMOC), and intend to provide some elements to comprehension of relations between natural and human elements that configure the brazilians coastal zones.

AB  - Background and Methods: Helsinki City Transport buses, trams, and underground trains carry 687 000 passengers on a weekday. Of the passengers, 0.13% travel with a pet. We interviewed passengers and measured allergen levels in vehicles to determine what difficulties allergens cause to passengers with allergy and asthma.
   Results: Of 2021 interviewed passengers, 14% complained about inconvenience caused by pets, usually health problems. Of 324 adult passengers with allergy or asthma, 53% had experienced symptoms in public transport; the corresponding figure for 75 children was 32%. The median concentration of the main dog allergen, Can f 1, in dust from seats and floors in public transport vehicles was 2400 ng per g of dust (range 20-8500 ng/g). For the main cat allergen, Fel d 1, the median was 870 ng/g (range 3-2600 ng/g). These levels can be regarded as low or moderate, and they cause symptoms in sensitive persons. Concentrations of mite allergens were undetectable or low. Allergen levels were lower in vehicles where pets were not allowed than in vehicles where pets were allowed, lower in dust from uncovered seats than in dust from seats with a covering, and lower after cleaning vehicle floors and seats than before cleaning.
   Conclusions: Dog and cat allergens are present in public transport vehicles in Helsinki at levels that cause symptoms in sensitive persons. Prohibiting pets would probably bring only a modest reduction in levels, as few pets are carried, and much allergen contamination comes from passengers' clothes.

CP  - 2nd Forbes Symposium on Scientific Research in the Field of Asian Art
AB  - As part of a comprehensive effort to document the present condition and past restorations of an important Yuan wall painting in the collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri, laboratory analyses of the paints have been undertaken. The sectional removal of the painting on its mud plaster support in the early twentieth century necessitated extensive reassembly and reintegration of losses upon its re-installation in the museum. Analysis is complicated by at least two major campaigns of work that occurred during the relocation. Prior historical refurbishments in China were also suspected at the outset. Analysis has shown that the most widely used original green pigment was one of the copper trihydroxychlorides that has undergone significant alteration. The micromorphology and trace components of the green Suggest that it was originally produced from corroded bronze. Deterioration of this pigment has resulted in significant chromatic shifts in the colors of the mural. Gypsum, a minor component of the white paint layers whose principal pigments are clays, shows widespread evidence of dissolution and recrystallization, including possible adverse interaction with the copper green. While evidence of dissolution and dispersal of the green is readily found, no products of the process that would explain the fate of the copper have been identified. The kaolin clay white is of considerable morphological complexity by itself. However, other white pigments, including gypsum and lead white of a very fine particle size. seem to have been sparingly used to augment the properties of this paint. The paint compositions, and their conditions, have important implications for conservation treatment planning.

AB  - In his belated riposte to my critique of the 'critical consensus' (P.A.J. Waddington, 1991), David Waddington (1998) seek; to defend the conceptual adequacy and methodological integrity of that position, and especially his own 'flashpoints' model (D. Waddington et al., 1987, 1989). In this reply, I demonstrate that not only is his defence unconvincing, but my original critique can be further developed. Conceptually, the notion of 'precipitating incidents' is inevitably applied ex post facto, but also compresses complex patterns of interaction into a single, arbitrary incident and, furthermore, relies upon an impoverished notion of the crowd. Methodologically, lack of equivocation and hesitancy are no substitute for careful and systematic recording of what occurs. The 'critical consensus' remains not only value-ladened, but advocacy. Moreover, it illustrates a characteristic feature of social movements/moral entrepreneurs: the attempt to 'frame' events so as to cast claimants as 'victims'. indeed, there seem to be good grounds for regarding the 'critical consensus' as simply part of a wider social movement that received political impetus from the riots of the early 1980s.

TI  - Public sector restructuring and democracy: The state, labour and trade unions in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This aticle looks at ways in which marketisation reforms affect the empowerment, ideological universes and functioning limits of popular institutions. Under what circumstances do left-leaning trade unions accept job cuts and wage freezes? What are the boundaries of consent and dissent? Case studies of three public sector companies in Bangalore city in the southern state of Karnataka, India, indicate that labour rationalisation has occurred with trade union acquiescence and support. However, as yet there is no broad institutional framework to handle social security, rehabilitation and redeployment of displaced workers. Public sector workforce reduction is taking place in a general economic context where there has been little growth of employment in the organised manufacturing sector Beneath unions' apparent acquiescence to rationalisation processes, there are critical areas of dissent. Dissent, however has not manifested itself in a critical alternative to the state's rationalisation policies. Changing party-union relations, and shifts in the internal dynamics of unions affecting choice of leaders, union aspirations and ideologies - underwritten by the broader economic changes wrought by the marketisation process - partially explain the inability of the labour movement to shape a definitive challenge to the marketisation process.

AB  - The study of relations of labour aims to analyse the working women, that means the domestic employees who work in the enclosed condominiums of Presidente Prudente city. In other words, we intend to know if the legislation disobedience is providing redefinitions in the labour market or in the geographical dynamic (deterritorialisation-reterritorialisation) of the domestic workers in a local/regional scope, considering that legislation is the mechanism the control used by the employers that affect the daily life and process of labour in the domestic scope. To understand the DTR process (deterritorialisation, territorialisation, reterritorialisation), which is the movement of territory formation, it is necessary to understand who delimitate and control space. In the current capitalist period, it is needed to recognise to whose order and for who the deterritorialisation process occur. This process in the economical perspective is much more tied to the expropriation, lost of quality and exclusion processes which are inserted in the logics of capitalist accumulation that guide working class, more and more submitted to degraded conditions of labour.

AB  - A geologic investigation of the city of Memphis and southern Shelby County, Tennessee reveals Quaternary faulting. Structure contour maps and cross-sections of the top of the Pliocene-Pleistocene Upland Complex (Lafayette gravel), Eocene Upper Claiborne Group, and Eocene Lower Claiborne Group reveal two 20-m down-to-the-northwest faults that strike approximately N30 degrees E. The western fault is herein called the Memphis Fault and the eastern, the Ellendale Fault.
   The Ellendale Fault is projected to pass beneath the Wolf River flood plain in cast Memphis. At this location, a cut bank exposes flood-plain sands that are folded into an anticline with a wavelength of similar to 100 m, an amplitude of similar to 4 m, and a hinge oriented 10 degrees N7 degrees W. the folded sands are truncated by overlying, flat-lying, clayey silt overbank sediments. A 1-m-wide earthquake liquefaction sand dike was found above the crest of the anticline, in the overbank sediments. 14 C dates reveal that the folding occurred between A.D. 390 and 450, and the liquefaction occurred post A.D. 450. Seismic-reflection lines indicate that the fold extends to more than 60 m depth into the Lower Claiborne Group, has a length of more than 1 km, and is thus tectonic in origin. The reflection lines also reveal a N25 degrees E-trending down-to-the-west fault with 5 m of displacement in the Upper Claiborne Group that we believe is within the Ellendale Fault zone. We believe the anticline formed during similar to 5 m of Quaternary right-lateral strike-slip movement on the N25 degrees E-trending fault. Based on these observations, we also believe that the Ellendale Fault, and perhaps the Memphis Fault, may pose seismic threats to the city of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee.

CP  - 7th World Wilderness Congress Symposium
AB  - This paper deals with the historic details of the tribes named Muthuvans of the High Ranges of Kerala in India's southwestern mountain ranges. Their origin, their migration into the hills, their culture, their occupation, their demographic profile, and so forth, are delineated. A comparison of their past and present lifestyle is presented.
   The question of why they are called the "ecosystem people" is analyzed. The details of how they helped the pioneering planters from the United Kingdom to trace the area and establish tea plantations in the hills are provided. They are portrayed as excellent guides for scientific game preservation in the early days.
   The birth and growth of the nature preservation movement in this part of the world, namely the High Range Wildlife and Environment Preservation Association, is detailed in this paper. The good working relationship between the Association and the Muthuvans, which has been preserved for nearly a century, is highlighted. The projects undertaken by the Association for the welfare and betterment of the Muthuvans are enumerated.
   This paper shows how a corporation can be proactive in promoting the spirit of protecting wilderness by enlisting the support of a human community, which is more close to natural wilderness than the rest of us living in the cosmopolitan wilderness of today's cities. And it concludes with suggestions for newer systems and approaches that could be emulated in developing countries.

AB  - Organochlorine compounds were dumped by chemical industries during the 1970s in many areas of the coastal plain of Sao Paulo state in Brazil. These dumps, located on hillsides and in valleys, in both rural and urban environments, are responsible for soil and water pollution. The objective of this work was to determine how the pollutants have spread in an area occupied by a spodosol-type soil mantle. The study combines soil morphological observations with soil and water analysis of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in soil toposequences. The results indicate that the highest pollutant concentrations are observed near the dump site and that the compounds contamination is increasing.
   A map integrating topography and chemical concentrations was created to visualize the spatial distribution of HCB levels in the landscape. Physical and chemical analyses were performed to measure HCB and PCP levels in the soil. Soil water appears to act as a vector of HCB, probably through complexation with and dispersal of dissolved organic matter. The persistence of HCB at the studied site is most likely due to the low pH values in combination with a high content of organic matter. HCB was consistently found in higher concentrations than PCP. It is plausible that the cause of this difference is that PCP is degraded more easily under sunlight than HCB and that degradation of PCP under acid conditions leads to the formation of HCB.

AB  - Background: Although much research has been carried out into European Reticulitermes taxonomy in recent years, there is still much discussion about phylogenetic relationships. This study investigated the evolution from intra- to interspecific phylogeny in the island subspecies Reticulitermes lucifugus corsicus and threw new light on this phenomenon. An integrative approach based on microsatellites and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences was used to analyze samples taken from a wide area around the Tyrrhenian sea and showed how the subspecies evolved from its origins to its most recent form on continental coasts.
   Results: According to mitochondrial phylogeny and molecular clock calculations, island and continental taxa diverged significantly by vicariance in the Pleistocene glacial period. However, more recently, numerous migrations, certainly human-mediated, affected the structure of the populations. This study provided evidence of direct hybridization and multiple introgressions which occurred in several hybrid areas. Analysis using STRUCTURE based on microsatellite data identified a population in Provence ( France) which differed considerably (Fst = 0.477) from populations on the island of Corsica and in Tuscany in the Italian peninsula. This new population, principally distributed in urban areas, is highly heterogeneous especially within the ITS2 regions where homogenization by concerted evolution does not appear to have been completed.
   Conclusion: This study provides an unusual picture of genetic interaction between termite populations in the Tyrrhenian area and suggests that more attention should be paid to the role of introgression and human impact on the recent evolution of European termites.

AB  - This paper deals with issues of political dissent and the geography of state power through the lens of a particular law and its deployment by the US state in the context of the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota by American Indian Movement activists and local residents. I explore how the state responded to the highly mediated nature of the Wounded Knee occupation through tactics that minimized the visibility of its efforts to contain the protest. These efforts, I argue, also constituted a broader politics of scale. I begin with a theoretical discussion of the intersection of protest, scale and publicity. I then use the empirical example of the H Rap Brown Act to show how these dynamics were being reworked in the US during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In particular, I place the emergence of the H Rap Brown Act within a context of changing geographies of race and state power, more specifically as they were articulated around the unrest that was engulfing American cities. I then analyze, how the law was deployed by the state during the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of what the case of the H Rap Brown Act has to tell us more broadly about our theoretical understandings of the geographies of public protest.

AB  - Diplotaxis harra is a common annual species in the desert of Egypt. The investigated population was located in Wadi Hof near Helwan city. Additional water in relatively wet years cause these ephemeral plants to live longer and become perennials. The species has ephemeral, modular and coppiced life-cycles and may shift from a r- to a K-selected strategy. The germinable seed bank represented 15.6%, of the total seed rain, out of which only 0.03% established as adult plants. About 72.7% of the adult plants were ephemeral. 27.0% modular and 0.3% coppiced plants. The highest contribution of the seed rain came from modular plants and the lowest contribution from coppiced plants. The survivorship curve of the coppiced plants exhibited a combination of Deevey type I and III curves. The ephemeral and modular plants showed steep curves. In contrast to ephemeral plants, the coppiced plants attained the highest reproductive value and the lowest reproductive effort, while the modular plants demonstrated intermediate values. The active phenological cycle started earlier in coppiced plants than in the modular and ephemeral plants, The period from the start of vegetative growth to shoot-die back extends from mid-December to early June in coppiced plants, from February to May in modular plants, and from late February to early May in ephemeral plants. The living stumps of the coppiced plants remained dormant during summer and autumn months. Seeds collected from coppiced plants attained high germinabiltiy and viability, while those from ephemeral and modular plants attained low values. Seed longevity was higher in the modular plants ( > 10 yr) than in seeds of ephemeral and coppiced plants (7-8 yr). The high energy content of the seeds produced from different cohorts over ten years of storage enabled the population to maximize the germinability, viability and longevity of seeds despite the unpredictable environment. The potential annual behaviour of D. harra is mainly attained by the persistence of viable seed bank and root-shoot stock. The ability to shift from a r- to a K-selected life-cycle, phenological variations among the different cohorts of the population, variations in seed longevity and energy content strengthen intra-population interactions.

AB  - We determine the velocities in an upper crustal model, composed of three homogeneous layers, for one subregion of the western part of the Gulf of Corinth, NE of the town of Aigion, Greece. We have used local events that occurred there in the year 2001 and were recorded by the Corinth Rift Laboratory Network. Weighted P and S arrival time residuals are minimized using the Neighbourhood Algorithm of Sambridge (1999), combined with the grid search for source locations. The resolution of the inversion is tested by delete-one jackknifing. The model obtained is compared with some other models derived or applied to the subregion. A fast velocity increase between depths of 5 and 7 km is confirmed as the major structural element.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of modal analysis to ascertain changes in the boundary conditions (or structural damage) of a complicated bridge structure. Reconstruction of the Interstate 15 corridor through Salt Lake City, Utah had provided an opportunity for destructive testing to be conducted on a three-span, continuous curved steel girder bridge. Forced Vibration testing using an eccentric mass shaker was conducted on the bridge in three phases. Each phase represented a change in boundary conditions. The initial testing was done with the bridge in the as-built condition with the continuous deck at the abutments and frozen bronze bearings. The second phase of testing occurred after the bridge deck was cut away from the approach slabs. For the third phase of testing, the bearings at the ends of the girders were replaced with teflon pads and the bearings over the two intermediate piers were jacked up and greased. The results of the study show that modal analysis is capable of determining changes in a structure's natural frequencies and mode shapes due to a change in the boundary conditions. By extrapolation this would indicate that modal analysis would work as an effective non-destructive evaluation tool.

AB  - Significant demographic, social and economic change has come to characterise much of rural Australia, with some authors arguing there are now two sharply differentiated zones, one of growth and one of decline. This restructuring process, which has been similar to other western nations, has had a profound impact upon rural places-socially, economically and physically. Findings from research investigating the relationship between health, place and income inequality suggest that rural 'desertification', which is characterised by decline of the agricultural sector, net population loss and the deterioration of demographic structures, may negatively influence mental health outcomes in these areas. By contrast, the growth in rural areas, which is associated with expanding employment opportunities and the movement of capital and people, may confer positive benefits to mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in mental health and well-being between rural communities experiencing growth and decline as measured by net population change. Utilising a survey methodology, questionnaires were distributed to 20,000 people randomly sampled from the electoral role in rural Australia. We selected four sub-regions from the sample area that were characteristic of areas experiencing population growth and decline in Australia and analysed the results of respondents from these four regions (n = 1334). The analysis provided support for our hypothesis that living in a declining area is associated with poorer mental health status; however, the factors that underpin growth and decline may also be important in influencing mental health. Discussed are the mechanisms by which demographic and social change influence mental health. The findings of this study highlight the diversity of health outcomes in rural areas and suggest that aspects of place in declining rural areas may present risk factors for mental health.

AB  - In the congested urban areas, tunnelling close to existing structures or services often occurs due to the lack of surface space. Consequently, tunnelling-induced ground movements may cause a serious damage to the adjacent structures. This study focussed on two-dimensional laboratory model test for the pile-soil-tunnelling interaction using a close range photogrammetric technique and numerical analysis. Model testing equipments and procedures were introduced, particularly the use of aluminium rods regarded as the frictional granular material. The normalised pile tip movements were identified by both the model test and finite element analysis. The model test results found to be in good agreement with the finite element analysis. Based on the normalised pile tip settlements due to tunnelling adjacent to a line of loaded piles, influence zones were proposed in this study. The proposed influence zones are relatively wider and deeper than those proposed in previous studies. The authors believe that it will be useful to decide the reasonable location of tunnel construction in the planning stage. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL-REFLECTIONS
AB  - In this paper I argue that the manner in which piety is perceived and propagated among Muslims in Sri Lanka must be understood as located within the context of ethnic conflict and the polarization between ethnic groups that occurred in its wake. I explore the work of one Muslim women's da'wa (preaching) group-Al Muslimaat-that pioneered the process of making piety popular among lower-middle and middle-income Muslim women in a semi-urban Colombo neighbourhood. Looking at the group's activities and specifically through analyses of the bayan or lay sermons delivered by their most charismatic member, I look at the nature of the pious practice that is preached. I argue that in making a self-consciously pious Muslim female subject, Al Muslimaat bayans are affecting ideas of masculinity and femininity among the suburban Muslims with whom they work, and recasting Muslimness in a manner exclusive of ethnic others. I argue also that by marginalizing the kafir in propagating the new Muslim, Al Muslimaat and the greater piety movement in Sri Lanka is mirroring the particular incommensurable indentities already espoused by the violently strident Sinhala and Tamil nationalisms in the country.

AB  - For more than a decade, research carried out in Scotland has investigated the movement of sediment in sewers and the associated pollutant release. Pollution by discharges from combined sewer overflows can adversely affect watercourses, particularly those in urban areas. Solids and-dissolved contaminants, many derived from in-sewer deposits during a storm event, can be especially significant. This phenomenon can occur during events known as 'foul flushes'. In combined sewers these typically occur in the initial period of storm flows, when the concentration of suspended sediments and other pollutants is significantly higher than at other times. It has become apparent that much of the suspended load originates from solids eroded from the bed. The 'near bed solids' which are re-entrained into the flow, together with solids eroded from the bulk bed, account for large changes in the suspended sediment concentration under time varying flow conditions. This paper describes so ne of the methods employed to investigate the solids eroding in combined sewers during peak flow events. The work examined the potential for sediment re-suspension under high flow conditions both in the laboratory and in the field.

TI  - Observations on the Natural History of Bats in the Yukon
T2  - NORTHERN REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Until recently, bats have not been well surveyed or studied in the Yukon. The little brown bat was known to range north to Mayo and Dawson City in the summer, but little was known of its biology or natural history, or if other species occurred. In this article we report from studies conducted between 1997 and 2008, funded in part by the Northern Research Institute. Current studies are answering questions about bat species that occur in the Yukon, their daily and seasonal activity patterns, foraging and roosting habitats, and population dynamics within roosts and roosting areas. We studied bats by detecting and interpreting ultrasonic echolocation calls (acoustic surveys) and by live capture. Acoustic surveys were conducted at over 100 sites across the little brown bat's range in the Yukon, where over 7,000 bat passes were recorded. Most of them were little brown bats but we also recorded northern long-eared and big brown or silver-haired bats. We have banded 1,043 little brown bats at twelve maternity colonies in buildings, bat houses, and rock crevices. Locations of hibernating sites remain unknown, but the bat species that occur in the Yukon are migratory and may hibernate a great distance from their summer range. The annual timing of birth of the little brown bat in the Yukon, at the northern edge of their range, is typical for the species. Recaptures of banded bats has documented roost fidelity and the use of multiple roosts within a larger foraging area. We have also documented cohesive movements of colonies during roost switching, long distance dispersal to new roosts, and survival for at least twelve years. Further research is needed to address the substantial gaps in our knowledge about bats in the Yukon.

AB  - Time series of ozone, CO, and NO2 surface mixing ratios and of aerosol density have been derived using ultraviolet photometry, infrared absoption spectrometry, gas filter correlation radiometry, and beta-ray absorption, respectively, at Busan, Korea (35.23degreesN, 129.07degreesE) since 1992. Enhancements of ozone above 100 ppbv were observed during an Asian dust event on 1 May 1999. A secondary ozone maximum observed at the surface was expected as the result of invasion of air from the free troposphere due to the jet stream. Sudden increases in CO, NO2 and aerosols were caused by the combination of the deepening cut-off low connecting with a surface cyclone, and the slow-moving surface anticyclone located to the south of the upper trough over Korea. The elevated mixing ratios of these gases and aerosols were the result of chemical reactions and stratosphere-troposphere exchange due to tropopause folding in the rear of the jet streak under these weather conditions. In the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of NOx, the enhancement of ozone was due to the catalytic reaction of CO that originates in fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions from China, together with ozone precursors such as VOCs that occur in Busan, Korea. In addition, transport of ozone was determined not only by the invasion of stratospheric ozone followed by tropopause folding of the deep cut-off low associated with the movement of total ozone, but also by long-range horizontal transport from China and from an anticyclone located to the south of Korea. The relative importance of chemical reactions and transport of these gases in the urban area was analyzed using an Urban Airshed Model (UAM) that included biogenic and anthropogenic emissions of VOCs and other gases. It showed that we could estimate the net flux of the ozone mixing ratio due to both long-range advection and free troposphereboundary layer exchange in connection with stratospheretroposphere exchange during Asian dust events in springtime.

AB  - Factors affecting the foraging of mobile native fauna in highly fragmented urban landscapes have seldom been quantified at large spatial scales. We investigated factors affecting foraging by Grey-headed Flying-foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus; 'flying-foxes') in the greater Melbourne metropolitan area. Flying-foxes established a continuously occupied colony site in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne in 1986, and the size of the colony has subsequently increased greatly. We used a stratified-random sampling design to examine the importance of six variables on the detection of foraging flying-foxes: (i) distance from the colony site (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 km); (ii) distance from the Yarra River (0-5 and 5-20 km); (iii) the relative tree density of the municipality; (iv) whether the site was a park or street; (v) whether there was a relatively high or low density of trees at the site; and (vi) whether food was or was not detected at the site. We surveyed 240 sites within a 30-km radius of the colony site for foraging flying-foxes in both May and October 2002. The probability of detecting a foraging flying-fox declined with increasing distance from the colony site, but increased with increasing tree cover, and was higher for parks compared with streets and when food was present. Flying-foxes were observed foraging in a number of plant genera that have no species that naturally occur in the Melbourne area. Flying-foxes in Melbourne thus forage on planted resources that are widely distributed within a fragmented landscape, and are an example of a positive response by a native species to the process of urbanization.

T2  - FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH: FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION (MULTIMODAL)
LA  - English
CP  - 79th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - Intracity goods movement is profoundly affected by the facilities and services available for pickups and deliveries in commercial office buildings (COBS). Inadequate freight-handling facilities in New York City's central business district (CBD) were identified as major barriers to freight mobility by shippers and carriers in industry-sector focus groups and in freight mobility interviews. Property managers of COBS completed 28 surveys that provided data about building characteristics, the number and size of freight elevators, a description of the dock area, and delivery windows. Results indicated that inadequate docks or receiving areas and insufficient freight elevators did not support the increasing number of freight deliveries, resulting in a significant amount of off-loading on the streets. Most property managers surveyed believed that enlarging docks would increase dock functionality. A time-and-motion study of vehicular deliveries to loading docks was carried out at two COBs located in the CBD. It documented time of delivery, dwell time in the dock, dwell time on the street, size and type of vehicle, and so forth, for a 10-week period in the summer of 1997. Most deliveries occurred in the mornings; dwell times averaged 33 min in the dock and on the street. A majority of straight trucks were under 7.31 in (24 ft) in length.

AB  - Pentecostal and African Independent Churches have rapidly spread throughout central Mozambique in the aftermath of war and in the midst of a recent structural adjustment program that has hastened commoditization of community life and intensified local inequalities. This extraordinary expansion signals a shift away from reliance on "traditional" healers to treat persistent afflictions believed to have spiritual causes. Survey data and illness narratives collected from recent church recruits and local residents during research in 2002 and 2003 in the city of Chimoio reveal that healers have increased fees and tailored treatments to clients searching for good fortune in ways that have alienated many other help seekers in this changing social environment. While traditional healing has been celebrated in the international health world, community attitudes are less generous; many healers are increasingly viewed with suspicion because of their engagement with malevolent occult forces to foment social conflict, competition, and confrontation for high fees. Church healing approaches offer free and less divisive spiritual protection reinforced by social support in a new collectivity. One vital source of church popularity derives from pastors' efforts to tap the already considerable community anxiety over rising healer fees and their socially divisive treatments in an insecure environment.

AB  - Recent multibeam sonar and acoustic subbottom profiler surveys and sediment coring offshore the city of Sept-(I) over cap les (NW Gulf of St. Lawrence) reveal different types of submarine mass-movements and gravity flows in glaciomarine, paraglacial and postglacial deposits. These mass-movement and gravity flow features are slumps, gullies and channel-levee systems and fans. The key results of this study include: 1) slumps involve the entire deglacial and postglacial sequence, indicating their recent triggering; 2) identification of a 57-cm thick turbidite and several sand layers in sediment cores collected in a deep and isolated basin unaffected by fluvial inputs, along with Pb-210 measurements, indicate the recent activity of mass wasting events derived from slope instabilities; 3) important volumes of sediments are being transported from the coastal to the deeper marine environment by gravity flows processes on the prodelta of the Moisie River. Hypotheses for explaining the widespread occurrence of recent mass-movements due to slope instabilities in the area possibly include their possible triggering by the AD 1663 (M similar to 7) or another large earthquake.

AB  - We used the LANDIS disturbance and succession model to study the effects of six alternative vegetation management scenarios on forest succession and the subsequent risk of canopy fire on a 2791 km(2) landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. The study area is a mix of fire-prone and fire-resistant land types. The alternatives vary the spatial distribution of vegetation management activities to meet objectives primarily related to forest composition and recreation. The model simulates the spatial dynamics of differential reproduction, dispersal, and succession patterns using the vital attributes of species as they are influenced by the abiotic environment and disturbance. We simulated 50 replicates of each management alternative and recorded the presence of species age cohorts capable of sustaining canopy fire and the occurrence of fire over 250 years. We combined these maps of fuel and fire to map the probability of canopy fires across replicates for each alternative. Canopy fire probability varied considerably by land type. There was also a subtle, but significant effect of management alternative, and there was a significant interaction between land type and management alternative. The species associated with high-risk fuels (conifers) tend to be favored by management alternatives with more disturbances, whereas low disturbance levels favor low-risk northern hardwood systems dominated by sugar maple. The effect of management alternative on fire risk to individual human communities was not consistent across the landscape. Our results highlight the value of the LANDIS model for identifying specific locations where interacting factors of land type and management strategy increase fire risk.

AB  - A strong earthquake (M (J) 6.9, M (W) 6.6-6.7) at about 11 km depth hit the western shore of the Noto Peninsula on Honshu, Japan, at about 00:42 coordinated universal time (9:42 A.M. local time) on 25 March 2007 (the Noto Hanto Earthquake in 2007). The earthquake triggered only 61 landslides, with most traveling short distances. It caused one long run-out landslide in the Nakanoya district of Monzen town, Wajima city, Ishikawa Prefecture, when a portion of a deep-seated landslide transformed into a moderate debris slide down a channel. The rock slide occurred on a south-facing convex-shaped slope on a small spur where earthquake ground shaking likely was strongly amplified by topography. A portion of the rock slide reached a small channel floored by materials containing abundant groundwater. Constant-volume box-shear tests on normally consolidated saturated specimens revealed that the apparent angle of internal friction of the channel-floor material was 33-36 degrees at 10-mm shear displacement and did not show much decrease in effective normal stress during shearing. In situ rock-sliding testing on the exposed channel materials showed a low kinetic-friction angle of about 21 degrees. We suggest that an unsaturated portion of the rock slide slid down the channel, with sliding between the rock-slide mass and the channel floor. Because the slope angle of the travel path nearly equaled the kinetic-friction angle, the unsaturated rock slide mass may have traveled at a moderately slow speed, or it might have decelerated and accelerated. Slow speed is supported by accounts from local residents that suggest movement of debris continued for 3 days after the main shock.

AB  - Background, aim and scope Transgenic oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.; OSR) is estimated to be environmentally and economically problematic because volunteers and ferals occur frequently and because of its hybridisation potential with several wild and weedy species. A proposed mitigation strategy aims to reduce survival, in particular in conventional OSR crops, by coupling the transgenic target modification with a dwarfing gene to reduce competitive fitness. Our study allowed us to access potential ecological implications of this strategy.
   Materials and methods On a large scale (> 500 km(2)), we recorded phenological and population parameters of oilseed rape plants for several years in rural and urban areas of Northern Germany (Bremen and surroundings). The characterising parameter were analysed for differences between wild and cultivated plants.
   Results In rural areas, occurrences of feral and volunteer OSR together had an average density of 1.19 populations per square kilometre, in contrast to urban areas where we found 1.68 feral populations per square kilometre on average. Throughout the survey, the vegetation cover at the locations with feral OSR ranged from less than 10% to 100%. Our investigations gave clear empirical evidence that feral OSR was, on average, at least 41% smaller than cultivated OSR, independent of phenological state after onset of flowering.
   Discussion The findings can be interpreted as phenotypic adaptation of feral OSR plants. Therefore, it must be asked whether dwarfing could be interpreted as an improvement of pre-adaptation to feral environments. In most of the sites where feral plants occurred, germination and establishment were in locations with disturbed vegetation cover, allowing initial growth without competition. Unless feral establishment of genetically modified dwarfed traits are specifically studied, it would not be safe to assume that the mitigation strategy of dwarfing also reduces dispersal in feral environments.
   Conclusions With respect to OSR, we argue that the proposed mitigation approach could increase escape and persistence of transgene varieties rather than reducing them. We conclude that the development of effective hazard mitigation measures in the risk evaluation of genetically modified organisms requires thorough theoretical and empirical ecological analyses rather than assumptions about abstract fitness categories that apply only in parts of the environment where the plant can occur.

CP  - 9th Multidisciplinary Conference on Sinkholes and the Engineering and Environmental Impacts of Karst
AB  - Karst development within Paleogene carbonate surfaces in Florida is prolific and ranges from early-stage dissolution of carbonate rocks along incipient fractures, to larger well-defined solution cavities with associated raveling zones and sinkholes, to stable sediment in-filled paleo-karst features. In west-central Florida, karst and sinkhole-related ground subsidence is responsible for extensive damage to urban structures and has in recent years become the focus of intense investigation. When evidence of subsurface karst features is found during ground subsidence investigations, distinguishing between active or reactivated paleo-karst and inactive paleo-karst features is important in determining whether sinkhole activity is a factor in ground movement and settlement damage to structures. This study examines two areas in Polk County, Florida experiencing subsidence damage where apparent paleo-karst features have been identified. Observational and subsurface drilling data from each site are presented. The data clearly show that the subsidence damage in one case is related to the reactivation of a deep-seated paleo-karst feature. At the other area, a shallow soil condition is the indicated cause of the settlement damage and the in-filled paleo-karst feature is stable. Knowledge of the occurrence and characteristics of these types of karst features is useful in identifying the causes of damage to structures in karst terrane.

AB  - Serious hazards have taken place in urban areas and road construction in Saudi Arabia because of the presence of accumulations of drifting sand dunes. Several researches, which carried out investigative work to solve this problem, were reviewed. Three locations of dune fields along the area between Jeddah and Al-Lith were investigated. The dune forms was identified. Detailed field investigations showed that barchan dunes are dominant in the area. The sands from the studied locations were found to be similar in grain size and shape parameters. Mineralogically, the sand reflects the composition of the surrounding igneous and metamorphic rocks. Regression analyses were performed and empirical relationships between dune height, width, windward length, slip-face length, and rate of movements were developed. Relatively strong relations exist between these parameters. The most important geometric parameter controlling dune movement with wind speed and direction is determined to be the dune height. A reasonable similarity occurs between the barchan dunes in the study area and those existing in Al Nufud, Al Jafurah sand seas, and Khulays area. The studied dune fields pose some natural hazards on the roads, and the surrounding buildings and constructions in the villages along the area between Jeddah and Al-Lith, especially during wind storms.

AB  - Groundwaters were sampled from four research boreholes, a private supply well and a natural karst resurgence in southern County Durham, England. Time series data sets of piezometric levels, groundwater major ions, and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were interpreted in the light of new geological mapping to assess the movement of groundwater and its potential for the dissolution of gypsum. Three distinct groundwater facies were identified representing contact with gypsiferous strata, dolomitic limestone and Quaternary Till. Piezometric data indicated time varying transverse flow across the gypsifeorus strata, which was confirmed from gradational mixing of groundwater types and cation ratios. Fluorescence of dissolved DOM identified variations in protein and fulvic-like acid fluorescence. The former was taken to represent surface derived, short-lived material. Spatial and temporal variations in protein fluorescence offered a means to trace groundwater movement along the regional groundwater gradient and indicated rapid lateral movement of groundwater. It was concluded that gypsum dissolution is occurring beneath the town of Darlington, however, the presence of a thick deposit of Quaternary till effectively confines the small head differences of approximately 1 m, across the gypsum strata beneath the town. Further to the south, the lowering of the ground surface results in a greater upwards flow of water across the gypsum and is used to explain the presence of historic collapse sinkholes.

AB  - Foraging theory in ecology has been useful for the analysis of patterns relating to the cost and benefit of looking for, harvesting and obtaining food, including the costs of searching for and manipulating food (or prey). Within foraging theory, Optimal Foraging Models have also been applied to the foraging behavior of fishermen. Such models are important tools for understanding the decision processes taken by fishermen, such as: how many patches (or fishing spots, grounds or sites) to exploit, how long to stay in a patch, the costs and benefits of visiting distant patches, which fish should be caught, and which fish should be sold or consumed. The criteria by which fishermen make decisions concerning the use of the river space and the use of the available fish diversity are important reference parameters for river management. We give two examples of the application of Optimal Foraging Models to the behavior of fishermen by studying two riverine communities in Brazil. The first, located in the Amazon, on the Negro River, in the city of Barcelos, and the second, located in southeastern Brazil, Sdo Paulo State, on the Piracicaba River, including two fishing communities: Santa Maria and Tanqud. Methods included sampling fish landings at known landing points, in local markets or at fishermen's houses. In the Amazon (Negro River), in Barcelos, we collected data from 79 fishing trips, at the main landing point, the fish market, in August 2001. On the Piracicaba River, data on fishing trips and fish landings covered 256 fishing trips, collected at fishermen's homes, from October 1994 to September 1995. The Optimal Foraging Models employed are Central Place Foraging Models, considering the travel time to the fishing spot (cost) and the quantity of fish caught (benefit). Such analyses show that the movement of fishermen to distant places is related to the fish-market value of target fish. Decision making processes underlying fishermen's movements are important to be taken into account for fishery management.

KW  - Before-and-after study
AB  - Unlike the typical stage-based policy commonly applied in Japan, the group-based control (often called movement-based in the traffic control industry in Japan) refers to such a control pattern that the controller is capable of separately allocating time to each signal group instead of stage based on traffic demand. In order to investigate its applicability at signalized intersections in Japan, an intersection located in Yokkaichi City of Mie Prefecture was selected as an experimental application site by the Japan Universal Traffic Management Society (UTMS). Based on the data collected at the intersection before and after implementing the group-based control policy respectively, this study evaluated the impacts of such a policy on driver behavior and intersection safety. To specify those impacts, a few models utilizing cycle-based data were first developed to interpret the occurrence probability and rate of red-light-running (RLR). Furthermore, analyses were performed on the yellow-entry time (Ye) of the last cleared vehicle and post encroachment time (PET) during the phase switching. Conclusions supported that the group-based control policy, along with certain other factors, directly or indirectly influenced the RLR behavior of through and right-turn traffics. Meanwhile, it has potential safety benefits as well, indicated by the declined Ye and increased PET values.

AB  - The central and northern parts of the Istrian Peninsula situated in the northwestern part of the Croatian Adriatic coast are formed within the Paleogene flysch rock complex. The flysch zone in the northeastern part of the peninsula borders with the Cicarija Mountain Range, which mostly consists of carbonate rocks. The occurrences of debris flows that cause huge damage to transport and other constructions are quite frequent. In this paper, we present the causes and triggering mechanisms of debris flows sporadically occurring in the Krbavcici village area near the city of Buzet. The potentially unstable soil mass formed by the erosion of the flysch bedrock fills the narrow and long ravines cut into the flysch bedrock all the way to the limestone slopes of the Cicarija Mountain Range. This paper describes in detail the occurrence of a particular debris flow along with its repetitive appearances in the period from the winter of 1979 until today. The debris flow mass damaged the road embankment and caused its downslope slide in the length of about 300 m in one night in the winter of 1979. The movement of the debris mass triggered in the ravine put into danger the bridge constructed over an old unstable zone in the winter of 2003, however fast intervention measures prevented the possible damage.

AB  - The 2nd century A.D. Roman annexation of the Nabataean Kingdom may have resulted in significant settlement disruption. Here we investigate the possibility that political refugees occupied Khirbet edh-Dharih after Roman takeover, using strontium isotope analysis of archaeological human dental enamel. We additionally discuss regional patterning of Sr-87/Sr-86 in western Jordan based on archaeological faunal dental enamel samples to understand strontium isotope spatial heterogeneity and to facilitate interpretation of the Dharih results. Strontium isotope analysis of small mammal dentition varied as expected based on bedrock geology, but small faunal sample sizes did not accurately reflect the broad range of biologically available strontium at Dharih. Only one person at Khirbet edh-Dharh appears to be non-local based on isotopic data. The status of the remaining individuals is unclear, as they could have originated from Dharih or the Nabataean capital city of Petra. Incorporating modem fauna and soil samples to establish the local value may assist in characterizing the local strontium in a geologically complex area such as Dharih. Futhermore, future analysis of elemental strontium to assess dietary composition and diagenetic contamination would facilitate interpretation of the strontium sources in the Dharih individuals.

AB  - Landslides are serious geologic disasters that threat human life and property in every country. In addition, landslides are one of the most important natural phenomena, which directly or indirectly affect countries' economy. Turkey is also the country that is under the threat of landslides. Landslides frequently occur in all of the Black Sea region as well as in many parts of Marmara, East Anatolia, and Mediterranean regions. Since these landslides resulted in destruction, they are ranked as the second important natural phenomenon that comes after earthquake in Turkey. In recent years several landslides happened after heavy rains and the resulting floods. This makes the landslide monitoring and mitigation techniques an important study subject for the related professional disciplines in Turkey. The investigations on surface deformations are conducted to define the boundaries of the landslide, size, level of activity and direction(s) of the movement, and to determine individual moving blocks of the main slide.
   This study focuses on the use of a kinematic deformation analysis based on Kalman Filtering at a landslide area near Istanbul. Kinematic deformation analysis has been applied in a landslide area, which is located to the north of Istanbul city. Positional data were collected using GPS technique. As part of the study, conventional static deformation analysis methodology has also been applied on the same data. The results and comparisons are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Contamination of groundwater in Merida, Yucatan, has increased in the last few years due to urban development growth. Therefore, it is necessary to know the processes that control solute transport in the unsaturated zone. The longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(L)) and the transverse dispersivity (a(T)) allow knowing the distribution of the solutes in the subsurface, which depend on the hydraulic conductivity. This paper presents the values of longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(L)), transverse dispersivity (a(T)), and of hydraulic conductivity (K) in conditions of saturation of 17 rock cores in the unsaturated zone of three places in Merida, Yucatan, using laboratory column tests. The values of aL, vary between 0.50 and 5.40 cm; the values of a(T) between 0.060 and 1.10 cm; and the values of hydraulic conductivity vary between 8.99 E-6 and 6.89 E-4 m/s. These values represent the minimum values that can be found underground due to the scale problem. In conclusion, the longitudinal (alpha(L)) and transverse (alpha(T)) dispersivities (a(T)) are influenced by solution micro-conduits and small fractures in the unsaturated zone. The flow of water and the transport of solutes occur mainly in the solution conduits, whereas longitudinal dispersivity dominates over transverse dispersivity in the unsaturated zone of Merida, Yucatan.

AB  - Estuaries are sites of port, industrial, urban and recreational development and also important to many forms of animal life. They often form sinks for sediment and thus for contaminants associated with the sediment which arise from anthropogenic activities in their hinterland and along their shores. These contaminants can adversely affect estuarine ecosystems and are the subject of international agreements on environmental protection. For both of these reasons, it is important to increase our knowledge of the distribution, concentration, controlling influences on, and impacts of, estuarine contamination. Evidence from around the world shows that although estuaries are sinks for contaminants from the terrestrial environment, there is significant transport of marine material up-estuary as bed load sediment whilst fine-grained terrestrial material may be transported seawards in suspension. Major movement of contaminants from estuaries onto the continental shelf probably occurs only during floods and storms and, in general, the impact on shelf seas is relatively minor and confined to the coastal zone. The chief exception to this rule is in the Far East where sediment from major Chinese rivers may be dispersed up to 300 kin across the shelf. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - We investigated movements of female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) roosting in maternity colonies in buildings in Fort Collins, Colorado (USA), during the summers of 2002, 2003, and 2005. This behavior can be of public health concern where bats that may carry diseases (e.g., rabies) move among buildings occupied by people. We used passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) to mark individual bats and hoop PIT readers at emergence points to passively monitor the use of building roosts by marked adult females on a daily basis during the lactation phase of reproduction. Multi-strata models were used to examine movements among roosts in relation to ambient temperatures and ectoparasite loads. Our results suggest that high ambient temperatures influence movements. Numbers of mites (Steatonyssus occidentalis) did not appear to in. uence movements of female bats among building roosts. In an urban landscape, periods with unusually hot conditions are accompanied by shifting of bats to different buildings or segments of buildings, and this behavior may increase the potential for contact with people in settings where, in comparison to their more regularly used buildings, the bats may be more likely to be of public concern as nuisances or health risks.

TI  - The Bristol Chamber of Commerce and the Port of Bristol, 1823-1848
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARITIME HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - This paper explores the attempts by the Bristol Chamber of Commerce (BCC) to improve the port and to promote the city's maritime and commercial interests during the quarter century from its foundation in 1823 to the municipalization of the docks in 1848. The discussion takes account of the three main bodies that shared the operation of the port in this period: the Corporation of Bristol, the Bristol Dock Company (BDC) and the Society of Merchant Venturers (SMV). In 1824 the BCC's campaign against high town dues succeeded in getting the levies reduced. It proved more difficult to pressurise the SMV and the BDC to reduce wharfage rates and dock dues, respectively. Nevertheless, the BCC's ability to place the matter of high port dues on the agenda for change pressured the Bristol Corporation to act further on this matter when municipal reorganization occurred in 1835.
   The BCC was at the forefront of the attention given to the operational problems and improvement of the port of Bristol. Its advocacy for a bridge over the River Avon at Clifton was taken up by I. K. Brunel, as was its challenge to the BDC to improve the scouring of the port and the flow of water in the floating harbour. The BCC gave important support to the free port movement in Bristol in the mid-1840s that led to municipal control of the docks. It also helped to persuade Bristol's commercial class about the measures needed to cultivate a forward-looking approach to the prosperity of Bristol and its region. The major failure of the BCC was the lack of detailed consideration to the costs of running the port, but that was a problem left unresolved by many nineteenth-century ports. Though the BCC did not succeed in all its aims, improvements to the port of Bristol might have taken longer without its lobbying over a quarter of a century.

AB  - That the Nazis never succeeded in extirpating the Socialist traditions of the German working class is attested to by the universality and vigour of the anti-fascist movement that sprang to life during the final days of the Second World War and during the first days and weeks of allied occupation. In almost every part of Germany, in every city or major town, and in thousands of the smaller towns and villages, there emerged ad-hoc 'antifascist committees' of Socialists, Communists and other antifascists who, with great energy and enthusiasm, set about restoring some degree of order out of the chaos into which Germany had been plunged by the collapse of the Nazi regime.
   For the most part these 'antifas' or 'action committees' focused their energies on the practical tasks of clearing rubble from the streets: taking control of remaining supplies of food: preventing looting: re-establishing supplies of gas, electricity and water; restoring telephone communications: and providing emergency health care to the desperate population. When time and resources allowed, they also engaged in political activities such as distributing antifascist literature, staging public meetings, and, above all, removing prominent Nazis from their posts in industry, local government and public services. Particularly in traditional strongholds of the Labour movement, the antifas played an important role during the transitional phase between the collapse of Nazi rule and the establishment of effective military government.(1)
   Though many of these committees were tiny, containing only a handful of individuals, some grew to a considerable size. At the end of April 1945, according to one account, the antifascist committee in Leipzig consisted of no fewer than thirty-eight local committees with 4500 members and 150,000 supporters, go per cent of whom were working class.' Just two weeks after its foundation, the antifain Bremen allegedly comprised fourteen local groups with 4625 members, with another fourteen groups and 2230 members in the surrounding countryside.(3)
   However, Germany's new masters, for reasons that are still debated, did not look kindly on these manifestations of the grass-roots, spontaneous political activism of the antifascist Left. The American, British and French occupiers either suppressed them immediately, or allowed them a few weeks of curtailed activity before shutting them down.(4) The Soviets might have been expected to be more tolerant of the antifas, partly because they were led in many cases by members of the Communist Party (KPD),(5) and partly because, during the war, the Soviets and exiled KPD leadership had frequently in their propaganda called upon the German people to form 'People's Committees' (Volksausschusse) to undertake precisely the same sort of tasks as the antifascist committees.(6) in the event, the Russians proved almost as unsympathetic to the antifas as their western counterparts, and, throughout the Soviet zone, the committees were closed down within the first days or weeks of occupation.(7).

AB  - Larval experience affects early post-metamorphic performance of a range of marine invertebrates, and even brief events during the larval stage can be important. One of the important larval stresses for organisms living in urban coastal environments is exposure to toxicants. Larvae may pass through patches of toxicants in their dispersal stage with the potential to affect their post-metamorphic performance. However, most studies on embryonic or larval tolerance to pollutants end at, or before, metamorphosis, have little follow-up and almost all are done under laboratory conditions. In this study, we tested whether short-term larval exposure to copper has short- and long-term carry-over effects in the encrusting bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata by following settlement and metamorphosis in the laboratory, then transplanting colonies into the field, in 2 seasons and at 2 sites in SE Australia. Cu at 100 mug l(-1) accelerated larval attachment in winter and summer, but inhibited metamorphosis. When transplanted to the field, juveniles survived and grew well, and effects on survival and growth did not appear until several weeks or months after settlement. Larval exposure to Cu reduced survival of colonies to about 2/3 that of control colonies in summer and at 1 site, reduced survival to about 20% that of controls in winter. The fall in survivorship occurred abruptly after 3 to 5 wk in summer and 14 wk in winter. The surviving colonies grew more slowly than the controls. In general, there was little temporal variation in Cu effects, but there was spatial variation in effects on survival and growth of colonies within and between sites.

AB  - In February 1913, once the Ten Tragic Days in the history of this turmoil period had occurred, Victoriano Huerta became president of Mexico. Since the United States did not consider his government as legitimate, it did not acknowledge him as head of the country. Besides, rebellion was spread in the city as well as in the rural areas. Therefore, he decided to impose a military government. From the original 33 000 soldiers in the army at the beginning of his administration, he increased the troops to 80 000. In moments of despair, he even announced his intention to raise the figure to 150 000 or 250 000 soldiers so as to crush his opponents, although nobody knew how he was going to get them. In such background, a group of a few generals led to the militarization of the country by means of occupying the government of the states, as well as senatorships and federal deputy designations. As far as policies projects, Huerta challenged the United States by posing the threat to nationalize the oil industry. He even suggested the possibility to militarize bureaucracy and public schools. Luckily for his plans, in the army there was no fracture at all, although in the navy things were different. Eventually, however, American invasion to Veracruz brought about the triumph of the constitutionalist movement and, so, Huerta had to quit and leave the country.

AB  - Electronic streams appear to be most illuminating when they fail or break down. At these moments, they make apparent our desire of wanting to keep continuity, to experience things uninterruptedly. In the contemporary artistic environment marked by electronic pulses and lightscapes, the flickering screen, with its conflicting modes of engagement, provides the thinking of a limit and erasure. Philippe Parreno's analogue line animation What Do You Believe, Your Eyes or My Words? Speaking Drawing: ... (2007) inhabits such a corruptive site of,no single continuing line' where the various time structures inherent to the work resist to create unity, both in terms of the work's spatiality and its relation to our sense of time. In Semiconductor's digital piece Inaudible Cities: Part One (2002) the flickering strips the image of the failed electronic stream, its supposedly essential element. The animated cityscape presents us with yet another kind of electronic light movement co-dependent on the sonic pressures of an electrical storm. What is expressed is the process of image-forming itself, the image's potential for self-variation which is linked to imagination and Brian Massumi's 'vagueness of the virtual'. Referring to notions such as Gilles Deleuze's 'point flicker' or Massumi's 'imaginative and non-systemic, the article addresses the sensation of flickering as an experience of spacing and rupturing inherent to animation. Not only does this sensation propose animation as an often paradoxical work, but, proposing a particular site its image can occupy, it allows us to think of the animated image as an erasure itself, with its potential of becoming art.

AB  - Cellular Automata (CA) is an effective method for simulating complex natural and artificial systems, which is able to evaluate various processes. For the Purpose of analyzing Bianloo landslide, and to determine its sliding characteristics (height of run-up, sliding surface, length of sliding and movement, and so on), a two dimensional CA model with square shape cells was selected as the analytical tool, together with an algorism pertinent to this approach. Bianloo landslide occurred in 1995 after a heavy rainfall which made it saturated. This landslide is located near a village in Bijar city in kordestan province in Iran. This landslide is predominantly composed of clay and fine sand. For determining mechanical and physical properties of the landslide a back analysis was carried out using Slope/w program, and C, phi and gamma were estimated 8 kpa, 20 degrees and 18 kn/m(3) respectively. For simulation of the landslide by CA, the landslide cross-section was divided to 10 x 10 cells (in meters) and using the selected algorism, the sliding soil of each central cell was distributed to the neighboring cells, and finally, the simulated cross section was determined which is comparable to the true landslide cross-section. The effect of cell dimension was also examined in this study and the appropriate dimensions were proposed. A computer program was prepared for the performing the analysis on the basis of CA method. The results obtained in this analysis showed a very good agreement with the reality.

AB  - Objective: Although organizations may initially adopt and implement interventions, the institutionalization of these interventions does not always occur. The purpose of this article is to provide an example describing the breakdown in the dissemination process using an accepted conceptualization and measurement of institutionalization. We also suggest an approach for understanding the movement of the intervention through the dissemination process to improve the likelihood of institutionalization. Methods: Through the Controlling Asthma in American Cities Project in St. Louis, the institutionalization of evidence-based interventions was measured in multiple settings. Specifically, data from three school districts were measured and presented. External implementation and financial support for the intervention were phased out and internal support by the districts was phased in after 2 years of implementation. Representatives for the districts and the schools were asked to complete the Levels of Institutionalization (Loln) scales instrument measuring the institutionalization of these interventions. Results: The Loln scale data demonstrate increasing routinization and saturation mean scores for all school districts in the first 2 years, with decreasing scores in district A in year 3. District A did not have external facilitation of implementation and support in year 3, which is reflected in the decreasing scores. Institutionalization did not occur in the conduct of formal evaluation, the presence of job descriptions, and the presence of similar and permanent funding in all three districts. Conclusion: We propose an approach to help identify and measure processes of dissemination through continuous quality improvement, increasing the likelihood that interventions are institutionalized.

AB  - On 18 July 2004, a localized heavy rainfall occurred in the Fukui area, where is located on the Japan-Sea side of the Japan Islands, in conjunction with the intensified Baiu-front. The Fukui heavy rainfall resulted in many disasters, e.g., landslide, debris flow, dyke-break and flood, especially in the Reihoku district of Fukui prefecture. One of the most disasters was caused by the water from a broken dyke of Asuwa river in Fukui city. Moreover, a lot of disasters of the fields and the houses by the flood and the debris flow occurred in the upstream region in the Asuwa river. This paper discusses the Fukui heavy rainfall from a view point of remote sensing. Remote sensing data of Goes 9, MODIS, ASTER, IKONOS and Aerial orthophotograph are used. The movement of the cloud by Goes 9 images shows the place and the time of the downpour. The height of the cloud at the downpour is estimated by using MODIS thermal band data. The false color images and the NDVI images of ASTER and IKONOS before and after the downpour are used to detect the damage area. The false color images and the NDVI images of ASTER and IKONOS are useful for the disaster detection of the heavy rainfall, because the influence of plant and muddy water can be used.

AB  - Context Although human rights abuses have been reported in Iraq, the full scope of these abuses has not been well documented.
   Objective To assess the prevalence of human rights abuses since 1991 in southern Iraq, along with attitudes about women's health and human rights and women's rights and roles in society, to inform reconstruction and humanitarian assistance efforts in Iraq.
   Design Cross-sectional, randomized survey of Iraqi men and women conducted in July 2003 using structured questionnaires.
   Setting Three major cities in 3 of the 9 governorates in southern Iraq.
   Participants A total of 1991 respondents representing 16520 household members.
   Main Outcome Measures Respondent demographics, information on human rights abuses that occurred among household members since 1991, women's health and human rights, opinions regarding women's rights and roles in society, and conditions for community health and development.
   Results Respondents were a mean age of 38 years and were mostly of Arab ethnicity (99.7% [1976/1982]) and Muslim Shi'a (96.7% [1906/1971]). Overall, 47% of those interviewed reported 1 or more of the following abuses among themselves and household members since 1991: torture, killings, disappearance, forced conscription, beating, gunshot wounds, kidnappings, being held hostage, and ear amputation, among others. Seventy percent of abuses (408/586) were reputed to have occurred in homes. Baath party regime-affiliated groups were identified most often (95% [449/475]) as the perpetrators of the abuses; 53% of the abuses occurred between 1991 and 1993, following the Shi' a uprising, and another 30% between 2000 and the first 6 months of 2003. While the majority of men and women expressed support for women's equal opportunities for education, freedom of expression, access to health care, equality in deciding marriage and the number and spacing of children, and participation in community development decisions, there was less support among both men and women for women's freedom of movement, association with people of their choosing, and rights to refuse sex. Half of women and men (54% and 50%, respectively) reported agreeing that a man has the right to beat his wife if she disobeys. Fifty-three percent of respondents reported that there were reasons to restrict educational opportunities for women at the present time and 50% reported that there were reasons to restrict work opportunities for women at the present time.
   Conclusions Nearly half of participating households in 3 southern cities in Iraq reported human rights abuses among household members between 1991 and 2003. The households surveyed supported a government that will protect and promote human rights, including the rights of women. However, currently, neither men nor women appear to support a full range of women's human rights.

LA  - English
AB  - This article covers the tortuous political journey of the East Timorese from 1974, traversing the last quarter century of brutal Indonesian occupation. It outlines the political antecedents of the National Council of Trimorese Resistance (CNRT) and assesses the leadership role of Xanana Gusmao as its president. Fretilin, the pro-independence front, formed the basis of the resistance to Indonesian occupation into the late 1970s, until it was devastated by Indonesian military repression. In March 1981, after several difficult years of reorganization, a National Conference resulted in an overhaul of resistance structures. Xanana Gusmao was elected president of the new National Council for Revolutionary Resistance (CRRN), and commander in chief of Falintil, Fretilin's armed wing. In 1987, increasingly frustrated by internal political wrangling, Xanana declared Falintil to be non-partisan and established the National Council of Maubere Resistance (CNRM), a nationalist umbrella council that he hoped would encompass all resistance forces. With Jose Ramos Horta as the special representative of CNRM abroad and a growing urban-based clandestine movement, the struggle developed a more sophisticated and international diplomatic face. This new dynamic of inclusiveness and non-partisan nationalist strategy, born with CNRM, matured with the creation of the CNRT in 1998. With an even broader support base CNRT offered voting rights to all major political parties and to nationalist, cultural, and religious groupings both inside and outside East Timer. Xanana Gusmao has recently passionately asserted CNRT and Falintil's place in the future independent Timer Loro'sae.

AB  - Campi Flegrei caldera has a long history of large surface deformation, with displacements of several meters in the 1970s and early 1980s. Its location within a densely populated urban area underscores the importance of understanding the relationship between large and episodic deformation events and their source mechanisms. The primary observable of the caldera's activity is its surface deformation. Classical geodetic approaches such as leveling, have been complemented by the more advanced measurements of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry. In this work we focus on the Campi Flegrei caldera uplift event that occurred from early spring to late summer 2000. Our goal is to highlight the potential to integrate interferometric SAR (IFSAR), GPS, and classical leveling data for ground deformation studies and source modeling. We compare models for the deformation source constrained by inversion of the differential IFSAR data (DIFSAR) with the model's prediction for the GPS and leveling data. Resolution of possible changes in the source mechanism for Campi Flegrei caldera are limited by differences in the temporal, spatial and deformation component strengths of each data set. In the future, overcoming these data deficiencies will be important for resolving the dynamics of volcano systems and for volcanic hazard mitigation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The western part of the Gulf of Corinth attracts attention due to its seismically active fault system and considerable seismic hazard. Detailed studies of the seismic activity of the region have been carried out especially as part of the so-called Corinth Rift Laboratory (CRL) Project. For standard earthquake locations, the CRL uses the HYPO algorithm and a special structural model that is composed of homogeneous layers (Rigo et al., 1996). This model was derived from a passive seismic experiment in a broader area around the western part of the Gulf A significant part of the seismic activity is concentrated close to the town of Aigion, which was damaged by a strong earthquake in 1995. A sequence of smaller earthquakes occurred to the south of this town in the year 2001. In the present paper, we have used this sequence to derive an improved structural model for the region in the vicinity of the town of Aigion. This new model is based on the minimization of travel-time residuals. In particular, we used arrival times from a subset of 88 events recorded by at least 5 stations of the southern part of the CRL network had magnitudes of over 2.3, and were recorded at the nearest station (station code AIO). A variant of the method of conjugate gradients has been used for this purpose. In comparison with the model derived by Rigo et al. (1996), the new model is characterized by a higher v(p)/v(s) velocity ratio and by higher velocities to a depth of about 7 k7n. The new model was derived with the aim to get more accurate locations of future events in the vicinity of the town of Aigion.

AB  - Four scleractinian coral taxa are described from limestones within a sandstone-shale sequence correlated with the Late Triassic Babulu Formation, Manatuto township, on the northern coast of Timor-Leste (East Timor). The coral fauna consists of three phaceloid taxa, Paravolzeia timorica gen. et sp. nov., Craspedophyllia ramosa sp. nov., Margarosmilia confluens (Munster), and a generically indeterminate solitary taxon attributed to the family Margarophylliidae. All four corals are related at various taxonomic levels to Carman faunas from the Dolomites of northern Italy. Previously, only Norian coral faunas were known from the Triassic of Timor. The fauna exhibits both similarities to and differences from Carnian faunas of the Dolomites and helps confirm palaeogeographic affinities with the western Tethys, although during Late Triassic time Timor lay in the distant southeastern portal of the Tethys. Despite isolation from the western Tethys, the presence of two species found also in the Dolomites indicates that larval dispersal occurred between the two areas.

AB  - This paper describes tectonic and metamorphic features of Precambrian rocks from the Guaxupe Complex and Varginha Shear Zone (VSZ) near the city of Guaxupe in the southern part of the Sao Francisco Craton, southeastern Brazil. The VSZ separates the metasediments of Araxa Group to the north from the granulites of Guaxupe Complex to the south. The sinistral transcurrent VSZ crosses the entire area striking approximately E-W, bending towards SE in the eastern part. Because of this bend, transpressional movement occurred, facilitating the exhumation of the garnet-rich rocks of the deepest exposed part of the granulite-facies terrane.
   In the garnet granulites the highest pressure-temperature conditions recorded are approximately 1040 degreesC and 14.4 kbar. The rocks underwent decompression from 14.0 kbar to 8.0 kbar, cooling from 980 degreesC to 710 degreesC, the retrograde path following the boundary between the kyanite and sillimanite stability fields. This interval is interpreted to record the uplift of the lower crustal granulite-facies terrane and re-equilibration during magmatic intrusions. For the felsic granulites an interval of 700-810 degreesC and 8.0-11.5 kbar was attained, also pointing to regional decompression.
   The granulites of the Guaxupe Complex comprise a medium- to high-pressure lower-crustal terrane, with local occurrences of higher-pressure garnet-rich gneisses, which were uplifted along a transpressional segment of the VSZ. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Heisei-eruption of Mt. Unzen had started on November 17 in 1990 and continued in the beginning of 1995. Dangerous volcanic phenomena such as pyro-clastic flows and debris flows had occurred intermittently during the eruption, resulting in 44 of casualties and 2,511 destroyed houses. Though no one had experienced and estimated the occurrences of such events, the central government of Japan and the Nagasaki prefecture government soon started to ensure the appropriate measures for reducing the expansion of disasters. The first approaches were preparation of hazard-map for evacuation and execution of temporary works such as sediment removal and sensor installation. Furthermore, they had developed many new methods such as unmanned construction and executed the measures to mitigate debris flows and pyro-clastic flows disasters. The measures were based on three viewpoints; (1) We have to cope with various phenomena by them. (2) They should be executed in short term. (3) The safety of workers has to be ensured. Inhabitants, academic persons and administrators had coped with the Mt. Unzen volcanic disaster in cooperation. As a result of the execution of the measures, the safety zone of life in the Shimabara city was restored and the communities were reconstructed. Thus, the preventive measures in Mt. Unzen were successful. Recently there is destruction of social infrastructures by volcanic disasters in the world. I can introduce the volcanic sabo work executed by the central and local governments in Mt. Unzen as a model case of the mitigation or prevention measures against volcanic disasters.

TI  - Estimating the impact of seasonal truck shortages on the movement of time-sensitive, perishable products - Transportation cost minimization approach

LA  - English
CP  - 84th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - This research focuses on the frequent and persistent problem of truck shortages for time-sensitive, perishable produce shipment out of the Pacific Northwest. Washington State is the number one apple-producing state in the United States, accounting for more than 2.7 million tons of apples per year valued in excess of $1 billion. However, without timely and accessible transportation to move the product from production to the consumer's table, the value to apple producers and the state's economy diminishes rapidly. This research aims to identify and quantify the change in total transportation cost that occurs as a result of seasonal truck shortages and associated rate increases and to provide an avenue for evaluating changes in specific destination markets, modal changes, and market competitiveness. A cost-minimizing optimization model is used to represent apple shipments from 29 producing supply points to 16 domestic markets and three international export markets over four seasons for two modes (truck and rail). Total transportation costs increase nearly $12 million as a result of truck shortages, from $245.6 million without shortages to $257.5 million under the current seasonal situation. Overall (across all seasons), the export markets of Nogales, Arizona; McAllen, Texas; and the Port of Seattle, Washington, are most affected by the truck shortages, followed by domestic markets near Seattle and San Francisco, California. The large markets of New York City, New York, and Los Angeles, California also experience relatively large increases in transportation cost per ton mile.

AB  - The Amazcala caldera is located 30 km NE of Queretaro City, near Amazcala, state of Queretaro. This caldera is the northernmost caldera within the central sector of the Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB). It has a 11 X 14 km(2) elliptical shape, and was formed 7.3-6.6 Ma ago. All caldera products are rhyolites. The oldest caldera unit, the Ezequiel Montes pumice (EMP), is a widespread pumice fallout emplaced around 7.3 Ma ago. An isopach map of the EMP shows two dispersal axes, oriented to the SW and SE with respect to the caldera. The EMP is 5 m thick 40 kin to the SW and 35 km to the SE of the caldera. An isopleth map of the EMP shows that pumice fragments increase in size toward the caldera, from I cm at 40 km to 25 cm near the caldera rim. The EMP is a regional stratigraphic marker. The Colon ignimbrite, dated at 7.3 +/- 0.5 Ma, is stratigraphically above the EMP. It consists of several ash-flow units interbedded with minor pumice fall lapilli and ash, with a minimum thickness of about 80 m at Colon. The caldera rim is occupied by several rhyolite lava domes and flows, some of which extend 10 km from the rim. These domes contain parts of fresh, aphyric obsidian. The last caldera event is an intracaldera rhyolitic dome near the NE rim at about 6.6 Ma. The dome is 4 X 2 km(2) and is elongated in the NE direction. The Amazcala caldera is 480 km from the Middle America Trench and represents the farthest inland caldera in the central sector of the MVB. Its a age of 7.3-6.6 Ma indicates that it is the oldest caldera of the MVB so far reported. This confirms the general view that the volcanic activity of the MVB initiated at its northern margin, and then migrated southward in time. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We used a simulation model to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of a potential rabies outbreak in an immunized fox population after the termination of a long-term, large-scale vaccination program with two campaigns per year one in spring and one in autumn. The 'worst-case' scenario of rabies resurgence occurs if rabies has persisted at a low prevalence despite control and has remained undetected by a customary surveillance program or if infected individuals invade to the control area. Even if the termination of a vaccination program entails such a risk of a subsequent new outbreak, prolonged vaccination of a wild host population is expensive and the declining cost-benefit ratio over time eventually makes it uneconomic. Based on the knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of a potential new outbreak gained from our modelling study, we suggest "terminating but observing" to be an appropriate strategy. Simulating the decline of population immunity without revaccination, we found that a new outbreak of rabies should be detected by customary surveillance programs within two years after the termination of the control. The time until detection does not depend on whether Vaccination was terminated within the fourth, fifth or sixth years of repeated biannual campaigns. But it is faster if the program was completed with an autumn campaign (because next-year dispersal then occurs after a noticeable decrease in population immunity). Finally, if a rabid fox is detected after terminating vaccination, we determine a rule for defining a circular hazard area based on the simulated spatial spread of rabies. The radius of this area should be increased with the time since the last vaccination campaign. The trade-off between the number of foxes potentially missed by the emergency treatment and the cost for the emergency measures in an enlarged hazard area was found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

KW  - WEATHER RADAR
AB  - In the late afternoon on Friday 9 March 2001, a severe storm occurred on the south side of Brisbane. Peak intensity reached more than 210 mm/h, and total rainfall up to 200 mm occurred over a period of 3 hours. Extensive flooding was recorded at a number of locations in the Norman Creek catchment. This and other localised storm events have highlighted the need for real-time flood forecasting to increase the awareness of and preparedness for flash floods in urbanised areas, and to minimise the damage and disruption as a result of flash floods in the tropical and sub-tropical environments. A real-time forecasting system is developed using ensemble probabilitybased rainfall forecasts coupled with an efficient raster-based hydrologic model to forecast water levels at critical locations for dissemination on the internet. Forecasting of flash flood involves interrogating ALERT/telemetry data on gauge rainfall and water levels in the catchment, processing and interpreting radar scans to determine the storm's spatial structure and movement, numerical weather prediction up to 30-90 min into the future, generating multiple realisations of likely rain fields, predicting multiple hydrographs from forecast rain fields, and converting hydrographs into probability-based water level forecasts at critical locations in the catchment. The design is critically constrained by the requirement to update the forecast on the internet every 15 minutes. The paper reports a retrospective test using the gauge and radar data for the March 2001 event in the 28 km(2) Norman Creek catchment.

AB  - The symbolic appropriation of mountains may be a universal phenomenon, yet it can also be highly specific to one religion or confession, located in one region and historical context. An interesting case in point is "Catholic Alpinism" in the Italian Alps. This popular movement began around the mid-19th century, when some curates, based in upland communities, some educators and some urban priests identified the mountains as a place for wholesome enjoyment and austere education. It was not that the Catholic world had totally lacked an interest in the mountains before. But in order to create a new way of mountaineering, it was necessary, first of all, to change the negative image of mountains which had taken root in European culture and had been codified during the early modem period. After the change occurred, the number of priest-scientists exploring the Alps increased steadily. Yet for "Catholic Alpinism" to take off, other meanings had to be read into the mountains. Crucial was the challenge by the British: Catholic Alpinism set in as an alternative to the expansion of British sporting alpinism (based more on Protestant creeds), and later, to increasingly extreme forms of physical effort and political nationalism. The Catholic form represented a different way of using the mountains. "The rocks should be a path to virtue," stated one Italian theologian in 1921. Seventy years later, and against the background of a completely changed ideological and political situation, another theologian maintained that alpinism would only have a future if a return to spirit" occurred.

CP  - 84th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - Many state and local transportation agencies install nontraversable medians on multilane highways to improve safety and travel times and to manage local access better. While nontraversable medians restrict direct left-turn access to and from adjacent developments, traffic destined for these locations must use alternate routes, some of which may involve making U-turns at nearby median openings-a movement often referred to as an indirect left turn. Until recently, the safety effects of increased U-turn volumes have been largely unknown. NCHRP Project 17-21, Safety of U-Turns at unsignalized Median Openings, documented the safety performance and operational effects of U-turns at median openings. This paper presents the key findings from that research. It presents a summary of key literature and current highway agency practice related to median openings, a detailed classification scheme for median openings, and a summary of the results of comprehensive field studies. The research results indicate that access management strategies that increase U-turn volumes at unsignalized median openings can be used safely and effectively. Analysis of accident data found that accidents related to U-turn and left-turn maneuvers at unsignalized median openings occur infrequently. In urban arterial corridors, unsignalized median openings experienced an average of 0.41 U-turn-plus-left-turn accidents per median opening per year. In rural arterial corridors, unsignalized median openings experienced an average of 0.20 U-turn-plus-left-turn accidents per median opening per year. On the basis of these limited accident frequencies, there is no indication that U-turns at unsignalized median openings are a major safety concern.

AB  - Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides in both agricultural and urban environments, and their potential movement to surface streams and toxicity to susceptible aquatic species is an emerging concern. Natural surface waters usually contain low levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM), Limited data have shown that DOM preparations can significantly alter the bioavailabiliry and toxicity effects of pyrethroids. However, the importance of these effects in natural waters has not been investigated. In this study we measured uptake and acute toxicity of permethrin and cyfluthrin by Daphnia species in 15 surface water samples. Low levels of DOM (320 mg L-1) inhibited cyfluthrin uptake by Daphnia magna and acute toxicity to Ceriadaphnia dubia in most samples. For permethrin, the effects of DOM on bioavailability and toxicity were generally not significant. The effects of DOM on bioavailablity of cyfluthrin could not be explained from the DOC concentration alone, suggesting that properties of DOM were also important in regulating bioavailability. Regression of K-DOC with selected DOM properties revealed significant dependence of K-DOC on the carboxylic acid content of DOM. Moreover, concentrations sensed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers were well correlated with the observed changes in bioaccumulation by D. magna and acute toxicity to C dubia. Therefore, selective sampling methods such as SPME may be used for measuring the bioavailable concentrations of pyrethroids in waters with naturally occurring DOM levels and predicting the actual toxicity effects.

AB  - Considerable investment has been made in recent years in improvements to the microbiological quality of urban wastewater discharges to surface waters, particularly in coastal towns, with the aim of reducing the exposure of bathers and surfers to gastrointestinal pathogens. As this source of pollution has come under greater control, attention has started to focus on diffuse catchment sources of faecal contamination which have been shown to be dominant during high river flows associated with storm events. This association with storm events suggests that rapidly responding hydrological pathways such as overland flow are likely to be important. The aim of this paper is to establish the current state of knowledge of pathogen transport processes in overland flow. In addition, the paper will attempt to convey the way that soil erosion science may aid our understanding of this environmental problem. The scale and nature of faecal waste applications to land in the UK is briefly reviewed, with data presented on both livestock slurry and manure, and human sewage sludge. Particular emphasis is placed on factors influencing the likelihood of pathogens making their way from infected livestock and humans to the soil surface, and therefore the chances of them being available for transport by overland flow. The literature relating to pathogen transport in overland flow is reviewed. Existing pathogen transport models treat pathogens as particles and link pathogen transport models to pathogen die-off kinetics. Such models do not attempt to describe the interactions that may occur between pathogens and soil and waste particles. Although conceptual models describing the possible states in which pathogen transport may occur have been proposed, an understanding of the factors controlling the partitioning of the microorganisms between the different states is only just beginning to emerge. The apparent poor performance of overland flow mitigation measures such as grass buffer strips in controlling the movement of faecal indicators highlights the need for a better understanding the dynamics of microbial transport so that better management approaches may be developed. Examples of on-going research into overland flow transport processes are briefly described and gaps in knowledge identified.

AB  - This article is an attempt to analyse the strategic geographical location of the Straits of Melaka, which was used by seafarers and traders travelling from the East and the West. The strategic position of the Straits of Melaka controlling the movement of the world trade in the East, which is rich in mineral resources, and its strategic location between China and mainland India was known since the Srivijaya era. Subsequently this strength was fully utilised by the Malay kingdom in Melaka, the Achenese in Sumatra and the Johor kingdom in Riau. Nevertheless, the strategic position of the port of Melaka and Riau that controlled the world trade finally led to their downfall when both port towns were occupied by the three European powers (Riau was occupied by the Dutch after the 1784 war). The significant role of the Straits of Melaka also became a dispute factor between the three European powers (Portuguese, Dutch and English). Thus, whichever power succeeded in controlling the Straits ofIfelaka, it will he the one that would hold the power to regulate the movement of the world trade, which was a lucrative and profitable business.

AB  - The taxonomy of the North American big-eared bats, genus Corynorhinus, was revised by Handley [Handley, C.O., 1959. A revision of the American bats of the genera Euderma and Plecotus. Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus. 110, 95-246] using a morphological systematics approach. Handley employed 17 morphological characters and identified only four characters that reliably differentiated the three species he recognized, C. townsendii, C. rafinesquii, and C. mexicanus. All three species have been shown to lead relatively sedentary lives and have a wing morphology that limits long-distance dispersal. Further, populations of two species, C. townsendii and C. rafinesquii, are considered to be declining. Handley [Handley, C.O., 1959. A revision of the American bats of the genera Euderma and Plecotus. Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus. 110, 95-246] recognized five subspecies of C. townsendii (C. t. australis, C. t. ingens, C. t. pallescens, C. t. tolmsendii, and C. t. virginianus) and two of C. rafinesquii (C. r. rafinesquii and C. r. macrotis). Two C. townsendii subspecies, C. t. ingens and C t. virginianus, are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. These facts and the lack of a thorough molecular systematic examination of this genus were the impetus for this study. Using mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA sequences, a molecular phylogeny was inferred. The combined DNA phylogeny supports Handley's [Handley, C.O., 1959. A revision of the American bats of the genera Euderma and Plecotus. Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 110, 95-246] designation of three species. Further the endangered subspecies, C t. ingens and C t. virginianus are corroborated, as were the monophyly of the other subspecies. However, the geographical ranges of two of these subspecies, C. t. pallescens and C. t. townsendii, are revised based on biogeographic distributions as understood from our results. Estimates of timing of divergences indicate that the three species, C. townsendii, C. rafinesquii, and C. mexicanus may have diverged before Pleistocene climatic oscillations began, and therefore their cladogenesis was not the result of those processes. However, subspecific divergences within C. townsendii appear to have occurred during and been driven largely by the climatic processes of the Pleistocene Epoch. We propose new hypotheses of dispersal scenarios that may have led to the current biogeography of these lineages. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial representativeness of gauging stations was investigated in two low-mountainous river basins near the city of Trier, southwest Germany. Longitudinal profiles during low and high flow conditions were sampled in order to identify sources of solutes and to characterize the alteration of flood wave properties during its travel downstream. Numerous hydrographs and chemographs of natural flood events were analysed in detail. Additionally, artificial flood events were investigated to study in-channel transport processes.
   During dry weather conditions the gauging station was only representative for a short river segment upstream, owing to discharge and solute concentrations of sources contiguous to the measurement site. During artificial flood events the kinematic wave velocity was considerably faster than the movement of water body and solutes, refuting the idea of a simple mixing process of individual runoff components. Depending on hydrological boundary conditions, the wave at a specific gauge could be entirely composed of old in-channel water, which notably reduces the spatial representativeness of a sampling site. Natural flood events were characterized by a superimposition of local overland flow, riparian water and the kinematic wave process comprising the downstream conveyance of solutes. Summer floods in particular were marked by a chronological occurrence of distinct individual runoff components originating only from a few contributing areas adjacent to the stream and gauge. Thus, the representativeness of a gauge for processes in the whole basin depends on the distance of the nearest significant source to the station. The consequence of our study is that the assumptions of mixing models are not satisfied in river basins larger than 3 km(2). Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We conducted a palaeoseismic study with geomorphologic mapping, geophysical prospecting and trenching along an 8-km-long NNE-SSW trending fault scarp south of Basel. The city as well as 40 castles within a 20-km radius were destroyed or heavily damaged by the earthquake of 1356 October 18 (Io = IX-X), the largest historical seismic event in central Europe. Active river incisions as well as late Quaternary alluvial terraces are uplifted along the linear Basel-Reinach (BR) fault scarp. The active normal fault is comprised of at least two main branches reaching the surface as evident by resistivity profiles, reflection seismic data and direct observations in six trenches. In trenches, the normal fault rupture affects three colluvial wedge deposits up to the base of the modern soil. Radiocarbon as well as thermoluminescence (TL) age determinations from other trenches helped to reconstruct the Holocene event chronology. We identified three seismic events with an average coseismic movement of 0.5-0.8 m and a total vertical displacement of 1.8 m in the last 7800 yr and five events in the last 13 200 yr. The most recent event occurred in the interval AD 500-1450 (2sigma) and may correspond to the 1356 earthquake. Furthermore, the morphology suggests both a southern and northern fault extensions that may reach 20 km across the Jura mountains and across the Rhine valley. Taking this fault length and a 10-km-thick seismogenic layer suggests a Mw 6.5 or greater event as a possible scenario for the seismic hazard assessment of the Basel region.

AB  - Objective To investigate how the use of different lec technologies, organizational structures, and task control determine the health-disease process in workers.
   Methods The study was developed in two glass industries, one automated and the other manual, in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil, between 1996 and 1997. Ergonomics methods were used as main principles underlying the techniques of data collection. The techniques applied, were case study and group comparisons, including a direct observation of the work condition, interviews and a questionnaire answered by all 41 workers of the workplaces studied: operators of automated machines (27 workers) and manual glass blow operators (14 workers). The questions were about their jobs and workplace characteristics and health complaints. The data were analyzed using Epi Info 6.
   Results The comparison between the two group of workers showed statistically significant differences in relation to workers' perceptions about excessive noise. work tools, posture while performing their work and complaints of pain in the arms. There were also identjfied differences in risk factors: movement repetition seen in the manual industry and those related to work organization in both industries, such as work rhythm, employees' participation in important decisions and training.
   Conclusions The use an ergonomics methodology was perfectly adequate. Manual industry workers seem to play a role that makes them feel they have an important participation in the work process, as they performed a significant part of the total work. contrasting with automatic industry workers, which task is only of supervising the process, where the machine is the actual producer.

AB  - In recent debates on the regulation and governance of contemporary capitalism and its territorial form, there is an emerging consensus that successful economic development is contingent on a movement away from the nation-state and policy interventions at the national scale toward subnational institutional frameworks and supports. In effect, both an 'institutional turn' and a 'scalar turn' appear to be occurring, through which the heterogeneity of economic growth may be explored. The author scrutinises these claims by examining what is becoming known as 'new regionalist' orthodoxy in economic development. This orthodoxy is particularly powerful because its concerns for resolving economic and democratic deficit by harnessing the regional scale are supported by academics, politicians, and policymakers alike. Focusing on England's Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), a radical initiative in regional economic governance, the author argues for a need to rethink the nation-state and the processes through which its intervention is being scaled. RDAs have been given a remit to enhance economic and social development, but rather than their providing decentralised 'partnerships for prosperity', a number of contradictions and tensions are revealed. These indicate that England's own brand of new regionalism is heavily steered by political fiat and central government dictate. To inform new regionalist debates, the author consequently argues that a new (regional) scale of state power is emerging and RDAs are forming part of a political strategy aimed at resealing, instead of resolving, an economic and democratic deficit. The author concludes by calling for a closer engagement in political-economic geography between state theory, crisis theory, and the scaling of state power and suggests a need to formulate a fourth-cut theory of crisis.

TI  - Late holocene earthquakes on the aeropuerto fault, Managua, Nicaragua

AB  - Managua, capital of Nicaragua, is built on the shore of Lake Managua, within a densely faulted graben at a major discontinuity in the Central American volcanic chain. Shallow moderate earthquakes (M-s 6-6:2) ruptured faults with devastating effect at the heart of urban Managua in 1931 and 1972, and damaging earthquakes are cataloged in the earlier history of the surrounding region. The Aeropuerto fault is a major structure in the Managua Graben, but like other faults in this area its behavior is little understood. Paleoseismic investigations now suggest that the most recent large earthquake on this fault occurred sometime during the interval A.D. 1650-1810. An earlier earthquake on this fault occurred prior to A.D. 1390 and possibly around 2000 B.P.
   On the basis of stratigraphic correlations we estimate the ages of two shorelines associated with former high stands of Lake Managua to be less than 6.4 ka and approximately 2 ka, respectively. Deformation of these abandoned shorelines adjacent to the Aeropuerto fault implies a vertical slip rate of 0.3 to 0.9 mm/yr. Strike-slip movement on this fault is also expected, but no direct measurement could be performed. By comparison with faults of similar geometry in the Managua area that ruptured in 1931 and 1972, we suspect a left-lateral component of horizontal slip that is higher than the vertical one but less than 5 mm/yr.
   Additional data on slip rate and timing of paleoearthquakes are needed to better assess the Holocene behavior of the Managua faults and to investigate the influence of magmatic processes on the nature of faulting in the Managua Graben.

TI  - Bread and honour: White working class women and Afrikaner nationalism in the 1930s
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Women have occupied a central place in the ideological formulations of nationalist movements. In particular, the figure of woman as mother recurs throughout the history of nationalist political mobilizations. In Afrikaner nationalism, this symbolic female identity takes the form of the volksmoeder (mother of the nation) icon, commonly assumed to describe a highly circumscribed set of women's social roles, created for women by men. The academic orthodoxy holds that middle-class Afrikaner women submitted to the volksmoeder ideology early on in the development of Afrikaner nationalism but that the working class Afrikaner women of the Garment Workers' Union (GWU) represented an enclave of resistance to dominant definitions of ethnic identity. They chose instead to ally themselves with militant, class-conscious trade unionism. This paper argues that Afrikaner women of different classes helped to shape the contours of the volksmoeder icon. Whilst middle class Afrikaner women questioned the idea that their social contribution should remain restricted to narrow familial and charitable concerns, prominent working class women laid claim to their own entitlement to the volksmoeder heritage. In doing so, the latter contributed to the popularization and reinterpretation of an ideology that was at this time seeking a wider audience. The paper argues that the incorporation of Afrikaner women into the socialist milieu of the GWU did not result in these women simply discarding the ethnic components of their identity. Rather their self-awareness as Afrikaner women with a recent rural past was grafted onto their new experience as urban factory workers. The way in which leading working class Afrikaner women articulated this potent combination of 'derived' and 'inherent' ideology cannot be excluded from the complex process whereby Afrikaner nationalism achieved success as a movement appealing to its imagined community across boundaries of class and gender.

AB  - According to the Earth Observatory dust outbreaks are considered as natural hazards, which affect the ecosystems and human life. The main objective of this study is to assess and monitor the movement of aerosols and pollutants from local or other sources, both natural and anthropogenic, using a combination of ground-based monitoring and satellite data, The turbid and polluted atmosphere in the densely-populated area of Hyderabad, India is further degradated from dust outbreaks originated from Thar desert. A dust event occurred during 10th to 11th April 2006 in the northwest region of India; its plume substantially spreaded across the downwind direction affecting the study region. Using both irradiance measurements and satellite data this dust event is investigated. The analysis shows a significant change in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Aerosol Index (AI) and aerosol-particle size during the dust event. The Aerosol Optical Depth in the dusty day is about 0.2 higher than the previous non-dusty days, while the Angstrom exponent rapidly decreases when the dust plume affected the study area. The surface PM concentrations show enhanced values during the dusty day directly influenced by the dust deposition. There is also a remarkable decrease in ground-reaching global radiation, UV erythemal (UVery) and other irradiance components. The analysis suggested that the use of the diffuse-to-direct-beam ratio is the most appropriate parameter for the dust monitoring since its values at the longer wavelengths are not affected by the solar zenith angle.

AB  - 1Disease epizootics can significantly influence host population dynamics and the structure and functioning of ecological communities. Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei has dramatically reduced red fox populations Vulpes vulpes in several countries, including Britain, although impacts on demographic processes are poorly understood. We review the literature on the impact of mange on red fox populations, assess its current distribution in Britain through a questionnaire survey and present new data on resultant demographic changes in foxes in Bristol, UK.
   2A mange epizootic in Sweden spread across the entire country in < 10 years resulting in a decline in fox density of up to 95%; density remained lowered for 15-20 years. In Spain, mange has been enzootic for > 75 years and is widely distributed; mange presence was negatively correlated with habitat quality.
   3Localized outbreaks have occurred sporadically in Britain during the last 100 years. The most recent large-scale outbreak arose in the 1990s, although mange has been present in south London and surrounding environs since the 1940s. The questionnaire survey indicated that mange was broadly distributed across Britain, but areas of perceived high prevalence (> 50% affected) were mainly in central and southern England. Habitat type did not significantly affect the presence/absence of mange or perceived prevalence rates. Subjective assessments suggested that populations take 15-20 years to recover.
   4Mange appeared in Bristol's foxes in 1994. During the epizootic phase (1994-95), mange spread through the city at a rate of 0.6-0.9 km/month, with a rise in infection in domestic dogs Canis familiaris c. 1-2 months later. Juvenile and adult fox mortality increased and the proportion of females that reproduced declined but litter size was unaffected. Population density declined by > 95%.
   5In the enzootic phase (1996-present), mange was the most significant mortality factor. Juvenile mortality was significantly higher than in the pre-mange period, and the number of juveniles classified as dispersers declined. Mange infection reduced the reproductive potential of males and females: females with advanced mange did not breed; severely infected males failed to undergo spermatogenesis. In 2004, Bristol fox population density was only 15% of that in 1994.

TI  - An investigation of the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming as a means of integrating the needs of women and men into spatial planning in the United Kingdom
T2  - PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA  - English
AB  - This paper discusses the incidence of gender mainstreaming, and the extent to which it is proving an effective means of facilitating the incorporation of the needs of women, and men, in the operation of the spatial planning system in the United Kingdom. The paper is illustrated by a study undertaken for the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) on the scope and nature of gender mainstreaming within local spatial planning departments. It also draws on a review of national planning guidance documents and other research in which the author is involved, on gender, ethnicity, diversity and disability.
   Key concepts are defined and misgivings discussed. The emphasis upon women's needs within the concept of gender, and the need to prioritise gender within the equalities and diversity agendas, are explained. The gendered nature of the built environment is outlined. The problem has long been identified by adherents of the women and planning movement. But policy change has proved elusive. Gender mainstreaming has been welcomed as a means of achieving change. But the process has proved conceptually problematic, of questionable efficacy and difficult to implement.
   The research incorporated an investigation of the extent to which gender is being mainstreamed into planning policy and practice. The effects of European Union directives and United Kingdom government equality initiatives upon national, regional and local planning level mainstreaming activities were investigated. A range of local planning authorities was chosen to provide case studies that showed the different approaches adopted. A qualitative approach was used to tease out those factors that inhibit or enable the mainstreaming process. Although equalities mainstreaming programmes are widespread within local authorities, the majority are generic rather than specifically gendered in emphasis. They are primarily concerned with personnel and procedural matters rather than spatial policy issues. The majority of planning authorities manifest limited understanding of either gender considerations or the process of mainstreaming. Nevertheless, a significant minority of authorities was found where progress is underway. However, progress is hampered by lack of central government policy direction and statutory support.
   A 'Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit' was developed to facilitate the process. It is concluded that this is likely to prove ineffective unless fundamental changes take place within the planning system. In order to achieve effective gender mainstreaming, the following prerequisites are identified: conceptual clarity, stronger policy guidance and legal support at central government level, educational change, and organisational and procedural changes within local planning authorities.

AB  - Brachychiton populneus (Sterculiaceae) (Schott et Endl.) R. Br. (kurrajong) is a small tree that occurs naturally ranging from southern Queensland to Victoria. It has been widely planted as an ornamental tree in south-western Australia. In Kings Park, B. populneus has moved from cultivation to become a weed in the adjoining bushland reserve. The aim of this study was to examine the ecology of B. populneus and the Kings Park environment in order to identify the particular conjunction of characteristics that have led to the species becoming a weed. The highest density of kurrajongs (69.3 trees ha(-1)) was observed in the most disturbed area of Kings Park, and there was a strong relationship between density of B. populneus and disturbance (P = 0.058). The most striking feature of the invasion was the tendency of B. populneus to occur beneath other tree species, and this was attributed to birds feeding on transported fruit in trees and rats building seed caches at their base. Mature trees produced large amounts of viable seed, but rates of seed predation were high. Weevils, beetle larvae and omnivorous vertebrates such as Australian ravens, magpies and introduced black rats were observed eating seeds. The foraging behaviour of the vertebrates may facilitate the dispersal of seeds for relatively long distances away from parent plants. Seeds that escape predation form a transient seed bank and germinate with the onset of the winter rains. Early in their development, seedlings allocate resources to form a large tap-rooted tuber that has substantial starch and water reserves, allowing seedlings to survive the long dry and hot summers in Perth. The study observed that B. populneus could survive at least one fire by resprouting from basal dormant buds. Brachychiton populneus appears to have become a weed in Kings Park because, first, it is dispersed widely into new sites through the foraging behaviour of vertebrates and once germinated has no grazing pressure, and, second, its development of a root tuber and ability to resprout means the seedlings are resilient in this frequently disturbed Mediterranean environment. While management of existing plants is relatively straightforward, continued vigilance will be required to avoid reinvasion.

AB  - A thermal comfort field study has been carried out in five cities in the humid subtropical climate zone in China. The survey was performed in naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings during the summer season in 2006. There were 229 occupants from 111 buildings who participated in this study and 229 questionnaire responses were collected. Thermal acceptability assessment reveals that the indoor environment in naturally ventilated buildings could not meet the 80% acceptability criteria prescribed by ASHRAE Standard 55, and people tended to feel more comfortable in air-conditioned buildings with the air-conditioned occupants voting with higher acceptability (89%) than the naturally ventilated occupants (58%). The neutral temperatures in naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings were 28.3 degrees C and 27.7 degrees C, respectively. The range of accepted temperature in naturally ventilated buildings (25.0 similar to 31.6 degrees C) was wider than that in air-conditioned buildings (25.1 similar to 30.3 degrees C), which suggests that occupants in naturally ventilated buildings seemed to be more tolerant of higher temperatures. Preferred temperatures were 27.9 degrees C and 27.3 degrees C in naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings, respectively, both of which were 0.4 degrees C cooler than neutral temperatures. This result suggests that people of hot climates may use words like "slightly cool" to describe their preferred thermal state. The relationship between draught sensation and indoor air velocity at different temperature ranges indicates that indoor air velocity had a significant influence over the occupants' comfort sensation, and air velocities required by occupants increased with the increasing of operative temperatures. Thus, an effective way of natural ventilation which can create the preferred higher air movement is called for. Finally, the indoor set-point temperature of 26 degrees C or even higher in air-conditioned buildings was confirmed as making people comfortable, which supports the regulation in China that in public and office buildings the set-point temperature of air-conditioning system should not be lower than 26 degrees C.

AB  - Comparative examination of a large sample of plant species can reveal important aspects of life history that influence the ecology and distribution of taxa and their vulnerability to local extinction. We investigated whether functional groups of 71 rare plant species with contrasting life history traits differed in terms of population losses over time, regional range contraction, and range-wide levels of imperilment. Using town-level occurrence data from herbaria and Natural Heritage Program databases, we characterized species' extents of occurrence as alpha-hulls encompassing the centroids of New England towns that contained well-documented populations of these rare taxa. Family affiliation was used as a covariate in analyses to reduce phylogenetic bias. Disparate functional groups of plants differed both in proportions of populations lost and declines in range areas over time, with insect-pollinated taxa, upland (vs. wetland) taxa, species with localized seed dispersal modes, and taxa reaching their northern range boundary in New England significantly more imperiled than other functional groups. These techniques permit a broad comparative assessment of the distribution of large numbers of plant taxa, so that we can identify several functional groups that warrant more concerted conservation attention.

AB  - To verify the incidence of extravasation of cytostatic drugs in patients treated on an outpatient basis at a university hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, during the period from 1998 to 2002, and to assess the quality of care provided by the nursing team using a protocol adopted for the treatment of this adverse event as a parameter.
   The movement for quality in healthcare services has been a recent event in Brazil, mainly as the result of the Brazilian Program of Hospital Accreditation instituted in 1998. Considering the emphasis on risk management, it is important to mention the monitoring of the occurrence of extravasations of cytostatic drugs in order to improve the quality of nursing care provided to cancer patients.
   An evaluative study with a descriptive, prospective and longitudinal design was conducted, based on the documentary analysis of the notification of 216 extravasations of vesicant and irritant drugs that occurred between 1998 and 2002 and the corresponding prescriptions of cold or hot compresses.
   The mean incidence of extravasations ranged from 0.2 to 1.4% over the five years of the study. Incorrect prescription of the type of compress was observed for three patients. Undesired effects were ulcers caused by the extravasation of vinblastine and dacarbazine in two cases.
   The low incidence of both extravasation and tissue damage demonstrates the adequate quality of nursing care provided to cancer patients at the outpatient clinic studied. However, the identification of the lack of 12 records of thermal treatment and of three erroneous prescriptions requires the implementation of educational measures to prevent these types of incident.
   The relevance of this study to clinical practice is to increase the awareness and involvement of the nursing team in the maintenance of a continuous surveillance system of the process and results of chemotherapy administration in order to increase the quality of care and the safety of the patient.

AB  - The overall aim of the work was to develop a comprehensive normative database of indices for ranges of motion in the lumbar spine, in an 'symptomatic sample of the general population. This was a repeated measures prospective study utilizing a reliable and valid instrument, the modified CA6000 Spine Motion Analyzer (Orthopedic Systems Inc. Union City CA & Troke/University of Brighton). The portable equipment was used to collect data in a variety of community settings (e.g. schools, GP surgeries, offices, leisure centres, emergency services stations).
   A total of 405 asymptomatic subjects (196 female, 209 male) aged 16-90 yr from sedentary, mixed and physically demanding occupations participated in the study and data were collected in standing, at different times of the day, following a standardized methodology for lumbar spine motion in the sagittal, coronal and horizontal planes.
   Age-related centile graphs were derived separately for male and female subjects in flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion and left and right axial rotation. All 12 graphs are presented as an appendix located on the Manual Therapy website (www.elsevierscience.com/journals/math). Overall, flexion (73-40 degrees) and lateral flexion (28-14 degrees, L&R) declined 45% and 48%, respectively, across the age range. Extension (29-6 degrees) declined the greatest at 79%. By contrast, no overall decline in axial rotational RoMs was recorded, and the median RoM remained at 7 degrees each way across the age spectrum examined.
   A comprehensive database of indices of lumbar spine ranges of motion has thus been developed which is gender specific, age related, drawn from a wide age range and presents data for all three planes of motion. It is considered that the new database has a number of potential clinical and research applications. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - [1] A field of sediment undulations has been mapped by means of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection profiles in the Llobregat River prodelta, off the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Similar features had previously been recognized in other prodelta environments and interpreted either as downslope sediment deformation or sedimentary structures induced by bottom currents or hyperpycnal flows. Since the study area is undergoing significant offshore development, proper interpretation of such sediment undulations is needed for a correct risk assessment. The occurrence of the sediment undulations is restricted to the prodelta front on slope gradients between 3 and 0.2 degrees. The undulations have developed at the edge and atop an area of gas bearing sediments within the Late Holocene high-stand mud wedge. An evaluation is made of the characteristics of the sediment undulations in order to determine the most likely process for the origin of these structures. Among these characteristics are the continuity of the reflections and lack of diffractions in between different undulations, their size distribution ( large to small) both from shallow to deep and with depth in section, the asymmetry ( decreasing from proximal to distal), the crest to trough vertical distance on the landward side of the undulations ( up to 0.5 m), and the lack of features that could indicate a progressive movement such as growth structures and drag folds. These characteristics indicate that the sediment undulations on the Llobregat River prodelta do not result from sediment deformation but rather from the interaction of bottom currents generated by hyperpycnal flows from the Llobregat River with regional sea water circulation. Their identification as sediment waves implies that such features do not pose a major hazard for further offshore development.

AB  - On 1992 October 12, Egypt was struck by an earthquake with M-b = 5.9 or equivalently M-s = 5.2. It occurred southwest of Greater Cairo (Cairo and Giza) and was widely felt from Alexandria in the north to Aswan in the south. This earthquake also caused widespread destruction and damage, mostly concentrated in greater Cairo, along the Nile Valley and in the Nile Delta area. The extent of damage caused by this earthquake motivated this study. We computed a 2-D finite-difference (FD) synthetic wavefield for a prototype model of the Nile Valley with a maximum sedimentary basin thickness of 5 km and assumed uniform crustal thickness of 35 km. A variant of the latter model tested is a thin crust (Moho bump) beneath the basin. We used a 2.5 Hz Ricker wavelet source that excites both P and/or S waves, initiated as point sources. Focal depths vary from 5 to 20 km to simulate different scenarios. We investigated how various model features such as source location (focal depth and epicentral distance), deep sedimentary basin, near-surface attenuation and crustal thinning beneath the sedimentary basin may influence the wavefield across the Nile Valley. The outstanding result of the wavefield simulations is that the Nile Valley sedimentary basin and the associated strong impedance contrast produce significant focusing and amplification effects. It was found that the peak amplitudes might vary by one order of magnitude in the 3-8 Hz frequency band, across the Nile Valley. The high vulnerability of the buildings in Greater Cairo in combination with focusing/amplification in the Nile Valley explain qualitatively the extensive damage in the city itself even for moderate size earthquakes. In fact, the predicted area of high amplification coincides closely with that of greatest housing damage. The effects of near-surface attenuation in the uppermost 500 m within the basin and/or crustal thinning beneath the basin is less significant. These results are interesting on two accounts: (1) the extent of variation in the synthetic wavefield will always be less than that observed, but unfortunately there are no Egyptian records to corroborate these results and (2) wavefield variations are significantly larger than those deduced from ranges of Q-variations and seismotectonic modelling as used in most seismic risk analysis. These results imply that the wavefield simulations can be very informative and provide realistic results in particular when accurate structural model information is available and even more so if the synthetics can be corroborated with dense seismic network recordings.

TI  - Performance of a submerged breakwater along a hardbottom influenced coast: Vero Beach, Florida

LA  - English
CP  - 13th Annual National Conference on Beach Preservation Technology
AB  - This paper summarizes the results of a 3-year monitoring study on the performance of the Vero Beach Prefabricated Erosion Prevention (P.E.P.)Reef Approximately 2.5 years (August 1996 to June 1999) of findings for this project are presented here. The project consisted of placement of 217 concrete units to form a nearshore submerged reef off the City of Vero Beach, Florida between 20 July and 16 August, 1996. The reef was configured into 11 segments, each containing several individual units. Segments were placed in alternating inshore and offshore positions, which provided gaps for the wave set-up to return offshore. Monitoring of the P.E.P. Reef and north and south control areas included analysis of shoreline movement; beach sediment volume gain and loss; nearshore bathymetric change; wave and current modifications; scour and settlement of the P.E.P units; and interactions with existing seawalls and naturally occurring hardbottom. Findings indicate that the existing natural hardbottom affects the beach response. Three nearshore areas, each with different hard bottom morphology, correspond to areas with accretion, high erosion, and moderate erosion of the beach face sand volume. This high erosion zone coincides with the largest natural hardbottom expanse and is also the area with the most seawall construction. The P.E.P. Reef was placed in this area to mitigate erosion pressures. Within four months of placement, the P.E.P. Reef units settled an average 0.86 m (2.8 ft). Most of the units came to rest on the hardbottom, which limited further settlement. A scour trench formed on both the landward and seaward side of the units. Wave transmission attenuation was initially around 12% until settlement when the transmission was the same as the adjacent natural reef. It now appears that the P.E.P. Reef is producing slightly more wave attenuation (in the order of 8%) than the surrounding natural hardbottom. Immediately after P.E.P. reef placement there appeared to be little difference in the erosion of the seawall and non-seawall profiles. After the first year, seaward movement of the shoreline and profile volume accretion have been measured to the north of the project. Erosion has been measured within the P.E.P. reef area and to the south where the natural hardbottom intersects the shoreline at an orientation of around S20 degrees E. The natural hardbottom appears to be controlling the main coastal processes of the area. The P.E.P. Reef seems to be modifying sediment transport, acting as a groin, trapping sand on its updrift end and enhancing the hot spot erosion. In 1999, a sand wave like feature formed behind the segments and is now progressing south through the P.E.P. Reef zone into the south control zone.

TI  - Geology of the gold deposits of the Yanacocha District, northern Peru
T2  - PACRIM 2004 CONGRESS
LA  - English
CP  - PACRIM 2004 Congress
AB  - The Yanacocha District is located 20 km north of the city of Cajamarca, in the Northern Andean Orogenic belt of northern Peru. Gold production may have occurred as early as Incan times (Paverd, 2000), but modem exploration that began in the 1960s targeted only copper and silver. Newmont Mining Corporation, BRGM and Compania de Minas Buenaventura began exploring for gold in 1983, with Newmont as operator. Initial drilling took place in 1985. By 1992 a reserve of 1.28 million ounces was reported (Teal et al, 2002). Production began at the Carachugo deposit in 1993. Current reserves are 31.7 million ounces at $US 325 per ounce at a grade of 1.03 ppm (Newmont Annual Report, 2003). The operating company, Mineral Yanacocha SRL (Newmont 51 per cent, Buenaventura 44 per cent and International Finance Corporation five per cent) produced 2.85 million ounces in 2003, making Yanacocha one of the largest gold mining operations in the world.
   The district is made up of a series of epithermal, high sulfidation style gold deposits and one gold-rich gravel deposit (La Quinua), aligned in a NE trend. La Quinua is not discussed in detail in this paper. The bedrock deposits are hosted in a Miocene volcanic package, the Yanacocha Volcanic Complex that also trends NE. Regional NW striking Andean faults intersect the NE striking Trans-Andean Chicama-Yanacocha structural corridor (Turner, 1997), localising the district mineralisation. These two structural orientations dominate the district, controlling breccia and intrusion locations, and gold mineralisation. Discontinuous EW oriented fracture zones are interpreted as extensional and locally are important in controlling gold mineralisation.
   Three main volcanic depositional phases are recognised. The oldest, the Lower Andesite, sits uncomformably on Cretaceous basement rocks. Above this is a sequence of pyroclastic rocks, including a lower crystal-rich package and an upper lithic-rich package. Overlying the pyroclastic rocks are multiple andesite flows, domes and minor pyroclastic rocks. The entire volcanic pile is intruded by multiple phases of andesite dykes and dacite to quartz dacite plugs and dykes. The latter are associated with porphyry style gold-copper mineralisation in the deep pails of some deposits. Phreatic and phreatomagmatic breccias cut the volcanic rocks as pipes and dykes.
   Multi-stage high sulfidation style alteration affects the entire rock package, with massive silicification at the centre of the deposits, grading out through vuggy and granular silica, advanced argillic, argillic, propylitic and finally fresh rock. In places this alteration assemblage is overprinted by later intermediate sulfidation creamy chalcedonic silica.
   Gold occurs in all rock types, commonly with massive, vuggy and granular silica, and especially as high grade with the creamy silica. Gold mineralisation is frequently localised around the margins of less permeable breccia pipes and andesite dome roots. Copper is not currently recovered at Yanacocha, but copper mineralisation occurs with gold in the deeper parts of most of the deposits, as indicated by a limited number of deep drillholes. These holes indicate a change from high sulfidation epithermal style to porphyry style mineralisation at depth.

AB  - The development and implementation of an earthquake early warning system (EEWS), both in regional or on-site configurations can help to mitigate the losses due to the occurrence of moderate-to-large earthquakes in densely populated and/or industrialized areas. The capability of an EEWS to provide real-time estimates of source parameters (location and magnitude) can be used to take some countermeasures during the earthquake occurrence and before the arriving of the most destructive waves at the site of interest. However, some critical issues are peculiar of EEWS and need further investigation: (1) the uncertainties on earthquake magnitude and location estimates based on the measurements of some observed quantities in the very early portion of the recorded signals; (2) the selection of the most appropriate parameter to be used to predict the ground motion amplitude both in near- and far-source ranges; (3) the use of the estimates provided by the EEWS for structural engineering and risk mitigation applications.
   In the present study, the issues above are discussed using the Campania-Lucania region (Southern Apennines) in Italy, as test-site area. In this region a prototype system for earthquake early warning, and more generally for seismic alert management, is under development. The system is based on a dense, wide dynamic accelerometric network deployed in the area where the moderate-to-large earthquake causative fault systems are located.
   The uncertainty analysis is performed through a real-time probabilistic seismic hazard analysis by using two different approaches. The first is the Bayesian approach that implicitly integrate both the time evolving estimate of earthquake parameters, the probability density functions and the variability of ground motion propagation providing the most complete information. The second is a classical point estimate approach which does not account for the probability density function of the magnitude and only uses the average of the estimates performed at each seismic station.
   Both the approaches are applied to two main towns located in the area of interest, Napoli and Avellino, for which a missed and false alarm analysis is presented by means of a scenario earthquake: an M 7.0 seismic event located at the centre of the seismic network.
   Concerning the ground motion prediction, attention is focused on the response spectra as the most appropriate function to characterize the ground motion for earthquake engineering applications of EEWS. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A number of recent studies have highlighted the potential contribution of migration to increasing inequalities in health between areas with different levels of deprivation. Some of these studies have reported that increasing inequalities between areas can, at least partly, be explained by selective migration. Both mortality and morbidity have been used as indicators of health status, but many of the studies focusing on morbidity have suffered from specific methodological problems, including the use of self-reported health measured after migration had occurred, thereby ignoring the possible effect that migration itself may have on health and the reporting of health. This study used general practice records assessed prior to movement, an arguably more objective measure of health status, from 40 general practices, to determine whether selective migration influenced the distribution of health in Northern Ireland between the years 2000 and 2005. Evidence of selective migration was found in the study, with migrants often having significantly different levels of health to non-migrants. However, overall migration within this cohort did not substantially alter the distribution of health through time, partly because the migrants out of the deprived and affluent areas were replaced by in-migrants with similar levels of health. The absence of an effect of migration in this instance should not be used, however, to conclude that migration effects are unimportant in assessing changes in inequalities through time. Rather, migration should be viewed in the context of the underlying population dynamics, which at the time of this study were characterised by a process of urban regeneration. Varying population movements, operating at different times and locations, require that the effects of migration be considered in all studies which examine changes in the spatial distribution of health.

AB  - Hailstorms are by far the costliest insured natural hazard in Australia. Major metropolitan areas such as Sydney and Brisbane, located in mid-latitude coastal Eastern Australia, are especially vulnerable due to building exposure and geographical location. Results are presented using data from metropolitan Sydney and Brisbane for seven recent severe storms, including the April 1999 Sydney hailstorm.
   The focus of this study is on comparisons between the radar-derived pattern of hail kinetic energy and damage to residential buildings in the form of insurance claims. CAPPI (Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicators) reflectivities were generated from S-band radar at low storm levels (1.5 km) and the hail kinetic energy was calculated. High reflectivity hail cells (>= 55 dBZ) were investigated during the time they passed over occupied urban areas causing damage on the ground to insured assets. The preferred area for hail damage was found to be located to the left side and towards the rear left flank with respect to the storm movement. Higher claim costs were identified within storms that produced "follow up cells."
   Two damage variables were derived from insurance claims on a 2 x 2 km grid: average cost and spatial average loss ratio. The radar fields were shifted horizontally in order to maximise correlations between the damage on the ground and the radar signal aloft. Correlation coefficients improved on average from 0.09 before shift to 0.47 after optimal shift for average cost; corresponding values for spatial average loss ratio improved from 0.06 to 0.43. These improvements in correlation are gatifing, especially considering the limitations of the data. Nonetheless, our general conclusion, when looking at all storms, is that hail kinetic energy as calculated in this study cannot by itself provide a robust, consistent and reliable predictor of insured losses.

AB  - Wood chips were studied for their efficacy in controlling soil erosion on a steep construction site with disturbed soils. The purpose of the research was twofold: to determine if wood chips could be used to reduce the off-site movement of soil during construction activities, and to find an environmentally sound alternative to the landfill disposal of wood wastes generated in the urban forest. The research was conducted on field plots that received natural precipitation. Twelve erodible plots were established on an embankment with a 55% slope and an elevation change of nearly 12 m. Each plot had a width of 3 m and a horizontal slope length of 10 m. A series of flow dividers was installed at the toe of each plot to measure runoff and sediment. Four treatments were studied: large wood chips, small wood chips, a mixture of wood chip sizes, and a control with no chips. The mixture of wood chip sizes represented the size distribution that was found to occur from chippers. The wood chips were applied at a rate that covered 80% of the soil surface.
   The erosion rate for the small wood chip treatment was not significantly different from the zero-cover plots. The erosion rates from the large wood chip and mixture of chip sizes were not significantly different from one another, but were significantly different from the zero-cover treatment. Overall, in comparison to the zero-cover treatment, the small wood chip treatment reduced erosion by 22%, the large wood chips reduced erosion by 78%, and the mixture of chip sizes reduced erosion by 86%. The results of this project indicate that wood chips (as produced by a chipper) should be utilized as a soil cover and need not be discarded as solid waste.

AB  - Two karst areas within Permian and Triassic carbonate rocks of the Codru Moma Mountains in the northwestern part of Romania yield thermal waters. Major karst springs occur where groundwater now is intercepted by hydraulic barriers, which also results in the movement of water from deeper levels. At Moneasa. thermal groundwater rises along faults and fractures associated with a thrust, and at Vascau Town, water rises along faults marginal to the Beius Basin. Geochemistry suggests that the thermal component of the Moneasa groundwaters is derived from dolomites and that at least a proportion of the Vascau thermal waters originates from deeply buried Permian sandstones.

AB  - Recharge of waste water in an unconsolidated poorly sorted alluvial aquifer is a complex process, both physically and hydrochemically. The aim of this paper is to analyse and conceptualise vertical transport mechanisms taking place in an urban area of extensive wastewater infiltration by analysing and combining the water balance, the microbial (Escherichia coli) mass balance, and the mass balance for dissolved solutes. For this, data on sediment characteristics (grain size, organic carbon, reactive iron, and calcite), groundwater levels, and concentrations of E. coli in groundwater and waste water were collected. In the laboratory, data on E. coli decay rate coefficients, and on bacteria retention characteristics of the sediment were collected via column experiments. The results indicated \that shallow groundwater, at depths of 50 in below the surface, was contaminated with E. coli concentrations as high as 10(6) CFU/100 mL. In general, E. coli concentrations decreased only 3 log units from the point of infiltration to shallow groundwater. Concentrations were lower at greater depths in the aquifer. In laboratory columns of disturbed sediments, bacteria removal was 2-5 log units/0.5 cur column sediment. Because of the relatively high E. coli concentrations in the shallow aquifer, transport had likely taken place via a connected network of pores with a diameter large enough to allow bacterial transport instead of via the sediment matrix, which was inaccessible for bacteria, as was clear from the column experiments. The decay rate coefficient was determined from laboratory microcosms to be 0.15 d(-1). Assuming that decay in the aquifer was similar to decay in the laboratory, then the pore water flow velocity between the point of infiltration and shallow groundwater, coinciding with a concentration decrease of 3 log units, was 0.38 m/d, and therefore, transport in this connected network of pores was fast. According to the water balance of the alluvial aquifer, determined from transient groundwater modelling, groundwater flow in the aquifer was mainly in vertical downward direction, and therefore, the mass balance for dissolved solutes was simulated using a ID transport model of a 200 in column of the Quaternary Alluvium aquifer. The model, constructed with PHREEQC, included dual porosity, and was able to adequately simulate removal of E. coli, cation-exchange, and nitrification. The added value of the use of E. coli in this study was the recognition of relatively fast transport velocities occurring in the aquifer, and the necessity to use the dual porosity concept to investigate vertical transport mechanisms. Therefore, in general and if possible, microbial mass balances should be considered more systematically as an integral part of transport studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - To determine the risk factors associated with complain of low back pain. A cross sectional study was done from June 2004 until August 2005. Seven hundred and sixty commercial vehicle drivers from 11 bus companies in central, northern and eastern regions in Malaysia participated in this study. Modified Nordic questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of low back pain; Maestro human vibration meter was used to measure the personal R.M.S values of lateral, anterior-posterior and vertical axes. Modified Owas was used to assess the awkward posture of the driver torso namely, bending forward movement, leaning, sitting straight and twisting. Profile of Mood States (POMS) was used to evaluate the mood states of bus drivers with complain of low back pain. A high prevalence of low back pain (60.4%) among Malaysian commercial vehicle drivers was found. Logistic regression analysis controlling for age, income, education level and non occupational activities revealed that the following factors were related to low back pain: Tension-anxiety [1.080, 95% CI 1.041-1.121], depression dejection [1.047, 95% CI 1.023-1.072], anger-hostility [1.053, 95 % CI 1.027-1.081], fatigue [1.132, 95% CI 1.089-1.177] and confusion [1.114, 95% CI 1.061-1.169] of POMS, length of employment [1.001, 95% CI 1.0-1.003], steering wheel adjustment [1.521, 95% CI 1.101-2.101], perception of exposing to vibration [1.943,95% CI 1.389-2.719]. In conclusion, combinations of risks lead to high increase of low back pain complain among Malaysian bus drivers.

AB  - This paper discusses the occurrence and development of the excavation-induce deep-seated landslide, which took place near Dundar village, located west of Orhaneli town in northwestern Turkey. The event occurred in the Bursa-Orhaneli lignite field, which has been actively operating since 1979. Due to undermining of a gently inclined slope (10 degrees) to extract a coal seam, primary tension cracks, which were precursors of the movement, were first observed in the northern head area in mid- to late October 2003. This movement happened simultaneously with precipitation that was significantly above long-term average measured at a nearby climatology station (Keles). This precipitation amount is characterized statistically by a significant standardized anomaly of 1.6. The majority of the monthly precipitation total in October 2003, which mainly consisted of rain showers and thunderstorms, occurred in the last week of the month. By April 2004, rotational failure continued intermittently. After a relatively wet (rainy and snowy) period from January 2004 to April 2004, the main rotational slump occurred in late April 2004, causing the entire destruction of Dundar village's cemetery. Daily climatic and synoptic meteorological data have proved that heavy showers in late April may had triggered the last slump by producing rain showers of 19.3 mm and 19.9 mm daily total on 27 and 28 April 2004, respectively.
   Field observations carried out along the main head scarp have shown that the slope failure was facilitated by a pre-existing normal fault with an east- west direction and 80 degrees dip. Grain-size analysis showed that the failure occurred on clayey silt, which forms 55% of the slip surface material. Based on the evidence from X-ray fluorescence and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results, smectite-type clay - a product of the chemical weathering of tuff - was the main constituent of the slip surface material. The landslide occurred over an area of 600 m x 650 m with a total volume of 8775 000 m(3). Approximately 28 hectares of farm land were entirely destroyed and the excavated coal seam was buried. The mining operation was moved to 100 m north of the landslide area near Gumuspinar village. From morphological evidence, it is concluded that excavation activities caused the failure to extend in more than one direction as an enlarging sliding mechanism; this produced a high landslide risk for Gumuspinar village, where the most significant normal fault with a 75 m vertical displacement in a coal-bearing sequence is found in the lignite field.

AB  - The Ottoman Empire, whose occupation in Bosnia lasted from the 15th to the 19th century, left numerous traces in local literature. A big number of Slavs, who converted to Islam, wrote their literary works in so-called oriental languages (Turkish, Arabic and Persian); their poetry anthologies, diwans, written in Ottoman Turkish, were impregnated by Sufism (Muslim mysticism). There are hundreds of authors of this kind, a phenomenon specific to Bosnia and not found among all the other countries occupied by the Ottomans. We observe a double identity in Bosnian Ottoman poems: both an attachment to the Empire, due to the Muslim religion, as well as to their country or town. Numerous authors also expressed themselves in the Slavic Bosnian language, by using Arabic characters (a kind of literature known by the name of alhamiado or aljemiado); another type, principally an urban one, the sevdalinka is representative of Muslim popular art, still very famous these days in the Balkans.
   Among the Bosnians who wrote in the Bosnian language by using latten characters--this movement appeared at the end of the 19th century--it is necessary to mention Safvet Bey Basagic (1870-1934) and Musa Cazim Catic (1878-1915) whose poetry is a mixture of two cultures, while remaining an Ottoman relic. This mixture of cultures is also evident in the works of Bosnian Christians, especially in the poetry of Aleksa Santic (1868-1924). The lyrical and nostalgic Bosnian Ottoman life, which we find in his work, are the antipode of the ambiance described by Ivo Andric (1892-1975). Nobel Prize winner (1961), Andric, describes Bosnia as a dark place "a country of hate and fright", known under the name of obscure vilayet. Another vision of the country appears in the work of Isak Samokovlija (1889-1955). Unlike the Jews represented by Ivo Andric, those of Samokovlija find that Bosnia is rather a country of understanding.
   We find almost the same atmosphere and polarity in the novels by Mesa Selimovic (1910-1982), in which the Ottoman Empire serves as a backdrop; using an encoded language, the author employs the Empire and Sufism to tell us his point of view on the currents events of that time.
   The war in Bosnia (1992 - 1995) marks a break from the literary themes mentioned above: the Ottoman Empire is no longer the topic of discussion--now it is the war that dominates almost every book.
   On the other hand, numerous authors are inspired by Islam, or even by Sufism, which in fact constitutes an indirect Ottoman influence.

AB  - The results of tectonic studies in the Rio Colca Valley, Peru, are presented in the paper. Field data were gathered in 2006 during a scientific expedition working on intensive and catastrophic geo-hazards of the area in relation to tectonic settings of the valley. Influence of recent seismic activity, volcanic eruptions and tectonic faulting on the slope failures was studied. Ample evidence of tectonic structures related to landslides, mud-, debris- and mud-debris flows were collected in the area.
   A detailed geological study in the Maca-Lari-Madrigal-Pinchollo area was carried out on numerous valley slope failures and their relation to recent faulting occurring in the Mesozoic bedrock (Jurassic elastic rocks) and Quaternary deposits (Pleistocene lacustrine and tuffite sediments, as well as recent colluvial and alluvial deposit).
   In the study area, four large landslides were encountered. Landslides at Madrigal and Lari, and another one located between both villages, are situated on the left Colca river side (northern slopes of the valley). Their elevation ranges from 3050 to 3350 In a.s.l., height from 100 to 250 in and area from 1.3 to 4 km(2). The landslides developed mainly in poorly consolidated lacustrinc deposits (tuffites) and in some places in older colluvial, as well as alluvial deposits.
   The landslides have a complex rotational structure. Initial sliding was interconected with rotation and it was followed by movement of oversaturated rock mass down the sub-horizontal bedrock top surface dipping gently to the south. The landslide in Maca is located on the southern slopes of the Rio Colca valley at an elevation of 3150-3350 in a.s.l. Its height reaches 200 in, and area 2.5 km2. It developed in poorly consolidated Quaternary deposits consisting mainly of colluvia accompanied by alluvial and lacustrine (tuffite) sediments in some places.
   All landslides in the study area show a close relation to a normal fault oriented WNW-ESE, along which the Rio Colca valley was developed. The shapes of landslide scars follow orientation of local fault network, NNE-SSW, N-S, NNW-SSE, WSW-ENE, W-E, NW-SE and NE-SW. These faults usually originated as strike or oblique-slip faults, and later were transformed into normal faults. In the landslide at Maca, numerous, criss-crossing, extensional horst and grabens developed and can be observed on the land surface. At first grabens developed along NW-SE orientation, and later along WSW-ENE and W-E. Among the youngest structures of this landslide, grabens striking NNW-SSE, N-S and NE-SW should be listed. Development of extensional horsts and grabens shows a close relation to sliding occurring on the sub-horizontal bedrock top surface.
   All populated places as well as local transport and agricultural infrastructure in the study area are vulnerable to geohazards. There are initiatives of governmental insitutions of Peru to set monitoring of geological hazard in potential disaster area. The map of the Colca Valley oublished by the Geophysical Institute of Peru. shows levels of geologic hazards in a 0-10 degrees scale. The study area is entirely located in the zone of very high risk of the 9th degree. It is related to high seismic activity of the area and to potential eruptions of Sabancaya volcano. Recently, the most catastrofic earthquake (Ms 5.6) dated on July 23(rd), 1991 triggered landslide in Maca and caused 20 casualties in the destroyed town. The slope failures were induced by fault motions in the bedrock beneath poorly consolidated Quaternary deposits. Other important factors controlling landslide hazard in the area are: inclination of bedrock top surface, geomorphology, climate and river bed errosion.

AB  - Soil rubification is defined as a pedogenesis stage in which iron is released from primary minerals to form free iron oxides that coat quartz particles in soils with a thin reddish film. This study used an airborne hyperspectral sensor to spatially map soil rubification oil the surface of coastal sand dunes in Israel, The area selected for this study is located south of the city of Ashdod, Israel, and is one of the last remaining coastal sand dune areas in the Country. The study area occupied about 60 kill, and was covered by two flight lines of the CASI 48-channel sensor from an altitude of 2650 in, providing a pixel size of about 3 in. A traditional way to estimate rubification is to chemically measure the iron oxide concentration in the sand. The Dithionite Citrate Bicarbonate (DCB) method, which is a laboratory "wet"-based procedure, was used to precisely measure the free iron oxide status of selected locations along the area. The soil reflectance properties of these samples were measured in the laboratory across the Visible and Near InfrarRed (VIS-NIR) region and was used with the DCB-Fe data to evaluate a spectral-based model for assessing the rubification extent solely from spectroscopy. After the CASI data were atmospherically, BRDF and geometrically corrected, they were run against the spectral model oil a pixel-by-pixel basis, generating a rubification map from a far distance. Spectral validation of independent samples and field measurements of dune movement over 17 months showed that the map is reliable and significantly correlated with known stabilization processes throughout the area (the overall accuracy estimated as 78%). It was concluded that soil spectroscopy, either from field or air, enables the detection of small changes in the Fe absorption feature across the VIS region that Provides information regarding the iron oxide minerals and content. This supports the utilization of a sensitive airborne hyperspectral sensor to rapidly and quantitatively evaluate spatial information concerning important pedogenic processes. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The native riparian vegetation communities on the Chowilla floodplain in the lower River Murray in South Australia are suffering severe declines in health, particularly the Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.( red gum) and Eucalyptus largiflorens F. Muell. ( black box) communities. The primary cause of the decline is salinisation of the floodplain soils caused by increased rates of groundwater discharge and hence increased movement of salt up into the plant root zone. The salinity is driven by a lack of flooding and rising saline groundwater tables. Rises in the naturally saline groundwater levels are due to the effects of river regulation from Lock 6 and high inflows from regional groundwater levels increased by Lake Victoria to the east. River regulation has also led to reduced frequency and duration of the floods that leach salt from the plant root zone and supply fresh water for transpiration. The frequency of medium-sized floods occurring on Chowilla has been reduced by a factor of three since locking and water extractions were commenced in the 1920s to provide reliable water for urban and agricultural use. The soil salinisation on the floodplain was modelled by using a spatial and temporal model of salt accumulation from groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, soil type and flooding frequency. The derived soil water availability index ( WINDS) is used to infer vegetation health and was calibrated against current extent of vegetation health as assessed from fieldwork and satellite image analysis. The modelling work has shown that there is a severe risk to the floodplain vegetation from current flow regimes. This paper estimates that 65% ( 5658 ha) of the 8600 ha of floodplain trees are affected by soil salinisation matching a field survey of vegetation health in 2003 ( Department of Environment and Heritage 2005a), compared with 40% in 1993 ( Taylor et al. 1996). Model results show that the best management option for Chowilla is lowering the groundwater down to 2m below current levels, which predicts an improvement in the health of the floodplain tree species from 35 to 42%.

AB  - Changes in land use patterns in and around forests, including rural development and road building, have occurred throughout the United States and are accelerating in many areas. As a result, there have been significant departures from 'natural' or pre-settlement disturbance regimes. Altered disturbance regimes can shift composition and dominance in tree species communities, potentially affecting ecosystem functioning. We examined the potential consequences of various forest management practices and forest fragmentation on tree community composition. Both forest management and fragmentation are changing as land use changes within the New Jersey Pine Barrens (NJPB). The NJPB has and is continuing to experience rapid rural development and urbanization that are altering the types, frequency, and intensity of forest management, and are increasing forest fragmentation. In the NJPB, the size and frequency of wildfires have declined and the use of prescribed fires is limited to a small portion of the landscape. In addition, the expansion of roads and decline in total forested area - two common measures of fragmentation - may impede the ability of tree species to colonize available habitat. To assess the consequences of fire management and fragmentation on fire regimes and forest communities, we simulated forest landscape change using LANDIS-II, a stochastic, spatially dynamic forest succession model that simulates the growth of tree species cohorts (defined by species and age), dispersal and colonization, and mortality. Simulated fires are sensitive to fuel loads and fuel load continuity. We constructed scenarios to mimic the pre-colonial contiguous landscape with an estimated pre-colonial fire regime; scenarios of the current day landscape with current and potential fire management; and scenarios designed to highlight the effects of fragmentation. Our simulations indicate that relative to the pre-colonial landscape and fire regime, the landscape is changing from a pine-dominated to an oak-dominated state. However, within areas where prescribed burning remains a viable management option, a doubling of the mean annual area that is managed with prescribed bums may substantially push the system back towards pre-colonial conditions, although oaks will continue to retain a higher than pre-colonial dominance. Our results also indicate that aside from a reduction in the potential fire sizes, fragmentation does not appear to substantially alter forest successional dynamics. In summary, our simulations estimate the departure from pre-colonial conditions and indicate the potential for a limited restoration of these conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hybrid zones between Townsend's Warblers (Dendroica townsendi) and Hermit Warblers (D. occidentalis) in the Pacific Northwest are narrow relative to estimated dispersal distances and appear to be moving, with Townsend's replacing Hermits. We examined whether the habitat-transition and parental-fitness asymmetry models can explain why these zones are narrow and moving by comparing habitat variables associated with warbler territories in the Washington Cascades hybrid zone. Habitat variables did not differ among phenotypes, suggesting that the habitat-transition model cannot explain the narrow and dynamic nature of this hybrid zone. Habitat characteristics of Hermit Warbler territories did not differ inside versus outside the hybrid zone, also suggesting that this zone is not associated with a region of habitat transition. The lack of difference in habitat use could be the result of comparing variables that are not important to pairing success. However, warblers tended to select territories on west-southwest aspects. South aspects in the southern Washington Cascades are dominated by Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and true fir, which is a habitat selected by female warblers when choosing among territories and males. The parental-fitness asymmetry model does not necessarily make predictions about habitat use within the hybrid zone but predicts the superiority of one parental species over the other. However, if significant overlap occurs in habitat use or niche las in these warblers), then competition between parental species is likely to occur. To determine whether these species compete, we mapped 12 warbler territories and monitored an additional 94 territories throughout the breeding season and found that all males with neighbors compete for and hold exclusive territories. Thus, the pattern of habitat use and territoriality is consistent with the parental-fitness asymmetry model.

AB  - Reclaimed mine soils in Lusatia/Germany are heterogeneous sandy sediment mixtures, which often contain significant portions of lignite (brown coal). Water-repellent aliphatic organic compounds may cause preferential finger-type flow in mine soils. The objective of this study was to analyse the significance, spatial scales, and spatial variability of potential water repellency in a lignitic mine soil. The mine site was located northeast of the city of Cottbus, Germany. A soil block of 2.5-m length, 1.25-m width, and 1.5-m depth was divided into squares of 0.25-m edge length from where 25 soil cores of 636 cm(3) were sampled at each 0.1-m depth increment. After drying the samples at 60 degreesC for 4 days, the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test was carried out using 30 water drops per sample. The frequency distributions of the classified potential water repellency were analyzed (i) locally, within a sample, (ii) horizontally, within a layer, and (iii) vertically, within the soil block: The WDPT values of most samples were either smaller than 5-10 s or larger than 10 min. Such 'bipolar' distribution occurred for the whole block, as well as locally, i.e., the WDPT varied between repellent and not repellent from drop to drop at distances of about 1 cm. The persistence of potential water repellency seems somewhat larger in the subsoil (0.5-1.5-m depth) than in the ameliorated topsoil (0-40-m depth). However, hardly any spatial structures are obvious since severely repellent, as well as not repellent, soil material occurs throughout the soil profile and intra- was as large as inter-sample variability. To a large degree, the spatial variability of water repellency seems to reflect a situation that resulted from partially mixing of different overburden sediments. The small-scale variability of the potential water repellency may probably be correlated with the spatial distribution of lignite, minerals, and more-or-less lignite-coated sand particles. These spatial patterns of repellency may, in particular, affect water and solute movement in mine soils. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine, by analysing marital origin-related homogamy and mobility, the fluidity of a system of social stratification marked by a heterogeneous working class and likely to lead to increasing social-group solidarity during the phase of a more active labour movement in the early twentieth century. Data from Winterthur, a Swiss town characterized by the expansion of an important engineering industry, reveal that occupational homogamy was most pronounced at the top, among higher managers and professionals, and at the bottom of the social hierarchy, among unskilled factory workers. There is no empirical evidence of increased homogamous behaviour after the nationwide general strike of 19 18, which is said to have had a long-term impact on workers' class-consciousness. Our analyses show, however, that the association between the social background of spouses depended on their geographical origin. This result may point to a regionally determined class-consciousness.

AB  - A strong earthquake (M-w = 7.4) occurred near the town of Golcuk, Izmit Bay, Western Turkey, at 00:01 GMT on August 17, 1999. Izmit Bay is a E-W trending pull-apart basin with a surface area of about 300 km(2) along the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAF), in the eastern extension of the Sea of Marmara. The earthquake was caused by a westerly movement of the Anatolian plate along NAF and was accompanied by isolated, chaotic water movements along the northern and southern shores of the bay. At localities along the shoreline a sudden drop in sea level, and a subsequent rise was prominent. The mode of observed sealevel movements rules out the occurrence of a basin-wide tsunami, sensu stricto. Instead, the water movements are attributed to localized sudden dip-slip movements of fault blocks in this pull-apart basin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The devastating impact of landslides and secondary instability with their unconsolidated depris deposits due to weathering, settlement and groudwater seepage are significant geological threats. Mass movemets can impact negatively on urbanisation and represent a critical factor determining landuse zonation during town and regional planning.
   Mapping and classification of mass movement deposits in the KwaZulu-Natal Province highlighted the more widespread extent of there Quaternary geomorphic desepquilibrium indicators than is commonly appreciated. Many of the largest occurrences mapped are palaeo-landslides located in areas of high rlief and steep slopes in the Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg footlopes and the major fiver valley. Some of these events temporatily blocked river channels resulting in changed channel and floodplain morphology. However, the majority of the landslides identified are smaller, more, recent, localized occurrences associated with high intensity rainfall events. Accelerator Mass Spectormetry (AMS) or radiocarbon dating of bulk organic material derived from ponds on back-tilted surfaces (sag ponds) of the palaeo-landslides has yielded minimum ages for the landslide events.

AB  - In the early morning of 21 September, 1999, Taiwan experienced its most powerful inland earthquake (with Richter magnitude 7.3) of the century. The earthquake occurred near the small town of Chi-Chi in central Taiwan, in an area with a low recent background of seismicity although it is surrounded by belts of high seismicity. It caused an extensive surface ruptures totaling about 100 km long and a tremendous number of aftershocks. Using seismological and morphological data, we investigate the tectonic environment in central Taiwan and the associated plate structure in the Taiwan region, with emphasis on the cause of the earthquake and its aftershock sequence.
   Taiwan island is situated on the northwestern corner of the Philippine Sea plate, where its interaction with the Eurasian plate is complicated. The Philippine Sea plate moves northwestward with respect to the Eurasian plate. The former subducts northwestward, in general, along the Ryukyu trench. However, due to the impediment of its motion, it subducts northward and underthrusts westward in the Taiwan region, with the meridian line of 121.5 degrees E being the present western boundary of the active subducting lithosphere. The western boundary is migrating westward, at a rate of about 6 cm/y, along with the northwestward movement of the Philippine Sea plate. The Philippine Sea plate, like a plow, pushes and uplifts Taiwan island situated on the Asian continental margin, as demonstrated by a seismic wedge to the east of 121 degrees E. In central Taiwan, there exist two obvious linear belts of frequent earthquakes, almost perpendicular and individually trending NW and NE. These linear belts form the boundaries of a triangular area with low background seismicity in front of the seismic wedge, including the Peikang basement high, an uplifted pre-Miocene basement beneath the Western Coastal Plain and its offshore zone. The Chi-Chi earthquake occurred in a subarea of the triangular area near the vertex, confined by the seismic belts and the Peikang basement high. The northwestward movement of the subarea has been impeded by the Peikang basement high, and the associated crustal strain energy may have thus been stored, and then released to trigger the Chi-Chi earthquake, the ruptures and the aftershocks.

AB  - Debris flows are a type of mass movement that occurs in mountain torrents. They consist of a high concentration of solid material in water that flows as a wave with a steep front. Debris flows can be considered a phenomenon intermediate between landslides and water floods. They are amongst the most hazardous natural processes in mountainous regions and may occur under different climatic conditions. Their destructiveness is due to different factors: their capability of transporting and depositing huge amounts of solid materials, which may also reach large sizes ( boulders of several cubic meters are commonly transported by debris flows), their steep fronts, which may reach several meters of height and also their high velocities. The implementation of both structural and nonstructural control measures is often required when debris flows endanger routes, urban areas and other infrastructures. Sensor networks for debris-flow monitoring and warning play an important role amongst non-structural measures intended to reduce debris-flow risk. In particular, debris flow warning systems can be subdivided into two main classes: advance warning and event warning systems. These two classes employ different types of sensors. Advance warning systems are based on monitoring causative hydrometeorological processes ( typically rainfall) and aim to issue a warning before a possible debris flow is triggered. Event warning systems are based on detecting debris flows when these processes are in progress. They have a much smaller lead time than advance warning ones but are also less prone to false alarms. Advance warning for debris flows employs sensors and techniques typical of meteorology and hydrology, including measuring rainfall by means of rain gauges and weather radar and monitoring water discharge in headwater streams. Event warning systems use different types of sensors, encompassing ultrasonic or radar gauges, ground vibration sensors, videocameras, avalanche pendulums, photocells, trip wires etc. Event warning systems for debris flows have a strong linkage with debris-flow monitoring that is carried out for research purposes: the same sensors are often used for both monitoring and warning, although warning systems have higher requirements of robustness than monitoring systems. The paper presents a description of the sensors employed for debris-flow monitoring and event warning systems, with attention given to advantages and drawbacks of different types of sensors.

TI  - Elemental distribution of coastal sea and stream sediments in the island-arc region of Japan and mass transfer processes from terrestrial to marine environments
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - A total of 49 elements have been identified in 338 coastal sea sediment samples collected from an area situated off the Ise-Tokai region of Japan for a nationwide marine geochemical mapping project. The spatial distribution patterns of the elemental concentrations in coastal seas along with the existing geochemical maps in terrestrial areas were used to define the natural geochemical background variation, mass transport, and contamination processes. The elemental concentrations of coastal sea sediments are determined primarily by particle size and regional differences. Most elemental concentrations increase with a decrease in particle size. Some elements such as Ca, Mn, and Yb are found to exist in large quantities in coarse particles containing calcareous shells, Fe-Mn oxides, and felsic volcanic sediments. Regional differences reflect the mass transfer process from terrestrial areas to coastal seas and the influence of the local marine geology. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that for many elements, the particle size effect is predominant over regional difference. The mean chemical compositions of coastal sea sediments are similar to those of stream sediments in adjacent terrestrial areas and in the upper crust of Japan. This observation supports the fact that coastal sea sediments have certainly originated from terrestrial materials. However, the spatial distributions of elemental concentrations are not always continuous between the land and coastal seas. The scale of mass movement observed in marine geochemical maps occurs at a distance of 20 km from the river mouth. A detailed examination of the spatial distribution patterns of K (K2O) and Cr concentrations suggests that terrestrial materials supplied through rivers are deposited near the shore initially, and then gravity-driven processes shift the sediments deeper into the basin. Contamination with heavy metals such as Zn, Cd and Pb was observed in coastal bays surrounded by urban and industrial areas. It is noteworthy that the areas with the highest concentration of these elements usually do not occur near the shore (not near the contamination source) but at the center of the bay. Unexpected low concentrations of Zn, Cd and Pb near shore may either be due to a decreased anthropogenic load in the most recent sediments or to dilution by unpolluted flood sediments.

AB  - We investigated the physiological basis of the 'broken escalator phenomenon', namely the sensation that when walking onto an escalator which is stationary one experiences an odd sensation of imbalance, despite full awareness that the escalator is not going to move. The experimental moving surface was provided by a linear motor-powered sled, moving at 1.2 m/s. Sled velocity, trunk position, trunk angular velocity, EMG of the ankle flexors-extensors and foot-contact signals were recorded in 14 normal subjects. The experiments involved, initially, walking onto the stationary sled (condition Before). Then, subjects walked 20 times onto the moving sled (condition Moving), and it was noted that they increased their walking velocity from a baseline of 0.60 m/s to 0.90 m/s. After the moving trials, subjects were unequivocally warned that the platform would no longer move and asked to walk onto the stationary sled again (condition After). It was found that, despite this warning, subjects walked onto the stationary platform inappropriately fast (0.71 m/s), experienced a large overshoot of the trunk and displayed increased leg electromyographic (EMG) activity. Subjects were surprised by their own behaviour and subjectively reported that the 'broken escalator phenomenon', as experienced in urban life, felt similar to the experiment. By the second trial, most movement parameters had returned to baseline values. The findings represent a motor aftereffect of walking onto a moving platform that occurs despite full knowledge of the changing context. As such, it demonstrates dissociation between the declarative and procedural systems in the CNS. Since gait velocity was raised before foot-sled contact, the findings are at least partly explained by open-loop, predictive behaviour. A cautious strategy of limb stiffness was not responsible for the aftereffect, as revealed by no increase in muscle cocontraction. The observed aftereffect is unlike others previously reported in the literature, which occur only after prolonged continuous exposure to a sensory mismatch, large numbers of learning trials or unpredictable catch trials. The relative ease with which the aftereffect was induced suggests that locomotor adaptation may be more impervious to cognitive control than other types of motor learning.

KW  - Geodetic surveys of deformations
KW  - Wieliczka Salt Mine
AB  - In 2006 there had been 80 years since the start of systematic observations of surface and rock mass deformations in the area of halite exploitation in Wieliczka. This anniversary encourages us to make conclusions about the measurements made so far and discuss their results. Over many centuries of salt mining 2300 chambers and about 300 km of gallery workings were made, with total volume of 7.5 million m(3). The convergence of these voids is the source of the deformations on the surface of the area, manifesting mainly in the form of a subsidence trough of a large size. Deformations of the surface of the area and the rock mass make threat both to the objects on the surface (urban buildings) and to the mine itself, especially its historical part. A particular danger is made by the hollows caused by the caving of post-exploitation chambers or due to water suffosion. This makes it necessary to carry out observations on the behaviour of the rock mass and surface. These are, first of all, researches on surveying.
   Based on the measurement results one can state that in the mining area of Wieliczka there arc two subsidence troughs. In the article both troughs were characterized, also probable causes of their formation were given. The results of the observation of surface deformations in the area of main shafts and in the "Mina" region were presented in detail. In the latter case, the overall surface deformations in the observed region can be influenced by the movements caused by suffosion, convergence of mine workings and landslide movements.
   The studies on the deformation of the rock mass were based on the results of the observations, including height transfer by main mine shafts, altitude measurements of the benchmarks in the workings of all the available mine levels and altitude observations of the benchmarks stabilized on the dams in the "Fornalska II" chamber and "Mina" gallery. It was found that the rock mass movement in the area of main shafts of the mine is characterized by the occurrence of the increase in convergence deformations in central parts of mine workings and this trend has been stable for a long time.

AB  - Previous work on Gentianella and related genera is reviewed, particularly the taxonomic history of the New Zealand gentians and their generic placement. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences shows the New Zealand gentians belong in Gentianella. The recently described Australasian genus Chionogentias is preceded by earlier names applied to South American species that belong in a Southern Hemisphere clade.
   Thirty species are recognised, including seven new species (G. angustifolia, G. calcis, G. decumbens, G. luteoalba, G. impressinervia, G. scopulorum, and G. stellata) and one species (G. magnifica) raised from varietal status. The identity of G. patula is clarified and the specific status of G. amabilis is affirmed. Thirteen subspecies are recognised, including a new subspecies within G. astonii (subsp. arduana) and four within a new calcicole species G. calcis (subspp. calcis, waipara, manahune, taiko). New subspecies are also made in G. corymbifera (subsp. gracilis), G. montana (subsp. ionostigma), and G. chathamica (subsp. nemorosa). G. montana var. stolonifera is the only existing variety this treatment continues to recognise. Four previously recognised species are reduced to synonymy (G. gracilifolia, G. matthewsii, G. tereticaulis, and G. townsonii). Descriptions and keys are provided for all species and subspecies recognised.
   Evidence is limited, but Gentianella appears to have arrived in New Zealand from South America either once or twice, and has probably dispersed once from New Zealand to Australia. The place of the first establishment of Gentianella in New Zealand appears to be in the southern half of the South Island. An initial radiation in the lower South Island was followed by northward range extensions and dispersal events. A second radiation occurred in the Nelson and Marlborough mountains.

AB  - The prevalence and host range of black band disease (BBD) was determined from surveys of 19 reefs within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Prevalence of BBD was compared among reefs distributed across large-scale cross-shelf and long-shelf gradients of terrestrial or anthropogenic influence. We found that BBD was widespread throughout the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and was present on 73.7% of the 19 reefs surveyed in 3 latitudinal sectors and 3 cross-shelf positions in the summer of 2004. Although BBD occurred on all mid-shelf reefs and all but one outer-shelf reefs, overall prevalence was low, infecting on average 0.09% of sessile cnidarians and 0.1% of scleractinian corals surveyed. BBD affected similar to 7% of scleractinian taxa (25 of approximately 350 GBR hard coral species) and 1 soft coral family, although most cases of BBD were recorded on branching Acropora species. Prevalence of BBD did not correlate with distance from terrestrial influences, being highest on mid-shelf reefs and lowest on inshore reefs (absent from 66%, n = 6, of these reefs). BBD prevalence was consistently higher in all shelf positions in the northern (Cooktown/Lizard Island) sector, which is adjacent to relatively pristine catchments compared to the central (Townsville) sector, which is adjacent to a more developed catchment. BBD cases were clustered within reefs and transects, which was consistent with local dispersal of pathogens via currents, although the spread of BBD was not dependent on the density or cover of any of the coral taxa examined. In combination, these results suggest that BBD is part of the natural ecology of coral assemblages of the GBR, and its prevalence is relatively unaffected by terrestrial influences on the scales characteristic of cross-shelf gradients.

AB  - It is common knowledge among brain researchers that certain events, such as motor imagery, can elicit event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERD/ERS) of neurons in the brain, and that these phenomena manifest themselves in terms of band power changes in brain signals. There are, however, also important phase related changes in the brain signals associated with ERD/ERS which we investigate here. We quantify for the first time the "delta-phase" component of the Complex Band Power (CBP) features introduced in [G. Townsend, B. Graimann, G. Pfurtscheller, A comparison of common spatial patterns with complex band power features in a four-class BCI Experiment, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 53 (2006) 642-651] and [G. Townsend, Brain Computer Interfaces: Phase Features and Post Processing Issues, Ph.D. Thesis, 2006, p. 97]. Although this component, which makes explicit use of phase, is known from these earlier studies to provide improved classification results in a brain-computer interface (BCI), this phenomenon has never been investigated purely in the context of a physiological phenomenon. The importance of this study is to fill this gap in our knowledge by providing an analysis and quantification of this new feature so that an improved understanding of its nature will allow further exploitation of this feature to further improve BCI systems. Given that the primary use of BCIs is as an assistive technology for the disabled, the importance of this work to society cannot be overstated. Changes in band power in the context of ERD/ERS have been investigated in the past using a visualization tool called an ERD/ERS map [B. Graimann, Movement-Related Patterns in ECoG and EEG: Visualization and Detection, Ph.D. Thesis, 2003, p. 107]. We present and discuss here for the first time, an equivalent tool called the delta-phase map used to visualize the occurrence of delta-phase in different frequency bands and over the time courses of motor imagery trials. In this study, the delta-phase feature is shown to be proportional to frequency and is quantified and presented in that context for clarity. It was found that the most prominent ERD activity occurring in the frequency bands studied here are correlated to the activity captured in the delta-phase maps. The underlying nature of ERD/ERS is explored based on evidence provided by the delta-phase feature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methodologies for end use analysis have been developed by different researchers in the energy and water fields and in different areas in the world over the last 20 years. While there are care features associated with the methodologies and models used, the differences ran provide insight into the ways that they might be improved, as well as the differences that may be required in different regions and when models are used for different purposes.
   In addition to reviewing the field of end use analysis and appliance stock models, this paper will focus on two case studies. The first is the Sydney Water End Use Model, developed as part of the Sydney Water Least Cost Planning Study. This model has been developed and used to project the demand for water in Sydney over the next 20 years under business as usual scenario, as well as allow the projection of a number of scenarios which include major investment in water efficiency and effluent reuse programs as well as regulatory options to improve the efficiency of water using appliances in stalled in new buildings. Key features of the Sydney Water End Use Model include the fact that it takes into account the fact that the efficiency of toilets in Australia has a much larger range than (say) the US, in that the dual flush toilet was introduced in (to date) three stages. The model also accounts for projections of demographic and land use change which has been particularly dramatic in Sydney, particularly the movement to smaller occupancy rates in dwellings, and towards multi-family residential dwellings.
   The second case study will demonstrate the linkages between end use modeling of energy using and water using appliances. A model of residential energy use in Australia has been developed as part of a research project to develop greenhouse abatement scenario for Australia and many of the appliances modeled overlap with the water end use model, including clothes washing machines, dishwashers, showerheads and taps. This more recent modeling exercise has revealed the importance of key assumptions in standard stock modeling techniques, and highlighted the need for earlier starting dates for stock modeling.
   The process and results of these two case studies will be presented, and conclusions drawn about further improvements in end use analysis for both water and energy use. The linkage between the use of backcasting as a planning tool, and the use of end use analysis as a pre-requisite for the development of a demand management program is highlighted.

TI  - Configuration and Design in Caring Environments: syntax and quality of life in a sample of residential care homes for older people
T2  - Space Syntax 5th International Symposium, Vol 2, Proceedings
LA  - English
CP  - 5th International Space Syntax Symposium
AB  - Space syntax techniques for the analysis of spatial layouts were the first to demonstrate, in a numerical way, clear and systematic relations between spatial design and observed functioning across a range of building and urban types. In this project, the techniques have been applied for the first time to the problem of layout design in care homes for older people as part of a wider study of care home performance, Design in Caring Environments (DICE), carried out by Sheffield University. We were able to do this because the DICE data included both building plans and quantitative measures of the quality of life of residents and staff. The aim of the work that is reported here was to add the syntactic dimension and to test to see if this related to the DICE quality of life variables.
   Complex, multi-level regression methods (Gorard, 2003) had been used by the DICE team to plot relationships between the main physical features of each building and quality of life data for residents and staff. An identical approach was used to explore the relationship between a range of syntactic variables and the residents' quality of life scores for each building. In the final event, only two syntactic variables showed significant associations with quality of life outcomes, but these turned out to be the two most important configurational measures - axial global and local integration of the building. These measures are known to work well in predicting space occupancy; use and interaction in buildings that embed a weak organisational programme, where unplanned movement and activity are likely to make a positive contribution to community formation, but prior to this study we were unsure of the extent to which building layout would be able to overcome the effects of a strong organisational programme of the kind that exists in the care home sector and which is usually backed up by rules restricting access to different parts of the building.
   The results from multi-level modelling revealed clear and positive correlations between spatial design variables and three critical performance variables: the proportion of the residents' active time, frequency of the residents' enjoyable activity and the extent of the residents' choice and control over environment. The research thus shows unambiguously that, as many designers and care home managers suspect, design is indeed a critical variable in care home management and performance.

AB  - High-resolution aeromagnetic data from the northern Willamette Valley, Oregon, reveal large, northwest-striking faults buried beneath Quaternary basin sediments. Several faults known from geologic mapping are wed defined by the data and appear to extend far beyond their mapped surface traces. The Mount Angel fault, the likely source of the Richter magnitude (M-L) 5.6 earthquake in 1993, is at least 55 km long and may be connected in the subsurface with the Gales Creek fault 25 km farther northwest, Northeast of the Mount Angel fault, a 60-km-long, northwest-striking anomaly may represent a preciously unrecognized dextral-slip fault beneath the towns of Canby and Molalla. Vertical offsets along the Mount Angel fault increase with depth, indicating a long history of movement for the fault. Dominantly northwest-trending, relatively straight faults, consistent stepover geometrics, offset magnetic anomalies, and earthquake focal mechanisms suggest that these faults collectively accommodate significant dextral slip. The 1993 earthquake may have occurred on a left-stepping restraining bend along the Mount Angel-Gales Creek fault zone.

AB  - Lumbricid earthworms have been surveyed in Iceland for more than a century and data from many minor Studies are available. The early samplings were mostly carried out in and around important townships and seaports, where earthworms were collected by hand-a method that generally results in an over-representation of surface-living species. The material was brought together and reported sixty years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s some large-scale Surveys were performed. They aimed at elucidating various ecological problems, such as the development of a terrestrial invertebrate fauna in the virgin island of Surtsey, the occurrence of invertebrates in geographically isolated areas, and the population dynamics of earthworms. The present paper summarizes the early material and those sampled in the 1960s (695 specimens) and the 1970s (40,620 specimens).
   Five species are widely distributed and common in Iceland, viz. Dendrodrilus rubidus (Savigny), Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny), Lumbricus rubellus Hoffmeister, Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny) and Eiseniella tetraedra (Savigny). The four first mentioned species are found in a variety of habitats. D. rubidus occurs in low-productive (in terms of plant biomass production) soils, often associated with D. octaedra. In somewhat more productive soils occurring in "natural habitats" the lumbricid community may expand and also consist of L. rubellus and/or A. caliginosa. E. tetraedra on the other hand is bound to running freshwater and damp habitats, where it forms a "single-species community". When grass-herb vegetation Occurs close to the watercourse one or two of the other common species may appear there. The five common species are found all over the mainland. E. tetraedra, however, is not yet recorded from islands and islets, where freshwater habitats are scarce, for instance the Westman Islands, though the island of Heimaey has been inhabited for 1100 years at least.
   In man-made habitats, such as hay-fields (tun), pastures, and gardens, Lumbricus terrestris Linnaeus, L. castaneus (Savigny), Aporrectodea rosea (Savigny), and Octolasion cyaneum (Savigny) may be found. The species are mostly associated with urban areas, but have evidently also spread to some agricultural districts. They are all strongly dependent oil deep, high-productive soils that more or less annually are supplemented with organic matter and nutrients.
   The lumbricid faunas in Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Hebrides and the Faroes (in the Viking Age and the Late Middle Ages constituting the Nordic sphere) have many characteristics in common. Besides that the areas were exposed to the Weichselian glaciation, there are similarities in climatic conditions. The areas have also been connected by trade that has been going on for more than 1000 years, or since man settled in Iceland (landnam).
   Most likely, the Icelandic lumbricid fauna was eradicated during the last glaciation (if it existed before then). Tentatively it is assumed that specimens (for instance the cocoon stage) of the species D. rubidus, D. octaedra, and E. tetraedra passively drifted on ice floes together with soil and debris to Iceland from northwestern Europe during a limited time of the early deglaciation period. The species that may have been dispersed in that way might have been those that likely had colonized the soil in the vicinity of the melting land ice or occurred in vegetated sites along rivers failing into the Baltic and the North Sea. It is also likely that the presence of lumbricid earthworms in Iceland is a consequence of landnam. Specimens may have been fellow-passengers (associated with livestock and farming implements and occurring in hay and fresh water) when man colonized the island or when merchant vessels that were stabilized by ballast crossed the sea. Once established, the widely distributed species have dispersed actively and passively; the aid of man has most likely been of great importance, as the dispersal ability of lumbricids in general hardly can explain the wide geographical distribution they show today in Iceland. Undoubtedly, man solely is responsible for the patchy distribution of the demanding, less common species.
   Studies in the 1980s carried out in some farming districts have revealed that Aporrectodea longa (Ude) is part of the Icelandic lumbricid fauna. A few species that occur in the Hebrides, the Faroes, and Fennoscandia are still missing in Iceland. It is expected that some of them may appear in the future, as they may be introduced to gardens via greenhouses that are exposed to foreign, soil-living invertebrates.

AB  - The availability of regional earthquake data from the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network (PNSN), together with active source data from the Seismic Hazards Investigation in Puget Sound (SHIPS) seismic experiments, has allowed us to construct a new high-resolution 3-D, P wave velocity model of the crust to a depth of about 30 km in the central Puget Lowland. In our method, earthquake hypocenters and velocity model are jointly coupled in a fully nonlinear tomographic inversion. Active source data constrain the upper 10-15 km of the model, and earthquakes constrain the deepest portion of the model. A number of sedimentary basins are imaged, including the previously unrecognized Muckleshoot basin, and the previously incompletely defined Possession and Sequim basins. Various features of the shallow crust are imaged in detail and their structural transitions to the mid and lower crust are revealed. These include the Tacoma basin and fault zone, the Seattle basin and fault zone, the Seattle and Port Ludlow velocity highs, the Port Townsend basin, the Kingston Arch, and the Crescent basement, which is arched beneath the Lowland from its surface exposure in the eastern Olympics. Strong lateral velocity gradients, consistent with the existence of previously inferred faults, are observed, bounding the southern Port Townsend basin, the western edge of the Seattle basin beneath Dabob Bay, and portions of the Port Ludlow velocity high and the Tacoma basin. Significant velocity gradients are not observed across the southern Whidbey Island fault, the Lofall fault, or along most of the inferred location of the Hood Canal fault. Using improved earthquake locations resulting from our inversion, we determined focal mechanisms for a number of the best recorded earthquakes in the data set, revealing a complex pattern of deformation dominated by general arc-parallel regional tectonic compression. Most earthquakes occur in the basement rocks inferred to be the lower Tertiary Crescent formation. The sedimentary basins and the eastern part of the Olympic subduction complex are largely devoid of earthquakes. Clear association of hypocenters and focal mechanisms with previously mapped or proposed faults is difficult; however, seismicity, structure, and focal mechanisms associated with the Seattle fault zone suggest a possible high-angle mode of deformation with the north side up. We suggest that this deformation may be driven by isostatic readjustment of the Seattle basin.

AB  - The similar to 1720-1640 Ma Willyama Supergroup was deposited in an epi-continental rift basin accompanied by felsic and mafic magmatism, and hosts the largest known Pb-Zn-Ag accumulation at Broken Hill. The Supergroup Occupies the southern portion of the Curnamona Province, a largely buried similar to 50,000 km(2) crustal block, possibly the southernmost part of the Eastern Australian Pb-Zn belt (which includes Mt Isa). Additionally, the Province is a component of the early Mesoproterozoic IOCG 'super-province' that includes the Gawler Craton (Olympic Dam), Eastern Succession of the Mt Isa region (Ernest Henry) and perhaps parts of NW North America (Wernecke Mountains). The Curnamona Province, but a small part of the original basin, is divided into domains on depositional, tectonic and magmatic criteria with variably distributed stratigraphic units reflecting syn-depositional faulting and onlapping relationships resulting from rifting during the earlier extensional stage of basin evolution.
   Rifting controlled the variable distribution and thickness of the succession. In the Olary Domain to the west, the palaeo-flank exposes the similar to 1720-1715 Ma Curnamona Group, but overlying sediment packages are but sporadically developed. To the east and closer to the rift axis, sedimentation in the Broken Hill Domain was more complete, comprising similar to 1710-1705 Ma migmatitic-metasediments, and the overlying similar to 1705-1695 Ma Thackaringa, similar to 1695-1685 Ma Broken Hill and similar to 1685-1670 Ma Sundown Groups. The similar to 1670-1640 Ma Paragon and Strathearn Groups represent sag-phase deposition with a change in basin configuration and provenance.
   Earliest syn-depositional magmatism is recorded in the Olary Domain by similar to 1720-1710 Ma A-type felsic volcanics and intrusives and restricted basaltic lavas. The locus of magmatism then moved to the Broken Hill Domain with partial melting of either the lower parts of the Willyama Supergroup, or underlying rocks of similar composition, producing S-type granitic sills of the similar to 1705-1685 Ma Silver City Suite. Magmatism climaxed in the upper Broken Hill Group with emplacement of Fe-rich tholeiite sills and the similar to 1685 Ma volcaniclastic felsic Hores Gneiss hosting the Broken Hill Pb-Zn-Ag orebody.
   Polyphase deformation and high T, low P metamorphism, ranging from greenschist to lower granulite grade, resulted from the similar to 1620-1590 Ma Olarian Orogeny. Early layer-parallel schistosity was deformed progressively, first by large ductile recumbent and sheath-style folds, and later by upright folding. The mainly S-type granites of the similar to 1595-1580 Ma Ninnerie Supersuite were intruded late in the deformation history. An extensive network of post-1580 Ma retrograde shear zones dismembered the Willyama Supergroup and was partially reactivated during the similar to 500 Ma Delamerian Orogeny.
   Of the wide range of mineralisation styles in the Curnamona Province, Broken Hill-type Pb-Zn-Ag deposits and epigenetic Cu-Au and U are currently of greatest interest. Broken Hill-type mineralisation probably formed in a shallow depositional environment at or below the sea-floor, with maximum development approximating cessation of magmatic activity. Cu-Au (+/- Co, Mo) deposits (e.g. Kalkaroo, Portia) are located in chemical and structural traps near a regionally extensive redox boundary. By sharing geological aspects of the eastern Gawler Craton, the Curnamona Province has excellent prospectivity for Olympic Dam-style IOCG mineralisation. Uranium deposits, some economic, are located both in basement rocks and as roll-front concentrations in overlying Tertiary channel sands. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB  - When a dictatorship is overthrown and a transition to democracy begins, the police force's place in the new regime becomes a contested issue. Can they be trusted? Are they to be held responsible for having enforced the dictatorship's rules? The April 1974 Carnation Revolution put an end to Europe's longest right-wing dictatorship. The Armed Forces Movement, in order to consolidate its power after the revolution, dismantled the political police (PIDE) and imprisoned its officers. Other police forces were ordered to remain in their headquarters and wait for 'democratic' reorganisation. During the two revolutionary years that followed, the provisional governments could not count on the police and did not exercise effective authority: workers occupied factories, shanty town dwellers occupied empty houses and angry mobs destroyed the headquarters of political parties. How could the new authorities deal with the 'people's' disruptive mobilisations if 'repression' was the mark that stigmatised the overthrown 'fascist' dictatorship? The post-revolutionary governments had to devise a new interpretation of the police's repressive practices, learning to distinguish which were a mark of 'fascism', and which could simply be understood as the exercise of ordinary public order duties.

AB  - Recent investigations using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institutes (MBARI) Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) "Ventana" and "Tiburon" and interpretation of MBARI's EM 300 30 kHz multibeam bathymetric data show that the northern flank of the Santa Barbara Basin has experienced massive slope failures. Of particular concern is the large (130km(2)) Goleta landslide complex located off Coal Oil Point near the town of Goleta, that measures 14.6-km long extending from a depth of 90 in to nearly 574 m deep and is 10.5 km wide. We estimate that approximately 1.75 km(3) has been displaced by this slide during the Holocene. This feature is a complex compound submarine landslide that contains both surfical slump blocks and mud flows in three distinct segments. Each segment is composed of a distinct head scarp, down-dropped head block and a slide debris lobe. The debris lobes exhibit hummocky topography in the central areas that appear to result from compression during down slope movement. The toes of the western and eastern lobes are well defined in the multibeam image, whereas the toe of the central lobe is less distinct. Continuous seismic reflection profiles show that many buried slide debris lobes exist and comparison of the deformed reflectors with ODP Drill Site 149, Hole 893 sue-est that at least 200 000 years of failure have occurred in the area (Fisher et al., 2005a). Based on our interpretation of the multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection profiles we modeled the potential tsunami that may have been produced from one of the three surfical lobes of the Goleta slide. This model shows that a 10 m high wave could have run ashore along the cliffs of the Goleta shoreline.
   Several other smaller (2 km(2) and 4 km 2) slides are located on the northern flank of the Santa Barbara Basin, both to the west and east of Goleta slide and on the Conception fan along the western flank of the basin. One slide, named the Gaviota slide, is 3.8 km(2), 2.6 km long and 1.7 km wide. A distinct narrow sear extends from near the eastern head wall of this slide for over 2 km eastward toward the Goleta slide and may represent either an incipient failure or a remnant of a previous failure. Push cores collected within the main head sear of this slide consisted of hydrogen sulfide bearing mud, possibly suggesting active fluid seepage and a vibra-core penetrated similar to 50cm of recent sediment overlying colluvium or landslide debris confirming the age of similar to 300 years as proposed by Lee et al. (2004). However, no seeps or indications of recent movement were observed during our ROV investigation within this narrow head sear indicating that seafloor in the sear is draped with mud.

AB  - Food at temporary bait sites has been used to capture deer (Odocoileus spp.), apply Amitraz (Point Guard((R)), Hoechst Roussel Vet, Somerville, N.Y.) for tick control, deliver immunocontraceptive agents, increase hunter success rates, and implement sharpshooting programs. Yet, little is known about the effects of bait on movements of white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). Our objectives were to examine effects of temporary bait sites on white-tailed deer movements during the fall and winter-spring periods. We captured and marked 44 adult does with radiocollars and numbered ear tags from 1995-1997. We monitored 16 deer during a fall and winter-spring baiting and no-baiting period. Baiting occurred during fall 1997 and winter-spring 1998. During the fall and winter-spring period, deer exhibited 4 responses to baiting. If established bait sites were within deer core areas (n=11), deer maintained their original core areas. If bait sites were established outside deer original core areas but within deer home ranges (n=14), deer either shifted existing core areas closer to bait sites (n=6 of 14) or established new core areas closer to bait sites (n=2 of 14). Deer with 2 core areas abandoned core areas distant from bait sites (n=6 of 14). No deer used bait sites outside their annual home range. Deer with bait sites outside their core areas exhibited greater shifts in activity toward bait sites than deer with bait sites in their core areas (P<0.001). There were no differences in core-area size between the baiting and no-baiting periods during the fall (P=0.307) or winter-spring period (P=0.915). If bait sites were established outside deer core areas, shifts in core areas toward bait sites during the winter-spring period approached statistical significance compared to the fall (P=0.091). All collared deer with bait sites in home ranges used bait sites. We concluded that temporary bait sites had no effect on home range and core-area size but might shift core areas of activity within deer home ranges. Although deer shifted closer to bait sites, deer with bait sites in core areas used bait sites more frequently and likely would be more vulnerable to management activities at bait sites. Our data suggested that using bait to capture or remove deer would be more efficient during the winter-spring than during the fall. Removing deer or hunting over temporary bait sites should affect only the local deer herd in the immediate area.

AB  - The transport of fine-grained sediments in the marine environment entails risks of pollutant intrusions from substances absorbed onto the cohesive flocks' surface, gradually released to the aquatic field. These substances include nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate compounds from drainage from fertilization of adjacent cultivated areas that enter the coastal areas through rivers and streams, or trace metals as remainders from urban and industrial activities. As a consequence, knowledge on the motion and distribution of sediment particles coming from a given pollutant source is expected to provide the 'bulk' information on pollutant distribution, necessary for determining the region of influence of the source and to estimate probable trophic levels of the seawater and potential environmental risks. In that aim a numerical model has been developed to predict the fate of the sediments introduced to the marine environment from different pollution sources, such as river outflows, erosion of the seabed, aeolian transported material and drainage systems.
   The proposed three-dimensional mathematical model is based on the particle tracking method, according to which matter concentration is expressed by particles, each representing a particular amount of sedimentary mass, passively advected and dispersed by the currents. The processes affecting characteristics and propagation of sedimentary material in the marine environment, incorporated in the parameterization, apart from advection and dispersion, include cohesive sediment and near-bed processes. The movement of the particles along with variations in sedimentary characteristics and state, carried by each particle as personal information, are traced with time. Specifically, concerning transport processes, the local seawater velocity and the particle's settling control advection, whereas the random Brownian motion due to turbulence simulates turbulent diffusion. The vertical stratification of the water-column is taken into consideration by appropriate damping of the vertical diffusion term. Variations in cohesive sediment properties during the abidance in the aquatic environment include coagulation and flock break-up processes, quantification of the effects of ambient density to the density of the cohesive aggregate and the associated alterations to the falling speed of the particle. In the vicinity of the seabed, particles may deposit and gradually consolidate with time, the particles remain settled onto the bed, re-enter the flow at a later temporal point or may enter the water column for the first time, originating from the erosion of the bed. The occurrence of each of the aforementioned near-bed processes is defined according to the prevailing benthic shear stress conditions.
   The mathematical model has been applied to the Thermaikos Gulf, an area of high environmental and socioeconomic importance but also a region of significant pollutant forcing from various anthropogenic activities taking place in the adjoining land. Various kinds of outputs can be extracted, such as trajectories of the overall movement of specific particles and related alterations of their characteristics with time, snapshots of the domain with respect to suspended or deposited matter and natural concentrations of sediments at every required temporal and spatial point. Indicative results from yearly and monthly simulations, using input baro-clinic circulation data from the North Aegean Sea model and river discharges are presented and discussed, including outputs from a Typical One-Year Simulation (TOYS), the simulation of the period from 3 September 2001 to 31 August 2002 (S1A2) and the January 2003 experiment (J03).
   The description of the processes that have been incorporated in the parameterization covers the most significant factors controlling transport and mixing of fine grained sediments in the marine environment, thus validating the accuracy and completeness of the model. One of the major advantages, apart from the observation of the phenomena in scales smaller than the grid size, describing the natural processes more accurately, is the flexibility in accepting various pollutant sources and the applicability to different domains with minor modifications. The model has been incorporated in the MFSTEP project, as part of the developed operational forecasting system for the Mediterranean Sea. The application can be used for the prognosis of the seawater quality for current and for future conditions, enabling employment as part of a near-real time observation system or to formulate decisions for the protection of the seawater environment.

TI  - Kaghan Valley (Pakistan) earthquakes of February 14, 2004: source mechanism, intensity distribution and their impact
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIMALAYAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - Two moderate earthquakes of magnitude M-L 5.6 and 5.4 occurred in the Kaghan Valley of northern Pakistan on February 14, 2004. The events were located in Mansehra District near the town of Paras, about 30 km NNW of Muzaffarabad. The seismic and geologic data of the area suggest that the tectonic movement was concentrated in upper crust down to a depth of about 10 km. The composite focal mechanism solution of the earthquakes, using combined polarity data of a local network and global stations, indicates dominantly thrusting with orientation striking 335 degrees NNW-SSE and dipping 55 degrees in NE direction. The isoseismic map shows that the lateral extent of the intensity contours did not extend significantly far from peak intensity VIII on Modified Mercalli Intensity scale near Paras trending in NW-SE direction. Most of the damage took place along the strike of the seismogenic fault. Sharp relief and loose/thin fluvial filled narrow valleys further added to the damage. After about 20 months of these earthquakes, on October 8, 2005, a devastating earthquake occurred about 10 km north-west of Muzaffarabad at a depth of about 13 km. The orientation of the Kaghan Valley earthquakes is similar to the orientation of the main shock of the Muzaffarabad earthquake and coincides with that of the Kashmir Thrust.

KW  - VIRUS
AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB) was previously known in many countries as greening disease. It is caused by the bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' and is vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). A delimiting survey showed that the disease had become established in, and near the border town of, Vanimo in the Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) by late 2002. A campaign of quarantine containment and public awareness followed. A second survey undertaken 1 year later indicated that long-distance movement of the disease and its vector had not occurred. Out of a total of 120 trees indexed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 4/72 were HLB-positive in 2002 compared to 12/48 in 2003. The second survey found presumptive evidence for limited HLB disease cluster expansion and further independent introduction of infected planting material. HLB-positive samples were also screened for Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) infection using a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The symptoms observed on leaves of orange (Citrus sinensis) and lemon (Citrus limon) infected by 'Ca. L. asiaticus' alone and 'Ca. L. asiaticus' plus CTV were similar. This is also the first verified record of CTV in PNG. No evidence was found for the presence of HLB in four Pacific Island countries (Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Samoa and Tonga) to the east of PNG with 18 citrus trees tested negative by PCR.

AB  - Historical sources have recorded earthquake shocks, their effects and difficulties that local inhabitants experienced before the AD 79 Pompeii eruption. Archaeological studies pointed out the effects of such seismicity, and have also evidenced that several water crises were occurring at Pompeii in that period. Indeed numerous sources show that, at the time of eruption, and probably some time before, the civic aqueduct, having ceased to be supplied by the regional one, was out of order and that a new one was being built. Since Roman aqueducts were usually built with a recommended minimum mean slope of 20 cm/km and Pompeii's aqueduct sloped from the nearby Apennines toward the town, this slope could have been easily cancelled by uplift that occurred in the area even if this was only moderate.
   For the crustal deformations a volcanic origin is proposed and a point source model is used to explain the observations. Simple analysis of the available data suggests that the ground deformations were caused by a < 2 km(3) volumetric change at a depth of similar to 8 km that happened over the course of several decades.

AB  - On the basis of geological and geomorphological surveys, landslide phenomena are analysed on a slope along a stretch of the Adriatic coast, near Petacciato (Molise, Italy).
   Locally, a blue clay sequence of Pleistocene outcrops, stratified with silty-sandy layers; bedding dips 3-8degreesNE and the slope has a similar attitude. This sequence evolves upwards to sands and conglomerates, with thickness of up to 40 in, on which the built-up area is located.
   Several episodes of landslide reactivation occurred in the past century, involving the zone between the built-up area and the sea, along a coastal slope of over 2000 m long and 200 in high. Important roads and railway lines have been heavily damaged as well as the town itself.
   The typology of the movement is a rotational-translational slide; the displacement reaches tens of centimetres at each reactivation episode along the entire coastal slope, extending well beyond the shore line.
   Detailed studies already exists, but different mechanism failures have been proposed to explain the landslide phenomena. In this study, a new failure mechanism is proposed, (sudden spreading of Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B., 1948. Soil Mechanics in Engineering Practice. Wiley and Sons New York) and analytical approaches have been adopted to evaluate the slope stability, based on the geotechnical and monitoring data and the geometrical and geological features of the slope.

AB  - The shore west of the town Bregenz situated at Lake Constance (Mehrerauer Seetifer) offers habitats for relictic floristic elements, such as the Lake Constance forget-me-not (Myosotis rehsteineri, WARTM.). During the last decades, several -meter-high gravely bars developed at the beach, and moved into landward direction. Sedimentological investigations were carried out in the littoral region, at the beach, and in the periodically flooded lagoons, in order to display the reasons for the sediments movements. Regular surveys of the bars exhibited them to move episodically. The translocation probably occurred at high water stages, especially during storm events. Extended well sorted, gravely beds were classified as tempestites, whereas poorly sorted, coarse gravely plasters seaward of the bars were characteristic of long-term erosion of fines. One reason for the observed morphodynamical processes probably were deep hollows in the littoral region, which had been the results of sand and gravel mining: Storm waves were moving towards the beach with low friction, and therefore were barely decelerated. In addition, the artificial progradation of the mouth of the River Bregenzer Aach, and the deepening of its riverbed evoked a reduction in inputs of fine particulate matter from the River Bregenzer Aach, which in turn caused a decrease in substitution of losses of the fine-grained binding agent due to erosion. The morphodynamics at the shore of Mehrerau are based on an interaction between anthropogenic reasons and natural storm events.

AB  - This cross sectional study was conducted among textile mill workers in Bahir Dar town in 1995/96. The main objective of the study was to investigate how workers perceive their work environment and explore their state of satisfaction with their work.;A pretested questionnaire was administered by trained health workers to 394 production workers.;The majority of the workers (53.6%) claimed the work environment to be,hot. For 668%, the physical conditions around the working departments was worst during the hot season. The work place was perceived as dusty and noisy by 47.2% and 36.0% of the respondents respectively. The distribution of adverse environmental complaint by work department was not the same. A higher proportion of the workers in the spinning department complained of inadequate ail movement (64.5%) and dusty work place (53.3%); whereas those in the weaving department complained the work place to be hot and noisy (60.5%, 53.5% respectively). Aprons were used by 95.7%, but other personal protectors such as ear protectors, gloves and goggles were used rarely. In general, 228 (57.9%) workers were satisfied but the rest were dissatisfied with their work environment. In order to improve the hygienic Conditions in the work place, 71.2% suggested use of different kinds of personal protectors. In conclusion, personal protectors should always be used, environmental hygiene should be conducted and health education should be provided to workers.

AB  - AIM: To explore the virulence and the infectivity of coccoid Helicobacterpylori(H. pylori) transformed from spiral form by exposure to sterile tap water.
   METHODS: Three strains of H, pylori, isolated from gastric biopsy specimens of confirmed peptic ulcer, were converted from spiral into coccoid form by exposure to sterile tap water. Both spiral and coccoid forms of H. pylori were tested for the urease activity, and the adherence to Hep-2 cells. The presence of flagella was examined under electron microscopy. In the experimental animal infection, the spiral and coccoid forms of H. pylori originated from the same strain F49 were inoculated intragastrically into BALB/c mice respectively four times at a 3-day interval. Half of the mice from each group were sacrificed at Day 21 and Day 28 after the last inoculation. Histology and H.pylori/colonization were detected by urease test of gastric mucosa, cultures of H.pylori,, and electron microscopy and so on.
   RESULTS: The urease activity and the ability of adherence to Hep-2 cells were found to be lower in coccoid H.pylori than that in its spiral form. For example, the transformation in strain F-44 led to a significant decrease of the adherence rate and adherence index from 70.0 +/- 5.3 % to 30.2 +/- 3.5 % (P < 0.01), and from 2.6 +/- 0.4 to 0.86 +/- 0.3 (P < 0.01), respectively. The flagella of coccoid H, pylori were observed under electron microscope. In the experimental infection in mice, the positive rate of gastric mucosa urease test was 93.8 % (15/16) in the group infected try spiral H.pylori and 50 % (8/16) in the group infected by coccoid H.pylori; and the estimated coccoid H.pylori colony number was 1.75 vs 0.56. The positive rates of H.pylori culture were 87.5 (14/16) in spiral H. pylori group and 68.8 % (11/16) in coccoid H. pylori group. There was no significant difference in either urease test or bacterial culture rate between the groups examined at Day 21 and Day 28 after inoculation. Electron microscopic examination of the samples taken from both groups showed the adherence of H.pylori in spiral, bacillary and coccoid shapes to the epithelial cells of gastric wall. Histological examination showed the occurrence of gastric mucosal injury as indicated by various degrees of erosion, ulcer, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Mucosal injury was slighter in the mice infected by coccoid H.pylori. No positive result was obtained in the control group that received intragastrical administration of sterile tap water.
   CONCLUSION: Although the virulence of coccoid H.pylori induced by water decrease, coccoid H.pylori still remains a considerable urease activity and the adhering ability to epithelial cells. Furthermore, the flagella, an important component responsible for bacterial movement and infection, were still observed as a cellular structure of coccoid H.pylori under electron microscope. The coccoid H.pylori induced by water is capable of colonizing in gastric mucosa and causing gastrititis in mice.

TI  - Oil Spill Emergency Response Mapping for Coastal Area Using SAR Imagery and GIS
T2  - OCEANS 2008, VOLS 1-4
LA  - English
CP  - OCEANS 2008 Conference
AB  - Oil spill disaster is unexpected accident occurs through failures in operations, transportations, ship accidents, human errors or due to other disasters such as flood and earthquake. Most of oil spills happen in coastal and sea environment that make the emergency response for the accident much difficult and complicate. Intricate operations involve through complexity of sea and coastal conditions, especially in bad weather where the access to the accident site is difficult. Management of such event needs an organized contribution, covering all procedures of disaster operation from monitoring and detection to mitigation and relief. This paper presents methods of SAR image and GIS technology applications for oil spill management in coastal area. The developed framework is based on automatic detecting and mapping of oil spills in SAR image and provision of oil spill location and extent map which includes information about the spill thicknesses and geographic references such as major towns and features along the coastal area. The output from SAR image processing then transferred into oil spill trajectory simulation model to simulate the next destinations of oil spill. Oil spill trajectory predicts the movement, spreading, and coastal impact of oil spill in the marine environment. The output vectors from trajectory simulation used as input data for creating other disaster products including oil spill risk map, affected area map and emergency response map. Each product demonstrates the results from various analyses aspects, include situational analysis, risk analysis, damage analysis, and emergency response analysis using satellite SAR image in GIS and image analysis software. All the models and applications are described and depicted.

AB  - We studied the ecological distribution and foraging behavior of three species in the Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) species group in the Eastern Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. The three species. Black-throated Green, Hermit (D. occidentalis) and Townsend's (D. townsendi) Warblers are largely allopatric on the breeding grounds and variably sympatric during the winter. We surveyed the composition of 166 mixed-species flocks and recorded habitat variables associated with the flock location along an elevational transect. We found that Black-throated Green and Townsend's Warblers segregated by altitude, whereas Hermit Warbler overlapped extensively with both other species. Even though Townsend's and Hermit Warblers co-occurred commonly in the same Rocks, the latter showed strong selective use of pine trees and the former showed weaker selectivity of oak trees. Black-throated Green Warbler showed no tree-type selection. The combined differences in elevational distribution and tree-type use resulted in very low ecological overlap for the three species. The Black-throated Green Warbler was the most distinct in its foraging behavior, occurring more often in the outer and upper branches of trees, and using hanging, aerial, and hovering maneuvers more than its congeners. In addition, it showed a higher movement frequency and a lower rate of between-branch flights. The Black-throated Green Warbler also is the most morphologically distinct as a result of its overall smaller body size, which is consistent for the trend towards larger body size in more conifer-specialized species in this genus. We propose that as new breeding populations were founded, and speciation occurred, individuals of the more derived species occupied decreasingly productive winter habitats.

AB  - The Highland Boundary Fault Zone (HBFZ) is one of the major faulted tectonic boundaries in Great Britain. Historically, seismicity has occurred in this zone around the town of Comrie. But an earthquake sequence that occurred in 2003 near the village of Aberfoyle (M-L 1.3-3.2) was the first significant activity to be recorded in the HBFZ since the installation of modem seismograph networks in the 1970s. This study describes detailed analysis of these data. The waveform signals of the events were almost identical and by applying a cross-correlation technique combined with multiple event location, the alignment of the events was found to be WSW-ENE. This alignment matches one of the nodal planes determined by joint focal mechanism analysis. The fault plane dips to the northwest, and shows oblique sinistral strike-slip with normal movement. The orientation of the event alignment matches the direction and orientation of observed features in the HBFZ. Hence, it is concluded that the WSW-ENE striking nodal plane was the causative fault that is associated with the HBFZ. The orientation of maximum compressional stress is rotated from the regional average expected due to the Mid-Atlantic ridge-push force. This rotation is possibly explained by stresses due to postglacial rebound. Smaller events in the sequence were used as empirical Green's functions and deconvolved from the larger events to determine source time functions. The corresponding corner frequencies matched results from spectral fitting, showing that the events were of relatively low stress drop. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - 'Men of the cloth': The federal theological seminary of Southern Africa, Inkatha and the struggle against apartheid
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - On 25 August 1985, a crowd of a hundred people, led by the mayor of Imbali, Patrick Pakkies, and a member of the KwaZulu Legislature, Velaphi Ndlovu, demanded that the staff and students of the Federal Theological Seminary of Southern of Africa (Fedsem) leave their premises by the following Friday, allegedly because they had been instrumental in the school boycott and the street demonstrations organised the same month by the youth in protest against the Imbali Township Council. The seminary community left the area, but they won an interim interdict and came back two weeks later. It is to the history of this episode that this paper is devoted. Did the seminary constitute a threat to the authority of the Imbali Council? To some extent, the Imbali residents who accused Fedsem of being involved in the politics of the township were right. Since the time of the seminary's expropriation from the land it occupied in Alice, staff and students had multiplied the acts of defiance against the apartheid regime. Yet, with a few exceptions, none of them played an active role in the democratic movement. Clearly, the Imbali residents and their leaders overestimated their influence upon the local youth. Many of them belonged to the very churches that were sending their candidates for the ministry to Fedsem. For them, this institution was nothing other than a terrorist organisation. Chief Buthelezi, who had been supportive of the seminary during its early years, refused to discipline his supporters. The Department of Development Aid, under whose jurisdiction Fedsem fell, would have liked to close the seminary, but it never managed to prove that it represented a threat to law and order.

AB  - The largest inland earthquake (M-L=7.3) of the 20th century in Taiwan occurred at 0147hrs local time on 21 September, 1999 near the small town of Chi-Chi, in central Taiwan, The crustal deformation pattern, caused by the Ch-Chi earthquake, appears to be unrelated to the velocity field that GPS stations measured in the period 1992 to 1995, I exhibits a greater horizontal and vertical slip in the northern block between the Tachia River and the Wu River than in the southern block between the Wu River and the Tzoshui River. This study compares the stream profiles of three rivers in central Taiwan, namely the Tachia, Wu and Tzoshui Rivers, which run westward across the Shuilikeng fault, the Shuangtung fault, the Chelungpu fault and the Changhwa fault. Historical change of stream gradient is retrieved by a comparison of previous maps published by the Japanese authorities in 1904 and produced by the Department of Interior, ROC in 1985, The results, simulated by the diffusion model, indicate that the changes are attributable to the crustal movement in this area over the past 80 years. It is concluded that crustal deformation has been more evident in the block between the Tachia River and the Wu River than that between the Wu River and the Tzoshui River. This result agrees with the faulting net slip caused by the Chi-Chi earthquake. The method used in this study has been verified as a feasible tool in the research of earthquake prediction and seismic hazard assessment, Further studies are necessary in such a tectonically active area as Taiwan.

AB  - Internationally, ethnicity in sports has become an independent field of research amongst sports historians focusing on phenomena such as colonialism, immigration and indigenous populations. Studies demonstrate that sports have simultaneously been able to assimilate different groups, promoting majority concepts of identity and majority values, and enable groups to fashion their own singular ethnic identities in contrast to those of majority societies. In Norwegian historical research, sport and ethnicity has been given only scarce attention. Norwegian sports historians have mainly seen Norway as an ethnically homogenous society where sport has played an essential part in creating a unifying national identity. A major concern for Norwegian sports history research has been the political split in Norwegian sports in the 1930s. Research on this event has mainly been occupied with the relationship between the Workers' Sports Association (AIF) and the "bourgeois'' National Sports Federation (NLI), and by AIF's significance as a political movement. Less attention, however, has been given to its cultural impact. This article investigates the establishment and function of AIF in the multi-ethnic area of West Finnmark, a geographically and politically peripheral region of Northern Norway, at the end of the 1930s. The town of Alta, the main focus of attention, was in the 1930s a small fiord community with an ethnically mixed population of indigenous Sami, Kvens and Norwegians, sharp political divisions and a vibrant sporting milieu. Although the political division of Alta's sports establishment displays many of the traits that characterize similar events in the country at large, the ethnic factor brought another, important, dimension to it. This highly politicized period in Finnmark sports underlines the importance of sports as an arena for the construction and reinforcement of not only political identity, but also for the production of ethnic and local identities.

KW  - Mandibular condyle fracture
KW  - Open reduction
KW  - Close reduction
KW  - Systematic review
AB  - Objective : The objective of this review was to provide reliable comparative results regarding the effectiveness of any interventions either open or closed that can be used in the management of fractured mandibular condyle
   Patients and Methods : Research of studies from MEDLINE and Cochrane since 1990 was done. Controlled vocabulary terms were used. MeSH Terms were "Mandibular condyle" AND "Fractures, bone". Only comparative study were considered in this review using the "limit" function. According to the criteria, two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of studies resulting from the searches. The studies were divided according to some criteria, and following were measured: Ramus height, condyle sagittal displacement, condyle Towns's image displacement, Maximum open length, Protrusion & Lateral excursion, TMJ pain, Malocclusion, and TMJ disorder.
   Results : Many studies were analyzed to review the post-operative result of the two methods of treatment. Ramus height decreased more in when treated by closed reduction as opposed to open reduction. Sagittal condyle displacement was shown to be greater in closed reduction. Condyle Town's image condyle displacement had greater values in closed reduction. Maximum open length showed lower values in closed reduction. In protrusive and lateral movement, closed reduction was less than ORIF. Closed reduction showed greater occurrence of malocclusion than ORIF. However, post-operative pain and discomfort was greater in ORIF.
   Conclusion : In almost all categories, ORIF showed better results than CRIF. However, the use of the open reduction method should be considered due to the potential surgical morbidity and increased hospitalization time and cost. To these days, Endoscopic surgical techniques for ORIF (EORIF) are now in their infancy with the specific aims of eliminating concern for damage to the facial nerve and of reducing or eliminating facial scars. Before performing any types of treatment, patients must be understood of both of the treatment methods, and the best treatment method should be taken on permission.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope Exploited gas fields and underground gasholders are specific sources of increasing methane concentration. Methane migrates into the soils by diffusion and convection through natural and technogenic cracks in geological structures and influences the function of the soils. Soil cover of gas-bearing area functions as a specific, bilateral, periodically penetrating, geomembrane. Soils shield, transform, and differentiate migrating fluxes of technogenic-allochthonous methane, preventing its emission to the atmosphere. Problems of methane's emission are rather current at the present, as methane is the second in importance after CO2 greenhouse gas, since its concentration in the atmosphere annually grows by approximately 1%. By global estimations, methane emissions in the gas industry make about 8% of annual receipt to the atmosphere, equal on the average to 500.g per a year (Cicerone and Oremland, Global Biogeochem Cy 2: 299-327, 1988). But these calculations are based on the account of the technological losses making 3-12% from the mining of natural gas. The contribution of migratory methane fluxes to the atmosphere, as a rule, is not considered. The need for research of soil cover functioning on gas-bearing areas is explained by the fact that processes of methane oxidation, its transformation in soils, and emission to the atmosphere at these objects are now practically not being studied. The aim of our study was to reveal specific processes of soil function and formation on gas-bearing areas by an example of underground gasholder.
   Materials and methods The material was sampled in 1998-2003 at the territory of underground gasholder located in Albeluvisol's zone in Russia. According to the comparative-geographical method, 51 soil profiles have been studied in similar litologically geomorphological conditions in various geochemical zones: in the industrial zone, in the zone of gas dissipation, and at the regional background. The total square of investigated territory is about 60 km(2). Six soil profiles were investigated in seasonal dynamics. Samples of soils for physical, chemical, and microbiological analyses were taken from each horizon of soil profiles (202 samples). Samples of soil air for a definition of methane concentration were taken from depths of 20, 40, and 60 cm. Methane emission to the atmosphere was measured near soil's cuts and, in addition, on all area of the investigated territory at knots of squares network through 700-1,000 m, in total at 32-42 points in May, July, and November. Years of investigation have been split by technological and hydrothermal conditions. The periods with the normal and lowered compression of gas in gasholder, dry and warm, and damp and cool years have been allocated. It has influenced the soil function processes and considered an interpretation of the data received.
   Results The changes of functional parameters of soils at a gas-bearing area influenced by methane fluxes migrating from gas deposits, in comparison with background soils, are revealed. Such functional parameters are methane concentration in the soils, activity of its bacterial oxidation, methane emission to the atmosphere, and oxidation-reduction potential. Spatial and temporary dynamics of these parameters at gas-bearing and background territory are investigated.
   Discussion Methane interaction with soil's air is in its ascending (descending) and lateral diffusion and convection in soils. Methane fluxes dissipate in porous space of soils forming gas anomalies. The technogenic-allochthonous methane concentration strongly varies in soil's air on gas-bearing area (1-10,500 ppm) and, on average, exceeds the autochthonous, microbiologically produced methane at background territories. Migratory methane is deposited on diffusion and sorption barriers. The capacity of diffusion barrier depends on effective coefficient of diffusion, the attitude of air and general porosity, and granulometric composition and sharply differs in auto-, semi- hydro-, and hydromorphic soils reaching maximum in hydromorphicity and among the soils with identical water content-in heavy soils. The capacity of the sorption barrier is defined by abiotic methane absorption and a specific surface of soils and grows with their increasing intensity in soils to a heavier granulometric composition or into soils with peat and gleyic horizons. The low sorption capacity leads to an increase of methane concentration in the soil's air and decreases its utilization by microorganisms, in which its quantity depends on sorption properties. The central component of functioning that promotes a number of essential transformations in soils on gas-bearing areas is methane interaction with the biotic phase. The periods of methane deposition by diffusion and sorption barriers are used for biological methane oxidation and formation of biogeochemical barriers in soils. The activity of bacterial methane oxidation is characterized by spatial variability and depends on the entrance of methane, defined by granulometric composition, soil moisture, the attitude of air and general porosity, Eh, organic matter content, and salinization. During interaction between technogenic-allochthonous methane and soil on diffusion, sorption, and biogeochemical barriers, its transformation occurs, accompanied by a strengthening of variability of oxidation-reduction potential and formation of pedogenic, bacteriomorphic, and nanodispersic magnetic oxides of iron.
   Conclusions and perspectives Specificity of soil functioning on a gas-bearing area is in interaction of technogenic-allochtonous methane with solid, liquid, gaseous, and living substance of the soil system. Spatial laws of soils functioning on gas-bearing area in the Albeluvisol's zone are revealed. Distinctions of soil functions depending on litologically geomorphological conditions are shown. The greatest changes of parameters of functioning under the influence of technogenic-allochthonous methane occur in automorphic soils, and it is less in semi- hydromorphic soils. Activity of bacterial methane oxidation in soils, emission, and consumption from the atmosphere and their spatial laws are characterized by the time dynamics depending on hydrothermal and technological conditions of seasons and years. During oxidation in soils of gas-bearing areas, carbon of methane is concentrated on a biogeochemical barrier that is shown in the increase of methylotrophic microorganisms' biomass and leads to a high variability and decrease of Eh and to the formation of magnetic oxides of iron.
   Recommendations Results of research can be used for carrying out ecological monitoring and an estimation of tightness of objects of the gas industry. Activity of bacterial methane oxidation, Eh, and magnetic oxides of iron can be used as diagnostic parameters of soils on gas-bearing areas.

T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - The tsunami of 26 December 2004 was the largest ever recorded in the Indian Ocean, triggered by the 3rd largest earthquake in 100 years measuring 9.2 moment magnitude. The epicenter of the earthquake was off Banda Aceh on the Indian Ocean coast of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, centered at 3.316 degrees N, 95.854 degrees E. A sudden upward movement of the seafloor that averaged similar to 6m occurred along almost 1300 km of the north-east Indian Ocean plate at 0059 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and lasted 8 min. Because of the lack of preparedness and absence of warning systems in the Indian Ocean the tsunami spread silently across the ocean over a span of 8 h causing massive destruction including the deaths of over 250,000 people, with maximum damages occurring in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and the Maldives. Moderate to low damages were recorded in the Seychelles, Socotra (Yemen) and Somalia, though in the latter a highly vulnerable town was impacted resulting in over 300 deaths. Most of eastern Africa was spared massive damages from the waves due to (a) distance from the epicenter (> 6000 km), (b) the dissipation of energy of the tsunami by shallow banks in the middle of the Indian Ocean (the Seychelles banks, Saya de Malha and Cargados Carajos Shoals) and (c) at least for Kenya and Tanzania, the first and largest waves hit at low tide. In Kenya and Tanzania these factors resulted in the waves being experienced as tidal surges of 1-1.5 m amplitude lasting 5-10 min. Damages recorded for eastern Africa include 11 deaths in Tanzania and 1 in Kenya, of people walking and swimming over shallow intertidal flats being trapped by the advancing and receding tidal surges, damage to boats anchored in shallow water and inundation in Mauritius and Rodrigues. Official information, warning and response networks were nonexistent, and even when an official response was generated in Kenya the public demonstrated no faith or willingness to act on warnings from officials such as the police. Importantly, information on the tsunami and the generation of an official response was dependent on two technologies, satellite television and mobile telephony, and these should be built into future warning systems as key mechanisms and backups to official information and warning networks.

AB  - In this study, a complex landslide, which occurred on 17 March 2005 near Koyulhisar town of Sivas Province of Turkey, is presented. The landslide resulted in 15 deaths and the destruction of about thirty houses at Kuzulu village. The main aims of this study are to assess the landslide in terms of engineering geology and geotechnics, to back-analyze the landslide in the source area, and to estimate its motion and destructive forces on structures. Furthermore, the effect of a future earthquake on stability condition of the mobilized but not completely failed mass adjacent to the right flank of the landslide is also investigated. Field observations, eyewitnesses, geomechanical laboratory tests, interpretations on pre-event aerial photographs and analyses using different approaches have been fundamentals of this study. Site observations indicate that the initial landslide in the source area occurred in highly weathered volcanics along a failure surface passing through the volcanics and along the interface between the volcanics and underlying limestone. Then the movement transformed into an earth flow and moved down through a V-shaped channel in the underlying limestone about 2 km until it stopped at a small settlement, which is called Kuzulu. Site observations and back-analysis of the initial slide suggest that the most likely cause should be water pressure increase as it is the season of snow melting and thawing of the groundwater. Interpretations on pre-event aerial photographs and the information obtained from eyewitnesses indicated that slope movements in the study area, where old landslide topography is evident, were continuing for many years. The simulation of the landslide with consideration of Bingham type yielding criterion together with water pressure variation suggested that the maximum velocity of the earth flow was 14.4 m/s and 13.6 m/s when it reached Kuzulu. Furthermore, this evaluation showed that the earth flow reached Kuzulu after 300 s, which is consistent with the information obtained from local people. The impact of the earth flow on the structures could be about 170 kPa against which only reinforced concrete structures may resist. Dynamic analyses suggested that a future earthquake, which may occur in the region, may result in a complete failure of the unstable mass remaining at the source area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Blowing sand and surface winds in the Pisco to Chala Area, Southern Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
LA  - English
AB  - The coastal belt of southern Peru is noted for its extensive and varied sand dunes. A major part of the sand occurs in a 300 km long strip starting 200 km south of Lima between the towns of Pisco on the north and Chala on the south. The sand is picked LIP from the Pacific Ocean beaches by the nearly invariant south-southeast winds and moved inland to its resting place in huge sand masses ("sand seas" or "ergs," depending on the author), generally at higher elevations. The writer mapped the moving sands and accumulated sand masses in this interesting region in 1959-1961 with airphotos, work which is partly unpublished and largely unknown (Plate 1). Eight sand masses were mapped; a ninth (Cerro Blanco) occurs just outside the area of airphoto coverage. If an average sand depth of only 10 m is assumed for the largest sand mass at lea in the northern Part of the area, that mass contains nearly 12 billion tons of sand and covers 900 km 2. Probably the average sand depth here is greater. One of the unique features of the present study was the mapping of the direction of sand movement (small arrows in Plate 1) which indicates the direction of prevailing Surface winds. Offshore, these winds have a nearly constant south-south east direction. Onshore, the winds blow in great clockwise-sweeping arcs due to frictional drag and other forces as the wind moves diagonally from the ocean over the uneven ground surface. However, there is some modification of the wind direction by topography, one good example being the obvious partitioning of the wind around both sides of Cerro Huaricangana (elev. 1725 m) in the center of the area (Plate 1b). But the most interesting wind pattern occurs in an area of subdued relief and low elevation near lea (elev. approx. 400 m), where the sands converge on the Ica sand mass from nearly opposite directions, that is, from the northwest, west, southwest, and southeast. The wide angle sweep (140degrees) of incoming sands here is believed to be unique in the world. A Landsat image was used to determine how this unusual wind pattern could develop (see Fig. 9), but the extreme local rotation of the winds is not fully understood. One idea proposed here by the author is that the surface/near-surface winds move as horizontal vortices, not in streamlines as is generally assumed, and it is the interaction of the vortices and the land surface that causes the pervasive clockwise swing in wind direction.

AB  - CARS ELICIT a wide range of feelings: the pleasures of driving, the outburst of 'road rage', the thrill of speed, the security engendered by driving a 'safe' car and so on. They also generate intensely emotional politics in which some people passionately mobilize to 'stop the traffic' and 'reclaim the streets', while others vociferously defend their right to cheap petrol. Cars are above all machines that move people, but they do so in many senses of the word. Recent approaches to the phenomenology of caruse have highlighted 'the driving body' as a set of social practices, embodied dispositions, and physical affordances (Sheller and Urry, 2000; Dant and Martin, 2001; Edensor, 2002; Oldrup, 2004; Dant, 2004; Thrift, 2004). More encompassing approaches to the anthropology of material cultures have also resituated the car as a social-technical 'hybrid' (Michael, 2001; Miller, 2001a).(1) This article builds both on this work and on recent approaches in the sociology of emotions (Hochschild, 1983, 1997, 2003; Bendelow and Williams, 1998; Katz, 2000; Goodwin et al., 2001; Ahmed, 2004) to explore the ways in which the 'dominant culture of automobility' (Urry, 2000) is implicated in a deep context of affective and embodied relations between people, machines and spaces of mobility and dwelling, in which emotions and the senses play a key part.
   Social commentators have long addressed the problem of car cultures in an explicitly normative manner concerned with the restitution of 'public goods' (the environment, human health, the social fabric of cities, democratic public cultures) that have been eroded by contemporary car and road systems (Jacobs, 1961; Nader, 1965; Sennett, 1990; Kunstler, 1994; Dunn, 1998). At stake in such debates is not simply the future of the car, but the future of the entire 'car culture' (and wider transportation system) in what might be characterized as 'societies of automobility' in which the 'coercive freedom' of driving shapes both public and private spaces of all scales and kinds (Sheller and Urry, 2000; Urry, 2004). Yet most practical efforts at promoting more 'ethical' forms of car consumption have been debated and implemented as if the intense feelings, passions and embodied experiences associated with automobility were not relevant.
   Car cultures have social, material and above all affective dimensions that are overlooked in current strategies to influence car-driving decisions. The individualistic 'rational choice' model, which is so influential as to be taken for granted in transportation policy debates, distorts our understanding of how people (and their feelings) are embedded in historically sedimented and geographically etched patterns of 'quotidian mobility' (Kaufman, 2000). Paying attention to the emotional constituents of car cultures, however, need not imply resorting to black-box causal explanations such as the popular yet ill-defined notions of 'automobile addiction' or a 'love affair' with the car (Motavalli, 2001). New approaches both to car cultures and to emotional cultures can aid us in shifting attention away from the counter-factual 'rational actor' who supposedly makes carefully reasoned economic choices, and towards the lived experience of dwelling with cars in all of its complexity, ambiguity and contradiction.
   Car consumption is never simply about rational economic choices, but is as much about aesthetic, emotional and sensory responses to driving, as well as patterns of kinship, sociability, habitation and work. Insofar as there are 'car cultures' vested in an 'Intimate relationship between cars and people' (Miller, 2001b: 17), we can ask how feelings for, of and within cars occur as embodied sensibilities that are socially and culturally embedded in familial and sociable practices of car use, and the circulations and displacements performed by cars, roads and drivers. As Michel Callon and John Law suggest:
   Agency and subjectivity are not just about calculation and interpretation. They may also have to do with emotion. Circulation and displacement are also crucial here.... Passion, emotion, to be affected, all have to do with travel, with circulation. The language gives it away. To be moved, to be transported, the trip, these are metaphors for displacement. As, too, is addiction, a word that comes from the Latin ad-ducere, to lead away. (2004: 10)
   As I shall argue below, an emotional agent is a relational entity that instantiates particular aesthetic orientations and kinaesthetic dispositions towards driving. Movement and being moved together produce the feelings of being in the car, for the car and with the car.
   A better understanding of the cultural and emotional constituents of personal, familial, regional, national and transnational patterns of automobility can contribute to future research programmes and policy initiatives that resist the powerful yet ultimately unsatisfying aggregation of social data based on statistical quantification of individual preferences, attitudes and actions. Social psychological studies of driving behaviour have begun to emphasize the complex determinants of transportational choices, such as architecture' that attend their mobility, but also by 'the children themselves, easily "picked off' by the SUV's higher bumpers and poor visibility' (Jain, 2002: 399), not to mention their now-recognized tendency to roll over in accidents allegedly leading to one in four traffic deaths in the US (Bradsher, 2002). Even if Bradsher's claims have been challenged, SUVs are nevertheless more likely to be accessorized with the rigid metal 'bull bars' which also are frequently fatal to child pedestrians in accidents, even at relatively slow speeds.

AB  - Northern Italy is a geomorphologically heterogeneous region: high mountains, wide valleys, gentle hills and a large plain form a very varied landscape and influence the temperate climate of the area. The Alps region has harsh winters and moderately warm summers with abundant rainfall. The Po Plain has harsh winters with long periods of subfreezing temperatures and warm sultry summers, with rainfall more common in winter.
   Geomorphic instability processes are very common. Almost every year, landslides, mud flows and debris flows in the Alpine areas and flooding in the Po flood plain cause severe damage to structures and infrastructure and often claim human lives. Analyses of major events that have struck northern Italy over the last 35 years have provided numerous useful data for the recognition of various rainfall-triggering processes and their sequence of development in relation to the intensity and duration of rainfall. Findings acquired during and after these events emphasise that the quantity and typology of instability processes triggered by rainfall are related not only to an area's morphological and geological characteristics but also to intense rainfall distribution during meteorological disturbances. Moreover, critical rainfall thresholds can vary from place to place in relation to the climatic and geomorphological conditions of the area. Once the threshold has been exceeded, which is about 10% of the local mean annual rainfall (MAR), the instability processes on the slopes and along the hydrographic networks follow a sequence that can be reconstructed in three different phases.
   In the first phase, the initial instability processes that can usually be observed are soil slips on steep slopes, mud-debris flows in small basins of less than 20 km(2) in area, while discharge increases substantially in larger stream basins of up to 500 km(2). In continuous precipitation, in the second phase, first mud-debris flows can be triggered also in basins larger than 20 km(2) in area. Tributaries swell the main stream, which is already in a critical condition. The violent flow causes severe problems mainly along valley bottoms of rivers with basins up to 2000 km 2 in area. First bedrock landslides can occur, reaching a considerable area density, with volumes from a few hundred up to about one to two million cubic meters. In continuous precipitation, in the third phase, basins of more than 2000 km(2) in area reach their first critical stage. River-bed morphology is extensively modified, with erosional and depositional processes which can locally undermine the stability of structures and infrastructures. Waters overflow levees, flooding villages and towns to various widths and depths and sometimes claiming casualties. Some days after an intense rainfall period, large landslides involving the bedrock can still take place. These processes usually cause the movement of very large rock masses. The total duration of rainfall usually has a greater effect on these landslides than does the number of short periods of very intensive precipitation. This sequence cannot be divided into separate phases when the events occur simultaneously because of the presence of intense rainfall pulses and the generation of very diffuse surface runoff. Such situations usually happen during short-lasting heavy summer rainstorms or in late spring, when snow melt combines with intense rainfall. The three-phase sequence has been identified in three severe events that are analysed in this paper: Valtellina (Lombardy) in 1987, Tanaro Valley (Piedmont) in 1994 and Aosta Valley in 2000-1 but this sequence has also been observed during other events that occurred in northern Italy: in Piedmont in 1968, 1977, 1978, 1993 and 2000; in Lombardy in 1983 and 1992; in the Aosta Valley in 1993.

TI  - An additional barrier: What the separation wall means for Palestinian women.
T2  - DU-DIE ZEITSCHRIFT DER KULTUR
LA  - German
AB  - Hadeel Rizq-Qazzaz first heard about the wall in early 2002 from a friend who had travelled through the West Bank and been told of the new restrictions. Although outraged by the news, Qazzaz did not yet know what the wall would mean in practical terms. Since the second Intifada, many Palestinians have felt shut away in their homes by the various measures imposed by the Israeli occupation forces. Qazzaz decided to overcome the feeling of imprisonment and hear reactions in other towns and villages near Ramallah, viewing the wall up close and talking to other women about its effect on their lives.
   What she found in April 2006 were 335 km of wall already up and 145 km in progress. She found high cement barriers, trenches and barbed wire, sand strips, high-tension fences, surveillance sensors, a two-lane road for police patrols and fortified watchtowers at regular intervals. She notes that the wall does not follow the Green Line but intrudes deep into Palestinian territory, claiming large pieces for Israel.
   Despite Israel's insistence that the wall is temporary, many experts see it inflicting irrevocable damage on the Palestinian people. The wall not only separates communities, it prevents people getting to fields, to work, to school and hospitals. And yet there has been no collective Palestinian resistance. Qazzaz learned from local women that the wall had become the centre of their lives, another daily harassment, and that they protest against it as much as they can while trying to keep their families alive. A woman in Betunia related her encounter with an Israeli soldier who tried to stop her retrieving her goats from over the line: she shoved him aside, saying her goats had always grazed there. The next soldier, she knows, could shoot her, along with children off to play. Other women told Qazzaz of youths who had tried to protect their fathers from rubber bullets and tear gas, of men shot or arrested by night for taking part in demonstrations.
   Women are much harder hit by the wall than others, Qazzaz found: they are restricted in their movements by social norms which forbid them to travel alone at night, making them dependent on a lift if they cannot afford transportation. Another woman tells her about the difficulties getting passes for their fields. These passes are more and more often refused, and some 50 percent of those needing them (farmers and their families) did not receive a pass in the first half of 2005, while only 9 percent of landowners were turned down. Women, who traditionally work the olives and figs, have not been receiving passes since they are not viewed as landowners by the Israelis, the land being registered in their husbands' names.
   Openings in the wall allow Palestinians access to their land but are placed at some distance from the fields. The gates are opened three times a day, usually for 20 minutes to an hour, and after incidents may remain closed for days. In Beit Sira the situation is worse: the last village before the Green Line, it is closed in on three sides by the wall and has become a sort of refugee camp. The inhabitants are cut off from water as well as from work in Israel. Women have an especially hard time when they are searched at the wall, and many families prefer them not to do any farm work rather than see them held up by soldiers.
   Women suffer from the wall, Qazzaz concludes, for its effect on medical and educational facilities, freedom of movement, agriculture and economics. The wall is particularly dangerous, she finds, because it creates new, irrevocable facts.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present a review of the studies on mental health services conducted over the past twenty-five years by the Head Offices of Epidemiological and Psychosocial Research of the Ramon de la Fuente National Institute of Psychiatry (INP) and to propose further lines of research to be developed in this field.
   Health services and addictions
   The study of the types of care needed and the characteristics of the use of services among the population that abuses substances has been an area of interest at INP. The Institute has information drawn from surveys, the Drug Information Registration System and studies focussing on specialized services. It also has results obtained from specific populations such as women and teenagers and groups that are difficult to reach, such as street children and cocaine users.
   Since 1974, INP has conducted a series of household surveys that has shed light on trends in the use of services by the population with drug-related problems. Several studies have shown that drug- and alcohol-users rely mainly on relatives, friends and ministers of the Church. The use of home remedies and self-medication are also common. Conversely, users rarely seek specialized services. In the 1988 survey, a mere 5% of this population sought the latter, a figure that had risen only slightly to 6.1% by 1998 (59, 57, 30).
   The main aim of the Drug Information Registration System (SRID), in operation since 1987, is to evaluate trends in the use of psychoactive substances, identify the changes that have occurred and estimate the trajectory of use. Approximately 60% of the cases reported came from health institutions and 40% from penal institutions. The main reason why the former had been admitted to health centers was to receive treatment, whereas the latter had been sent to penal institutions as a result of crimes involving robbery or damage to health (39,40,41).
   The information provided by SRID has served as the basis for conducting studies that analyze in greater depth the characteristics of services designed to deal with problems of drug dependence. One example of this is the project carried out to stud), the patterns of cocaine use, associated problems and perceptions and attitudes towards treatment services (37).
   Other research projects have been designed to assess or analyze the way specialized services operate in the treatment of addictions. Two examples of this are the Center of Assistance for Alcoholics and their Relatives (CAAF) (61, 62, 35) and the Alcoholics Anonymous movement (AA) (49, 44, 50, 51).
   For over a decade, Gutierrez and Vega have studied children that live on the streets and consume substances and they have found that the resources available for dealing with this population are extremely limited. The lack of success of the interventions implemented can be attributed to unrealistic goals, a fragmented perception of the problem and therefore of its solution and failure to consider the perceptions and needs of the children whom these programs are intended to benefit (16, 28, 63).
   Since the early 1990s, the study of drug use among women has attracted the attention of a group of INP researchers. The results of various studies have repeatedly shown that there are hardly any programs specifically designed to deal with the needs of female addicts (45, 46, 47, 27, 31, 32). The few types of treatment offered at specialized centers only cover part of women's needs. For example, patients undergo detoxification or receive pharmacological treatment, while others problems are ignored (27).
   Natera, Mora and Tiburcio (34) analyzed the obstacles that prevent relatives from seeking help to deal with the physical and psychological effects of having to cope with a family member's drug use. On the basis of the information obtained from 100 interviews, the authors observed that only 50% of the interviewees had sought some kind of assistance while only 20% had found it useful. The reasons for failing to seek assistance were related as much to cultural values and norms as to the lack of financial resources, fear, shame and lack of information.
   Mental health care services
   The information presented below is drawn from household surveys and studies on populations attended at the primary health care level and in mental health service facilities. It also analyzes research conducted on special groups such as children, teenagers, women and the rural population and studies focussing on issues such as curative trajectories and the use of alternative services. As part of the 1988 National Survey on Addictions, a mental health survey was carried out on a fifth of the urban population selected (n=2,025). The results of this study show that friends and relatives constituted the first source of help (54%), followed by self-medication (15%) and priests or ministers (10%). Only 5%,, resorted to general medical services,while a similar percentage used centers specializing in mental health, The main reasons for not requesting assistance were lack of knowledge about the services, prejudice towards the latter and lack of time and financial resources (27). Similar results were reported in subsequent surveys (7,9,10,29).
   INP has a long tradition of studying the needs and demands for care at the primary health care level. The earliest projects focussed on the adaptation, modification and standardization of instruments used for detection and diagnosis (2,11). These instruments subsequently permitted the detection of psychiatric disorders among the population that made appointments to see their local GP. The most common disorders were depression and anxiety (26, 42, 22, 3). Subsequent studies have shown that although the population initially seeks help from a GP (27, 29, 14, 8), a high percentage of cases are nor detected, far less referred in time, which in turn increases the cost of care (23, 42, 43).
   Since 1978, studies have been undertaken to determine the characteristics of specialized mental health services. The earliest studies showed that the main reasons for a patient's admission were relapses caused by discontinuing treatment, the inability to survive on their own and aggressiveness (12, 52). In 1992, a national survey was carried out on 4,539 hospitalized psychiatric patients (6). In general, almost half the cases could be treated as outpatients.
   The use of health services by the child and adolescent population has been studied by Zimmerman and collaborators (64) and by Caravco and collaborators (10). The first two studies showed that there is a low perception of mental health care among children and youth and that even less formal assistance is provided.
   The use of services by the female population has also been widely studied. Results have shown that women tend to seek professional help because of emotional disorders whereas men do so because of problems related to alcoholism and drug dependence (43). Data yielded by various studies show that friends, relatives, priests or ministers and home remedies are the main resources used by women (27, 59, 29, 53). Very few women seek specialized mental health care services. The main reasons why women do not seek them are that they do not feel anyone can help them, they are ashamed to talk about their problems and they do not know where to go.
   Snyder and collaborators have found that although the presence of emotional malaise such as depression or "nerves" is common among the female rural population, there is a lack of specialized services in rural settings. Consequently, women resort to other sources of support such as friends or relatives, priests, local healers and self-medication (53, 54, 55).
   Data yielded by various surveys have served as the basis for carrying out studies to analyze the characteristics of alternative services in greater depth. The main studies have been carried out with groups of Neurotics Anonymous (25), spiritualist churches such as the Marian Trinitarians (24) and traditional doctors (1).
   The paths followed by psychiatric patients in search of care have also been evaluated. One of the most striking results is that in comparison with other countries, Mexico shows the greatest lag between the emergence of symptoms and the first attempt to seek help. As for the characteristics of the trajectories followed, people resort mainly, to their GPs, traditional doctors, healers or ministers and priests (15,5).
   Discussion
   The information reviewed in this article highlights the need for further research on treatment, prevention and health promotion programs. Studies should include an analysis of various related factors such as the beliefs, attitudes and behavior of patients and providers, the type of disorder involved, the complexity of the therapeutic regime, the system of service provision and certain determinants of health and mental illness.

TI  - The return of epidemics: Health and society in Peru during the twentieth century
T2  - SOCIAL HISTORY OF MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - A Spanish edition of this masterly and thought-provoking book was deservedly awarded the Premio Iberoamericano by the Latin American Studies Association in 1998. The publisher is to be congratulated for making this excellent translation available to the English-speaking world. Although ostensibly about epidemics, it has much to say about the development of public healthcare systems in developing nations in general and the way in which they are moulded by economic, political, and ideological forces.
   The book comprises five main chapters, each of which focuses on an epidemic. The five epidemics considered are: the outbreak of bubonic plague in 1903; the yellow fever epidemic in 1919-22; typhus and smallpox outbreaks in the Andes in the 1930s; malaria epidemics and eradication in the 1930s and 1940s; and the cholera epidemic in 1991. For each of the epidemics, the author looks briefly at its biological and ecological causes, but the greater part of the analysis examines its impact and the health measures taken to control it, whether by the state, individual practitioners, or the popular sectors, who were often the worst affected. The analysis is based on extensive use of Peruvian national and local archives, the Rockefeller Foundation Archives in New York, and also inter-views.
   Although each epidemic is discussed in a separate chapter, since they are arranged chronologically, a clear picture emerges both of the evolution of public health care in the twentieth century and of the broad changes occurring in the Peruvian economy and society. Hence it reveals the significance of the role of indigenismo, a regional and ethnic movement in the 1930s, in promoting community health care, and of modernization in fostering technocratic solutions to health problems. However, in drawing out broad themes, Cueto does not overlook the role of individuals. In particular, he examines the roles of Manuel Nimez Butron in organizing sanitary brigades, known as rijcharys, which aimed to stimulate local communities to look after their own health, incorporating rather than rejecting traditional healers; and of the govemment-hired North American, Dr Henry Hanson, whose technical solution for the control of yellow fever and plague resulted in the demolition of a significant part of the town of Paita.
   Responses to these epidemic episodes varied. In common with historic epidemics Cueto stresses how there was still a propensity to blame the victim. Very often the victims were the poor who lived in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions that favoured the spread of disease. The poor often belonged to a distinct ethnic group. Hence the Chinese were blamed for the spread of bubonic plague in 1903, a prejudice that resurfaced with the cholera epidemic of 1991 when a Chinese freighter that discharged effluent off the coast was held responsible. In the early twentieth century, epidemics often heightened ethnic differences between the coast, highlands, and forested lowlands, since they were often confined to specific geographical regions. The study also shows how responses to outbreaks frequently exacerbated conditions for the poor, who were often the victims of technical solutions or increased social control, or, as in the case of the cholera outbreak of 1991, were neglected by the state on the grounds that the solution lay in changes to personal hygiene. Overall, specific responses at different times are shown to reflect economic and political priorities, not only in Peru but also in the USA.
   Although responses to epidemic crises might vary, the study shows how, during the twentieth century, public health in Peru came to depend less on charitable institutions and came increasingly to be recognized as a function of the state. Although advances in health care were made during this period, it reveals the continuing strong relationship between poverty and disease and argues that further advances will only be made through attention to preventive and essential primary health care, based on a productive dialogue between modem and traditional medicine. It is one more reminder that epidemics are not yet a thing of the past.
   It is impossible in this review to summarize all the themes running through this book, despite its short length. It is exceptionally rich in detail and wide-ranging in its analysis and conclusions. It not only makes a significant contribution to our knowledge of epidemics and public health, but also encapsulates the history of Peru in the twentieth century, revealing the economic, political, and ethnic cleavages that have such fundamental implications for the health of ordinary people. By demonstrating that the history of medicine can only be understood in its social context, it is a most worthy and valuable addition to the series.

AB  - Background. Treatment of otitis media in children is associated with substantial expenditures because of its high frequency during childhood. Vaccines against respiratory pathogens causing otitis media are now being developed. Information about otitis media-related medical expenditures will be needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of these preventive interventions.
   Methods. This study used utilization data from claims to impute otitis media-related expenditures for medical visits, pharmaceuticals, and surgical procedures for 87 057 children 13 years of age and younger who were continuously enrolled in Colorado's fee-for-service Medicaid program during 1992. International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes were used to identify visits for otitis media. An antibiotic was considered to have been prescribed to treat otitis media if it was dispensed up to 24 hours before or within 48 hours after a physician encounter showing a diagnosis of otitis media. All tympanostomies, mastoidectomies, and adenoidectomies were assumed to be related to otitis media. Expenditures were imputed from utilization using a Medicaid fee schedule.
   National expenditures for 1992 to treat otitis media were extrapolated from Colorado's Medicaid data. We adjusted for differences between Colorado and the United States as a whole in terms of price, number, and intensity of services; for differences in reimbursement rates by service between Medicaid and private insurance; and for differences in utilization between Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured. To provide a more current expression of medical expenditures for otitis media, we inflated the 1992 expenditure estimates to 1998 dollars using the Consumer Price Index published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Results. Twenty-eight percent of children experienced at least 1 episode of diagnosed otitis media. The proportion of children with a diagnosis of otitis media was highest (42%-60%) in the 7-month to 36-month age range. The proportion was also higher among white (34.5%) and Hispanic (25.3%) children than among black children (18.5%), as well as among rural (34.5%) compared with urban children (27.2%).
   Children 19 to 24 months of age incurred the highest total annual expenditures per child with otitis media ($239.68). Expenditures for drugs, visits, and procedures were all highest for this group. The per-patient cost to Medicaid was greater for visits than for drugs or procedures across all age groups.
   Total per-patient expenditures were higher for males ($174.67) than for females ($154.47) and higher for white children ($176.59) than for Hispanic ($154.12) or black children ($134.44). The differences among the ethnic groups can be attributed almost entirely to differences in expenditures for procedures and drugs. Although mean expenditures per patient varied substantially by some patient characteristics (eg, race), these differences accounted for only a small fraction of the enormous variation in costs per patient.
   Including children with and without otitis media, age-specific estimated expenditures per child peaked among children 1 ($132.94) and 2 years of age ($88.72). Children 3 to 6 years of age incurred expenditures only one third as great as those incurred by children 1 year of age.
   Total national expenditures were estimated to have been approximately $4.1 billion in 1992 dollars and $5.3 billion in 1998 dollars. Over 40% of national expenditures to treat otitis media in children younger than 14 years of age were incurred for children between 1 and 3 years of age ($453 per capita in 1992 dollars over these 2 years vs $1027 for all years of age from 2 to 13). Nationally, expenditures for visits remained the largest component of expenditures.
   Limitations. This study assessed expenditures from the point of view of the health care system; that is, no social costs, such as lost work time, or expenditures not normally covered by insurance, such as those for transportation, were included. The study captured expenditures to treat otitis media during a calendar year and should not be interpreted as the cost to treat episodes of otitis media. Our reported expenditures may have captured only part of an episode straddling 2 calendar years, or, alternatively, they may cover several episodes.
   The figures reporting 1992 expenditures expressed in 1998 dollars should not be taken as an estimate of 1998 expenditures to treat otitis media. The approach used to adjust the expenditures did not take into account changes in the medical practice environment, such as would occur with a movement of the population from predominantly fee-for-service practice to managed care or the introduction of new treatment practices. It also did not account for changes in insurance status, eg, an increase in the proportion of uninsured children, or for population increases.
   Most importantly, our estimates of expenditures are based on treatment of otitis media as it was practiced in 1992, before the current practice guidelines were promulgated. The effect of the guidelines on physician practice in 1992 may, however, not have been substantial. In 1998, Christakis and Rivara found that only 50% of pediatricians were aware of the otitis media guidelines, and of these, only 28% believed that they had changed their practice as a result of the guidelines. It is important to remember that our estimates are based on 1992 Medicaid utilization. Given Medicaid's low reimbursement to primary care physicians at that time, doctors would have had little financial incentive to see patients more often than necessary. Thus, insofar as practice guidelines encouraged fewer visits, Medicaid utilization may already reflect close adherence to the practice guidelines.
   Conclusions. Because 40% of expenditures to treat otitis media are incurred between 1 and 3 years of age, vaccines designed to reduce the incidence of otitis media are most likely to be cost-effective if they can be administered before the child's first birthday.
   Because visits are the most costly category of service for all payers, otitis media case management guidelines should emphasize reducing unnecessary visits, for instance, by improving physician training in pneumatic otoscopy, which has been shown to be critical to an accurate diagnosis of otitis media, and by scheduling follow-up visits for children who have become asymptomatic 3 to 4 weeks after diagnosis rather than after 10 to 14 days, allowing time for resolution of the middle ear effusion.

AB  - This research work deals with an experimental study on the erosion phenomenon of a mud under the action of a water current. It is observed from research works carried out by Partheniades (J Hydraul Div ASCE 91(HY1): 105-139, 1965), Migniot (La Houille Blanche 1&2: 11-29, 95-111, 1989), Ockenden and Delo (GeoMar Lett 11: 138-142, 1991), Aberle et al. (Mar Geol 207: 83-93,2004), among others, that mud erosion process by an hydrodynamic action depends mainly on sediment properties. Based on a literature study, this critical stress is assumed to be proportional either to the effective cohesion (Eq. 2) or to the yield stress (Eq. 4) of the sediment bed. Six erosion test series have been performed at six different concentrations of a mud from the Loire estuary. Some properties of the tested sediments are: a solid particles density rho(s)= 2,550 kg m(-3), a liquidity and plasticity limit at 140 and 70% of the water content, respectively, a mean size of the dispersed mineral fraction determined by laser techniques of 10 mu m, and a volatile matters content of 11.86% by total dry weight burned at 550 degrees C. As the rheological behaviour is difficult to describe, the sediment strength is characterized by only a parameter, namely, the yield stress tau(y). It is measured with a coaxial cylinder Brookfield LVT viscosimeter following a defined procedure (Hosseini in Liaison entre la rigidite initiale et la cohesion non drainee dans les vases molles-Relation avec la dynamique sedimentaire. These, Universite de Nantes, 167 p, 1999). For each studied concentration, three successive erosion tests are carried out, and for every erosion test, 15 successive measurements of tau(y) are made. The mean values and the standard deviations of tau(y) are shown in Table 1 as a function of the bed sediment concentration C. A confined flume has been conceived and built to characterize the erosion rates. With this device, a current-induced shear stress is generated above an homogeneous deposited sediment (Fig. 1). The bed shear stress so is calculated from the measured mean velocity V by Eq. 5. The friction coefficient c(f) involved in Eq. 5 has been evaluated from measurements of the hydraulic pressure loss. Finally, the validity of Eq. 5 has been confirmed by five calibration tests on the incipient of the movement of sands for which results are compared with Shields diagram in Fig. 2. The observed erosion mechanisms affecting cohesive sediments depend mainly on the value of the yield stress. For a fluid mud (tau(y) less than 3 N m(-2)), the bed shear stress produces at first a wavy motion on the bed surface with a progressive undulation. When the shear stress increases, resuspension produces a diluted sediment cloud which is entrained and dispersed by the flow. For a plastic mud (tau(y) greater than 3 N m-2), erosion occurs by a wrenching of aggregates which are transported near the bottom. Initially, the eroded aggregates measure several millimetres in size; but, once transported, aggregates break into very rigid and compact aggregates of maximum size close to 1 mm in all the cases. During erosion tests, erosion volumetric rates E(v) have been evaluated under steady-state bed shear stress so from the observed variation in time of suspended sediment concentration. A generalized erosion is assumed for E(v) >= E(vo)= 3 x 10(-7) m s(-1) (that is the equivalent of 1 mm sediment layer eroded per hour).
   The generalized erosion occursabove a critical bed shear stress tau(oe) which is linked to tau(y) and mud density through Eq. 7. A phenomenological law defined by Eq. 8 is proposed to calculate the erosion rate as a function of yield stress and hydrodynamic shear stress at the bottom. For tau(o) < tau(oe), a small erosion is observed, which is described by a formulation given by Cerco et al. (Water quality model of Florida Bay. U. S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC/EL TR-00-10, Vicksburg, USA, 260 p, 2000). Above tau(oe), a small increase in so produces an important erosion rate rise which is described by a formulation suggested by Mehta and Partheniades (Resuspension of deposited cohesive sediment beds. In: Proceedings of the 18th coastal engineering conference, Cape Town, South Africa, 2: 1569-1588, 1982). Figure 3 shows as a function of so the observed values of Ev (discrete symbols) as well as the proposed model (in solid lines) for the six concentrations. For the theoretically maximum value of Ev, the hydrodynamic shear stress is very high with regard to the sediment cohesion; and then, the water flux produces an entrainment of underlying fluid mud layers. The asymptotic law obtained from the model of Kranenburg and Winterwerp (1997) plotted in dashed lines in Fig. 3, is expressed by E(v)= 0.3 u*. A sediment trap inserted in the experimental system allows a sample of eroded mud aggregates to be obtained. It is observed that the maximum value of the diameter D(M) of the eroded aggregates depends on the density and yield stress of the initially deposited mud according to Eq. 10. In the same way, the density of the aggregates issued from plastic mud erosion is measured following an original experimental method and procedure (Table 3). The erosion of plasticmuds with a concentration from 310 to 420 kg m(-3) produces aggregates with a concentration close to 400 kg m(-3) and yield stress a little greater than 100 N m(-2).

TI  - Partnership and union participation in management: The case of Tembec
T2  - RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES-INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
LA  - French
AB  - It is only under certain conditions and circumstances that partnership is likely to be accompanied by democracy and a strengthened unionism. Failure to meet these conditions results in participation without power that leads to a weakened local union. This is the main conclusion derived from the study of the longest-standing experience of partnership in Quebec.
   Located in the small town of Temiscaming, Tembec was created in 1973 as a result of the financial participation of workers and managers who bought the plant that was closed down one year earlier by its former owner, Canadian International Paper (CIP). From the outset, the plant was characterized by participative management, the main features of which are still maintained today: worker representation on the board of directors, existence of a large number of joint committees whose composition and mandate are stipulated in the collective agreement, management commitment to the employment security of workers (whose number has risen from 400 when the plant was re-opened to more than 700 today) and, lastly, great flexibility within the organization. However, the union's evolution over the years has been rather worrying. The union has few internal resources (only the union president is freed up on a full-time basis), is isolated from the rest of the labour movement, and is less and less involved in issues related to working conditions and work organization in the plant. It is therefore moving away from its rank and file members and drawing closer to management, which has become its main source of legitimacy. These conclusions are based on the results of a field survey conducted between 1993 and 2000. The results come from several sources: in-depth inter-views with the principal management representatives, union representatives and ten workers; a one-week observation period in the plant; and a review of the relevant documents.
   The article is divided into six parts. Part I stresses the limitations of strategic choice theory in industrial relations. By lending too much importance to management strategies, this theory only takes unions into consideration insofar as they represent one of the favourable conditions of or obstacles to the completion of management's modernization projects. Too concerned with the adjustment to environmental constraints and achievement of economic performance that is mutually beneficial for employees and employers, it ignores a major issue, namely democracy at work. Highly functionalist and normative as well as overly focused on the description of "best practices," it ignores the tensions and conflicts at the centre of workplaces that explain the dynamics of change. These latter aspects, which are deliberately ignored by strategic choice theory, form the central subject of this article.
   Part 2 presents the Tembec case and highlights the principal aspects that make Tembec exceptional in terms of its management style: copartnership, union representation on the board of directors, profit sharing with employees, non-payment of dividends to shareholders, great importance given to employment protection, and joint management. Both the survey methodology and the analytical framework are set out.
   Part 3 reviews the conditions in which partnership emerged and describes its original form. The compromise on employment in order to reopen the plant proved to be essential for understanding the experience. Partnership opened up a space for participation that the local union was unable to fully occupy, thus leading to a weakened unionism. This is analyzed in Part 4. Without sufficient external and internal resources and characterized by a weak democracy, the union was unable to develop a distinctive agenda and therefore adopted a passive position of support towards management.
   Part 5 describes participation at the end of a 25-year evolution. Whether it is representative or direct, whether it takes place within the board of directors, various joint committees or work groups, participation is characterized by a lack of power for workers and the union. Instead, its goal is to ensure better information communication and increased co-operation. Rather than influencing management decisions, it contributes to modifying union strategies and positions as well as bringing them into line with those of management, thus increasingly weakening the local union, This situation provokes many tensions within the union and dissatisfaction among the workers.
   These tensions and dissatisfaction, which are analyzed in Part 6, are caused by the way complaints are handled, which is marred by a strong suspicion of bias. They also concern the introduction of flexible remuneration to protect employment, in particular a wage disparity clause that has a detrimental effect on new workers, in a context where the gap between the composition of the union executive and that of the workforce is growing. Dominated by the older workers who lived through the syndrome of plant closure, the union executive is no longer representative of a younger workforce, most of whom did not experience this trauma. The union's legitimacy is challenged at the end of a particularly co-opting process, which means that the majority of union leaders are pursuing their career in management. Despite everything that has made it fragile, the Tembec model nevertheless maintains a certain degree of stability due to the existence of a counterbalance: the plant-closure syndrome, employment security, wage catch-up with other plants, certain management practices that foster a strong sense of belonging, the importance of opportunities for promotion, a charismatic management, and the omnipresence of relatives in the plant and the village.
   This case study aptly demonstrates the main limitations of strategic choice theory. At first glance, on the basis of a few interviews with one or two union and management representatives, this case may appear to have all the characteristics of an ideal model of partnership. However, the results of this study show that partnership can be reconciled with participation without democracy, a weakened unionism, and a continued hierarchical work organization. They also demonstrate that co-operation and trust do not by themselves bring about democracy at work. On the contrary, cooperation and trust can Very well be reconciled with a benevolent paternalism combined with a unionism that is more or less dominated by management.

AB  - Privately owned forests in Croatia cover an area (1)581,770 ha, which is 22% of the total area of forests and forestland in the Republic of Croatia. The total growing stock in private forests in Croatia amounts to 78 301 000 m(3), or 20% of the overall growing stock of the entire forest management area. The average growing stock is 163 m3/ha and the increment is 4.4 m(3)/ha or 2.7%.
   Privately owned forests in the area managed by Delnice Forest Administration extend over 22,380 ha. These forests are presently classified into uneven-aged forests. which is not conducive to their future management. Bearing in mind their condition regarding the silvicultural form, biological properties and ecological requirements of the tree species participating in their formation. the management of these forests should follow the methods applied to,forests of high silvicultural firm or seed forests, which are regular and selection forests, and to coppices. Forests of high silvicultural fin-in are regular or even-aged seed forests covering an area of 13,264 ha, while selection seed fin rests cover an area of 6,085 ha. Regular coppice forests are found over an area of 3,031 ha.
   Placing these different forest forms into a uniform uneven-aged class prevents, among other things, the application of those necessary silvicultural operations which are aimed at attaining better stability, productivity and sustainability; or sustainable development.
   Based on the above structural indicators, especially the growing stock and increment of these forests, we may conclude that the current condition of private forests in this area is equally bad and worrying as that of other private forests in Croatia.
   Such a situation may be attributed to a number of factory, such us,. for. example, the inexpert application of silvicultural treatments, the disintegration of rural environments,. property fragmentation, the owners' social status, the insecurity of private ownership, the length of. the production cycle, insufficient control and sanctioning, and finally, the disobeyance (illegal regulations.
   Some objective reasons Jar which these forests are difficult to manage are;
   - Fragmentation of property (the average size of a plot is preceded by two zeros). Unsolved ownership-legal relationships, as well as an unstimulating, slow and expensive system of solving ownership problems,
   - Disproportion between the cadastre of cultures and the real condition in the field, and the disproportion between the cadastre and the land registry,
   - Management at the level of cadastre units prevents the application of more complex management with forest resources,
   - Prejudices of forest owners towards pooling resources (Cooperatives) due to negative experiences from the recent past,
   - Movement of the younger more vital part of the population from rural into urban areas.
   Forest owners and forest owners associations should direct their activities concerned with increasing forest quality toward the following fields, treatments and activities:
   - Tending and regeneration treatments in selection forests with selection cuts. Tending and regeneration treatments in regular high forests and coppices.
   - Tending and restocking those areas subject to natural succession of pioneer species with valuable broadleaved and coniferous species.
   - Establishing cultures of valuable, fast-growing and marketable broadleaved and coniferous species over abandoned grasslands and other areas.
   - Organizing timber harvesting and marketing, as well as utilization of timber for bioenergy after the forests have been tended, established and regenerated.
   Selection management is the most suitable method for fir forests or for those forests in which the fir is the dominant species such as, fin. example, Mixed forests of fir and beech, fir beech and spruce, and fir and spruce.
   The management goals in a selection forest are accomplished by selecting and marking the trees to be cut. These management goals are: raise mixed selection stands which will ensure good quality increment, stand stability and plentiful natural new growth; use the productive site capacity to the maximum; and achieve the highest production values.
   Felling operations in a selection forest achieve multiple goals of tending and regeneration, forming the selection structure, utilizing forests and maintaining their hygiene. There are two groups of silvicultural procedures; tending of the young generation - young growth and young, forest, and selection, which includes thinning and harvesting mature trees. All the procedures in a selection forest are temporally and spatially concentrated, thus creating an indelible whole. any of the above activities is omitted, the structure of the selection forest will be disrupted and its inclement, regeneration and stability will be affected.
   Tree marking in a selection forest should always take account oldie goals for which this activity is undertaken. These goals are permanent regeneration, stand tending, continuous maintenance of the selection structure, stand utilization and maintenance of the sanitary-hygienic function.
   In a normal selection forest with normal growing stock, a 10-year annual increment is cut. Under normal circumstances, this is 25% the total growing stock in the stand. lithe growing stock is higher than normal, cutting intensity should not exceed 30%. lilt is lower cutting intensity may be reduced to 15%. This is borderline intensity which should not be exceeded. This means that cutting should be postponed until another cutting cycle is over in this case another 10 years. Higher or lower intensities could endanger the selection structure, i.e. the increment, regeneration and stability of the selection stand. Inappropriately applied intensities cannot maintain a selection stand in the optimal structural conditions which will ensure maximal production and optimal regeneration. Regrettably, this is one of the most serious current problems in selection management and selection forests.
   Beech and spruce stands which have officially been classified as uneven-aged stands and which have not been managed selectively but with selection cuts show a negative developmental trend. This kind of management results in decreased growing stock, absence of natural regeneration, reduced tree quality and lower increment.
   In such stands management based on regular principles should be organized over small areas (each structural unit special silvicultural treatment). Silvicultural treatments are spatially divided over small areas. In other words, each structural unit represents a special part of the stand which requires a special silvicultural treatment. They are spatially separated but temporally concentrated.
   Management with shelterwood cuts in small areas with a longer regeneration period achieves biological diversity of beech and spruce forests. This type of regeneration enables, over a longer time period, a good yield of seeds of the principal,and other tree species and the survival of their young generation.
   Regeneration in regular forests is generally done in 3 cuts (preparatory, seed and fined) and less,frequently in 4 or 5 cuts, where subsequent cuts are introduced. The preparatory cut is Undertaken with 20% intensity and the seed cut with 50% intensity in a good seed year The remaining, wood is cut as needed. either with one or two subsequent cuts or more frequently, with one final cut.
   Regular forests are tended throughout the life cycle of the stand, that until the shelterwood cuts are applied. Tending consists of the following stages: tending of the young growth after the final cut, cleaning in the developmental stage of the young growth and saplings, and tending with thinning.
   Tending of the young growth after the final cut is usually done once only, while cleaning or negative selection is done once or twice until the moment the stand reaches its maximal height increment. At this stage future trees are identified, which in beech and spruce forests takes place around the age of 30. At this age stands may be tended with thinning.
   Coppices of beech, pubescent oak and other hard broadleaves are regenerated with shelterwood cuts. The goal is to convert a coppice into the forest of high silvicultural form or seed finest.
   Regenerating a coppice with clearcutting and planting conifer species is a serious mistake. Conifers may be planted in degraded fives, soils which have lost the properties that provide the parent climatogenic stand with optimal conditions for growth and development.
   Coppices should be tended throughout the rotation period,
   The tending stages in a coppice include reducing the number of poor quality and superfluous shoots on the stump, tending coppices with cleaning or negative selection, and tending coppices with thinning or positive selection,
   In the c:current economic and social conditions in Croatia arable areas are systematically being reduced and the size of. abandoned agricultural laird is increasing. These areas are subjected to the spontaneous expansion of less valuable tree species and shrubs, classified as pioneer species. Being the first to occur they are spontaneously followed by transitional species. The 100-year-long process ends with the occurrence of principal Or climatogenic species (fir beech, oaks).
   Pioneer and transitional tree species gradually convert degraded forest soil into forest soil suitable for climatogenic or principal species. The basic tree species that bear the characteristics of pioneer species an? those,from the genera of alders, willows, poplars, birches and others. Domestic, autochthonous tree species from other genera, with the exception of the genera of oaks, beech and fir belong to transitional tree species. Together with pioneer species. they,gradually colonize abandoned agricultural and other lands.
   Forest cultures should be established on abandoned agricultural areas in order to increase their market and non-market values. These cultures are established by planting broadleaved species from the genera of wild cherry. peal; apple, as well as maple, ash, lime, whitebeam, rowan, service tree, wild service tree, bird cherry, walnut, and others. Coniferous species to be planted include species from the genera of spruces, larches and pines.
   The choice of the tree species depends on the site conditions that prevail in the treated area, where the soil and the climate have a decisive role.
   The pioneer transitional or secondary tree species have an important role in the structure of all Croatian natural forests'. They are particularly suitable for the establishment of cultures which supply good quality and valuable timber Timber of all these species is applied in mechanical and chemical processing industries, and in energy production. The establishment of energy forests with short rotations and small planting distances will gain increasing importance in Croatian forestry.
   Due to the present energy crisis, the share of timber in the energy balance of the most developed European countries is constantly glowing. Timber from forests has been accepted everywhere in Europe as an important and renewable source of bioenergy.
   Although the Croatian forestry is making initial, modest steps in this field, there is no reason that forest owners in Gorski Kotar should not be included in this European trend. They have at their disposal about 3,000,000 m(3) wing stock, the annual increment of 80,000 m(3), and,the prescribed annual yield of about 40,000 m(3), of which 40% or 16,000 m(3) is wood of thinner dimensions suitable fin. energy. At present, the major portion of this wood remains in Me forest and perishes. This alone provides sufficient motive fin. the owners to pool forces,, fight fir,. their place on the market and join the chain of bioenergy producers fin. both the domestic and foreign markets.

AB  - The first issue of Hand Clinics published 20 years ago was devoted to flexor tendon injuries. This was most appropriate, because no subject in hand surgery has sparked more interest or discussion. That inaugural issue included excellent presentations on the basic science of tendon injuries (anatomy, biomechanics, nutrition, healing, adhesions) and the clinical practice of tendon repair. Of interest, there was no presentation on the fascinating history of flexor tendon surgery. It is most appropriate, therefore, that this current update of the flexor tendon begins with a historical review of the evolution of flexor tendon repair.
   The treatment of injured tendons dates to antiquity. Hippocrates and other ancient physicians did not recognize the tendon as a distinct structure. They observed a white slender cord entering the fleshy substance of skeletal muscle that they knew to be nerve. The muscle was seen to terminate in a similar whitish cord-like structure that they did not distinguish from the nerve entering the muscle; they used the term "neuron" to identify this terminating structure, not recognizing it as a tendon. Several investigators [1-3] mistakenly assigned this erroneous anatomic observation to Galen and used it to explain Galen's written admonition to physicians not to suture tendons. Although Galen had written that pricking the tendon would lead to twitching and convulsions, the recent writings of Siegel [4] make clear that Galen understood the anatomic differences between nerve and tendon and the different functions of muscle and tendon. Muscle actively contracts, whereas the tendon moves passively; the tendon's attachment to the bone results in movement of the distal part.
   Galen's error in advising not to suture tendons was more subtle [4]. In his anatomic dissections of skeletal muscles, he observed that nerve and ligament fibers became progressively smaller and finer on entering the muscle tissue. He concluded that in the course of fetal development, these fine ligament and nerve fibers were woven together within the muscle and fused to form the terminating tendon. The tendon thus was sensitive to pricking because it was composed in part of nerve fibers, and therefore the advice not to prick tendons with sutures. Not withstanding this admonition, there is evidence from Galen's other writings that suggest that he did, in fact, repair injured tendons in his role as physician to the gladiators. According to Kuhn's translation, Galen wrote, "I found one of the gladiators called horseman with a transverse division of the tendon on the anterior surface of the thigh, the lower part being separated from the upper, and without hesitation I brought them together with suture."
   Galen was a prolific writer and had a profound impact on shaping medical concepts and practices for more than 1500 years. His extensive medical treatises were translated first into Arabic and subsequently into Latin. Undoubtedly they influenced Avicenna, the great Muslim physician-philosopher of the eleventh century who succeeded Hippocrates and Galen as an important medical writer. Although Avicenna is described [1-3,5-7] as the first surgeon to advocate suturing of tendons, he undoubtedly was aware of Galen's scientific dissections and his clinical practices as physician to the gladiators. As reported in Gratz's interesting treatise [5], Avicenna's tendon repair concepts were adopted subsequently by several European surgeons in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. Despite these reports of successful tenorrhaphy, however, Galen's precepts based on his anatomic dissections predominated and tendon repair was not practiced universally. Gratz [5] reported that Meekren performed the first experimental study in 1682 that directly challenged Galen's concept; he crushed tendon fibers (presumably the Achilles tendon of the dog) and did not observe pain, twitching, or convulsions in the animal. It was not until Von Haller performed similar experimental studies in 1752, however, investigating the irritability and sensibility of various body tissues, including tendon, that the coup de grace was finally rendered to the dictum against tendon suture.
   In 1767, John Hunter performed the first experimental study investigating the tendon healing process [7]. He noted that the canine Achilles tendon healed by formation of callus, similar to that seen in healing bone. As reported by Mason and Shearon [7], Hunter's study was followed by numerous others that attempted to define the morphologic changes associated with tendon repair, the contribution to tendon healing by extrinsic fibroblasts and the intrinsic components of the tendon, and the effect of tension and motion at the repair site. These questions are remarkably similar to experimental questions and studies of recent times.
   For the most part, these early studies were performed primarily on the Achilles and other paratenon covered tendons and did not specifically consider flexor tendons, which are in a distinctly different anatomic environment within the synovial lined flexor digital sheath. The specific investigation of flexor tendon healing within the digital sheath began early in the twentieth century. Around 1920, Bier [8] and Saloman [9,10] noted poor tendon healing following suture of canine flexor tendons. Saloman attributed this poor response to an inhibitory hormone in the synovial fluid and to the paucity of cells capable of proliferation within the tendon. Saloman advocated leaving a defect in the tendon sheath at the time of repair to permit contact between the repaired tendon and the subcutaneous tissue. Hueck [11], however, noted that healing was poor whether the sheath was left open or sutured closed.
   At this same time, Bunnell [12,13] and Garlock [14] recognized the clinical occurrence of restrictive adhesions at the flexor tendon laceration site within the digit. Bunnell used the term "No Man's Land" (NML) to describe this region where the flexor tendon passed through the digital sheath. The historical derivation of the term No Man's Land dates to its description in the fourteenth century of a plot of land outside the city of London used for executions. Bunnell encountered the term in his World War I experience in France when it was used to describe the strip of devastated lands between the front line trenches of the two opposing armies where soldiers ventured with extreme caution. Similarly, Bunnell advised surgeons to be cautious when repairing tendons within this region in the digital sheath. According to Boyes (JH Boyes, personal communication), Bunnell used the term No Man's Land to describe this region as early as 1934; the term was written for the first time in the second edition (1948) of his text Surgery Of the Hand [15]. Bunnell outlined rigid conditions that must be present to perform flexor tendon repair within the digital sheath [16]; these included the use of stainless steel suture, an admonition to repair only the profundus tendon, and postoperative immobilization of the wrist in flexion to prevent the involved muscle from contracting too forcefully and separating the ends of the sutured tendon. Of interest, Bunnell also noted that the flexed wrist position still allowed sufficient motion to "stimulate growth and lessen adhesions while physiological union is occurring"; it is apparent that Bunnell was aware of the importance of motion and tension on tendon healing.
   In 1940, Mason also advised similar specific conditions for repairing acutely lacerated flexor tendons within the digital sheath. These included never repairing both tendons, wide excision of the overlying sheath, and adequate elimination of all contaminates from the wound [17].
   Despite the establishment of the concept and conditions for primary repair of lacerated flexor tendons within the digital sheath by these two well respected hand surgeons, the predominant opinion during the first half of the twentieth century was that primary repair of flexor tendons in No Man's Land should be discouraged in preference to tendon grafting. In 1947, Boyes noted that primary flexor tendon repair in the critical No Man's Land area usually failed because of infection, excessive scarring, and flexion contracture caused by poorly placed incisions [18]. Because of the generally unsatisfactory results, his preferred treatment was tendon grafting [19]. Boyes' opinion regarding the poor results following primary flexor tendon repair also was held by numerous other investigators [20-22]. the intrinsic capacity to participate in the repair process in the absence of peripheral adhesions, primary repair of injured flexor tendons is the preferred treatment.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to describe the principal therapeutic and research contributions developed during 1979 and the year 2003, at the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente, former Mexican Institute of Psychiatry Several psychosocial treatment approaches were applied to different groups of schizophrenic patients, as well as family therapy to the their relatives.
   Schizophrenia is an illness characterized by psychotic symptoms, some of them known as positive symptoms such as: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and also negative symptoms such as: affective flattering, alogia or avoition. Psychotic symptoms may lead the patient to loose contact with reality, specially if he is not using antipsychotic medication. Since the illness usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, the learning of psychosocial role performance is interrupted resulting in a decline of psychosocial functioning with catastrophic consequences for the patient, several areas of psychosocial functioning remain affected such as: work, income, social relations, love relationships, and also the family system is affected, the relatives have to manage not only the economic consequences but also the impact of the illnes. As a result, the management of schizophrenia should include not only the psychotic symptoms, but also the impairments and the disabilities of the illness. Within this frame work, the present treatment of schizophrenia should consider four important components: 1.- pharmacological treatment, 2.- psychosocial treatment, 3.- family treatment, 4.-the management of the patient in the community.
   The initiation of psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia is almost parallel, or immediately after the appearance of neuroleptic medication, which occured early in the 1950's. Patiens recluded in mental hospitals, started to use neuroleptic medication and as a consequence there was a reduction in psychotic symtomatology. Patients were released to the community, in some cases they returned to live with their relatives, in other cases, some alternatives were developed in the community such as: halfway houses, c-ay care centers, partial hospitalisation services, and therapeutic communities. By the time patients were living in the community they began to present several psychosocial problems, most of them related to the impairments of the illness. They had difficulties for maintaining a job and as a consequence they had no income; therefore, they had economic dependence upon their families or otherwise they needed economic support from certain social agencies in the community. They also had difficulties for initiating and maintaining social interactions, their social network was very much reduced and as a consequence the possibility of having long and lasting love relationships was limited. Within this framework certain specific areas where schizophrenic patients have psychosocial problems have been identified. The evidence indicates that psychosocial functioning is not satisfactory for the patient in the community. Patients, not only have to battle with the symptoms of the illness, since it has been established that in order to reduce the symptoms, they need to take antipsychotic medication. They also have to deal with the impairments, and disabilities arising from the illness, that affect their psychosocial functioning, and therefore they need psychosocial treatment.
   In developed countries, psychosocial treatments for schizophrenic patients have become an important and necessary component in mental health services, psychiatric hospitals, and specially in Schizophrenia Clinics. Psychosocial treatments have been validated as effective in providing psychosocial coping skills, improving community psychosocial functioning, reducing relapse rate, increasing compliance with the prescribed medication, and usually obtaining an acceptable degree of therapeutic adherence. Psychosocial treatments can not be used as a substitute of pharmacological treatment, neither as the only treatment of choice. It has been established and recommended that the most convenient perspective to treat schizophrenic patients is always using the combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatment. Psychosocial interventions can be used beneficially in conjunction with antipsychotic medication and the combination may actually have an additive or synergistic effect.
   In this article, several models of psychosocial treatment are presented that were carried out in different groups of schizophrenic patients at the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City. One model was utilized on acute psychotic hospitalised patients, during four weeks of treatment. Another model was implemented on chronic hospitalised schizophrenic patients, during two years of treatment. Another type of psychosocial treatment was carried out on three different occasions on non-hospitalised schizophrenic patients, on each occasion the duration of every treatment was of one year. Finally, another study was carried out, comparing three modalities of interventions: integrated treatment, music therapy, and psychosocial treatment, during six months. In all psychosocial models, group therapy techniques were utilized and in some cases, individual therapy was provided, when needed. Therapy sessions were utilized as an space for the patients to talk about their psychosocial problems. In all groups, the basic component was the use of prescribed antipsychotic medication, as the first approach to treatment. The clinical procedure for allocating the patients to the interventions group's consisted in determining and verifying the schizophrenia diagnosis, and the use of antipsychotic medication. Once the patients were clinically stabilized, the), were allocated to the treatment groups. The scientific method consisted of using quasi-experimental and experimental designs including experimental and control groups. Patients of all groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of each intervention, considering variables Such as: symtomatology, psychosocial functioning, global functioning, compliance with antipsychotic medication, relapse, rehospitalization, therapeutic non-compliance and adherence.
   The results show that psychosocial treatments can be very effective when combined with antipsychotic medication, in comparison with the use of pharmacotherapy alone. patients improved clinically and psychosocially in the following aspects: symtomatology, psychosocial functioning, global functioning (symptoms and psychological activities), they presented a lower relapse frequency and rehospitalization rate, a higher antipsychotic medication compliance, a reduced rate of therapeutic noncompliance and 2 higher degree of adherence. Control patients, who received exclusively pharmacological treatment, remained stabilized in their psychotic symtomatology, but they did not improved in any of the psychosocial variables. It can be concluded that the conjunction of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, show beneficial effects for the patients; therefore, it should be considered as an important therapeutic alternative in the treatment of schizophrenia.
   The schizophrenia is one of the mental disorders in where old difficulties in the family environment are introduced; the negative effect of the illness, in the majority of the cases, it relapse basically in who they suffer it and in who they live together with the sick person, the clinical characteristics of this illness generate a great number of negative situations like difficulty in the family relationships, impoverishment in the quality of life, social isolation that interferes in the labor operation, scholar and in the own home; the one which increases the level of stress already existent, being converted in an additional factor of anguish, so much for the patient like for their family, coming to be considered like precipitant of relapses, of exacerbation of symptoms and of rehospitalization, the family plays a fundamental paper when she are pretended to improve the level of global operation of the patient, their quality of life and their addiction to the treatment.
   The treatment that they received the relatives was conformed by two element: 1degrees the psychoeducation and 2degrees the therapeutic. Psychoeducation was begun multifamily that divided in two parts, the senior with a shop it consisted in the presentation of specific related topics with the illness, exposed for specialists of the team with a total of 12 educational sessions. Subsequently, in a second part, in more reduced groups recombine the topics of the sessions and he was favored the handling of the emotions that the information woke up in each relative and the solution of problems. To the same time the therapy was carried out unfamiliar, in where I am worked the specific problem of each family and their patient, approximately 5 sessions, fundamentally as for the limits, the hierarchy and the centrality, as well as the establishment of nets of support in order to favor a better evolution of the illness centered in looks communicative, interaccional and structural. Several instruments were utilized: 1.- The Identification of Evaluation of the conduct of the patient SBAS 2degrees Ed; 2.- The Cuestionary of Evaluation of expressed emotion (CEEE); 3.-Conception of the Illness. (CONENF); 4.- The Composite International Diagnostic Interview [version] 1.0. (CIDI); Global evaluation of the form of family relationship with the EEGAR-DSM-IV and the Cuestionary of Woman Domestic Violence (MVD).
   The outputs of the study of the effects of the intervention in the relatives, they were evaluated by means of several indicators, concerning the family load answers in the loads were observed: Emotional, Economical, Physics and Social, highlighting improvement mainly in the "subjective emotional load" of the relatives after receiving the treatment.
   As for the emotional expression the tall level was introduced with more frequency, he stood out the component of overinvolvement, Compound for looks of overinvolvement and sacrificial, they to the term of the treatment met differences in the component of overinvolvement and in the global EE. He met association between the emotional tall expression, an unfortunate operation and the symptomatic conduct of the patient. The relatives that expressed tall EE, reporter old carelessness, irritability, violence and isolation per party of their sick relative.
   With concerning the secondary opposing psychopathology in the relative, he was observed that more than three fourth relate the suffer any physical or emotional disorder with the apparition of the schizophrenia in their relative, it is important mention that of two relatives one introduced any disorder Psychical, very superior figure to the reported for the general population, as for the type of diagnosis met similitude with him described in other populations, in where the disorders depressives highlights in first place; consecutive for the dependence to the alcohol.
   The outputs that were gotten of this investigation are of utility for the construction of 2 model of treatment and study of the relatives of a sick person with schizophrenia, in order to prevent and try to resolve the necessities detected in the relatives of effective manner. Upon considering the illness of the patient on one hand and-the wide range of problems related to this and for another, the presence of one or more diagnoses Psychical in the responsible relative, he is of waiting for, that the evolution of both lacks a satisfactory course, unless this comorbility is detected and undertaken therapeutics, with the purpose of optimizer the evolution or the development of the illness and diminish the exacerbation of symptoms or relapses and to their time, improve the family interaction.
   Considering the necessity of undertaking so much integral the diagnosis like the treatment and the prevention of the illness for the family group, the sick relative, of manner the team of mental health and the community will allow to advance toward the rehabilitation of the people that they suffer this suffering.
