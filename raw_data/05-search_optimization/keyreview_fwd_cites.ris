TI  - Ecological Drift and Directional Community Change in an Isolated Mediterranean Forest Reserve—Larger Moth Species Under Higher Threat
PY  - 2020
AB  - Long-term data are important to understand the changes in ecological communities over time but are quite rare for insects. We analyzed such changes using historic museum collections. For our study area, an isolated forest reserve in North-East Italy, data from the past 80 yr were available. We used records of 300 moth species to analyze whether extinction risk was linked to their body size or to their degree of ecological specialization. Specialization was scored 1) by classifying larval food affiliations, habitat preferences, and the northern distributional limit and 2) by analyzing functional dispersion (FDis) within species assemblages over time. Our results show that locally extinct species (mean wingspan: 37.0 mm) were larger than persistent (33.2 mm) or previously unrecorded ones (30.7 mm), leading to a smaller mean wingspan of the moth community over time. Some ecological filters appear to have selected against bigger species. By using coarse specialization categories, we did not observe any relationship with local extinction risk. However, FDis, calculated across 12 species traits, significantly decreased over time. We conclude that simple classification systems might fail in reflecting changes in community-wide specialization. Multivariate approaches such as FDis may provide deeper insight, as they reflect a variety of ecological niche dimensions. With the abandonment of extensive land use practices, natural succession seems to have shifted the moth community toward a preponderance of forest-affiliated species, leading to decreased FDis values. Multivariate analyses of species composition also confirmed that the moth community has significantly changed during the last 80 yr.

TI  - Spatio-temporal approach for identification of critical conservation areas: a case study with two pine species from a threatened temperate forest in Mexico
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fragmentation transforms natural habitats into a set of structurally and functionally differentiated small and separated patches, and causes the loss of connectivity among populations. In this study, we used a multi-temporal approach (1986, 2011 and 2016), to analyze the patterns of habitat fragmentation and to identify critical zones for the maintenance of habitat connectivity of two focal pine species (Pinus pseudostrobus and P. montezumae) with the broadest distribution and highest economic importance in the temperate forests of the Meseta Purepecha, in Michoacan, Mexico. This eco-region is currently one of the most threatened in terms of habitat degradation and extinction of forest communities. From a supervised classification of satellite images, land use coverage classes were selected and used as a basis to analyze the degree of landscape fragmentation using configuration and composition metrics and landscape connectivity based on the graph-theory approach. The fragmentation metrics suggested an increase in agricultural coverage (10.81%; fruits crop, mainly avocado), while the coverage of the forest showed a reduction (15.06%) and fragmentation throughout the study period. The landscape connectivity is lower (16.3% on average) and showed two highly important zones (Uruapan and Tancitaro) and one zone of high importance (Patzcuaro) to maintain connectivity, considering three different dispersion distances (0.5, 5.0 and 10 km) for the species analyzed. We propose these three zones as potential habitat stepping stones to promote overall landscape connectivity, offering primary habitats and possible ecological resilience for this important forest ecosystem.

TI  - Graphab: an application for modeling and managing ecological habitat networks
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landscape graphs are increasingly used in ecology, conservation, and landscape planning for modeling habitat connectivity of wildlife species. We present here the follow-up of Graphab, a software application for modeling habitat networks. This application has been recently enhanced by advanced functions of spatial analysis, command-line facilities, and connections with other software applications. It has been used in many studies, first in ecological studies for analyzing the role of landscape connectivity on biological responses measured in the field, second for supporting decisions concerning biodiversity preservation. Future improvements could be made to make the links more realistic with respect to ecological processes.

TI  - Accounting for Connectivity Uncertainties in Predicting Roadkills: a Comparative Approach between Path Selection Functions and Habitat Suitability Models
PY  - 2019
AB  - Functional connectivity modeling is increasingly used to predict the best spatial location for over- or underpasses, to mitigate road barrier effects and wildlife roadkills. This tool requires estimation of resistance surfaces, ideally modeled with movement data, which are costly to obtain. An alternative is to use occurrence data within species distribution models to infer movement resistance, although this remains a controversial issue. This study aimed both to compare the performance of resistance surfaces derived from path versus occurrence data in identifying road-crossing locations of a forest carnivore and assess the influence of movement type (daily vs. dispersal) on this performance. Resistance surfaces were built for genet (Genetta genetta) in southern Portugal using path selection functions with telemetry data, and species distribution models with occurrence data. An independent roadkill dataset was used to evaluate the performance of each connectivity model in predicting roadkill locations. The results show that resistance surfaces derived from occurrence data are as suitable in predicting roadkills as path data for daily movements. When dispersal was simulated, the performance of both resistance surfaces was equally good at predicting roadkills. Moreover, contrary to our expectations, we found no significant differences in locations of roadkill predictions between models based on daily movements and models based on dispersal. Our results suggest that species distribution models are a cost-effective tool to build functional connectivity models for road mitigation plans when movement data are not available.

TI  - Connectivity maintain mammal assemblages functional diversity within agricultural and fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Despite major advances in mammal research, there are knowledge gaps regarding distribution, composition, and the functional role of mammal species within agricultural and fragmented landscapes. Also, there is a lack of knowledge about which factors influence mammal assemblages within agricultural ecosystems. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the contribution of forest cover, functional connectivity, drainage, and amount of sugar cane toward explaining the functional diversity of terrestrial mammals. We made an inventory of terrestrial mammals in an agricultural and fragmented landscape in an Atlantic Forest-Cerrado ecotone in southeastern Brazil, assessed the functional diversity of mammal assemblages, and proposed conservation strategies at the landscape level. Data collection occurred from September/2011 to August/2012 through a combination of complementary methods: active search; trapping stations; collection of fecal samples, which were identified by hair cuticle and fecal DNA analysis; and data from the literature. Functional diversity (FD) was calculated using a set of ecological traits including body mass, locomotion form, behavioral and dietary traits, and the environmental sensitivity of species. Akaike information criterion was used to compare generalized linear models between FD values and landscape metrics. Our results reveal a surprising insight about the role exerted by agricultural and fragmented landscapes, which still sustain impressively high biodiversity levels and a meaningful amount of ecological functions, indicating some resistance of species to pressure from the agricultural matrix and advancing urbanization. The amount of ecological functions performed by mammal species within agricultural and fragmented landscapes was similar to pristine areas and more preserved landscapes. Functional connectivity (amount of area assessed for species able to cross 200 m of matrix) was the most plausible model (wAICc = 0.873). Thus, we concluded that improving functional connectivity guarantees high FD values, and we demonstrate the importance of maintaining and restoring structural connections between fragment patches within these landscapes for species conservation and the maintenance of populations over time.

TI  - Effect of the landscape matrix condition for prioritizing multispecies connectivity conservation in a highly biodiverse landscape of Central Mexico
PY  - 2018
AB  - Implementing and monitoring long-term conservation strategies demands identifying priorities for preserving landscape connectivity. In this manuscript, we present an approach to prioritize areas for preserving landscape connectivity by using the landscape matrix in central-western Mexico and the connectivity for habitat patches considering ensembles of different terrestrial organisms. We aggregated three multispecies connectivity scenarios into a composite corridor scenario. To evaluate which corridors were more important to multispecies connectivity, we used the composite corridor model based on two ways: (1) the contribution of habitat patches that the corridor connects to overall connectivity and (2) the corridor’s capability for facilitating movement across the network of patches. Habitat patches were classified according to their value for the conservation of multispecies connectivity by hybridizing circuit-based and spatial prioritization models for connectivity conservation. We developed current flow models for each species (n = 40) and combined them in four prioritization models corresponding to the three multispecies groups and an all-species group. We found that the corridors having the highest accumulated importance (CI ≥ 58) are located along the protected areas of Pico de Tancitaro and the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera de la Mariposa Monarca–RBMM, Spanish acronym), which have relatively similar spatial distributions corridors compared to areas with priority for conservation (relative rank test = 0.6). Within those areas, there are permeable sectors with high connectivity retention values that could optimize their ecological function as multispecies corridors. Our approach is applicable to different landscapes, and it allows for identifying priorities for connectivity conservation by integrating landscape elements outside habitat patches.

TI  - Green infrastructure for coastal flood protection: The longitudinal impacts of green infrastructure patterns on flood damage.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The importance of implementing green infrastructure (GI) for flood protection is supported by multiple substantial cross-sectional analyses. Yet, limited longitudinal research has been conducted which addresses how to maintain and improve the configuration of GI in order to minimize the cost of losses resulting from flooding. Structural damage from devastating storm events has repeatedly imposed substantial financial burdens on local governments in coastal regions. This study longitudinally examines the impacts of changes in GI patterns on flood damage cost in coastal Texas areas. Major flood events in the 36 Texan coastal watershed counties along the Gulf of Mexico were monitored from 2000 to 2017. Along with non-spatially weighted panel data models, we developed an advanced statistical model controlling for spatially correlated errors in flood loss and predicting flood loss with a set of time-series socioeconomic and environmental control variables. The results of the spatial panel data model reveal that long-term maintenance of larger, more irregular, more dispersed, less fragmented, and less connected patterns of GI will help to reduce county-level flood damage costs per capita over time. Most importantly, protecting larger patches within a closer proximity was found to be of the utmost importance for retaining the flood regulation services provided by GI. These findings suggest that planners and natural resource managers should enhance supportive land use policies to preserve existing GI and strategically locate new implementations in order to achieve long-term flood protection.

TI  - Metapopulation connectivity in Voles (Microtus sp.) as a gauge for tallgrass prairie restoration in midwestern North America
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Applying quantifiable metrics to validate the success of restoration efforts is crucial for ongoing management programs in anthropogenically fragmented habitats. Estimates of dispersal can provide such baseline data because they measure not only the extent to which restored patches are colonized and interconnected, but also their metapopulation source/sink dynamics. In this context, we estimated dispersal and population connectivity among prairie (Microtus ochrogaster; N=231) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus; N=83), sampled from eight restored plots at five tallgrass prairie sites embedded within the agricultural matrix of midwestern North America. Our expectation was that extensive distances separating these restored habitats (i.e., 48–246 km) would spatially isolate vole metapopulations, resulting in significant genetic differentiation. We first used molecular taxonomy to validate the field-identifications of all sampled individuals, then used pairwise FST derived from 15 microsatellite DNA loci to estimate genetic connectivity among the species-delimited study populations. Metapopulation stability was gauged by assessing migration rates and deriving effective population sizes (Ne). We also calculated relatedness values (r) as a potential surrogate for contact in prairie vole, a primary vector for Lyme disease. Molecular species-assignments contravened field-identifications in 25% of samples (11 prairie/67 meadow) and identified two instances of species-hybridization (0.6%). Local effects (i.e., population crash/drought) were manifested at two sites, as documented by significant temporal declines in Ne and r. Overall, high migration rates and non-significant (10/15) pairwise FST values underscored elevated metapopulation connectivity. A single site that recorded five significant FST values also displayed significant r-values indicating the inadvertent sampling of closely related individuals. This highlights the close social groupings among cooperatively-breeding prairie vole that can exacerbate Lyme disease transmission. Thus, while elevated population connectivity aligns with prairie restoration goals, it also reinforces a need in adaptive management to evaluate environmental matrices for their permeability to vector-borne diseases.

AB  - Los estudios enfocados a la conectividad del paisaje son actualmente claves para la planificacion de la conservacion de los ecosistemas; sin embargo, solo un numero limitado de estudios proporcionan datos empiricos sobre los beneficios de la conectividad en la conservacion de los ecosistemas terrestres. En este estudio, se analizaron las publicaciones sobre estudios de conectividad particularmente para cuatro topicos en America Latina de 2000 a 2018, para brindar una vision del estado actual, retos y avances del conocimiento. La busqueda se realizo en diferentes bases de datos, las cuales se seleccionaron 217 trabajos. Todas las referencias seleccionadas fueron revisadas y clasificadas considerando: a) ano de publicacion, b) tipo de investigacion, c) pais de America Latina donde se realizo, d) area de estudio, e) tipo de ecosistema y f) objetivos de la investigacion. Los resultados muestran que la mayor parte de los estudios de conectividad se realizan considerando los topicos: a) de planificacion para la restauracion, b) modelado y planificacion de la cobertura vegetal/uso del suelo y c) servicios ecosistemicos. Sin embargo, los trabajos publicados sobre conectividad y cambio climatico han sido escasos. Tambien fue posible identificar publicaciones que abordaron dos topicos simultaneamente: a) estudios de modelado y planificacion de la cobertura vegetal/uso del suelo con estudios de la planificacion para la restauracion, b) estudios en servicios ecosistemicos con cambio climatico, and c) planificacion para la restauracion con cambio climatico. Sin embargo, existe la necesidad de incrementar sustancialmente las investigaciones en los temas de conectividad en America latina.

TI  - Multispecies landscape functional connectivity enhances local bird species' diversity in a highly fragmented landscape.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Local species assemblages are likely the result of habitat and landscape filtering. However, there is still limited knowledge on how landscape functional connectivity complements habitat attributes in mediating local species assemblages in real-world fragmented landscapes. In this study, we set up a non-manipulative experimental design in a standard production forest to demonstrate how functional connectivity determines the spatial distribution of a bird community. We test single- and multispecies spatially explicit, landscape functional connectivity models framed within the circuit theory, considering also patch attributes describing habitat size and quality, to weight their effects on species occurrence and community assemblage. We found that single-species functional connectivity effects contributed positively for occurrence of each species. However, they rarely provided competing alternatives in predicting community parameters when compared to multispecies connectivity models. Incorporating multispecies connectivity showed more consistent effects for all community parameters, than single-species models, since the overlap between species’ dispersal abilities in the landscape shows poor agreement. Habitat size and quality, though less important, were also determinant in explaining community parameters while possibly relating to the provision of suitable nesting and foraging conditions. Both habitat and landscape filters concur to govern community assembly, though likely influencing different processes: while landscape connectivity determines which species can reach a patch, habitat quality determines which species settle in the patch. Our results also suggest that surrogating multispecies connectivity from single species has potential to source bias by assuming species perceive landscape and its barriers similarly. Inference on this issue must be gathered from as much species as possible.

TI  - Depicting the mating system and patterns of contemporary pollen flow in trees of the genus Anadenanthera (Fabaceae).
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anadenanthera (Fabaceae) is endemic to the Neotropics and consists of two tree species: A. colubrina (Vell.) Brenan and A. peregrina (L.) Speg. This study examined the mating system and contemporary gene flow of A. colubrina (Acol) and A. peregrina (Aper) in a highly fragmented area of the Atlantic Forest to provide valuable information that informs conservation strategies. Reproductive adults from forest remnants [n A. colubrina = 30 (2.7 ha), n A. peregrina = 55 (4.0 ha)] and progeny-arrays (n A. colubrina = 322, n A. peregrina = 300) were genotyped for seven nuclear microsatellite markers. Mating system analyses revealed that A. colubrina is a mixed mating species (tm = 0.619) while A. peregrina is a predominantly outcrossing species (tm = 0.905). For both Anadenanthera species, high indices of biparental inbreeding were observed (Acol = 0.159, Aper = 0.216), resulting in low effective pollination neighborhood sizes. Categorical paternity analysis revealed different scales of pollen dispersal distance: the majority of crossings occurring locally (i.e., between nearby trees within the same population), with moderate pollen dispersal coming from outside the forest fragments boundaries (Acol mp = 30%, Aper mp = 35%). Nevertheless, pollen immigration from trees outside the populations for both species suggests that the populations are not reproductively isolated. This study highlights the importance of evaluating both mating system and contemporary gene flow for a better understanding of the biology of Anadenanthera species. This information should be considered to ensure the effective conservation and management practices of these plant species.

TI  - Landscape functional connectivity for butterflies under different scenarios of land-use, land-cover, and climate change in Australia
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Pollinating invertebrates are vital to terrestrial ecosystems but are impacted by anthropogenic habitat loss/fragmentation and climate change. Conserving and improving landscape connectivity is important to offset those threats, yet its assessment for invertebrates is lacking. In this study, we evaluated the functional connectivity between protected areas in Australia for 59 butterfly species, under present conditions and different future scenarios (for 2050 and 2090) of land-use, land-cover, and climate change. Using circuit-theory analysis, we found that functional connectivity under present conditions varies widely between species, even when their estimated geographical ranges are similar. Under future scenarios, functional connectivity is predicted to decrease overall, with negative changes worsening from 2050 to 2090, although a few species are positive exceptions. We have made our results available as spatial datasets to allow comparisons with taxa from other studies and can be used to identify priority areas for conservation in terms of establishing ecological corridors or stepping-stone habitat patches. Our study highlights the importance of considering pollinating invertebrates when seeking holistic conservation and restoration of a landscape’s functional connectivity, underscoring the need to expand and promote protected areas to facilitate functional connectivity under future scenarios of global change.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Research Data</jats:title><jats:p>The habitat suitability maps and functional connectivity maps are made available as GeoTiff images via Figshare (10.6084/m9.figshare.19130078).</jats:p></jats:sec>

TI  - Coupling landscape graph modeling and biological data: a review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landscape graphs are widely used to model networks of habitat patches. As they require little input data, they are particularly suitable for supporting conservation decisions (and decisions about other issues as e.g. disease spread) taken by land planners. However, it may be problematic to use these methods in operational contexts without validating them with empirical data on species or communities. Since little is known about methodological alternatives for coupling landscape graphs with biological data, we have made an exhaustive review of these methods to analyze links between the main purposes of the studies, the way landscape graphs are constructed and used, the type of field data, and the way these data are integrated into the analysis. We systematically describe a corpus of 71 scientific papers dealing with terrestrial species, with particular emphasis on methodological choices and contexts of the studies. Despite a great variability of types of biological data and coupling strategies, our analyses reveal a dichotomy according to the objective of the studies, between (i) approaches aimed at improving ecological knowledge, mainly based on land-cover maps and using biological data to test the influence of landscape connectivity on biological responses, and (ii) approaches with an operational aim, in which biological data are directly integrated into the graph construction and assuming a positive effect of connectivity. Beyond these main contrasts, the review shows that landscape graphs can benefit from field data of different types at varying scales. The great variability of approaches adopted reveals the flexible nature of these tools.

AB  - <jats:p>Connectivity is a landscape property that promotes gene flow between organisms located in different patches of habitat and provides a way to reduce habitat loss by maintaining flux of organisms through the landscape; it is an important factor for conservation decisions. In this study, we evaluated the structural and functional connectivity among 510 oak forest remnants in a basin in central Mexico by modeling the potential distribution of seven oak species that inhabit in it. The structural and functional connectivity of oak forest remnants was estimated by graph theory. Distribution models for all the oak species had a good level of predictability, showing that 53.16% of the basin is suitable for oaks. The importance for connectivity varied between the remnant forests. Large forest fragments had the highest values of connectivity, and small forest fragments acted as steppingstones favoring the movement of organisms among fragments. In the southern region of the basin, connected remnant forests had conformed to a large network, but in the northern region, the remnant forests were mostly isolated. Conservation of oak forests in this basin requires protection for remaining patches by preserving both large and small ones and restoring biological corridors to reduce the isolation of forest fragments.</jats:p>

TI  - Assessing Environmental Criteria to Support Forest Connectivity
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Establishing forest connection in landscapes under urban sprawl is essential for maintaining the ecological processes and ensuring biodiversity conservation. However, the major challenge is incorporated the ecological network in the land-use/land-cover planning. This way, the main objective of the study was the evaluation of environmental criteria for prioritizing areas to obtain forest functional connectivity in a landscape subject to the urban sprawl. The second objective was to understand how the criteria are associated with the structural forest attributes represented by traditional landscape ecology metrics. The criteria were defined through the literature review, representing the landscape characteristics as the topographic, conflicts, and biotics. The metrics used to characterize the forest structure were perimeter, shape index, and distance to the nearest neighbor. They were generated to a selected group of forest remnants, which represent the landscape forest structure. Sampling the criteria and forest fragments maps (i.e., different maps representing the metrics-values) through the hexagon network, we assessed how the criteria are associated with the structural forest attributes. The statistical analysis used to evaluate these sampled values were The Moran Global (Moran I) and Moran Local (LISA). We obtained that the urban expansion process is diffuse, although it does not occur randomly in our landscape. The criteria slope, TWI, distance from drainage network, distance from highways, distance from the low-density urban area, and distance from forest patches have characteristics that support this process. Furthermore, our results indicated a spatial autocorrelation among metrics and after, among metrics and these criteria. Also, we obtained that the external influences on the fragments did not occur randomly and that the criteria act on the landscape. This way, through these criteria, we can identify regions where it is possible to have the persistence of forest fragments, even though in places under the impact of urban sprawl.</jats:p>

TI  - The Role of Reproductive Periodicity in Dispersal Among Hydrothermal Vents and its Implications for Regional Connectivity and Conservation
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Connectivity among isolated habitat patches via planktonic larval dispersal is crucial for maintaining the regional diversity of hydrothermal vents. Despite, increasing sophistication of techniques for simulating dispersal, limited information on biological and behavioural traits of vent-associated species has unknown affects on the applicability of these methods for conservation. Here we focus on the role of periodic reproduction on dispersal among hydrothermal vents, as periodic spawning has increasingly been observed in a variety of taxa. For generalizeability, we simulate the dispersal of larvae under treatments of periodic and aperiodic release timing at various depths, with a consistant but variable planktonic larval duration. Our results show a highly variable effect of periodicity on the characteristics and distribution of dispersal, which are heavily modified by the dispersal depth and source location. The capacity for reproductive periodicity to impact the among-site dispersal warrents further investigation into its prevelance and timing among vent-associated fauna.</jats:p>

TI  - Riparian forest corridors: A prioritization analysis to the Landscape Sample Units of the Brazilian National Forest Inventory
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract In addition to sampling biophysical data in field plots, the Brazilian National Forest Inventory (NFI-BR) has a component dedicated to the study of Brazilian rural landscapes. The Landscape Sample Units (LSUs) are square areas of 100 km2, established in a regular grid of 40 × 40 km over the entire national territory, where habitat quality and spatial structure are characterized and evaluated. The LSUs’ evaluation scheme measures the fragmentation and connectivity of remnant forest patches as well as the spatial configuration of riparian zones. As part of these analyses we propose the use of integrated indices based on the structural connectivity of the riparian environments as forest corridors, the degree of human pressure acting on them and the protection schemes defined by the new Brazilian forest legislation. These indices are then turned into scores to make a ranking allowing for the identification of riparian priority areas for conservation and landscape restoration. Basic processing steps included the application of Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to the LULC map of a pilot sample from the LSU dataset in the State of Parana, in southern Brazil. The following indices have been calculated for 20 LSUs: Structural Corridors Index (SCc), which reveals the proportion of core and bridge MSPA categories within the riparian zone, the Structural Corridors under Pressure Index (CPc), that allows the identification of areas where structural corridors coexist with areas subject to anthropogenic influences and, finally, the Structural Corridors under Pressure Protection Index (UCPc), which identifies areas that function as corridors, being under anthropogenic pressure as well but with little or no legal protection, thus corresponding to priority areas for conservation. Among the 20 pilot LSUs studied, three of them are representative of a critical situation regarding conservation issues as they presented high values for indices CPc and UCPc, which denote areas with high anthropogenic influences and no environmental protection schemes. An important aspect of the proposed methodology is the possibility to identify and prioritize areas at different spatial scales, further aggregating the indices for LSU or larger political regions, such as micro and mesoregions of federal states.

TI  - Use of botanical gardens as arks for conserving pollinators and plant-pollinator interactions: A case study from the US Northern Great Plains
PY  - 2021
AB  - Botanical gardens have contributed to plant conservation through the maintenance of both living and preserved plant specimens for decades. However, there is still a large gap in the literature with regards to understanding the potential conservation value botanical gardens could provide for local pollinators. We investigated how plant-pollinator community structure and diversity may differ between botanical gardens and native habitats by sampling and comparing between two environments: a restored native grassland patch within a local botanical garden and fifteen native, remnant temperate grassland sites in the Northern Great Plains. We found pollinator diversity within the restored native grassland patch was greater than 55% of total remnant temperate grassland transects throughout the entire flowering season, while plant diversity and network community metrics between the two environments remained similar throughout, except that remnant prairies have more links (higher connectance) with pollinators than the garden patch. Overall, our findings demonstrate the promising role restored native grassland patches in botanical gardens could play as reservoirs for local pollinator communities by supporting plant-pollinator interactions comparable to those found in native habitat remnants in the same region.

TI  - Incorporating landscape connectivity into household pond configuration in a hilly agricultural landscape
PY  - 2016
AB  - Manmade ponds are common landscape features in rural areas and also important habitats for maintaining biodiversity. However, they are vulnerable to anthropogenic activities, land-use changes, and habitat degradation; many ponds being filled or (re)created arbitrarily. Little attention has been paid to quantifying the spatial structure of these manmade ponds at a landscape scale, nor to their potential functional benefits in promoting ecological flows and interactions between habitats for whole-ecosystem integrity. In this study, we investigated the patch-based landscape connectivity of household ponds, a particular type of domestic pond prevalent in hilly rural areas of China, by using least-cost path modelling and graph theory based network analysis. A hierarchical network was modelled consisting of 4606 individual ponds, 373 pond patches and 772 potential links within a 1.5-km threshold distance. Network importance analysis revealed that the largest pond patch contributes 24.5 % to network building and that patches with larger areas are generally more important. In contrast, the importance of the simulated links is only 2.3 % at most, indicating that the network has spatial redundancy which can strengthen resilience to uncertain disturbances. Our study moves beyond network simulation and importance assessment by directly relating the connectivity analysis to a real construction context through the incorporation of a spatially explicit land suitability analysis. This approach systematises the analysis of pond landscapes and guides integration with the wider landscape matrix. It provides operational spatial suggestions for holistic landscape planning across local to regional scales.

TI  - Integrating opportunistic and structured non-invasive surveys with spatial capture-recapture models to map connectivity of the Pyrenean brown bear population
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Connectivity, in the sense of the persistence of movements between habitat patches, is key to maintain endangered populations and has to be evaluated in management plans. In practice, connectivity is difficult to quantify especially for rare and elusive species. Here, we use spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models with an ecological detection distance to identify barriers to movement. We focused on the transnational critically endangered Pyrenean brown bear (<jats:italic>Ursus arctos</jats:italic>) population, which is distributed over Spain, France and Andorra and is divided into two main cores areas following translocations. We integrate structured monitoring from camera traps and hair snags with opportunistic data gathered after depredation events. While structured monitoring focuses on areas of regular bear presence, the integration of opportunistic data allows us to obtain information in a wider range of habitat, which is especially important for ecological inference. By estimating a resistance parameter from encounter data, we show that the road network impedes movements, leading to smaller home ranges with increasing road density. Although the quantitative effect of roads is context-dependent (i.e. varying according to landscape configuration), our model predicts that a brown bear with a home range located in an area with relatively high road density (8.29km/km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) has a home range size reduced by 1.4-fold for males and 1.6-fold for females compared to a brown bear with a home range located in an area with low road density (1.38km/km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>). When assessing connectivity, spatial capture-recapture modeling offers an alternative to the use of experts’ opinion when telemetry data are not available.</jats:p>

TI  - The Contribution of Physical Geographers to Sustainability Research
PY  - 2017
AB  - A physical geographers’ scope of practice is not defined by any regulatory or academic organization, so perception of the potential contribution of physical geography to sustainability research has been nebulous or informal, at best. In order to understand what physical geographers can do to enhance sustainability, this paper describes a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on sustainability published in three physical geography journals. The results show that physical geographers are active in sustainability research in terms of a spatial perspective, an understanding of human interactions with the environment, and an ability to recognize, interpret, and project environmental change and its impacts. The depth of this understanding is facilitated by a physical geographers’ understanding of the natural world, process and system concepts, the ways that systems are linked and interact, and a willingness to deploy a wide range of methodologies to secure that knowledge. The expertise of physical geographers makes an important contribution to sustainability research and should be considered when multidisciplinary teams are assembled.

TI  - Articulation of the cross-boundary effects of China's ecological conservation redline program: A perspective on the ecological security network and ecological radiation
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> China’s Ecological Conservation Redline (ECR) program ensures the coordination and sustainability of natural and economic development while maintaining regional ecological security. Current research focuses on the ecosystem services within ECR areas but ignores cross-boundary ecological flow and the interactions between the internal and external ecological effects of ECR areas. In addition, the ecological background has spatial continuity that is not limited by boundaries, and the radiation effect areas extending beyond ECR areas have not been quantified. In this study, the Beijing ECR areas and ecological security network were integrated in order to connect the ecological process and landscape pattern to the ECR through the circulation path of ecological corridors, and cross-boundary effects between patches were examined. The field spread model was used to quantify the radiation influence range of ECR areas. Additionally, 972.46 km of ecological corridors were identified in Beijing, and abundant corridors effectively linked the ECR areas and maintained the material cycle. In the surrounding areas, ecological corridors were spread radially, with a total length of 941.85 km, promoting cross-boundary ecological flow between the ECR and surrounding source areas. This study used 25 ecological nodes to constitute the cross-boundary ecological security network system. The total radiation area based on the ECR source was 9572.16 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. These results provide support for the radiation effect of ECR and cross-boundary ecological flows and suggest a useful model for sustainable ecological development and cross-boundary management. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Sustainable management planning of protected areas depends on data from their biophysical and human environment. Based on such a premise, and using established international and national standards, this chapter proposes to outline a range of measures that can be considered in this process, drawing on the results of ecological studies carried out in the Mozogo-Gokoro National Park, located in the Sudano-Sahelian dry zone in the Far North of Cameroon. Initially, determining attributes for conservation were identified, notably those relating to the richness of the flora and the structure of the vegetation, which are close to a reference ecosystem. Subsequently, recommendations for sustainable management were formulated and analyzed in turn, taking into account especially the destructive anthropization identified as a major threat to the stability of the park. These management orientations could also be applied to safeguard other ecosystems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone.</jats:p>

TI  - Environmental mitigation hierarchy and biodiversity offsets revisited through habitat connectivity modelling.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Biodiversity loss is accelerating because of unceasing human activity and land clearing for development projects (urbanisation, transport infrastructure, mining and quarrying …). Environmental policy-makers and managers in different countries worldwide have proposed the mitigation hierarchy to ensure the goal of "no net loss (NNL) of biodiversity" and have included this principle in environmental impact assessment processes. However, spatial configuration is hardly ever taken into account in the mitigation hierarchy even though it would greatly benefit from recent developments in habitat connectivity modelling incorporating landscape graphs. Meanwhile, national, European and international commitments have been made to maintain and restore the connectivity of natural habitats to face habitat loss and fragmentation. Our objective is to revisit the mitigation hierarchy and to suggest a methodological framework for evaluating the environmental impact of development projects, which includes a landscape connectivity perspective. We advocate the use of the landscape connectivity metric equivalent connectivity (EC), which is based on the original concept of "amount of reachable habitat". We also refine the three main levels of the mitigation hierarchy (impact avoidance, reduction and offset) by integrating a landscape connectivity aspect. We applied this landscape connectivity framework to a simple, virtual habitat network composed of 14 patches of varying sizes. The mitigation hierarchy was addressed through graph theory and EC and several scenarios of impact avoidance, reduction and compensation were tested. We present the benefits of a habitat connectivity framework for the mitigation hierarchy, provide practical recommendations to implement this framework and show its use in real case studies that had previously been restricted to one or two steps of the mitigation hierarchy. We insist on the benefits of a habitat connectivity framework for the mitigation hierarchy and for ecological equivalence assessment. In particular, we demonstrate why it is risky to use a standard offset ratio (the ratio between the amount of area negatively impacted and the compensation area) without performing a connectivity analysis that includes the landscape surrounding the zone impacted by the project. We also discuss the limitations of the framework and suggest potential improvements. Lastly, we raise concerns about the need to rethink the strategy for biodiversity protection. Given that wild areas and semi-natural habitats are becoming scarcer, in particular in industrialised countries, we are convinced that the real challenge is to quickly reconsider the current vision of "developing first, then assessing the ecological damage", and instead urgently adopt an upstream protection strategy that would identify and protect the land that must not be lost if we wish to maintain viable species populations and ecological corridors allowing them the mobility necessary to their survival.

TI  - Prioritizing actions: spatial action maps for conservation.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Spatial prioritization is a critical step in conservation planning, a process designed to ensure that limited resources are applied in ways that deliver the highest possible returns for biodiversity and human wellbeing. In practice, many spatial prioritizations fall short of their potential by focusing on places rather than actions, and by using data of snapshots of assets or threats rather than estimated impacts. We introduce spatial action mapping as an approach that overcomes these shortfalls. This approach produces a spatially explicit view of where and how much a given conservation action is likely to contribute to achieving stated conservation goals. Through seven case examples, we demonstrate simple to complex versions of how this method can be applied across local to global scales to inform decisions about a wide range of conservation actions and benefits. Spatial action mapping can support major improvements in efficient use of conservation resources and will reach its full potential as the quality of environmental, social, and economic datasets converge and conservation impact evaluations improve.

TI  - Ecological connectivity as a planning tool for the conservation of wildlife in cities.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The application of ecological theory in urban planning is becoming more important as land managers focus on increasing biodiversity to improve human welfare in cities. Authorities must decide not only what types of biodiversity-focused infrastructure should be prioritized, but also where new resources should be positioned and existing resources protected or enhanced. Measuring the contribution of green infrastructure to landscape connectivity can maximise the successful return and conservation of urban nature. By using ecological connectivity theory as a planning tool, the effect of different interventions (both positive and negative) on the ease with which wildlife can move across the landscape can be compared. Here we outline an approach to a) quantify ecological connectivity for different urban wildlife species and b) use this to test different urban planning scenarios using QGIS. We demonstrate extensions which improve the application of this method as a planning tool:•Conversion of the effective mesh size value ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>eff</mml:mtext></mml:msub> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> to a "probability of connectedness" ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow> </mml:math> for easier interpretation by local government and comparisons between planning scenarios).•An approach for measuring species-specific connectivity, including how to decide what spatial information should be included and which types of species might be most responsive to connectivity planning.•Guidance for using the method to compare different urban planning scenarios.

TI  - Defining fine‐scaled population structure among continuously distributed populations
PY  - 2022
AB  - Understanding wildlife population structure and connectivity can help managers identify conservation strategies, as structure can facilitate the study of population changes and habitat connectivity can provide information on dispersal and biodiversity. To facilitate the use of wildlife monitoring data for improved adaptive management, we developed a novel approach to define hierarchical tiers (multiple scales) of population structure. We defined population structure by combining graph theory with biological inference about dispersal capability (based on movement, gene flow, and habitat condition) and functional processes affecting movement (e.g. habitat selection across scales of landscape preferences). First, we developed least-cost paths between high fidelity sites (habitat patches) using a cost surface, informed from functional processes of habitat characteristics to account for resistance of inter-patch movements. Second, we combined the paths into a multi-path graph construct. Third, we used information on potential connectivity (dispersal distances) and functional connectivity (permeability of fragmented landscapes based on selection preferences) to decompose the graph into hierarchical tiers of connected subpopulations, denoting the degree that dispersal affected population structure. As a case study, we applied our approach across the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) range, a species of conservation concern in western United States. We described the relative importance of local populations and where to potentially avoid landscape disturbances that may negatively affect population connectivity using centrality measures supported by graph theory, and we demonstrated close alignment of the resulting population structure with population densities. This method can be adapted for other species with site fidelity and used as a management tool to evaluate population trends and responses to landscape changes across different temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - LandScape Corridors (lscorridors): a new software package for modelling ecological corridors based on landscape patterns and species requirements
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary Maintaining connectivity is one of the main challenges for biodiversity conservation world-wide. Ecological corridors are important to maintain landscape connectivity, but their efficiency depends on landscape patterns and species responses at different spatial extents and landscape contexts. We developed a new ecologically oriented free software package, LandScape Corridors (lscorridors), to improve ecological corridor design by considering biodiversity responses to landscape attributes at a variety of spatial extents. LandScape Corridors considers stochastic variation, species perception and landscape influence on organisms in the design of ecological corridors. In addition to the least cost path algorithm, we propose four different methods for the simulation of multiple-path functional ecological corridors. One method uses the information for each pixel separately, whereas the three other methods permit corridor simulation considering the landscape context at different spatial extents. LandScape Corridors permits to simulate corridors for species with different requirements and considers that different species perceive and respond to the surrounding landscape in different ways, as many species may choose to move through areas that may not be the most permeable ones in the landscape. Two parameters in lscorridors modulate the stochasticity in corridors simulations. The first parameter is the level of variability added to the input resistance map in each simulation, resulting in more variable and spatially spread-out corridors. The other parameter is the spatial extent that may influence each pixel; larger extents result in larger spatial zones affecting each pixel during corridors simulations. In addition, when considering spatial influence, the simulations may be performed for species highly, medially or less sensitive to habitat quality. Some currently available software are not free or depend on a paid GIS software to work. In addition, some software do not support large matrices in their simulations, limiting their use. LandScape Corridors is designed to deal with large rasters, is based on strictly freeware software, and is freely available online. This allows the users to implement new methods for modelling multi-scale and ecologically based corridors. LandScape Corridors is a potential tool for the identification of protected areas, as corridor simulation considers species movement and landscape connectivity, essential characteristics to aid in large-scale biodiversity conservation, especially in anthropogenic landscapes. LandScape Corridors provides what we may call a zone for conservation, showing a set of connected areas in the landscape which may be ordered according to their potential for ecological corridors or which may be used as an aid for conservation strategies or ecological restoration projects.

TI  - Reconciling humans and birds when designing ecological corridors and parks within urban landscapes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Considering the necessity of interdisciplinary approaches for planning and managing the expansion of urban landscapes worldwide, this study aimed to (1) assess landscape permeability for birds and people inhabiting a Neotropical city and (2) propose priority streets and areas for the implementation of a green infrastructure project that could benefit both. To reach these goals, we generated resistance surfaces using expert knowledge to simulate multiple least-cost corridors (MLCC) between parks and green spaces within an urban landscape for people and seven bird species. We compared the solutions using a corridors' spatial agreement analysis, which allow us to identify the overlap between modeled corridors for all organisms or functional groups of interest. We also identified the streets most selected by the simulated MLCC and then identified a green space which is a convergence point of corridors modeled for both people and bird species. Finally, we suggested priority streets for planting trees and proposed interventions to turn the green space into a multifunctional park, conciliating social and ecological perspectives.

TI  - Comparison of landscape graph modelling methods for analysing pond network connectivity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landscape fragmentation negatively impacts species populations by isolating them. Assessing landscape connectivity could help to improve biodiversity conservation. Among various methods available to model and analyse connectivity, graph-theoretic approaches are recognized as powerful tools, even if their ecological significance may be questionable in some cases. Indeed, there are many ways to construct a landscape graph and their impacts on the assessment of connectivity are rarely explored. Our aim was to compare three methods of constructing landscape graphs to identify differences and similarities in the resulting network connectivity. The methods can be distinguished according to the type of data used: expert opinions, field data or a combination of the two. The methodological framework was applied to seven pond-dwelling species (Alytes obstetricans, Bufo bufo, Epidalea calamita, Hyla arborea, Natrix natrix, Rana temporaria, Triturus cristatus) in the Ile-de-France region (France). Three common methods were applied to construct landscape graphs: (1) using a land cover map (LM) and expert opinions to define nodes and links; (2) using a habitat suitability model (HSM) and species occurrence data to define nodes and links; and (3) using a HSM to define nodes and a land cover map to define links (HSM_LM). To carry out our study, we produced a land cover map, collected and prepared input data for HSMs, generated HSMs to map the probability of species occurrence and constructed landscape graphs from the three methods. For each of them, several connectivity metrics were calculated and compared. The results revealed large differences in the statistical distribution of connectivity values, even though the spatial location of the main areas of low and high connectivity was roughly the same. In general, the LM method provided lower values of connectivity and smaller areas of high values than the other two, regardless of species. Conversely, the HSM method had the highest connectivity values, while the combined HSM_LM method appeared to be intermediate. Our study was not intended to conclude whether one method is better than another; only to point out that results vary greatly depending on the graph construction method. To evaluate the predictive performance of each model, a validation process should be conducted with another independent biological dataset, which was not available in our study. The high variability of results argues for taking care to ensure that the construction of models is carefully consistent with ecological assumptions and the objective pursued.

TI  - Human footprint differentially impacts genetic connectivity of four wide‐ranging mammals in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Aim Maintaining connectivity is critical for long-term persistence of wild carnivores in landscapes fragmented due to anthropogenic activity. We examined spatial genetic structure and the impact of landscape features on connectivity in four wide-spread species- jungle cat (Felis chaus), leopard (Panthera pardus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). Location Our study was carried out in the central Indian landscape, a stronghold in terms of distribution and abundance of large mammals. The landscape comprises fragmented forests embedded in a heterogeneous matrix of multiple land-use types. Methods Microsatellite data from non-invasively sampled individuals (90 jungle cats, 82 leopards, 104 sloth bears and 117 tigers) were used to investigate genetic differentiation. Impact of landscape features on gene flow was inferred using a multi-model landscape resistance optimization approach. Results All four study species revealed significant isolation by distance (IBD). The correlation between genetic and geographic distance was significant only over a short distance for jungle cat, followed by longer distances for sloth bear, leopard and tiger. Overall, human footprint had a high negative impact on geneflow in tigers, followed by leopards, sloth bears and the least on jungle cats. Individual landscape variables- land-use, human population density, density of linear features and roads- impacted the study species differently. Although land-use was found to be an important variable explaining genetic connectivity for all four species, the amount of variation explained, the optimum spatial resolution and the resistance offered by different land-use classes varied. Main conclusions As expected from theory, but rarely demonstrated using empirical data, the pattern of spatial autocorrelation of genetic variation scaled with dispersal ability and density of the study species. Landscape genetic analyses revealed species-specific impact of landscape features and provided insights into interactions between species biology and landscape structure. Our results emphasize the need for incorporating functional connectivity data from multiple species for landscape-level conservation planning.

TI  - Effect of landscape connectivity on plant communities: a review of response patterns
PY  - 2019
AB  - Context Fragmentation in agricultural landscapes is considered as a major threat to biodiversity. Thus, ecological corridors are deployed at multiple scales to increase connectivity. However, there is limited consensus about their efficiency, especially for plants. Objectives We assimilated existing knowledge to assess whether and how landscape connectivity impacts plant communities. Methods We reviewed published literature across more than 20 years, providing an overview on the influence of connectivity on plant communities. Results We found that landscape connectivity has a varying and complex influence on the composition and diversity of plant communities (i.e. community taxonomic structure), due to the multiplicity of factors that modulate its effect. Our understanding of how of landscape connectivity impacts the dispersal of plants is improved by using biological traits (i.e. community functional structure). Finally, we showed that landscape connectivity promotes actual dispersal between connected communities. Conclusions This review emphasises the pertinence of trait-based and actual dispersal approaches to improve our understanding and ability to predict the effect of connectivity loss on plant communities, allowing us to identify new prospects for future research.

TI  - Barriers and bridges for sustaining functional habitat networks: A macroecological system analysis of wet grassland landscapes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - This study aims at supporting the maintenance of representative functional habitat networks as green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation through transdisciplinary macroecological analyses of wet grassland landscapes and their stewardship systems. We chose ten north European wet grassland case study landscapes from Iceland and the Netherlands in the west to Lithuania and Belarus in the east. We combine expert experiences for 20-30 years, comparative studies made 2011-2017, and longitudinal analyses spanning >70 years. Wader, or shorebird, (<i>Charadrii</i>) assemblages were chosen as a focal species group. We used evidence-based knowledge and practical experience generated in three steps. (1) Experts from 8 wet grassland landscapes in northern Europe's west and east mapped factors linked to patterns and processes, and management and governance, in social-ecological systems that affect states and trends of wet grasslands as green infrastructures for wader birds. (2) To understand wader conservation problems and their dynamic in wet grassland landscapes, and to identify key issues for successful conservation, we applied group modeling using causal loop diagram mapping. (3) Validation was made using the historic development in two additional wet grassland landscapes. Wader conservation was dependent on ten dynamically interacting ecological and social system factors as leverage points for management. Re-wetting and grazing were common drivers for the ecological and social system, and long-term economic support for securing farmers' interest in wader bird conservation. Financial public incentives at higher levels of governance of wetland management are needed to stimulate private income loops. Systems analysis based on contrasting landscape case studies in space and over time can support (1) understanding of complex interactions in social-ecological systems, (2) collaborative learning in individual wet grassland landscapes, and (3) formulation of priorities for conservation, management, and restoration.

TI  - Identifying wildlife corridors for the restoration of regional habitat connectivity: A multispecies approach and comparison of resistance surfaces.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Many large-scale connectivity initiatives have been proposed around the world with the aim of maintaining or restoring connectivity to offset the impacts on biodiversity of habitat loss and fragmentation. Frequently, these are based on the requirements of a single focal species of concern, but there is growing attention to identifying connectivity requirements for multi-species assemblages. A number of methods for modelling connectivity have been developed; likewise, different approaches have been used to construct resistance surfaces, the basic input data for connectivity analyses. In this study we modelled connectivity for a multi-species group of vertebrates representative of heavily fragmented forests in north-central Victoria, Australia. For each species, we used least-cost modelling and compared two alternate resistance surfaces, based on species distribution models and on expert opinion, respectively. We integrated the connectivity results across individual species to obtain a multi-species connectivity map for the region. A resistance surface based on expert assessment of the relative use of land-cover classes by the target species was more informative than one based on species distribution models. The former resulted in pathways more strongly aligned with existing patches and strips of native vegetation. In this region, pathways aligned with streams and their associated riparian vegetation have relatively high ecological potential and feasibility to contribute to regional connectivity for the assemblage of forest vertebrates.

TI  - Proposal of new Natura 2000 network boundaries in Spain based on the value of importance for biodiversity and connectivity analysis for its improvement
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The aim of the Natura 2000 Network is to ensure the conservation of habitats and species in their natural areas of distribution. Connectivity is an essential part of this conservation. For this purpose, a value map of importance for biodiversity (V.I.B) was generated proposing 4 levels of protection and overlapped with the Natura 2000 network. New boundaries for the zoning are proposed adding 1.600.000 ha. Two connectivity indices (MSPA and PC) are calculated in the 4 different scenarios. With these indices it is possible to know the number of existing nuclei and connectors in each of the scenarios. New boundaries cover more areas of interest for biodiversity as well as zones of great importance in relation to connectivity. We propose a uniform method that can be extrapolated to any European territory.

TI  - Testing landscape resistance layers and modeling connectivity for wolverines in the western United States
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract In the conterminous United States, wolverines (Gulo gulo) occupy semi-isolated patches of high elevation subalpine habitats at naturally low densities. The long-term success of the wolverine metapopulation requires open space in valley bottoms that link the mountain ranges of the western US to facilitate dispersal. No previous analysis has used empirical data to determine the degree to which dispersing wolverines are sensitive, or not, to differences in habitat quality outside of areas suitable for a home range. This sensitivity is important because it influences conservation actions. Improving wolverine habitat connectivity models among mountain ranges will benefit future wolverine conservation aimed at maintaining gene flow among populations. To determine how to most accurately model wolverine habitat connectivity, we used a resource selection function to model habitat and then generated six circuit theory connectivity maps. Each connectivity map represented a degree of sensitivity to movement within low-quality habitats. We used three validation metrics to compare these different connectivity surfaces and determine which layer best approximated observed wolverine dispersal using relocation data. We found that a strong negative logistic exponential relationship between habitat quality and resistance best described observed wolverine dispersal (c = 8). This suggests that once outside of habitat suitable for a home range, wolverines are only moderately sensitive to changes in habitat quality. However, we found that there is still some lower threshold of dispersal habitat quality for wolverines, as dispersing wolverines follow lower-resistance pathways that connect high-quality habitat and do not move indiscriminately across the landscape. Our results highlight the need to disentangle dispersal data from home range data through validation using dispersal data. Our findings also indicate that the validation of connectivity metrics is an essential component of conservation planning to best support the persistence of species.

TI  - General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM): a new way to map whole of landscape biodiversity functional connectivity for operational planning and reporting
PY  - 2022
AB  - • GLCM was developed to underpin connectivity conservation planning and evaluation • It addresses ecological realism through structure and function aspects of connectivity • Is adaptable to available inputs and operational for large and heterogeneous regions • Transcends reliance on pre-defined path nodes or a single node per ‘patch’ • Uses a novel fractal approach to reduce computational complexity for repeatability Graph-theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities. We developed the new General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM), as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans. GLCM is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology-based measures: Neighbourhood habitat area ( Ni ) and habitat link value ( Li ). Ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross-scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat. The remaining Ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of Ecological Carrying Capacity for wildlife (plants and animals). Li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region (i.e. which is reported as summed Ni across a region) by virtue of providing the ‘least-cost’ linkages between concentrations of habitat. Mapped Li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region's habitat network, highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping-stones, and candidate areas for conservation and restoration. Due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design, GLCM addresses a number of criteria we list as important, while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph-theoretical approaches. We present results for three south-east Australian case-studies using continuous-value ecological condition surfaces as input. However, a simple habitat/non-habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used. GLCM has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales, and broader. It incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes (foraging, dispersal and migration). Successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling-law. This approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data-driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations. The operational advantages of GLCM means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time-series remote sensing of land cover, or applied to alternative scenarios of land use, ecological restoration, climate projections or combinations of these.

TI  - Pooling biodiversity offsets to improve habitat connectivity and species conservation.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land developers can apply biodiversity offsetting in different ways, from a project-by-project approach to a pooled and proactive approach, this latter appearing to provide greater advantages both in terms of implementation and of the No Net Loss objective. Incorporating landscape connectivity into the mitigation hierarchy is commonly recommended, but the benefits of pooling and anticipating offsets have never really been demonstrated from modeling approaches. Here, we compare connectivity gains from two different offsetting scenarios, when interconnections at offset sites are taken and not taken into account. Assuming that gains can be increased by optimizing the location of offsets, we identified sites where biodiversity offsetting generates the greatest ecological gains in habitat connectivity. The method was applied to a study case in the suburbs of Lyon (Southern France) using several representative species and the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. Pooling biodiversity offsets led to additional gains in overall habitat connectivity of +103% on average, which we show can be further improved (+8%) by using a patch addition process available in Graphab to plan spatially and ecologically coherent offsetting areas. Pooling and anticipating biodiversity offsets in this way can help preserve the biodiversity and the functionality of natural environments at the territorial scale.

TI  - Prioritising sites for pollinators in a fragmented coastal nectar habitat network in Western Europe
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation contribute significantly to pollinator decline and biodiversity loss globally. Conserving high quality habitats whilst restoring and connecting remnant habitat is critical to halt such declines. We quantified the connectivity of pollinator habitats for a generic focal species (GFS) which represented three groups of pollinators in an existing coastal nectar habitat network. Subsequently, in partnership with a conservation agency, we modelled an improved landscape that identified priority habitat patches to increase connectivity for pollinators. We selected 4260 pollinator habitats along an 80 km section of coastland in Scotland using Phase 1 habitat data. A GFS represented three vulnerable European pollinator groups while graph theory and spatial metrics were used to identify optimal sites that could enhance habitat connectivity. Higher dispersing species experienced greater habitat connectivity in the improved landscape and habitat availability increased substantially in response to small increases in habitat. The improved landscape revealed important habitat patches in the existing landscape that should be protected and developed. Our findings highlight that optimal landscapes can be designed through the integration of habitat data with spatial metrics for a GFS. By adopting this novel approach, conservation strategies can be targeted in an efficient manner to conserve at-risk species and their associated habitats. Integrating these design principles with policy and practice could enhance biodiversity across Europe.

TI  - Dynamics of landscape pattern and connectivity of wetlands in western Jilin Province, China
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Interconnected River System Network plan as an important target for river health and enhancing water resource utilization was put forward in the new period in China. This study aimed at analyzing and interpreting changes in landscape pattern and connectivity of wetlands in 1950s, 1980s and 2012 in western Jilin Province using FRAGSTATS and conefor software. The results showed that the appropriate grain size of wetlands landscape pattern analysis was 900 m, and the total area, connectance index, aggregation index, patch cohesion index (COHESION) all showed a sharp decrease from 1950s to 2012, while the patch density increased largely. The appropriate distance thresholds of the wetland landscape connectivity were 4000 m for sub-region I and 7000 m for sub-region II, III, IV. The landscape connectivity also decreased significantly from 1950s to 2012, which was especially obvious in sub-region I from 1950s to 1980s and sub-region II from 1980s to 2012. The area and number of important patches for landscape connectivity (dPC > 1) declined significantly from 1950s to 2012. And the restoration of the important patches (dPC > 1) was critical for the wetlands landscape connectivity improvement. The correlation results between landscape pattern metrics and connectivity indexes indicated that PC had a significant positive relationship with COHESION, and dPC had a strong significant positive relationship with AREA, PERIM, while a negative correlation with PAR.

TI  - Habitat Fragmentation, Connectivity Conservation and Related Key-Concepts: Temporal Trends in Their Recurrences on Web of Science (1960–2020)
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>In this work, we analyzed the temporal trends of nine selected key terms used in the habitat fragmentation arena, quantifying their number (and frequency) of recurrence on Web of Science from 1960 to 2020. The most used key (focal) terms (“stepping stones”, “habitat corridors”, “landscape connectivity”), showed a progressive increase from 1981 to 2020, with “landscape connectivity” showing the highest increase in frequency in the last decade (2011–2020). Among the key secondary terms (recurring &lt; 5%), although “corridors”, “continuity”, and “contiguity” showed a slight growth over the decades, “connectivity conservation” showed the most significant increase. This last landscape-related term recently replaced other local-scale concepts (as “stepping stones” and “corridors”) as a consequence of a change of perspective. Conversely, “ecological network planning”, used in landscape planning and less in conservation biology, showed a comparable fewer recurrence. This gap in recurrences could be due to a bias in our research approach, as Web of Science is a search engine that does not intercept grey literature (as plans and reports) drawn up by Public Agencies which rarely appears in scientific journals.</jats:p>

TI  - How do African elephants utilize the landscape during wet season? A habitat connectivity analysis for Sioma Ngwezi landscape in Zambia.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The influence of environmental factors on the distribution and persistence of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) is pertinent to policy makers and managers to formulate balanced plans for different land-use types.The study focuses on movement of elephants and how they utilize foraging areas in Sioma Ngwezi landscape in Zambia by answering the following questions: (1) Which environmental variables and land-cover class predict the movement of elephants during the wet season in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? (2) What is the wet season suitable habitat for elephants in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? (3) What are the major wet season movement corridors for elephants in Sioma Ngwezi landscape?We used GPS telemetry data from the collared elephants to assess habitat connectivity. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and linkage mapper were the tools used to predict habitat suitability, movement corridors, and barriers in the landscape during the wet season.The study identified elevation, land cover, and NDVI as the most important environmental predictors that modify the dispersal of elephants in the landscape during the wet season. Additionally, a total of 36 potential wet season corridors were identified connecting 15 core areas mainly used for foraging and protection from poachers in the landscape. Of these, 24 corridors were highly utilized and are suggested as priority corridors for elephant movement in the landscape.The identified wet season habitats and functional corridors may help to combat elephant poaching by patrolling areas with high relative probability of elephant presence. The findings may also help abate human-elephant conflict such as crop-raiding by managing identified corridors that run into agriculture zones in the game management area.

TI  - Effects of changing ocean temperatures on ecological connectivity among marine protected areas in northern British Columbia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools for safeguarding marine systems, yet they are increasingly impacted by climate change. Connectivity is a fundamental aspect of MPA design and evaluation, but regional patterns of marine ecological connectivity are often not well understood, nor how connectivity patterns may be affected by climate change. Our objective was to assess how ecological connectivity between MPAs may shift with projected ocean temperature changes in the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, and demonstrate a potential approach that can be used in other systems. We conducted a case study with Dungeness Crab (Metacarcinus magister) and Shortspine Thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) using benthic temperature outputs from a regional ocean model for hindcast (1981–2010) and future (2041–2070) periods coupled with species’ environmental preference information. We evaluated MPA exposure to projected temperature changes and suitability for the adult stage of the focal species. Using existing least-cost and circuit theory-based tools more often applied in terrestrial systems, we identified potential linkages between MPAs via adult movement, simulating both optimal and probabilistic paths, then compared MPA interconnectedness between time periods. There was a marked decrease in MPA suitability and interconnectedness for Shortspine Thornyhead under projected future climates, while there was a marked increase in MPA suitability for Dungeness Crab and minor increase in MPA interconnectedness. Given the contrasting results in connectivity changes when examining just two species, this study highlights the challenge of building climate resilience in MPA network designs with multispecies objectives.

TI  - Ecological Security Pattern Construction in Karst Area Based on Ant Algorithm.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Constructing the ecological security pattern is imperative to stabilize ecosystem services and sustainable development coordination of the social economy and ecology. This paper focuses on the Karst region in southeastern Yunnan, which is ecologically fragile. This paper selects the main types of ecosystem services and identifies the ecological source using hot spot analysis for Guangnan County. An inclusive consideration of the regional ecologic conditions and the rocky desertification formation mechanism was made. The resistance factor index system was developed to generate the basic resistance surface modified by the ecological sensitivity index. The Ant algorithm and Kernel density analysis were used to determine ecological corridor range and ecological restoration points that constructed the ecological security pattern of Guangnan County. The results demonstrated that, firstly, there were twenty-three sources in Guangnan County, with a total area of 1292.77 km2, accounting for 16.74% of the total. The forests were the chief ecological sources distributed in the non-Karst area, where Bamei Town, Yangliujing Township and Nasa Town had the highest distribution. Secondly, the revised resistance value is similar to “Zhe (Zhetu Township)-Lian (Liancheng Town)-Yang (Yangliujing Township)-Ban (Bambang Township)”. The values were lower in the north and higher in the south, which is consistent with the regional distribution of Karst. Thirdly, the constructed ecological security pattern of the “Source-Corridor-Ecological restoration point” paradigm had twenty-three ecological corridors. The chief ecological and potential corridor areas were 804.95 km2 and 621.2 km2, respectively. There are thirty-eight ecological restoration points mainly distributed in the principal ecological corridors and play a vital role in maintaining the corridor connectivity between sources. The results provide guidance and theoretical basis for the ecological security patterns construction in Karst areas, regional ecologic security protection and sustainable development promotion.

TI  - A method of linking functional and structural connectivity analysis in urban green infrastructure network construction
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Accelerated urbanization and population growth lead to the fragmentation of urban green space and loss of biodiversity. There are few studies on the integration of structural and functional connectivity to solve this problem. Our study aims to draw up a methodology to synthesize two methods of connectivity evaluation, accordingly, to construct an urban green infrastructure (UGI) network which is of great significance to maintain the stability of the urban ecosystem. Taking Beijing as a study area, we first used Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to identify the source patches, then combined with the graph theory-based landscape metrics to discuss the effect of different diffusion distances on the regional landscape connectivity and classify the importance level of the source patches. Finally, we used both least-cost path (LCP) and circuit theory to construct network and identify pinch areas in corridors for network optimization. The results show that (1) the landscape connectivity of the study area is obviously polarized. Source patches in mountain and hilly areas have good ecological bases and large areas, and the density of corridors is relatively high, which makes a large contribution to the overall landscape connectivity; Source patches in plain areas are severely fragmented, and there are only a small number of potential corridors connecting urban areas and suburban areas. (2) The UGI network is composed of 70 source patches and 148 potential corridors. The diffusion distance that is most beneficial to improve landscape connectivity is 20–25 km. (3) 6 pinch areas that are of great significance for improving the connectivity of the landscape present the coexistence of high migration resistance and large optimization potential, and urgently need to be restored first. This study provides a method to combine the structural and the functional analysis to construct a UGI network and formulate more scientifical protection strategies for planning departments.</jats:p>

TI  - Évolution de l’occupation du sol dans les zones humides littorales du Bassin méditerranéen de 1975 à 2005
PY  - 2015
AB  - Les zones humides mediterraneennes dans leur ensemble, ecosystemes de haute valeur pour la biodiversite, ont perdu environ 50 % de leur superficie au cours du xxe siecle. Par ailleurs, le littoral mediterraneen est soumis a de fortes pressions dues a l’urbanisation, au tourisme mais aussi au developpement d’infrastructures industrielles et de transport. Il y a donc dans les zones humides littorales mediterraneennes une convergence d’enjeux ecologiques, sociaux et economiques. L’evolution de l’occupation du sol a ete caracterisee dans 214 d’entre elles entre 1975 et 2005. En leur sein, la superficie des habitats humides naturels a diminue de 10 % en 30 ans, soit une perte de 1329 km². A l’inverse, les habitats humides d’origine anthropique ont augmente de 105 %, c’est‑a‑dire un gain de 854 km². Pendant cette periode, la principale pression directe sur les habitats humides naturels a ete l’agriculture puisque 71 % des habitats humides perdus l’ont ete au profit des milieux agricoles. L’urbanisation a eu un impact direct moindre mais elle a entraine la conversion des terres agricoles periurbaines, qui se sont reportees vers les habitats naturels peripheriques.

TI  - Connectivity between coastal lagoons and sea: Asymmetrical effects on assemblages' and populations' structure
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Connectivity among marine populations plays a fundamental role in the dynamic of metapopulations and communities. Moreover, genetic connectivity is important for the evolutionary history and adaptive capability of species while demographic connectivity is essential to maintain ecological processes. In coastal lagoons, isolation degree or confinement is considered the main factor structuring biological assemblages. These environments also function as nursery areas for many marine species that colonize the lagoons as larvae or juveniles, returning to the sea for reproduction. It is therefore essential to know the connectivity between lagoons and sea for the management of biodiversity and the exploitation of coastal living resources. This work anases the role that connectivity between coastal lagoons and sea plays in the assemblages and subpopulations structure of the first. To this purpose, a finite element hydrodynamic model was used coupled with a lagrangian module to simulate the potential exchange of organisms between Mar Menor lagoon (Western Mediterranean) and the adjacent sea. Connectivity parameters from 40 stations, located inside and outside the Mar Menor, have been estimated. The outcomes of the eight simulations carried out were compared with field data, including ichthyoplankton species composition and genetic fluxes in 6 species with different life stories. The results suggest that pelagic larval phases are longer than expected or the species can extend PLD within certain limits if the conditions for the settlement are not adequate. Repetition can improve the chance of self-recruitment, coupling larval duration, competency period and finding the adequate location for settlement. The results also show that connectivity between all lagoon and Mediterranean stations is very low and is independent of geographical distance. There is a strong asymmetry in the probability of receiving particles, being lower the probability of colonization of the lagoon stations from the sea than vice versa. Despite its low values, connectivity can explain up to 65% of the similarities in species composition of the ichthyoplankton and between 30 and 96% of the variance in genetic differentiation of the studied species. The low value of connectivity and colonization rates is enough, however, to maintain the genetic fluxes between populations and, at the same time, restricted connectivity can play an important role in maintaining high diversity and heterogeneous assemblage structure.

TI  - Identifying priority areas for landscape connectivity for three large carnivores in northwestern Mexico and southwestern United States
PY  - 2021
AB  - Large carnivores are crucial to ecosystem functioning, as they enhance the biodiversity of the native communities in which they live. However, most large carnivores are threatened with extinction resulting from human persecution, habitat encroachment, and the loss of habitat connectivity. To identify areas that favor landscape connectivity for three large carnivores within and between northwestern Mexico and southwestern United States. We performed a habitat suitability analysis for puma (Puma concolor), Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi), and black bear (Ursus americanus) by combining ecological niche modeling with anthropogenic variables to identify high-quality habitat patches to be connected. We also developed a connectivity analysis to identify smaller suitable habitat patches within connecting corridors to evaluate their contributions to connecting larger populations. We found existing large, high-quality areas in Mexico and the United States that could connect through smaller patches. Likewise, we identified pinch-point areas, patches and links with high centrality, indicating that some biological corridors promote connectivity among the most extensive suitable patches. It is possible to maintain and even enhance adequate landscape connectivity between major suitable habitat patches for the three large carnivores, within and between their distributional areas in Mexico and the United States. In this regard, decision-makers, academia, and civil society need to strengthen their bonds to reduce the pressure on these carnivores and help authorities improve binational plans and agreements to consolidate conservation actions and landscape connectivity between Mexico and the United States.

TI  - Missing interactions: the current state of multispecies connectivity analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Designing effective habitat and protected area networks, which sustain species-rich communities is a critical conservation challenge. Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of new computational methods for analyzing and prioritizing the connectivity needs of multiple species. We argue that the goal of multispecies connectivity prioritizations be the <jats:italic>long-term persistence of a set of species</jats:italic> in a landscape and suggest the index of metapopulation capacity as one metric by which to assess and compare the effectiveness of proposed network designs. Here we present a review of the literature based on 77 papers published between 2010 and 2020, in which we assess the current state and recent advances in multispecies connectivity analysis in terrestrial ecosystems. We summarize the four most employed analytical methods, compare their data requirements, and provide an overview of studies comparing results from multiple methods. We explicitly look at approaches for integrating multiple species considerations into reserve design and identify novel approaches being developed to overcome computational and theoretical challenges posed by multispecies connectivity analyses. We conclude that, while advances have been made over the past decade, the field remains nascent in its ability to integrate multiple species interactions into analytical approaches to connectivity. Furthermore, the field is hampered in its ability to provide robust connectivity assessments for lack of a clear definition and goal for multispecies connectivity, as well as a lack of common metrics for their comparison.</jats:p>

TI  - Single-species and multiple-species connectivity models for large mammals on the Navajo Nation
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract. Estimation of connectivity for multiple species could increase the efficiency of resource management and elucidate trade-offs among maintenance of connectivity for different taxa. We identified potential areas of high connectivity for 5 species of mammals on the Navajo Nation and adjacent lands in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, USA: mountain lion (Puma concolor), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), American black bear (Ursus americanus), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). These species were identified by the Navajo Nation as relevant to the benefit of their present and future generations. We used telemetry data to calculate utilization distributions, derive model permeability (the probability that a given location facilitates animal movement), and assess connectivity (the realization of permeability across a landscape) for desert bighorn sheep, black bear, and pronghorn. We based models of connectivity for mountain lion and mule deer on expert-ide...

TI  - Circuitscape in Julia: Empowering Dynamic Approaches to Connectivity Assessment
PY  - 2021
AB  - The conservation field is experiencing a rapid increase in the amount, variety, and quality of spatial data that can help us understand species movement and landscape connectivity patterns. As interest grows in more dynamic representations of movement potential, modelers are often limited by the capacity of their analytic tools to handle these datasets. Technology developments in software and high-performance computing are rapidly emerging in many fields, but uptake within conservation may lag, as our tools or our choice of computing language can constrain our ability to keep pace. We recently updated Circuitscape, a widely used connectivity analysis tool developed by Brad McRae and Viral Shah, by implementing it in Julia, a high-performance computing language. In this initial re-code (Circuitscape 5.0) and later updates, we improved computational efficiency and parallelism, achieving major speed improvements, and enabling assessments across larger extents or with higher resolution data. Here, we reflect on the benefits to conservation of strengthening collaborations with computer scientists, and extract examples from a collection of 572 Circuitscape applications to illustrate how through a decade of repeated investment in the software, applications have been many, varied, and increasingly dynamic. Beyond empowering continued innovations in dynamic connectivity, we expect that faster run times will play an important role in facilitating co-production of connectivity assessments with stakeholders, increasing the likelihood that connectivity science will be incorporated in land use decisions.

TI  - Construction of an Ecological Security Pattern and the Evaluation of Corridor Priority Based on ESV and the "Importance–Connectivity" Index: A Case Study of Sichuan Province, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Constructing an ecological security pattern (ESP) is an important means to describe, manage, and control ecological security. However, there are few related studies on functional analyses and evaluations of landscape elements, and the distribution of identified elements cannot fully reflect reality. To accurately depict ecological security and strengthen the role of landscape planning for policy formulation, we used the spatial distribution patterns of ecosystem services to adjust the ecosystem service value to accurately identify the distribution of ecological sources. The gravity model and Centrality Mapper tool are used to build an “importance–connectivity” index that evaluates the importance of ecological corridors in linking the sources and the contribution to maintaining the overall connectivity of ecological networks. The results show that (1) spatial heterogeneity exists in seven kinds of ecosystem services in Sichuan Province, China, and the high-level areas are concentrated in the central region. Moreover, (2) a total of 179 ecological sources and 445 ecological corridors with woodland and grassland as the main land use types are identified, and (3) a total of 153, 49, 78, and 165 corridors are divided into high importance–high connectivity, low importance–high connectivity, high importance–low connectivity, and low importance–low connectivity ecological corridors, respectively. The study provides a new framework for the construction of an ESP and for the priority evaluation of ecological corridors. To achieve balance between economic development and environmental protection, priority should be given to the protection of high-priority corridors when maintaining ecological security.</jats:p>

TI  - Assessment of playa wetland network connectivity for amphibians of the south-central Great Plains (USA) using graph-theoretical, least-cost path, and landscape resistance modelling
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land-cover changes are likely affecting structural and functional connectivity for wetland-associated wildlife among the > 80,000 playa of the Great Plains (USA). We investigated how patterns of land cover from 2008 to 2016 affected structural and functional connectivity among playas under biologically feasible scenarios and a range of vagilities for amphibians. We compared graph-theoretical, least-cost path (LCP), and landscape resistance models. Using land-cover and irrigation data and literature-based estimates of species-specific dispersal, we developed three alternative scenarios with resistance values that differed by land-cover type. Sensitivity analysis examined effects of altering the numeric range of values within models. From a structural perspective, the playa network was highly fragmented, with coalescence distances greater than amphibian dispersal capabilities (> 15 km). The network was insensitive to assigning different resistance values to different land-cover types: 81% of LCP locations overlapped with at least one other modeled scenario, and 57% of LCPs overlapped among all three scenarios. Our findings partially support previous graph-based assessments of playa structural connectivity that indicated high levels of path redundancy within this ecological network. However, although there was extensive path overlap among scenarios, many modelled linkages were at distances well beyond the individual lifetime dispersal maxima for regional amphibians. Thus, functional connectivity would be achieved in this landscape only by spanning scales from daily movements to inter-generational dispersal.

TI  - Predicting burrowing owl flight trajectories in urban environments
PY  - 2021
AB  - It is important to understand how animals respond to changes in landscape structure, especially when considering habitat alteration and urbanization. Using the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) as an ecological model we tested two hypotheses: (1) the landscape of urban areas influences trajectories of the burrowing owl, which responds changing its displacement patterns, and (2) models incorporating species-specific traits, such as stochasticity and landscape perception, better predict flight trajectories than least-cost path models. Thirty owls were captured at the Brasilia International Airport, fitted with VHF transmitters, and released in random locations within 30 km of the airport. We generated a habitat suitability map for use as a resistance raster to model flight trajectories: one model was based on the least-cost path, and four models included stochasticity and variations of the owls’ landscape perception and dependency on natural ecosystems. Observed trajectories were compared with those predicted by models using the following metrics extracted from the trajectories: mean habitat suitability values, sinuosity, and length. The best generalized linear models were selected using the Akaike information criterion. The owls dispersed through areas with a lower cost than expected by chance (z = 104.65, p 0.05), sinuosity (r2 = 0.03, p > 0.05), and length (r2 = 0.37, p > 0.05). Our results demonstrate that landscape information influences flight trajectories, and models incorporating landscape perception and stochasticity better predict burrowing owl flight trajectories.

TI  - Coupling urban 3-D information and circuit theory to advance the development of urban ecological networks.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ongoing, rapid urban growth accompanied by habitat fragmentation and loss challenges biodiversity conservation and leads to decreases in ecosystem services. Application of the concept of ecological networks in the preservation and restoration of connections among isolated patches of natural areas is a powerful conservation strategy. However, previous approaches often failed to objectively consider the impacts of complex 3-D city environments on ecological niches. We used airborne lidar-derived information on the 3-D structure of the built environment and vegetation and detailed land use and cover data to characterize habitat quality, niche diversity, and human disturbance and to predict habitat connectivity among 38 identified habitat core areas (HCAs) in Nanjing, China. We used circuit theory and Linkage Mapper to create a landscape resistance layer, simulate habitat connectivity, and identify and prioritize important corridors. We mapped 64 links by using current flow centrality to evaluate each HCA's contribution and the links that facilitate intact connectivity. Values were highest for HCA links located in the west, south, and northeast of the study area, where natural forests with complex 3-D structures predominate. Two smaller HCA areas had high centrality scores relative to their extents, which means they could act as important stepping stones in connectivity planning. The mapped pinch-point regions had narrow and fragile links among the HCAs, suggesting they require special protection. The barriers with the highest impact scores were mainly located at the HCA connections to Purple Mountain and, based on these high scores, are more likely to indicate important locations that can be restored to improve potential connections. Our novel framework allowed us to sufficiently convey spatially explicit information to identify targets for habitat restoration and potential pathways for species movement and dispersal. Such information is critical for assessing existing or potential habitats and corridors and developing strategic plans to balance habitat conservation and other land uses based on scientifically informed connectivity planning and implementation.

TI  - Potentially suitable habitat, connectivity and priority conservation areas for White-breasted waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus) and Bronze-winged jacana (Metopidius indicus)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Wetlands, like East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) in present study, are vulnerable to habitat alteration and other anthropogenic threats affecting avifauna. Consequently, prioritizing avifaunal conservation based on suitable habitats and their connectivity is essential. White-breasted waterhen (WBW, Amaurornis phoenicurus) and bronze-winged jacana (BWJ, Metopidius indicus) are two resident birds of EKW. We used MaxEnt for habitat suitability maps; assessed habitat connectivity in Circuitscape and mapped top 10% conservation priority areas in Zonation softwares. Both species had similar niche breadth and high niche overlap. The high suitability and moderate suitability areas for WBW was 0.02 km2 and 13.06 km2 respectively, while high suitability area for BWJ was absent and moderate suitability areas covered 6.73 km2. But, these suitable habitats mostly showed low and least connectivity. Finally, we found banks and dikes of wetlands, small vegetations therein and cropfields are important land-use classes in their projected suitable habitats and also in top 10% conservation priority areas. Use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the cropfields and clearing of bushes on the banks and dikes, as well as, the floating and emergent macrophytes in waterbodies with intensive commercial pisciculture are recorded as potential anthropogenic threats. Also ~80% of this top 10% conservation priority area are prone to moderate to high habitat transformation. Protection of remaining suitable habitats and their connectivity identified in this study, as well as, restoration of degraded habitats, and reduction of threats will ensure the conservation of WBW and BWJ in EKW and also in other wetlands in human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - Climate change, habitat connectivity, and conservation gaps: a case study of four ungulate species endemic to the Tibetan Plateau
PY  - 2021
AB  - Habitat connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of species, but is commonly disregarded in climate change impact studies. The Tibetan Plateau contains a biome rich in endemic ungulates, which are highly sensitive to climatic variations and deserve particular attention in conservation planning against climate change. We evaluated the response and vulnerability of habitat connectivity to climate change for four ungulate species endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, and examined the robustness of protected areas (PAs) for the conservation of these species under climate change. For each focal species, we developed ecological niche models to predict the spatial variations in habitat under climate change and conducted a network-theoretical analysis to estimate the consequent changes in habitat connectivity. Moreover, we used the circuit theory to characterize dispersal patterns of these species and conducted gap analyses to estimate the contribution of existing PAs to the conservation of these species. The four focal species will experience a remarkable connectivity loss that outpaced their habitat loss in response to climate change. Currently, 53.39 and 46.64% of the areas that could contribute to the habitat suitability and connectivity, respectively, of these species are unprotected. These values could further increase under future climate conditions. Climate-driven habitat variations may lead to the loss of key connectivity areas between the habitats of ungulates, causing disproportionate decrease in habitat connectivity. The existing PAs on the Tibetan Plateau are not robust for the conservation of the four ungulates. Adjustment of certain key PAs may help to address the conservation gaps.

TI  - Dispersal-based species pools as sources of connectivity area mismatches
PY  - 2021
AB  - Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity enhance robustness of large multi-species ecosystems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Understanding ecosystem stability and functioning is a long-standing goal in theoretical ecology, with one of the main tools being dynamical modelling of species abundances. With the help of dynamical population models limits to stability and regions of various ecosystem dynamics have been extensively mapped in terms of diversity (number of species), types of interactions, interaction strengths, varying interaction networks (for example plant-pollinator, food-web) and varying structures of these networks. Although it is apparent that ecosystems reside in and are affected by a spatial environment, local differences (spatial heterogeneity) is often excluded from studies mapping stability boundaries under the assumption of an average and equal amount of interaction for all individuals of a species. Here we show that extending the classic dynamical Generalised-Lotka-Volterra model into a connected space the boundaries of stability change. When viewing the ecosystem as a spatially heterogeneous whole, limits previously marking the end of stability can now be crossed without any remarkable change in species abundances and without loss of stability. Thus limits previously thought to mark catastrophic transitions are not critical due to the possibility of spatial heterogeneity within the system. In addition, we show that too much spatial fragmentation of ecosystem habitats acts destabilising and leads back to the stability boundaries found in spatially homogeneous ecosystems with average interactions. Thus, we conclude that spatially heterogeneous but connected systems are the most robust. In terms of ecosystem management, the risk of collapse or irreversible changes is lower in spatially heterogeneous systems, which real ecosystems are, and we should expect local changes in populations well in advance of system collapse. Although, too much fragmentation of an ecosystem’s available space can lead to a less robust system with higher risk of extinctions and collapse. Author summary One of the major challenges facing humanity is the fragmentation of wildlife habitats and decline in biodiversity due to human need for resources and land-use practices. We need to find ways to combine human prosperity with biodiversity conservation. To achieve this a solid understanding of ecosystem stability and functioning is paramount. One way to gain such insight is to find limits when we expect species to go extinct or ecosystems to collapse by simulations of interacting species populations. Many such stability limits have been found theoretically the last decades, but for simplification of modelling, studies often exclude that ecosystems are spread out in space. By doing so, studies assume an average and equal amount of interaction for all individuals of a species. Here, we explicitly include space and thus allow for migration and spatial heterogeneity (local differences) in interactions. When modelling the ecosystem as a spatially heterogeneous whole, limits previously marking extinction or collapse can now be crossed without any remarkable change in species abundances. Thus, natural hindrances to migration improve ecosystem robustness and limits previously thought to mark catastrophic transitions are not critical due to the possibility of spatial heterogeneity within the system. In addition, we reconfirm that a large amount of fragmentation acts destabilising for an ecosystem. Thus, we conclude that the most robust ecosystems are spatially heterogeneous but connected.

TI  - Complex effects of landscape, habitat and reservoir operation on riparian vegetation across multiple scales in a human-dominated landscape
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Riparian ecosystems associated with dam reservoirs, are subjected to a wide variety of stressors that alter their plant community composition and diversity patterns and affect riparian ecosystem services delivery. To enhance riverine and regional ecosystem management, the different influences of dam-induced environmental change and anthropogenic factors within and around the reservoir need to be understood across multiple scales. To elucidate the relative importance of these factors, this study examines riparian vegetation composition and structure along the Three Gorges Reservoir (China) and their responses to surrounding landscapes, habitat quality and reservoir management (three groups of influences). We recorded vegetation data in 5 × 1 m quadrats embedded in three stratified elevational zones 145–155 m, 155–165 m, and 165–175 m. Correspondence analyses were used to partition the contribution of various influences in explaining vegetation patterns at three organisational scales: site, community and individual species. Vascular plants totaled 150 species in 130 genera from 56 families. Overall, vegetation responses were idiosyncratic across the analysed scales. At the site-scale, landscape was most important in structuring communities. However, localised habitat and reservoir flooding influences have higher explanatory power at the community-scale, regardless of elevational divergence. Overall, there seem to be a general trend in the importance of variables across all analysed scales. Among the landscape factors, variables based on a landscape gradient model were much more influential than those based on the conventional patch mosaic model. Given the heavily inter-correlated nature of many variables at varying scales of human altered landscapes, the best way forward for reservoir riparian vegetation management strategies is to develop multi-scale, synthetic and location-specific approaches that may optimise conservation efforts.

TI  - Non-production vegetation has a positive effect on ecological processes in agroecosystems
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract An ever-expanding human population, ongoing global climatic changes, and the spread of intensive farming practices is putting increasing pressure on agroecosystems and the inherent biodiversity they contain. Non-production vegetation elements, such as woody patches, riparian margins, and inter-crop and restoration plantings, are vital for conserving biodiversity in agroecosystems and are therefore considered key to sustaining the biotic and abiotic processes underpinning sustainable and resilient agroecosystems. Despite this critical role, there is a surprising lack of synthesis of which types of non-production vegetation elements drive and/or support ecological processes and the mechanisms by which this occurs. Using a systematic, quantitative literature review of 342 articles, we asked: what are the effects of non-production vegetation elements on agroecosystem processes and how are these processes measured within global agroecosystems? Our literature search focussed on the effects of non-production vegetation related to faunal, weed, disease, and abiotic processes. The majority (61%) of studies showed positive effects on ecological processes: non-production vegetation increased the presence, level or rate of the studied process. However, rather than directly measuring ecosystem processes, 83% of studies inferred processes using proxies for ecosystem function, such as biodiversity and soil physicochemical properties. Studies that directly measured non-production vegetation effects focussed on a limited number of vegetation effects including comparisons of vegetation types, farm-scale configuration, and proximity to vegetation. Moreover, studies directly measuring ecosystem processes were similarly limited, dominated by invertebrate biocontrol, predator and natural enemy spillover, animal movement, and ecosystem cycling. We identify research gaps and present a pathway for future research in understanding the ecosystem components and processes that build resilient, sustainable agroecosystems.

TI  - Landscape connectivity modeling from the perspective of animal dispersal
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dispersal plays a key role in linking populations, habitat (re)-colonization, and species range expansion. As fragmentation and habitat loss are ubiquitous threats and can disrupt dispersal, landscape connectivity modeling has become a valuable tool in conservation planning. We provide an overview of how current connectivity modeling has incorporated the different aspects of animal dispersal. We describe the most popular connectivity models and highlight their main assumptions related to dispersal, suggesting a series of questions that could clarify the advantages and disadvantages of using a particular approach. We review the structure of the connectivity models based on least-cost analysis, circuit theory, and the individual-based dispersal models. We use some studies as case examples to discuss how important elements of animal dispersal were considered through models to predict movement routes. Ongoing developments in connectivity modeling have made it possible to represent animal dispersal in a more realistic way by implementing key elements such as dispersal behaviors, mortality, and inter-individual variability. However, the potential to consider such elements and how this is done in connectivity modeling depends on the selected approach, since each model represents animal dispersal through a different perspective. We recommend that the choice of a connectivity model should be made after considering the study objectives, the species dispersal mechanism, and the prior knowledge available about it. By understanding and incorporating dispersal behavior into connectivity modeling, we can improve our capacity to generate useful information aimed to construct more effective conservation strategies.

TI  - Human-modified landscape acts as refuge for mammals in Atlantic Forest
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract: Human-modified landscapes (HMLs) are composed by small, isolated and defaunated forest fragments, which are surrounded by agricultural and urban areas. Information on species that thrives in these HMLs is essential to direct conservation strategies in local and regional scales. Since HMLs are dominant in the Atlantic Forest, we aimed to assess the mammalian diversity in a HML in southeastern Brazil and to propose conservation strategies. We collected data of terrestrial (small-, medium- and large-sized) and volant mammals in three small forest fragments (10, 14 and 26 ha) and adjacent areas, between 2003 and 2016, using complementary methods: active search, camera trapping, live-traps, mist nets and occasional records (i.e., roadkills). In addition, we used secondary data to complement our species list. We recorded 35 native mammal species (6 small-sized, 16 medium- and large-sized, and 13 bats) and seven exotic species in the HML. The recorded mammal assemblage (non-volant and volant), although mainly composed of common and generalist species, includes three medium- and large-sized species nationally threatened (Leopardus guttulus, Puma concolor and Puma yagouaroundi) and two data deficient species (Galictis cuja and Histiotus velatus), highlighting the importance of this HML for the maintenance and conservation of mammal populations. Despite highly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, the study area harbors a significant richness of medium- and large-sized mammals, being an important biodiversity refuge in the region. However, this biodiversity is threatened by the low quality of the habitats, roadkills and abundant populations of domestic cats and dogs. Therefore, we stress the need of conservation strategies focusing on the medium- and large-sized mammals as an umbrella group, which could benefit all biodiversity in the landscape. We recommend actions that promotes biological restoration, aiming to increase structural composition and connectivity of the forest fragments, reducing roadkills and controlling the domestic cats and dogs' populations, in order to maintain and improve the diversity of mammals in long-term.

TI  - Mineral lick distribution modeling and NW Amazon conservation planning alternatives
PY  - 2021
AB  - Mineral licks are faunal attractors, whose distribution determines the structure and composition of Amazonian landscapes and the way they are used by wildlife and traditional communities. Research on the distribution of mineral licks is scarce, limiting the possibility of using them in conservation beyond local scales. Using the species distribution modeling framework, we predicted the distribution of suitable conditions for mineral licks in the Northwest Amazon, compiling localities from academic and traditional sources and using environmental variables associated with geology, geomorphology, edaphology, topography, and hydrology. Best models, selected according to evaluation metrics incorporated in the ENMeval “R” package, showed to be robust and predict sectors with different areas, but similar distributions. Suitable areas covered up to 14.6% of the study area and confirmed the association of mineral licks with the drainage system. The erosive capacities of the rivers and their roles in terms of sediment deposition allowed the generation of ideal conditions for the expression of mineral licks in past and present riparian zones. Closeness to salt deposits and the seacoast was also important, giving information about the underground and aboveground mineral availability, crucial aspects for mineral lick formation. Considering the extension and distribution of our predictions, we proposed its use as input for other spatial modeling exercises, for example, as part of a complex resistance matrix to evaluate ecological connectivity or as criteria to prioritize sectors for restoration in the Colombian Amazon, where it is imperative to consolidate functional networks to prevent isolation between the Amazon and Andes regions.

TI  - Enhancing connectivity in agroecosystems: focus on the best existing corridors or on new pathways?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Restoring or establishing corridors between residual forest patches is one of the most adopted strategies for the conservation of animal populations and ecosystem processes in fragmented landscapes. This study aimed to assess whether it is more effective to focus restoration actions on existing corridors or to establish habitats in other strategic areas that can create new dispersal pathways to enhance connectivity. We considered a real agroecosystem in northern Italy, based our analyses on graph-theory and habitat availability metrics, and focused on the Hazel Dormouse as the target species. We compared the connectivity increase resulting from (i) the simulated restoration of existing priority corridors, i.e., those with significant presence of forest but in which restoration actions would still result in considerable connectivity gains, or (ii) the simulated plantation of 30 hedgerows along new priority pathways, i.e., those areas with no current forest cover in which habitat creation would be more beneficial for connectivity. Implementing new priority pathways resulted in substantially larger connectivity gains (+ 38%) than when restoration efforts were concentrated in improving already existing corridors (+ 11%). Establishing hedgerows along new pathways allowed enhancing the complementary and functionality of the full set of landscape corridors and proved more efficient than just strengthening the areas where dispersal flows were already concentrated. We demonstrated the importance of analytical procedures able to compare the effectiveness of different management strategies for enhancing connectivity. Our approach may be applied to multiple species sensitive to fragmentation in other heterogeneous landscapes and geographical contexts.

TI  - Individual-based modeling highlights the importance of mortality and landscape structure in measures of functional connectivity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Functional landscape connectivity is vital for the conservation of wildlife species. Landscape connectivity models often overlook factors such as mortality and asymmetry in landscape resistance that can have a significant impact on functional connectivity. Individual-based models (IBMs) can be used to explore such factors through the implementation of mechanistic dispersal behavior. Furthermore, population-level patterns of animal dispersal and landscape connectivity resulting from the simulation of alternative landscapes or scenarios of animal behavior can be compared. Use an IBM to evaluate the effects of disperser mortality, asymmetrical dispersal due to landscape structure, and land-use change on the functional landscape connectivity between two populations of reintroduced American martens Martes americana. We applied a previously calibrated IBM of marten dispersal to simulate movement between two reintroduced populations in Wisconsin and Michigan, USA. We used machine learning analyses to determine how each factor affected dispersal between populations (connectivity) across five consecutive generations. Functional landscape connectivity between populations was not always correlated with more traditional dispersal metrics, such as dispersal distance. Mortality had the greatest impact on functional connectivity. Land-use change and landscape configuration affected connectivity mostly when mortality was not incorporated into simulations. These experimental factors had a stronger effect on long-distance dispersal between populations than on more local dispersal. Conservation planning for landscape connectivity may benefit from accounting for mortality risks within matrix habitat. The development of individual-based models that incorporate landscape heterogeneity and complex animal behaviors when investigating long-distance dispersal can provide unique and specific insights into both landscape connectivity and wildlife conservation.

Se evidencio gran dinamica en la estructura y composicion del paisaje y una alta heterogeneidad en el 2001, con tendencia a homogenizacion en el 2011. Se detectaron cambios “positivos” de pastos a rastrojos y bosques de 1985 al 2001, mientras que del 2001 al 2011 se evidenciaron perdidas y fragmentacion de bosques. Esta transformacion se relaciona con el abandono de las tierras y el desplazamiento en las decadas de 1980 y 1990, asi como con el posterior retorno y la reactivacion de las actividades economicas en la decada del 2000. Se estimaron unas rutas de conectividad potencial norte-sur entre los bosques de interes, mostrando alta fragmentacion transversal en el paisaje.

TI  - Medium and large mammal conservation in the City of Cape Town: factors influencing species richness in urban nature reserves
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32–8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean ± SD = 7 ± 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

TI  - The role of benthic habitat mapping for science and managers: A multi-design approach in the Southeast Brazilian Shelf after a major man-induced disaster
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Seabed mapping is currently the baseline information for ocean management and conservation, and is an indispensable item within research and Marine Spatial Planning. Here, we use a case study and published data along the southeast Brazilian continental shelf to illustrate the concepts and ideas of potential benthic habitat mapping and the importance of having maps on different scales and the potential for using a multi-design approach. The case analysis presented here uses a regional map and distinct criteria (seabed geodiversity and biodiversity, and potential influence of a tailings plume) to define three areas along the continental shelf to be mapped in a high-resolution, as part of a marine monitoring program. The background of the case study is a tailing dam failure disaster that led to the input of iron ore tailings in the ocean, leading to a major environmental disaster. Three areas were chosen, including: a Marine Protected Area (MPA Costa das Algas), a major fishing ground (the Doce River prodelta/depocenter), and an understudied reef area (Forgotten Reefs). Potential benthic habitat mapping was carried out using acoustic surveys (multibeam echosounder acquiring bathymetry and backscatter) and ground-truthing (sediment samples and seafloor image). Results detailed the potential habitats throughout the three areas, providing primary information for the study of benthic habitats and their distribution. The multi-design approach indicated that although a regional analysis can indicate potential vulnerability as a first assessment approach, high-resolution potential habitat mapping (herein, 20 m or finer) is beneficial to evaluate and produce a higher-confidence level for decision-makers. Having an overall view of what and where to collect new and finer data would be best to identify vulnerable areas that, in this case study, could be threatened by plume dispersion and tailings accumulation. Our results support the delineation of priority areas aiming for monitoring, protection and guiding for other studies, besides the consolidation of habitat importance and the integration of various datasets through a hierarchical classification scheme. Although Brazil has never produced a regional or national habitat map for the entire continental margin, there are already conditions to plan, execute and maintain a habitat mapping program, partnering with Universities, Government Institutions (e.g., the Brazilian Navy), and the private sector. In the context of the UN Decade of Ocean Science targets, it is urgent to plan and implement a national database capable of supporting a habitat classification effort on a broader national scale, with the flexibility to support a multi-design or a multi-scale approach.</jats:p>

TI  - Geospatial Applications in Wildlife Conservation and Management
PY  - 2022
AB  - AbstractWildlife, which is one of the integral parts of our ecosystem, nowadays facing a severe threat from anthropogenic actions, like forest obliteration, wildlife poaching and trade, introduction of invasive species, pest and diseases, etc. Moreover, the anthropogenic influence on the Earth’s environment and climate is altering the nature of wildlife habitats and which in turn is accelerating the process of wildlife extinction in a faster way. Advancement in geospatial technology gives conservationists the benefit to improved understanding of the wildlife, their habitats, and the danger that they are facing, in a scientific way to simplify the process of planning, implementing, and tracking wildlife for conservation and management activities. This chapter provides an appraisal of various geospatial technologies in wildlife conservation and management that can be utilized effectively. One of the major applications of geospatial technology in wildlife management is habitat assessment. Wildlife habitat can be assessed for risk assessment, suitability assessment, habitat utilization pattern, and habitat restoration program or protecting threatened habitats. Bio-logging or bio-telemetry, one of the geospatial technologies, provides meaningful information about the movement ecology of individual species which can be used to understand the behavioral pattern of wildlife in relation to its environment. Another use of geospatial technology is the assessment of home ranges, territories, corridors, and connectivity metrics with the aid of bio-telemetry/camera traps/pug marks/visual observations. Assessment of human–wildlife conflicts for conflicts mitigation efforts is yet another application that offers a wide variety of solutions to the managers to mitigate conflicts. Nowadays geospatial technology is being used for wildlife census, wildlife crime investigation, and Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) of protected areas. This chapter briefly explains the methodologies and utilities of various applications mentioned above with some examples to demonstrate the utility of geospatial technology for wildlife conservation and management.KeywordsWildlifeGeospatial technologyMovement ecologyHome rangeTerritory analysisCorridorsHabitat suitability assessmentHabitat risk assessmentHabitat utilization patternWildlife censusHuman–wildlife conflicts

TI  - Habitat ecology of Nearctic–Neotropical migratory landbirds on the nonbreeding grounds
PY  - 2020
AB  - Of the approximately 716 bird species that breed in North America, 386 (54%) are considered Nearctic–Neotropical migrants by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic–Neotropical migrants normally spend 6–8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic–Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how “carry-over effects” arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. In recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch.LAY SUMMARYMore than half of the bird species that breed in North America, representing billions of birds, migrate to the Neotropics.In the past 50 years, scores of these species have declined dramatically.Migratory birds normally spend 6–8 months in tropical habitats, making the conservation of these species an international challenge. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available.Accelerating climate change is adding to the urgency of our gaining an understanding of the full annual and migratory cycle of these birds.In recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations.

TI  - Effectiveness of corridors varies among phytosociological plant groups and dispersal syndromes.
PY  - 2018
AB  - In agricultural landscapes, semi-natural habitats are scarce and remaining habitat patches are largely isolated. However, linear landscape elements might facilitate dispersal of plant species through the agricultural landscape matrix. We investigated the following research questions: 1. are open linear landscape elements (LLE) effective corridors for dispersal of vascular plant species? 2. Which plant species, with respect to phytosociological group and dispersal-distance class, do use LLE as corridors? 3. To which extent is floristic similarity of communities influenced by dispersal through corridors? Field work was carried out in agricultural landscapes of Northwest Germany. We sampled 50 vegetation releves on open linear landscape elements i.e. field margins (incl. road verges) and ditches, in eight 1-km2 study areas. Then, we calculated Jaccard similarities of all plot pairs within study areas using either all species or only species of certain phytosociological groups or dispersal-distance classes. We assessed the isolation of the plots from each other using both Euclidean distance and resistance distance along LLE. Resistance distance reflected the degree of connectivity of the LLE network between the plots. A stronger effect on Jaccard similarity of resistance distance compared to Euclidean distance would indicate corridor dispersal of plants through LLE. Relationships between Jaccard similarity and the two isolation measures were analysed with Generalised Linear Mixed Models. Resistance distance of LLE had a stronger negative effect on Jaccard similarity than Euclidean distance in field margins, but not in ditches. This was found for species of ‘meadows and pastures’ and short to medium dispersal distance. In plot pairs that were highly connected by LLE, the models suggested that roughly 20% of all species occurred in both plots due to dispersal through LLE. Other species groups did not respond more strongly to resistance distance than to Euclidean distance. We conclude that linear landscape elements in agricultural landscapes are effective corridors for dispersal of plant species that are confined to semi-natural habitats, such as traditional grasslands, and lack mechanisms of long-distance dispersal.

TI  - Conservation planning with spatially explicit models: a case for horseshoe bats in complex mountain landscapes
PY  - 2017
AB  - Context Bats are considered as an ecological indicator of habitat quality due to their sensitivity to human-induced ecosystem changes. Hence, we will focus the study on two indicator species of bats as a proxy to evaluate structure and composition of the landscape to analyze anthropic pressures driving changes in patterns. This study develops a spatially-explicit model to highlight key habitat nodes and corridors which are integral for maintaining functional landscape connectivity for bat movement. We focus on a complex mountain landscape and two bat species: greater (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) horseshoe bats which are known to be sensitive to landscape composition and configuration. Species distribution models are used to delineate high-quality foraging habitat for each species using opportunistic ultrasonic bat data. We then performed connectivity analysis combining (modelled) suitable foraging habitat and (known) roost sites. We use graph-theory and the deviation in the probability of connectivity to quantify resilience of the landscape connectivity to perturbations. Both species were confined to lowlands (<1000 m elevation) and avoided areas with high road densities. Greater horseshoe bats were more generalist than lesser horseshoe bats which tended to be associated with broadleaved and mixed forests. The spatially-explicit models obtained were proven crucial for prioritizing foraging habitats, roost sites and key corridors for conservation. Hence, our results are being used by key stakeholders to help integrate conservation measures into forest management and conservation planning at the regional level. The approach used can be integrated into conservation initiatives elsewhere.

TI  - Right on track? Performance of satellite telemetry in terrestrial wildlife research
PY  - 2019
AB  - Satellite telemetry is an increasingly utilized technology in wildlife research, and current devices can track individual animal movements at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. However, as we enter the golden age of satellite telemetry, we need an in-depth understanding of the main technological, species-specific and environmental factors that determine the success and failure of satellite tracking devices across species and habitats. Here, we assess the relative influence of such factors on the ability of satellite telemetry units to provide the expected amount and quality of data by analyzing data from over 3,000 devices deployed on 62 terrestrial species in 167 projects worldwide. We evaluate the success rate in obtaining GPS fixes as well as in transferring these fixes to the user and we evaluate failure rates. Average fix success and data transfer rates were high and were generally better predicted by species and unit characteristics, while environmental characteristics influenced the variability of performance. However, 48% of the unit deployments ended prematurely, half of them due to technical failure. Nonetheless, this study shows that the performance of satellite telemetry applications has shown improvements over time, and based on our findings, we provide further recommendations for both users and manufacturers.

TI  - Identification of ecological networks for land-use planning with spatial conservation prioritization
PY  - 2019
AB  - Spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) has most often been applied to the design of reserve network expansion. In addition to occurrences of species and habitats inside protected area candidate sites, one may also be interested about network-level connectivity considerations. We applied SCP to the identification of ecological networks to inform the development of a new regional plan for the region of Uusimaa (South-Finland, including the Finnish capital district). Input data were 59 high-quality layers of biotope and species distribution data. We identified ecological networks based on a combination of a Zonation balanced priority ranking map and a weighted range size rarity map, to account for both relative and absolute conservation values in the process. We also identified ecological corridors between protected areas and other ecologically high-priority areas using the corridor retention method of Zonation. Furthermore, we identified candidate sites for habitat restoration. We found seven large ecological networks (132–1201 km2) which stand out from their surrounding landscape in terms of ecological value and have clear connectivity bottlenecks between them. Highest restoration needs were found between large high-priority sites that are connected via remnant habitat fragments in comparatively highly modified areas. Land conversion should be avoided in areas of highest ecological priorities and network-level connectivity. Restoration should be considered for connectivity bottlenecks. Methods described here can be applied in any location where relevant spatial data are available. The present results are actively used by the regional council and municipalities in the region of Uusimaa.

TI  - Characterizing the landscape compositions of urban wildlife encounters: the case of the stone marten (Martes foina), the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) in the Greater Paris area
PY  - 2021
AB  - As urbanization continues to expand worldwide, more and more urban areas become home to wild animals able to adapt to city life, generating a growing need for information. In the Greater Paris area, the existence of three wild mammals (the stone marten, Martes foina, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes and the hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus) is attested. However, little is known regarding their presence. The research reported in this study aims to shed light upon their co-existence with city dwellers. Specifically, the areas where contacts between these species and the inhabitants are the most likely are studied. Gaining insight on the distribution of such areas allows for those in charge of wildlife-related issues to target where management measures may be needed the most, whether they concern biodiversity promotion initiatives or conflict mitigation actions. In this paper, we investigate the landscape compositions in which these encounters have been the most frequent using presence records. To do so, we analyzed the land use types within buffers set around contact points and applied statistical operations (correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering) on the obtained results. Results show that while some landscape compositions attract all three species (namely areas where greenery is prevailing), others were only favored by one or two of the species.

TI  - Ecological connectivity in the three-dimensional urban green volume using waveform airborne lidar
PY  - 2017
AB  - The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services.

TI  - Environmental impact assessment of development projects improved by merging species distribution and habitat connectivity modelling
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is performed to limit potential impacts of development projects on species and ecosystem functions. However, the methods related to EIA actually pay little attention to the landscape-scale effects of development projects on biodiversity. In this study we proposed a methodological framework to more properly address the landscape-scale impacts of a new stadium project in Lyon (France) on two representative mammal species exemplary for the endemic fauna, the red squirrel and the Eurasian badger. Our approach combined species distribution model using Maxent and landscape functional connectivity model using Graphab at two spatial scales to assess habitat connectivity before and after development project implementation. The development project had a negative impact on landscape connectivity: overall habitat connectivity (PC index) decreased by −6.8% and −1.8% and the number of graph components increased by +60.0% and +17.6% for the red squirrel and the European badger respectively, because some links that formerly connected habitat patches were cut by the development project. Changes affecting landscape structure and composition emphasized the need to implement appropriate avoidance and reduction measures. Our methodology provides a useful tool both for EIA studies at each step of the way to support decision-making in landscape conservation planning. The method could be also developed in the design phase to compare the effectiveness of different avoidance or mitigation measures and resize them if necessary to maximize habitat connectivity.

TI  - A prioritization metric and modelling framework for fragmented saltmarsh patches restoration
PY  - 2021
AB  - Saltmarsh is a coastal ecosystem providing crucial ecosystem services, and its continued degradation and fragmentation has drawn increasing attention. However, how to effectively restore the connectivity between fragmented saltmarsh patches remains an open challenge. In this study, we developed a metric and modelling framework that prioritised saltmarsh patches for restoration. To demonstrate our approach, we simulated spatially explicit restoration schedules for Suaeda salsa patches at the Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve, China, using three strategies: increasing-patch-area, increasing-number-of-patches and a benchmark unrestrictive prioritization strategy. We prioritised patches for restoration based on a number of widely used graph-theoretic landscape connectivity and metapopulation capacity metrics. Our simulation results suggested the rank connectivity-importance of extant patches was correlated within the group of graph-theoretic connectivity metrics or metapopulation capacity metrics, but unrelated across group. The unrestrictive prioritization strategy clearly outperformed the strategies of increasing-patch-area and increasing-number-of-patches which returned comparable connectivity restoration outcomes. For the more effective unrestrictive prioritization strategy, there were substantial differences in the simulated priority patches between metrics that considered stepping stone effects and those did not. While the former resulted in corridor-building priority patches that led to a more connected landscape throughout the region, the latter led to local clustering. We recommend use of the total probability of connectivity (PC) among the metrics we tested due to similarity of results to other metrics and its simulation efficiency. The proposed framework is readily applicable to prioritise areas for connectivity conservation and restoration in any monospecific ecosystem at the regional scale.

TI  - Better providers of habitat for Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus E. Geoffroy 1812): A species distribution modeling approach in Central Java, Indonesia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract. Sodik M, Pudyatmoko S, Yuwono PSH, Tafrichan M, Imron MA. 2020. Better providers of habitat for Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus E. Geoffroy 1812): A species distribution modeling approach in Central Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 1890-1900. The Javan slow loris is an arboreal and nocturnal primate endemic to Java, which is known to inhabit primary and secondary forest habitats, such as swamps, plantations, and bamboo forest. The population of the Javan slow loris continues to decline significantly due to forest degradation, habitat loss/fragmentation, and illegal trade. Conservation of this small primate in Java has been hampered by a paucity of local data on how conservation areas support this species. This study aims to build a spatial distribution model of the Javan slow loris and analyzing the role of each stakeholder plays on land use type to support the conservation of N. javanicus. By utilizing Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) with Maximum Entropy species distribution modeling approach, the researchers were able to highlight the importance of which conservation areas in Central Java that play crucial role to conserve the N. javanicus population. Data on the presence of the Javan slow loris was obtained from the result of a survey undertaken in 2017 and communication with researchers. Elevation, slope, landcover, rainfall, distance to road, distance to settlement, distance to river (water source), and NDVI were used as environmental variables. Results showed that 0.76% (25,715.4 ha) of the total area of the Central Java Province is suitable for their habitat. In addition, results revealed that 2.2% of suitable habitat is present within conservation areas, 4.6% in protected forest areas, and 93.2% outside of protected areas. The Javan slow loris is predicted to be mostly scattered in the northern part of Central Java Province. The Javan slow loris is widely distributed in plantations, their most dominant habitat. The findings of this study show that the small percentage of suitable habitat presents within protected forest and conservation areas cannot sustainably maintain the extant Javan slow loris population. Thus, it is important for the Indonesian government and other key related stakeholders to work together in combination with educating local communities to preserve the habitat and population of N. javanicus.

TI  - Landscape genetic analyses of Cervus elaphus and Sus scrofa : comparative study and analytical developments
PY  - 2019
AB  - Red deer and wild boar are two major game species whose populations are managed and live in areas impacted by human activities. Measuring and understanding the impact of landscape features on individual movements and spatial patterns of genetic variability in these species is thus of importance for managers. A large number of individuals sampled across Wallonia (Belgium) for both species have been genotyped using microsatellite markers (respectively > 1700 and > 1200 genotyped individuals) and some individuals have also been followed using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) protocol. The combined data set represents an unprecedented opportunity to study and compare the environmental factors impacting the interconnectivity of these large mammals. The present study describes and uses a landscape genetic workflow to compare spatial patterns of genetic variability and the impact of environmental factors on genetic differentiation. For the latter analyses, we investigate the correlation between genetic and environmental distances (pairwise approach) and also between local genetic dissimilarity and environmental conditions (point approach). Preliminary analyses of CMR data confirm that motorways act as significant barriers to dispersal. However, analyses performed with the pairwise approach do not highlight any evidence of an impact of motorways on genetic differentiation, which is presumably due to their recent establishment. Complementary analyses performed with the point approach reveal that low altitude tends to be associated with higher genetic dissimilarity. From a methodological point of view, the present workflow illustrates the complementary application of both pairwise and point approaches, as well as univariate and multivariate analyses.

TI  - Ecological corridors for the amphibians and reptiles in the Natura 2000 sites of Romania.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation are key challenges for biodiversity conservation. As Earth’s landscape is increasingly dominated by anthropogenic land use, it is clear that broad-scale systems of nature reserves connected by corridors are needed to enable the dispersal of flora and fauna. The European Union currently supports a continent-wide network of protected areas, the Natura 2000 program, but this program lacks the necessary connectivity component. To examine whether a comprehensive network could be built in order to protect amphibians and reptiles, two taxonomic groups sensitive to environmental changes due to their physiological constrains and low dispersal capacity, we used species’ distribution maps, the sites of community interest (SCIs) in Romania, and landscape resistance rasters. Except Vipera ursinii rakosiensis, all amphibians and reptiles had corridors mapped that, when assembled, provided linkages for up to 27 species. Natura 2000 species were not good candidates for umbrella species as these linkages covered only 17% of the corridors for all species. Important Areas for Connectivity were identified in the Carpathian Mountains and along the Danube River, further confirming these regions as hot spots for biodiversity in Europe, where successful linkages are most likely. In the end, while such corridors may not be created just for amphibians and reptiles, they can easily be incorporated into more complex linkages with corridors for more charismatic species, therefore enhancing the corridors’ value in terms of quality and structure.

TI  - Planning for carnivore recolonization by mapping sex-specific landscape connectivity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Identifying and preserving landscape connectivity as well as planning for conflict mitigation are key for facilitating species persistence, especially in increasingly human-dominated landscapes outside of protected areas. Black bears (Ursus americanus) have lost more than a third of their former range throughout North America, but are currently recovering and recolonizing numerous human-modified landscapes. Based on previously developed sex-specific landscape suitability models, we characterized landscape use and connectivity for a recolonizing population. Since female and male carnivores differ in traits such as body size, reproductive strategies, risk aversion, and movement, we developed sex-specific models to assess intra-specific differences. Core areas (patches larger than the median annual range for each sex) represented 53–58% of their predicted suitable range, suggesting a considerable amount of habitat fragmentation. Typical linkages were 31 km for females and 37 km for males, similar to commonly documented dispersal distances for black bears. Due to having more numerous and smaller core areas being connected, female linkages occupied a larger area and had a 26% overlap with male linkages, while males overlapped 65% with females. Independent verified black bear sightings overlapped 40–50% with our predicted female and male areas, and sightings of females with offspring overlapped >90% with our predicted female areas. Anthropogenic barriers with high restoration potential were 2–4 times more numerous than natural barriers. Land cover composition within linkages was similar for both sexes, with the highest proportion of agriculture (mostly pastures and grasses) in the center of the linkage network. Core areas for both sexes extended well beyond protected areas, suggesting that private landowners will play a key role in the maintenance of high quality habitat and linkages for black bears in Missouri. Successful conservation will depend on land management that preserves a variety of high-quality habitat patches and corridors, while identifying areas of potential habitat restoration, as well as targeting management in areas with anticipated increases in bear abundance and conflict.

TI  - Conservation costs of retention forestry and optimal habitat network selection in Southwestern Germany.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Promoting the maintenance of biodiversity in managed forests should take into account economic efficiency of conservation plans. Therefore, novel economic valuation schemes must be developed in order to support conservation programs and mitigate biodiversity loss. Here, we assess the economic implications of retention forestry practices and create a habitat network in a mixed-montane forest in Southwestern Germany. We applied a simulation-optimization approach for i) evaluation of retention forestry practices applied in the region, ii) creation of forest reserves with a minimum eligible area for biodiversity conservation and establishing a connecting corridor with minimum cost, and iii) allocation of deadwood islands inside the connecting corridor with minimum cost. The average opportunity cost arising from retention forestry practices amounted to 1795 EUR/ha by leaving a minimum deadwood volume of 35 m3/ha and 2.5–5 habitat trees/ha. The optimized plan for establishing a habitat network would reduce the net present value (NPV) of forest management between 3.7% and 4.2%, and the novel design for the allocation of deadwood islands would impose a marginal reduction (

TI  - Getting ahead of climate change for ecological adaptation and resilience.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Changing the course of Earth's climate is increasingly urgent, but there is also a concurrent need for proactive stewardship of the adaptive capacity of the rapidly changing biosphere. Adaptation ultimately underpins the resilience of Earth's complex systems; species, communities, and ecosystems shift and evolve over time. Yet oncoming changes will seriously challenge current natural resource management and conservation efforts. We review forward-looking conservation approaches to enable adaptation and resilience. Key opportunities include expanding beyond preservationist approaches by including those that enable and facilitate ecological change. Conservation should not just focus on climate change losers but also on proactive management of emerging opportunities. Local efforts to conserve biodiversity and generate habitat complexity will also help to maintain a diversity of future options for an unpredictable future.

TI  - Towards more effective landscape governance for sustainability: the case of RIMBA corridor, Central Sumatra, Indonesia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Over the last two decades, sustainable landscape approaches are increasingly being adopted worldwide. An important challenge for these approaches is to analyse and improve governance systems that promote non-conflicting land uses to provide multiple ecosystem services and safeguard biodiversity for diverse social groups over the long term. Our study provides a diagnostic of the gaps and limitations of the current institutional arrangements of an ecosystem corridor in Central Sumatra covering Riau, Jambi and West Sumatera, known as the RIMBA corridor landscape. We identify actions that stakeholders think should be taken to improve the governance of the RIMBA corridor to achieve sustainable landscape goals. We used a combination of methods, including (1) Focus Group Discussions with key stakeholders of the RIMBA programme; (2) the use of a “context diagnostic approach for conservation” to analyse the results of the Focus Group Discussions; (3) a survey on formal institution design for coordination and management of the RIMBA corridor. We found that although transformational dynamics have already been initiated at the local, provincial and national levels through a pilot project, new regulations and institutional changes, many obstacles to effective governance of the RIMBA landscape still remain. Our study points at the need for a new institution to enable cooperation for green economy policy objectives established through a Presidential Decree to achieve the required institutional innovations at the scales required. Our experimental diagnostic approach can be applied in other settings in Indonesia and elsewhere to analyse and improve the effectiveness of governance for the management of biodiversity and ecosystem services at landscape scales.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Global Research on Ecological Networks in Nature Conservation from 1990 to 2020
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>As a nature-based solution to land-use sustainability, ecological networks (ENs) have received substantial attention from researchers, planners, and decision-makers worldwide. To portray the global research on ENs in nature conservation during the period of 1990–2020, 1371 papers in 53 subject categories were reviewed with bibliometric methods and CiteSpace. The results showed a successive growth of publications at an annually averaged rate of 18.9% during the past three decades. Co-citation analysis indicated that the most popular topic was connectivity, on which the studies concentrated on quantifying connectivity, identifying priority areas, and integrating conservation planning. A recent hotspot is to study the landscape fragmentation effects on natural habitats or biodiversity under land-use changes in urbanized areas. Multidisciplinary approaches have been increasingly used to tackle more complex interplays among economic, social, ecological, and cultural factors, with the aim of alleviating ecological service losses attributed to human activities. Spatiotemporal dynamics and participatory design of ENs at different scales have become an emerging trend. In order to address increasing pressures on biodiversity or landscape connectivity brought about by land use and climate change, it is suggested to develop more research on the evaluation and management of the resilience of ENs.</jats:p>

TI  - Urban ecological connectivity as a planning tool for different animal species
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The application of ecological theory to urban planning is becoming more important as land managers focus on increasing urban biodiversity as a way to improve human welfare. City authorities must decide not only what types of biodiversity-focused infrastructure should be prioritized, but also where new resources should be positioned and existing resources protected or enhanced. Careful spatial planning can contribute to the successful return and conservation of urban nature by maximizing the contribution of green infrastructure to landscape connectivity. By using ecological connectivity theory as a planning tool, governments can quantify the effect of different interventions on the ease with which wildlife can move across the landscape. Here we outline an approach to a) quantify ecological connectivity for different urban wildlife species and b) use this to test different urban planning scenarios using QGIS.

TI  - The concept of green infrastructure and urban landscape planning: a challenge for urban forestry planning in Belgrade, Serbia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract: The beginning of the 21st century has witnessed a growth in our understanding of the importance of planning urban landscapes in the context of urban population growth and unpredictable climatic conditions. In the search for responses to the challenges set by the development of contemporary urban landscapes, researchers have offered solutions based on the concept of sustainable and resilient cities, whose spatial development would be based on an interdisciplinary approach to strategy development: biodiversity, urban ecological networks and connectivity, multifunctionality and modularity. Although the concepts of a green infrastructure, in their spatial and functional dimensions, allow the application of such strategies, there are still problems when it comes to implementation and measuring the results achieved. At the same time, there is a growing discussion of the important role played by urban forestry in the context of the collaborative planning of urban landscapes and the application of the ideas of a green infrastructure. The key question is: what are the modalities of application of the concept of green infrastructure in the process of planning the development of the modern city and how can the resulting benefits be evaluated? With the modalities of application of the concept of green infrastructure in mind, we discuss its multi-scale and multifunctional dimensions as applied in the case of Serbia. The realisation of the green infrastructure concept is presented through the example of the Urban Forest Management Plan for the City of Belgrade - Mladenovac Municipality. The results of using the spatial-ecological approach in creating the plan and establishing connectivity as a new aim in forest management planning show that the implementation of the green infrastructure concept, and the achieved multifunctional ecosystem values, can be presented on the basis of the parameters of landscape metrics. In light of the new urban world, future research should focus on the application of the landscape ecological approach of the green infrastructure concept in collaborative planning at the urban landscape scale, which allows the creation of ecosystem services and benefits to human well-being.

TI  - Rethinking Biological Invasions as a Metacommunity Problem
PY  - 2021
AB  - Perhaps more than any other ecological discipline, invasion biology has married the practices of basic science and the application of that science. The conceptual frameworks of population regulation, metapopulations, supply-side ecology, and community assembly have all to some degree informed the regulation, management, and prevention of biological invasions. Invasion biology needs to continue to adopt emerging frameworks and paradigms to progress as both a basic and applied science. This need is urgent as the biological invasion problem continues to worsen. The development of metacommunity theory in the last two decades represents a paradigm-shifting approach to community ecology that emphasizes the multi-scale nature of community assembly and biodiversity regulation. Work on metacommunities has demonstrated that even relatively simple processes at local scales are often heavily influenced by regional-scale processes driven primarily by the dispersal of organisms. Often the influence of dispersal interacts with, or even swamps, the influence of local-scale drivers like environmental conditions and species interactions. An emphasis on dispersal and a focus on multi-scale processes enable metacommunity theory to contribute strongly to the advancement of invasion biology. Propagule pressure of invaders has been identified as one of the most important drivers facilitating invasion, so the metacommunity concept, designed to address how dispersal-driven dynamics affect community structure, can directly address many of the central questions of invasion biology. Here we revisit many of the important concepts and paradigms of biological invasions—propagule pressure, biotic resistance, enemy release, functional traits, neonative species, human-assisted transport—and view those concepts through the lens of metacommunity theory. In doing so, we accomplish several goals. First, we show that work on metacommunities has generated multiple predictions, models, and the tools that can be directly applied to invasion scenarios. Among these predictions is that invasibility of a community should decrease with both local controls on community assembly, and the dispersal rates of native species. Second, we demonstrate that framing biological invasions in metacommunity terms actually unifies several seemingly disparate concepts central to invasion biology. Finally, we recommend several courses of action for the control and management of invasive species that emerge from applying the concepts of metacommunity theory.

TI  - Resilience of benthic deep-sea fauna to mining activities
PY  - 2017
AB  - With increasing demand for mineral resources, extraction of polymetallic sulphides at hydrothermal vents, cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts at seamounts, and polymetallic nodules on abyssal plains may be imminent. Here, we shortly introduce ecosystem characteristics of mining areas, report on recent mining developments, and identify potential stress and disturbances created by mining. We analyze species’ potential resistance to future mining and perform meta-analyses on population density and diversity recovery after disturbances most similar to mining: volcanic eruptions at vents, fisheries on seamounts, and experiments that mimic nodule mining on abyssal plains. We report wide variation in recovery rates among taxa, size, and mobility of fauna. While densities and diversities of some taxa can recover to or even exceed pre-disturbance levels, community composition remains affected after decades. The loss of hard substrata or alteration of substrata composition may cause substantial community shifts that persist over geological timescales at mined sites.

TI  - Hydrothermal Vent Species Assemblage Networks Identify Regional Connectivity Patterns in the Northwest Pacific
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The distribution of species among spatially isolated habitat patches supports regional biodiversity and stability, so understanding the underlying processes and structure is a key target of conservation. Although multivariate statistics can infer the connectivity processes driving species distribution, such as dispersal and habitat suitability, they rarely explore structure. Methods from graph theory, applied to distribution data, give insights into both connectivity pathways and processes by intuitively formatting the data as a network of habitat patches. We apply these methods to empirical data from the hydrothermal vent habitats of the Northwest Pacific. Hydrothermal vents are ‘oases’ of biological productivity and endemicity on the seafloor that are imminently threatened by anthropogenic disturbances with unknown consequences to biodiversity. Here, we describe the structure of hydrothermal vent species assemblage networks, how local and regional parameters affect their structure, and the implications this has for conservation. Two complementary networks were formed from an extensive species assemblage dataset: a bipartite network of species nodes linked to vent site nodes at which they are present, and a similarity network of vent site nodes linked by weighted edges based on their pairwise assemblage similarity. Using these networks, we assessed the role of individual vent sites in linking their network and identified biogeographic sub-regions. The three sub-regions and two outlying sites are separated by their spatial arrangement and local environmental filters. Both networks detected vent sites that play a disproportionately important role in regional pathways, while the bipartite network also identified key vent sites maintaining the distinct species assemblages of their sub-regions. These regional connectivity pathways provide insights into historical colonisation routes, while sub-regional connectivity pathways are of value when selecting sites for conservation and/or estimating the multi-vent impacts from proposed deep-sea mining.</jats:p>

TI  - Human footprint differentially impacts genetic connectivity of four wide-ranging mammals in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Aim Maintaining connectivity is critical for long-term persistence of wild carnivores in landscapes fragmented due to anthropogenic activity. We examined spatial genetic structure and the impact of landscape features on connectivity in four wide-spread species- jungle cat (Felis chaus), leopard (Panthera pardus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). Location Our study was carried out in the central Indian landscape, a stronghold in terms of distribution and abundance of large mammals. The landscape comprises fragmented forests embedded in a heterogeneous matrix of multiple land-use types. Methods Microsatellite data from non-invasively sampled individuals (90 jungle cats, 82 leopards, 104 sloth bears and 117 tigers) were used to investigate genetic differentiation. Impact of landscape features on gene flow was inferred using a multi-model landscape resistance optimization approach. Results All four study species revealed significant isolation by distance (IBD). The correlation between genetic and geographic distance was significant only over a short distance for jungle cat, followed by longer distances for sloth bear, leopard and tiger. Overall, human footprint had a high negative impact on geneflow in tigers, followed by leopards, sloth bears and the least on jungle cats. Individual landscape variables- land-use, human population density, density of linear features and roads- impacted the study species differently. Although land-use was found to be an important variable explaining genetic connectivity for all four species, the amount of variation explained, the optimum spatial resolution and the resistance offered by different land-use classes varied. Main conclusions As expected from theory, but rarely demonstrated using empirical data, the pattern of spatial autocorrelation of genetic variation scaled with dispersal ability and density of the study species. Landscape genetic analyses revealed species-specific impact of landscape features and provided insights into interactions between species biology and landscape structure. Our results emphasize the need for incorporating functional connectivity data from multiple species for landscape-level conservation planning.

TI  - Habitat specialisation and matrix resistance predict responses of butterfly populations to landscape features in tropical grassland-forest complexes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - A fundamental question in ecology is to understand how a species is distributed in a landscape. In terrestrial landscapes, the size and isolation of habitat patches, and matrix properties, are thought to drive population density patterns. Yet, given the same set of landscape features, why do species from a single taxon vary so widely in their density patterns? A primary hypothesis for such variation, proposed by community-level studies, is that key ecological characteristics of species influence how they respond to landscape features. However, robust tests of this hypothesis, which require measurements of populations of multiple species in an assemblage, are still scarce. We investigated the ability of ecological specialisation and the interaction of species with the matrix (matrix resistance) to predict population responses of butterfly species to patch size and connectivity in naturally heterogeneous tropical forest-grassland complexes. We surveyed 56 habitat patches in a 65 sq. km area by laying 276 transects, along which the identity and abundances of butterfly species were recorded. We also used transects that cut across two habitats to estimate matrix resistance. We find that habitat specialisation predicted the strength of area-density and isolation-density relationships. Matrix resistance also predicted variation in area-density relationships, highlighting the importance of species interactions with the matrix. Specialists showed higher matrix resistance and stronger area and isolation effects than did generalists. Our findings suggest that investigating how traits related to ecological specialisation and matrix resistance affect demographic parameters can contribute towards understanding mechanisms underlying species distributions in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - A connectivity modeling and evaluating methodological framework in biodiversity hotspots based on naturalness and linking wilderness
PY  - 2022
AB  - Wilderness is important for the maintenance of biodiversity, but human activities are increasingly fragmenting it. This situation has serious impacts on various ecological processes, especially in biodiversity hotspots. In previous studies, connectivity modeling is mostly focused on key species, but this approach is difficult to use in biodiversity hotspots. Therefore, it is more practical to focus on naturalness or wilderness. In this study, the Boolean tool and morphological analysis were used to extract landscape type core as wilderness core and Bridge as structural corridors. Then, connectivity analysis was used to extract the wilderness landscape source (WLS). Linkage mapper and Pinch-point mapper were used to identify the potential corridors and analyze the Pinch-Points in the corridor, and network connectivity indexes were used to evaluate the corridor network structure. Finally, wilderness core, WLS, structural corridor, and potential corridor are superimposed to get a wilderness network map. A method framework for comprehensive identification and evaluation of the wilderness network in biodiversity hotspots was proposed. Taking Nujiang Prefecture as an example, a wilderness network was constructed and evaluated based on naturalness and wilderness. The results show that human activity has a clear impact on connectivity and that wilderness networks have the potential to be an efficient alternative to habitat networks. In addition, the method framework has potential applicability to other biodiversity hotspots’ regions to reduce the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

TI  - Integrating Habitat Availability, Permeability, and Configuration in a Model of Landscape Connectivity: The Contribution of Habitat's Site-to-Site.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The landscape configuration, the permeability of the matrix and the possibility of random dispersal movement of species are essential to robust modeling of the landscape connectivity. To represent this condition, we report a spatial model that integrates graph theory, circuit theory, metrics of habitat availability and includes a temporal aspect by looking into land use changes over time. We identify the possibilities of movement of species site-to-site over time in the landscape, taking into account not only the importance of sites of focal habitats, but also the potential relevance of the matrix for landscape connectivity. The modeling was applied to two rural landscapes, considering three functional groups of mammals with different resource-feeding and habitat requirements. The model indicated multiple and new dispersal non-linear potential routes to each group of mammals, considering its specific requirement to obtain resources and its movement pattern on the agricultural matrix.

TI  - Infrastructure development with(out) ecological conservation: the Northern Forests in İstanbul
PY  - 2021
AB  - Large-scale infrastructure development that accompanies global urban transformation threatens biodiversity and ecosystems around the world. Transportation infrastructure, in particular, uniquely affects landscape structure and connectivity. However, spatially explicit, quantitative analyses of change in habitat configuration due to multiple, linked transportation infrastructure are rare. Here, we analyze how a new airport and new highway system altered the spatial pattern of forest habitats to the north of the Istanbul metropolitan region in the context of two-decade-long landscape change. We carry out a land-change analysis from 2000 to 2019. We then analyze the changes in the spatial patterns of various forest habitat types across the metropolitan region, within and in the vicinity of the airport site, and in a key biodiversity area (KBA) that the new highway passes through. New transportation infrastructure significantly altered the forest habitats. Ten percent of all forest cover was lost, a quarter of which due to the new transportation development. Overall and within the KBA, respectively, core forest habitat decreased by 20% and 16%; the share of isolated, highly fragmented, and edge habitats within the remaining forest increased by 7% and 8%. On the European side of the metro area, the last remnants of the connectivity between the western and eastern sections of the forests were lost. The degradation of the forest landscape has implications for the endemic biodiversity and ecosystem services relied on by the metropolitan area. Our findings inform landscape strategies to arrest these degradation trends. Such strategies can succeed if ecological conservation is integrated into planning and current highly centralized governance structure is reformed.

TI  - Functional connectivity in urban landscapes promoted by Ramphastos toco (Toco Toucan) and its implications for policy making
PY  - 2018
AB  - The scarcity of green areas in urban landscapes hinders connectivity among sites reducing the flux of organisms and seed dispersal. Ramphastos toco is an effective plant disperser in tropical landscapes, playing an important role in conserving plant connectivity. In this study we combined two methods of landscape connectivity analysis, in a way not yet explored, to assess the potential contribution of Ramphastos toco to enhancing connectivity among urban vegetation patches. We used spatial modeling techniques to evaluate least cost routes, or those that facilitate bird movement through green urban areas, in Belo Horizonte, a city in Southeast Brazil. We also assessed the relative importance of forest patches for conserving both bird and seed dispersal fluxes using the integral index of connectivity. The resulting least cost route of greater accessibility for the species included in its course an important forest patch under environmental licensing for the construction of a residential condominium. The number of green urban areas covered by forest, of highest habitat quality for the species, summed to 155 patches. Of this total only 5.2% were relevant for regional connectivity, while the four most important patches are targeted by the city’s expansion plans. Ramphastos toco is an effective connector for tropical green urban areas given its adaptability, wide range of movement and seed dispersal effectiveness. We emphasize the need for incorporating ecological knowledge and the prioritization of green areas into city planning, since current expansion projects jeopardize forest patches that are crucial to the functional connectivity of the urban landscape.

TI  - Effects of local characteristics and landscape patterns on plant richness: A multi-scale investigation of multiple dispersal traits
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Plant species distributions are determined by various factors (including the dispersal modes and the complex physical environment) across multiple spatial scales, in which the dispersal distance of different dispersal modes and the external environment (including local characteristics and landscape patterns) are closely related. Therefore, understanding the response mechanism of plant species with different dispersal abilities to environmental factors is critical for developing effective landscape management strategies and prioritizing biodiversity conservation efforts at the appropriate scale. In this study, we aimed to explore: (1) the spatial distribution of plant species richness; (2) the spatial scale at which plant species have the strongest response to environment variables (scale of effect); and (3) to identify the key factors that affect the plant species at local and six landscape scales (a 0.5 km, 1 km, 1.5 km, 2 km, 3 km and 4 km-radius circle) considering multiple dispersal traits. We conducted vegetation surveys at 53 sites and classified plant species into three dispersal modes, including biotic dispersal (BD), abiotic dispersal (AD) and autochorous (AT), based on the respective dispersal vector of the seed. We classified land use types into 15 categories and clipped 6 specified radii around each sampling site using ENVI 5.1 and ArcGIS 10.3 software. We applied linear mixed effects models (LMM) to analyze the local and the surrounding landscape variables in predicting plant species richness in Qingshui town of Beijing, China. Our results revealed that the response traits of species to environment factors varied across different scales, proving the existence of scale effect in our study area. The biotically-dispersed (BD) and abiotically-dispersed (AD) species favored structurally complex habitats with greater tree height and cover of herb at the local scale. The area-weighted mean of shape metric (SHAPE_MN) of shrubbery and the euclidean nearest neighbor distance distribution (ENN_AM) of bare land play a major role in determining BD and AD species at large spatial extents, which suggest that the patterns and ecological attributes of patches of these two land use types hinder the migration and colonization ability of species and thus affect the species richness. These results suggest that a multi-scale approach should be encouraged to help guide effective landscape managements in conserving biodiversity for different response traits.

TI  - Validating graph-based connectivity models with independent presence-absence and genetic data sets.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Habitat connectivity is a key objective of current conservation policies and is commonly modeled by landscape graphs (i.e., sets of habitat patches [nodes] connected by potential dispersal paths [links]). These graphs are often built based on expert opinion or species distribution models (SDMs) and therefore lack empirical validation from data more closely reflecting functional connectivity. Accordingly, we tested whether landscape graphs reflect how habitat connectivity influences gene flow, which is one of the main ecoevolutionary processes. To that purpose, we modeled the habitat network of a forest bird (plumbeous warbler [Setophaga plumbea]) on Guadeloupe with graphs based on expert opinion, Jacobs' specialization indices, and an SDM. We used genetic data (712 birds from 27 populations) to compute local genetic indices and pairwise genetic distances. Finally, we assessed the relationships between genetic distances or indices and cost distances or connectivity metrics with maximum-likelihood population-effects distance models and Spearman correlations between metrics. Overall, the landscape graphs reliably reflected the influence of connectivity on population genetic structure; validation R<sup>2</sup> was up to 0.30 and correlation coefficients were up to 0.71. Yet, the relationship among graph ecological relevance, data requirements, and construction and analysis methods was not straightforward because the graph based on the most complex construction method (species distribution modeling) sometimes had less ecological relevance than the others. Cross-validation methods and sensitivity analyzes allowed us to make the advantages and limitations of each construction method spatially explicit. We confirmed the relevance of landscape graphs for conservation modeling but recommend a case-specific consideration of the cost-effectiveness of their construction methods. We hope the replication of independent validation approaches across species and landscapes will strengthen the ecological relevance of connectivity models.

TI  - Areas Important for Ecological Connectivity Throughout Canada
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Governments around the world have acknowledged the importance of conserving ecological connectivity to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. In this study we employed recent methodological developments in circuit theory to conduct the first pan-Canadian analysis of multi-species connectivity for all terrestrial regions of the country, at a spatial grain sufficient to support local land-management decisions. We developed a movement cost surface with a limited number of thematic categories using the most recently updated land cover data available for the country. We divided the country into 17 tiles and used a wall-to-wall, omnidirectional mode of Circuitscape on each tile in order to assess ecological connectivity throughout entire landscapes as opposed to strictly among protected areas. The resulting raw current density map of Canada revealed heterogenous patterns of current density across the country, strongly influenced by geography, natural barriers, and human development. We included a validation analysis of the output current density map with independent wildlife data from across the country and found that mammal and herpetofauna locations were predicted by areas of high current density. We believe our current density map can be used to identify areas important for connectivity throughout Canada and thereby contribute to efforts to conserve biodiversity.</jats:p>

TI  - Quantifying landscape connectivity for wild Asian elephant populations among fragmented habitats in Thailand
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The information on landscape connectivity among wildlife populations is crucial for conservation of endangered species. In this study, connectivity between core habitat areas was mapped and prioritized for the potential corridors among elephant populations in two separated regions in Thailand. The step selection function modeling approach was employed to estimate resistance surfaces based on elephant occurrence data. Connectivity maps were created based on the estimated resistance surfaces by employing the least-cost path and circuit theory through a proposed analytical method. As the results of resistance modeling, the averaged model showed that four of fifteen covariates were positively associated with the selection of the steps. The predictors consist of landcover, elevation, terrain ruggedness, and distance to the nearest cell of specific landcover. The connectivity maps indicated multiple potential connectivity pathways, bottlenecks, and varied important linkages between core areas in both regions. This gave an alternative opportunity in acquiring information of landscape connectivity for providing aid in conservation planning at landscape-level.

TI  - Habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes improving multi-functionality of constructed wetlands as nature-based solutions
PY  - 2022
AB  - The prevention of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes to protect ecosystem stability and functions is of major importance in itself and for the maintenance of associated ecosystem services. Intense agriculture leads to a loss in species richness and homogenization of species pools as well as the fragmentation of natural habitats and groundwater pollution. Constructed wetlands stand as nature-based solutions (NBS) to buffer the degradation of water quality by intercepting the transfer of particles, nutrients and pesticides between crops and surface waters. In karstic watersheds where sinkholes short-cut surface water directly to groundwater increasing water resource vulnerability, constructed wetlands are recommended to mitigate agricultural pollutants. Constructed wetlands also have the potential to improve landscape connectivity by providing refuge and breeding sites for wildlife, especially for amphibians. We propose here a methodology to identify optimal locations for water pollution mitigation using constructed wetlands from the perspective of habitat connectivity. We use ecological niche modelling at the regional scale to model the potential of habitat suitability for nine amphibian species, and to infer how the landscape impedes species movements. We combine those results to graph theory to identify connectivity priorities at the operational scale of an agricultural catchment area. Our framework allowed us to identify optimal areas from the point of view of the species, to analyze the effect of multifunctional constructed wetlands aiming to both reduce water pollution and to improve amphibian species habitat overall connectivity. More generally, we show the potential of habitat connectivity assessment to improve multifunctionality of NBS for pollution mitigation.

TI  - Effects of road ditches on the vegetation composition in a saline environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - The construction of transportation corridors (such as roads) frequently disturbs and alters the natural disturbance regimes of ecosystems in many areas worldwide. In this study, by comparing the species richness, diversity, composition and soil among four ecotypes (non-road disturbance areas, road systems without ditches, road systems with large and small ditches), we tested the hypothesis that the presence of road ditches could facilitate the preservation of species and increase species richness in the Yellow River Delta, China. Both positive and negative effects of road ditches on the plant community were detected. The species richness in road systems (> 14) was significantly greater than that in the non-road disturbance areas (6). In the road systems without ditches, the refuges (relatively low soil salinity: 1.12 ± 0.15 mg/g) for non-halophytes were limited to road verges (0 m from a road verge). In the road systems that included a ditch, however, the refuge area expanded from road verges to 30 m from the verges. The width and structure affected ditch function. Both large ditches and small ditches effectively reduced the salinity of the soil, but the influence mechanisms differed, resulting in differences in the distribution of species diversity. The proportion of non-halophytes was significantly greater (37%) in the road systems with large ditches than in the road systems with small ditches (45.0%). In addition, the proper structure of large ditches with slopes increased the species diversity (the species richness was 26); in contrast, some structures of small ditches reduced the species diversity (the species richness was 14). The results of our study suggest that large ditches (width > 5 m) can be constructed 10 m from road verges to increase local species richness. Moreover, it is necessary to create buffer zones alongside roads (30 m from road verge), which can prevent the movement of invasive species into internal natural areas.

TI  - Selecting Graph Metrics with Ecological Significance for Deepening Landscape Characterization: Review and Applications
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The usual approaches to describing and understanding ecological processes in a landscape use patch-mosaic models based on traditional landscape metrics. However, they do not consider that many of these processes cannot be observed without considering the multiple interactions between different land-use patches in the landscape. The objective of this research was to provide a synthetic overview of graph metrics that characterize landscapes based on patch-mosaic models and to analyze the ecological meaning of the metrics to propose a relevant selection explaining biodiversity patterns and ecological processes. First, we conducted a literature review of graph metrics applied in ecology. Second, a case study was used to explore the behavior of a group of selected graph metrics in actual differentiated landscapes located in a long-term socioecological research site in Brittany, France. Thirteen landscape-scale metrics and 10 local-scale metrics with ecological significance were analyzed. Metrics were grouped for landscape-scale and local-scale analysis. Many of the metrics were able to identify differences between the landscapes studied. Lastly, we discuss how graph metrics offer a new perspective for landscape analysis, describe the main characteristics related to their calculation and the type of information provided, and discuss their potential applications in different ecological contexts.</jats:p>

TI  - Connectivity of priority areas for the conservation of large carnivores in northern Mexico
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Puma, jaguar, and American black bear are the largest carnivores in northern Mexico. • We identified priority areas and corridors for the conservation of these carnivores. • We identified areas where habitat could be lost, threatening connectivity between them. • We made specific proposals to maintain or restore the corridors identified. The loss and fragmentation of habitat has negative effects on populations of large carnivores, but ecological corridors that allow dispersal of individuals among habitat remnants mitigate these effects. Our objectives were to identify 1) priority areas for the conservation of three species of large carnivores in northern Mexico, 2) the corridors that can maintain connectivity between them, and 3) pinch points signifying habitat loss that threatens connectivity. We generated species distribution models using MaxEnt and GLM to obtain a consensus model for each species. We applied an inverse function to the probability gradient of the consensus models to calculate the resistance and identify the corridors between priority areas. With Linkage Mapper software, we generated the corridors, calculated their centrality and that of the priority areas, and identified the areas where the corridors are narrower (i.e., pinch points). Finally, we identified the main anthropic fragmentation elements in the most important corridors. We identified 6 priority areas for jaguar, 20 for puma and 21 for black bear, with 5 corridors for jaguar, 22 for puma and 29 for black bear. The pinch points were produced by agricultural fields, human settlements, roads, or combinations of these factors. Depending on the element of fragmentation in each corridor, we propose specific strategies at the pinch points, e.g., applying restoration programs, including wildlife crossings to mitigate road killed cases, promoting payment programs for environmental services or compensation in cases of conflict, to increase the support of local inhabitants for conservation.

TI  - Combining wildfire behaviour simulations and network analysis to support wildfire management: A Mediterranean landscape case study
PY  - 2022
AB  - • We used well-established and a new network metrics to assess wildfire connectivity. • We assessed the effect of a planned fuelbreak network in these metrics. • We ranked fuelbreak segments concerning their impact in vegetation patches connectivity. • Weather scenarios play an important role in vegetation patches connectivity. • Active management will greatly reduce fire spread in the landscape. The recent extreme wildfire events in the Mediterranean region overwhelmed fire suppression capabilities of national authorities, evidencing the need for a paradigm shift in forest and wildfire management. Wildfire spread and behaviour simulations can provide relevant information to assess fire hazard and to guide decision-makers in implementing fuel treatment strategies. Here, we quantify the influence of spatial arrangement of fuels on fire spread connectivity by developing a new graph-based connectivity index and by applying well established graph-based metrics. These spatial connectivity metrics provide useful information for wildfire hazard and fuel management plans, since they can be used to map vegetation patches able to generate large and intense wildfires, with consequent large impacts. This approach was applied in the fire-prone landscape of Serra de Monchique, southwestern Portugal, under different fire weather scenarios and various linear fuelbreak layout options. We show that network metrics allow the location of the most important areas of wildfire connectivity whereas wildfire suppression may be challenging under specific fire weather conditions. We further show how the construction of fuelbreaks allows to modify the wildfire spread by directly reducing the overall connectivity by 20% and the amount of area with limited opportunities for ground-based suppression by up to 70%, which may, however, be insufficient under extreme weather conditions. This information can be used to prioritize the implementation of fuelbreak segments given their relevance to contain wildfire spread across the landscape and to provide defensible areas for ground-based wildfire suppression. We anticipate that these network metrics will be helpful to both land planners and wildfire researchers seeking to disrupt fuel connectivity and assess different fuel reduction strategies in fire-prone Mediterranean regions.

TI  - Building biodiversity into the urban fabric: A case study in applying Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Biodiversity within cities is fundamental for human health and well-being, and delivers a wide range of critical ecosystem services. However, biodiversity is often viewed as an afterthought or final addition once an urban development nears completion. As such, provisions for biodiversity are typically tokenistic and do not achieve the experience of everyday nature that people need. Considering biodiversity requirements at the start of an urban development allows for strategic, intentional design with biodiversity enhancement in mind. Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol that aims to create urban areas that deliver on-site benefit to native species and ecosystems through the provision of essential habitat and food resources. Here we present a case study demonstrating how BSUD methods can be used to (a) encourage successful outcomes for nature, (b) improve the aesthetics and liveability of the urban form, and (c) engage stakeholders in a process that supports other aspects of urban design including park and streetscape design. Fishermans Bend (Melbourne) is the largest urban renewal project in Australia, and one of the first of this scale to explicitly include biodiversity targets. We outline the methods used to co-create biodiversity objectives with diverse stakeholders, and how these, combined with a quantitative analysis of their potential biodiversity impact, were translated into clear design and planning recommendations. We critically reflect on the success of this method for 1) communicating and facilitating provisions for biodiversity across different stakeholders and 2) providing clear messaging around biodiversity across different planning disciplines.

TI  - A multispecies approach for assessing landscape connectivity in data-poor regions
PY  - 2020
AB  - Identifying animals movement through the landscape and delineating key corridors is critical for effective management and conservation. Still, assessments of space-use patterns and landscape connectivity are subjected to many limitations, especially in large scales. The main objective of this study was to assess functional connectivity for four focal mammal species with varying dispersal abilities and diets, across protected areas in a transnational region where only scarce information on movement patterns exists. We used models relying on circuit theory, multiple layers of spatial information and graph-theoretical analysis. We delineated potential pathways suitable for species movement and evaluated connectivity status of the protected areas network in the Balkan Peninsula, southeastern Europe. Models were parameterized by combining information from experts and scientific literature, or by applying allometric equations, while novel connectivity metrics were developed. We identified four key, suitable corridors within the transnational study region. The largest one crossed three countries, highlighting the need for international conservation efforts. For species with higher dispersal abilities, the network of protected areas appeared to be well connected and robust while for others it consisted of numerous isolated sites, raising the need for species-specific management plans. Our study serves as an example of how to set monitoring and conservation priorities in data-poor regions. Our findings highlight the need to identify a number of ecological corridors that could facilitate movement of multiple species with different functional traits and habitat preferences. This information is proved to be critical for setting spatially explicit conservation plans at local, regional and transnational scales.

TI  - Come back to stay: landscape connectivity analysis for the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) in the western Alps
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Assessing landscape connectivity allows defining the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of a species between resource patches. In this phase of climate change and biodiversity crisis, maintaining landscape connectivity by restoring and protecting connecting areas and corridors is a key strategy to ensure the survival of many species. The Eurasian otter (<jats:italic>Lutra lutra</jats:italic>) is a freshwater top predator that is slowly recovering after a dramatic decline occurred in central and southern Europe in the last century. To assess the chances of otter recolonization of the western Alps, we analyzed environmental connectivity by applying electrical circuit theory to an expert-based resistance surface using the <jats:italic>Circuitscape</jats:italic> software. The study area included southeastern France, northwestern Italy, and Switzerland. We produced a cumulative current flow map and a gap analysis was also conducted to highlight the “conservation gaps” for optimal corridors. The results revealed that the orography of the landscape was the main factor influencing the quantity and quality of the pathways in the western Alpine landscapes. As main corridors were concentrated on valley bottoms, human pressure could severely diminish animal movement. Despite this, some heavily populated areas showed high connectivity values. Some important pathways did not fall within protected areas, potentially hindering otter dispersal and highlighting the need to expand the system of protected areas in the Alpine arc. Recolonization of Alpine territories by otters can therefore only occur if connectivity and environmental suitability combine to ensure the animals' survival over time.</jats:p>

TI  - Deterministic, random, or in between? Inferring the randomness level of wildlife movements.
PY  - 2021
AB  - When assessing connectivity, it is crucial to rely on accurate modeling frameworks that consider species movement preferences and patterns. One important aspect is the level of randomness or unpredictability in the route selection. In this respect, traditional approaches (based on least-cost path or circuit theory) consider species movements unrealistically as totally deterministic or as totally random. A recent approach (randomized shortest path) advocates for choosing intermediate levels of randomness through a single parameter. This parameter may be optimized by validating connectivity surfaces developed from different levels of randomness against observed movement data. However, connectivity models are seldom validated, and it is still unclear how to approach this task. To address this knowledge gap, this paper aims at comparing different validation methods to infer the optimal randomness level in connectivity studies. Additionally, we aimed to disentangle the practical consequences of applying traditional connectivity approaches versus using an optimized level of movement randomness when delineating corridors. These objectives were accomplished through the study case of the Iberian lynx, an endangered species whose maintenance and recovery depend on the current connectivity among its population nuclei. We firstly determined a conductance surface based on point selection functions accounting for the behavioral state (territorial or exploratory) of individuals. Secondly, we identified the level of randomness that better fits lynxes’ movements with independent GPS locations and different validation techniques. Lastly, we delineated corridors between lynx population nuclei through a) the randomized shortest path approach and the extreme and optimal levels of randomness of each validation method, and b) the traditional connectivity approaches. According to all used validation methodologies, models with intermediate levels of randomness outperformed those with extreme randomness levels representing totally deterministic or random movements. We found differences in the optimal randomness level among validation methods but similar results in the delineation of corridors. Our results also revealed that models with extreme randomness levels (deterministic and random walk) of the randomized path approach provided equivalent corridor networks to those from traditional approaches. Moreover, these corridor networks calculated with traditional approaches showed notable differences in patterns from the corridor network calculated with an optimized randomness level. Here we presented a connectivity model with a solid biological basis that calibrates the level of movement randomness and is supported by comprehensive validation methods. It is thus a step forward in the search and evaluation of connectivity approaches that lead to improved, efficient, and successful management actions.

TI  - Distribution and Ecological Network Construction of National Natural Protected Areas in the Upper Reaches of Yangtze River
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>The upper reaches are an important part of the Yangtze River Basin. The basin area is large and the terrain is complex, covering nearly all types of terrestrial ecosystems. This study sorts out the information of 313 protected areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and uses morphological spatial pattern analysis, a minimum cumulative resistance model, and geospatial indicators to quantitatively analyze the relationship between population density, per capita gross domestic product, and the pattern of protected areas in combination with regional economic and social conditions. Results show that the number of national forest parks is the largest, accounting for 31.31% of the study area. In the study area, all types of protected areas are concentrated distribution, protected areas in sparsely populated areas that are larger, more densely populated, and more economically developed, and the corresponding number of protected areas is greater. The study area is divided into five regions through the analysis of the corridors of the protected areas: the source area of the Yangtze River National Park, the Hengduan Mountain Ecological Strict Protection Area, the Qinling-Daba Mountain Ecological Protection Area, the Northern Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Ecological Protection Area, and the Three Gorges Ecological Control Area, forming an ecological network pattern of “one park, four districts, and three rings” in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</jats:p>

TI  - Construction and optimization strategy of ecological security pattern in a rapidly urbanizing region: A case study in central-south China
PY  - 2022
AB  - • A new strategy to optimize ecological sources and resistance surfaces was proposed to build ESP. • The optimal diffusion distance of ecological source was analyzed to meet future needs. • Boundary analysis and resistance radial effect were integrated to construct resistance surface. • More reasonable ecological corridor direction was obtained for the construction of ESP. Rapid urbanization would lead to deterioration of the eco-environment and damage the functioning of ecosystem services. Ecological security pattern (ESP) is one of important national strategies in China for coordinating the ecosystem protection and economic development. Previous studies have mainly focused on how to identify ecological sources and extract ecological corridors, but optimization of the identified ecological sources and resistance surfaces are seldom explored. In this study, a new strategy to optimize ecological sources and resistance surfaces was proposed. The optimal diffusion distance of each existing ecological source with poor landscape connectivity was analyzed to meet future needs. The radial effect of resistance in areas with high resistance values were considered in combination with the characteristics of species migration. Hunan is an important province in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and the Rise of Central China strategies. Taking a rapidly urbanizing region in Hunan Province as an example, the results showed that the total area of the optimized ecological sources was 9.60% higher than that of the existing area, which expanded the radial range of ecosystem services and enhanced ecosystem internal connectivity. According to the spatial distribution of important ecological landscape elements, the ecological framework of “two axes, four cores, and four belts” was proposed. This study offers a new insight for ESP construction, which can provide a new reference for ecological protection and development planning of rapidly urbanizing regions in central-south China.

TI  - Integrating ecosystem service trade-offs and rocky desertification into ecological security pattern construction in the Daning river basin of southwest China
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Ordered weighted averaging method was used to handle ecosystem service trade-offs. • Ecological sources were selected based on the conservation efficiency. • Proposed a resistance surface framework considering the characteristics of the karst. • Ecological security patterns showed that large-scale farmland hampered connectivity. The construction of ecological security patterns (ESPs) from the perspective of ecosystem services is vital in regional sustainability. However, previous approaches have often not considered the complex trade-offs between ecosystem services during the construction of ESPs. Taking the Daning river basin in karst areas of southwest China as our study area, we improve the current methodological framework to construct an ESP by integrating ecosystem service trade-offs, typical characteristics of the karst area, and circuit theory. The multi-criterion decision method of ordered weighted averaging was used to balance ecosystem service trade-offs and to determine the ecological sources with the optimum conservation efficiency. The resistance surface based on land use was modified by the nighttime light intensity and rocky desertification index. Circuit theory was then applied to identify corridors, pinch points and barriers. The results showed that the spatial patterns of the six ecosystem services (food provision, carbon sequestration, soil retention, water yield, habitat quality and ecological recreation) varied considerably within the study area. By comparing the conservation efficiencies, scenario 5 was selected as the optimal scenario, and the conservation efficiencies of six ecosystem services within the ecological sources were > 1 and were more balanced, illustrating the flexibility and feasibility of our method. The modified resistance surface comprehensively reflected the dual influence of human activity and rocky desertification on ecosystems. The ESP in the Daning river basin included 34 ecological sources, 66 key corridors, ecological corridors with an area of 957 km 2 , and 100 pinch points and 36 barriers distributed on the corridors. The ecological sources mostly covered by forest land were mainly distributed in the north and east of the study area. The key and ecological corridors were densely located in the south and central areas, where pinch points were also mainly concentrated. Barriers were distributed on the edge of ecological sources and corridors. Based on ESP, the Daning river basin was divided into ecologically important areas in northern and eastern and ecologically improving areas in central and southern, the corresponding ecological restoration measures were also proposed. In summary, this study makes up for the shortcomings of constructing ESPs by the simple spatial overlaying of ecosystem services. Our findings could also effectively enhance the robustness and sustainability of ESPs in karst areas.

TI  - The role of natural regeneration to ecosystem services provision and habitat availability: a case study in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
PY  - 2016
AB  - Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modelled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modelled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 years. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfil its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.

TI  - The allometry of movement predicts the connectivity of communities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Connectivity has long played a central role in ecological and evolutionary theory and is increasingly emphasized for conserving biodiversity. Nonetheless, connectivity assessments often focus on individual species even though understanding and preserving connectivity for entire communities is urgently needed. Here we derive and test a framework that harnesses the well-known allometric scaling of animal movement to predict community-level connectivity across protected area networks. We used a field translocation experiment involving 39 species of southern African birds to quantify movement capacity, scaled this relationship to realized dispersal distances determined from ring-and-recovery banding data, and used allometric scaling equations to quantify community-level connectivity based on multilayer network theory. The translocation experiment explained observed dispersal distances from ring-recovery data and emphasized allometric scaling of dispersal based on morphology. Our community-level networks predicted that larger-bodied species had a relatively high potential for connectivity, while small-bodied species had lower connectivity. These community networks explained substantial variation in observed bird diversity across protected areas. Our results highlight that harnessing allometric scaling can be an effective way of determining large-scale community connectivity. We argue that this trait-based framework founded on allometric scaling provides a means to predict connectivity for entire communities, which can foster empirical tests of community theory and contribute to biodiversity conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of environmental change.

TI  - A systematic review on the definition, criteria, indicators, methods and applications behind the Ecological Value term
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The “Ecological Value” (EV) term has been spread in the literature since 1860; however, there is no consensus on its definition and the criteria for its assessment. To identify, assess and summarize the main definitions, criteria, indicators and applications behind the EV term, we performed a systematic literature review of 209 articles published over the last 10 years. Methods included documentation of the following data: i) study area, ii) study subject, iii) study object; iv) criteria, indicators and methods used in the analyses, v) applications of the EV term, and vi) if the study was performed in a natural protected area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was conducted to uncover the association among studies regarding the use of EV and to test for homogeneity among the articles publishing research involving EV. A bootstrap technique was used for MCA validation. The main findings exposed the polysemy of the term and the paucity in the definition, mainly derived by the lack of a theoretical framework. Only 74, out of the 209 revised articles, involved numerical analysis to evaluate criteria. The more recurrent criteria were those related with ecological properties (biodiversity, vulnerability) and with functional characteristics (fragmentation, connectivity and resilience). Remote sensing techniques were the more frequent method for the assessment of EV. The main applications in the use of this term were for natural and urban planning, biodiversity conservation and payment for ecosystem services. An explicit heterogeneity among articles, with and without numerical analysis, was denoted by MCA. Finally, we concluded that the EV term is highly related with the intrinsic values of the landscape.

TI  - Potential paths for male-mediated gene flow to and from an isolated grizzly bear population
PY  - 2017
AB  - For several decades, grizzly bear populations in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) have increased in numbers and range extent. The GYE population remains isolated and although effective population size has increased since the early 1980s, genetic connectivity between these populations remains a long-term management goal. With only ~110 km distance separating current estimates of occupied range for these populations, the potential for gene flow is likely greater now than it has been for many decades. We sought to delineate potential paths that would provide the opportunity for male-mediated gene flow between the two populations. We first developed step-selection functions to generate conductance layers using ecological, physical, and anthropogenic landscape features associated with non-stationary GPS locations of 124 male grizzly bears (199 bear-years). We then used a randomized shortest path (RSP) algorithm to estimate the average number of net passages for all grid cells in the study region, when moving from an origin to a destination node. Given habitat characteristics that were the basis for the conductance layer, movements follow certain grid cell sequences more than others and the resulting RSP values thus provide a measure of movement potential. Repeating this process for 100 pairs of random origin and destination nodes, we identified paths for three levels of random deviation (θ) from the least-cost path. We observed broad-scale concordance between model predictions for paths originating in the NCDE and those originating in the GYE for all three levels of movement exploration. Model predictions indicated that male grizzly bear movement between the ecosystems could involve a variety of routes, and verified observations of grizzly bears outside occupied range supported this finding. Where landscape features concentrated paths into corridors (e.g., because of anthropogenic influence), they typically followed neighboring mountain ranges, of which several could serve as pivotal stepping stones. The RSP layers provide detailed, spatially explicit information for land managers and organizations working with land owners to identify and prioritize conservation measures that maintain or enhance the integrity of potential areas conducive to male grizzly bear dispersal.

TI  - Assessing Green Roof Contributions to Tree Canopy Ecosystem Services and Connectivity in a Highly Urbanized Area
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Ecosystem services refer to the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment and healthy ecosystems. Green roofs can be used to enhance ecosystem services, which are reduced by urbanization. Moreover, green roofs can improve biodiversity by connecting green spaces. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the multi-dimensional contributions of green roofs to urban ecosystems. To this end, we used i-Tree Canopy to identify changes in land cover and tree canopy ecosystem services from 2003 to 2021 in Suwon City, Republic of Korea. Next, we simulated improved ecosystem service effects of tree canopies by green roofs. Graph theory was also used to analyze connectivity improvement at local and landscape scales. Tree area was found to decrease from 2003 to 2012, alongside the corresponding ecosystem services, which then showed a tendency to increase from 2012 to 2021. The tree area was expected to increase further in the green roof scenario than in 2003. Green roofs were found to improve tree canopy connectivity at the landscape scale more than the local scale, by acting as stepping stones in connecting fragmented forests and trees. Areas with improved connectivity at both scales should be prioritized for green roof development. These results will aid in the strategic planning of urban green infrastructure and provide support for decision-making processes to improve ecosystem services and connectivity using green roofs.</jats:p>

TI  - Population connectivity in voles (Microtus sp.) as a gauge for tall grass prairie restoration in midwestern North America.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecological restoration can promote biodiversity conservation in anthropogenically fragmented habitats, but effectiveness of these management efforts need to be statistically validated to determine 'success.' One such approach is to gauge the extent of recolonization as a measure of landscape permeability and, in turn, population connectivity. In this context, we estimated dispersal and population connectivity in prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster; N = 231) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus; N = 83) within five tall-grass prairie restoration sites embedded within the agricultural matrix of midwestern North America. We predicted that vole dispersal would be constrained by the extent of agricultural land surrounding restored habitat patches, spatially isolating vole populations and resulting in significant genetic structure. We first employed genetic assignment tests based on 15 microsatellite DNA loci to validate field-derived species-designations, then tested reclassified samples with multivariate and Bayesian clustering to assay for spatial and temporal genetic structure. Population connectivity was further evaluated by calculating pairwise FST, then potential demographic effects explored by computing migration rates, effective population size (Ne), and average relatedness (r). Genetic species assignments reclassified 25% of initial field identifications (N = 11 M. ochrogaster; N = 67 M. pennsylvanicus). In M. ochrogaster population connectivity was high across the study area, reflected in little to no spatial or temporal genetic structure. In M. pennsylvanicus genetic structure was detected, but relatedness estimates identified it as kin-clustering instead, underscoring social behavior among populations rather than spatial isolation as the cause. Estimates of Ne and r were stable across years, reflecting high dispersal and demographic resilience. Combined, these metrics suggest the agricultural matrix is highly permeable for voles and does not impede dispersal. High connectivity observed confirms that the restored landscape is productive and permeable for specific management targets such as voles and also demonstrates population genetic assays as a tool to statistically evaluate effectiveness of conservation initiatives.

TI  - Increasing fragmentation of forest cover in Brazil's Legal Amazon from 2001 to 2017.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Persistent forest loss in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is responsible for carbon emission, reduction of ecosystem services, and loss of biodiversity. Combining spatial data analysis with high spatial resolution data for forest cover and forest loss, we quantified the spatial and temporal patterns of forest dynamics in the BLA. We identified an alarming trend of increasing deforestation, with especially high rates in 2016 and 2017. Moreover, the creation of forest cover fragments is faster than ever due to decreasing size and dispersion of forest loss patches. From 2001 to 2017, the number of large forest loss patches decreased significantly, accompanied by a reduction in the size of these patches. Enforcement of field inspections and of initiatives to promote forest conservation will be required to stop this trend.

TI  - Temporal and spatial changes of biodiversity in Caverns of Heaven and Places of Blessing, Zhejiang Province, China from 1990 to 2020
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Caverns of Heaven and Places of Blessing (CHPB) are the earliest Ecological Reserve in China, but in recent years, due to the accelerated process of urbanization and weak protection, the Chinese traditional ecological reserve represented by CHPB has been damaged to a certain extent. How to accurately measure the dynamic changes of ecological value in existing ecological protection and construct is an initial topic of CHPB protection. To understand the temporal and spatial changes characteristics of biodiversity in CHPB, this paper selects three-time nodes in 1990, 2005, and 2020, and takes CHPB in Zhejiang Province as an example, comprehensive three influencing factors: habitat quality, landscape pattern, and nighttime-light. To provide a relevant theoretical basis for the protection of CHPB, this paper quantitatively analyzes the changes of ecological environment and biodiversity in recent 30 years. The results showed that from 1990 to 2020, the biodiversity of CHPB in Zhejiang Province showed a positive change, the decline in Caverns of Heaven overall area slowed down, and the core area rebounded. The spatial distribution change of biodiversity is highly consistent with the land-use changes. The low value regions of biodiversity are mainly concentrated in the regions with intensive human activities, and the area decreases with the expansion of construction land. The core areas are primary areas with high biodiversity and overlap with nature reserves, natural parks, Scenic and Historic Interest Area, and other protected areas. In a word, CHPB still plays a vital role in ecological and environmental protection. In the future development, we should still pay attention to its biodiversity protection, and give full play to its role in ecological and environmental protection, and realize the contemporary application of CHPB’s traditional ecological knowledge.</jats:p>

TI  - Missing Interactions: The Current State of Multispecies Connectivity Analysis
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Designing effective habitat and protected area networks, which sustain species-rich communities is a critical conservation challenge. Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of new computational methods for analyzing and prioritizing the connectivity needs of multiple species. We argue that the goal of prioritizing habitat for multispecies connectivity should be focused on <jats:italic>long-term persistence of a set of species</jats:italic> in a landscape or seascape. Here we present a review of the literature based on 77 papers published between 2010 and 2020, in which we assess the current state and recent advances in multispecies connectivity analysis in terrestrial ecosystems. We summarize the four most employed analytical methods, compare their data requirements, and provide an overview of studies comparing results from multiple methods. We explicitly look at approaches for integrating multiple species considerations into reserve design and identify novel approaches being developed to overcome computational and theoretical challenges posed by multispecies connectivity analyses. There is a lack of common metrics for multispecies connectivity. We suggest the index of metapopulation capacity as one metric by which to assess and compare the effectiveness of proposed network designs. We conclude that, while advances have been made over the past decade, the field remains nascent by its ability to integrate multiple species interactions into analytical approaches to connectivity. Furthermore, the field is hampered its ability to provide robust connectivity assessments for lack of a clear definition and goal for multispecies connectivity conservation.</jats:p>

TI  - Strengthening a Regional Green Infrastructure through Improved Multifunctionality and Connectedness: Policy Suggestions from Sardinia, Italy
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>A wide body of research in recent years has studied either green infrastructures as providers of multiple ecosystem services, especially at the urban level, or ecological corridors and the issue of connectivity between landscape patches in the face of growing fragmentation. However, not many studies have analyzed how the two concepts can be combined to ground evidence-based policy and planning recommendations. In this study, a methodological approach for such a combination is proposed: after mapping a regional green infrastructure building upon the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and a network of ecological corridors through the resistance to movement of species, the two spatial layouts are combined so as to analyze correlations between the potential provision of ecosystem services and the resistance to movement. The methodology is applied in the case of the island of Sardinia, whose self-containment makes it possible to discard potential effects from surrounding areas, hence facilitating the implementation of the model. The outcomes of the regression model point out three ecosystem services as the most important factors that should be targeted by appropriate spatial policies if connectivity is to be increased: regulation of micro and local climate, forestry productivity, and cultural identity and heritage values.</jats:p>

TI  - Exploring structural and functional corridors for wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) in a semi-arid area
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Although corridors have been the subject of extensive research in the recent years, the probable correlation between structural and functional corridors have not been addressed to date. To fill this scientific gap, we compared structural and functional corridors of wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) as a threatened species in a semi-arid area of central Iran. We first used Maximum-Entropy to develop wild sheep habitat suitability map. We then used Morphological-Spatial-Pattern-Analysis (MSPA) and circuit theory to map structural and functional corridors of wild sheep respectively. Bootstrapping techniques then were used to compare structural and functional corridors. We found that structural corridor is a concept which is dependent on the scale of observation. By changing edge-width from 600 to 1200 m, the total area of structural corridors increased by 63%. We also only found very small differences in the functional connectivity role of different MSPA categories (including structural corridors). All MSPA categories together accounted for only 20% of the functional connectivity. Although, in some cases functional corridors had a better performance in showing migration path of wild sheep between reserves, other cases showed that for effective conservation, both structural and functional corridors should be identified and considered in the planning step.

TI  - Assessing the Role of Kettle Holes for Providing and Connecting Amphibian Habitats in Agricultural Landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - The intensification of agriculture over the last few decades has caused habitat loss, which poses a significant threat to the survival of populations and species. Where habitats are connected, populations may escape the destruction of their habitat by migrating to another one. Consequently, the functional connectivity of landscapes has become an important focus for species conservation. Kettle holes are hotspots of biodiversity that provide suitable conditions for wildlife species (i.e., amphibians, insects, aquatic plants) and contribute to landscape heterogeneity. They are also considered to function as stepping stone habitats that contribute to habitat connectivity. This study assesses the contribution of kettle holes for (i) habitat provision and (ii) the functional connectivity of three amphibian species with different movement ranges, and (iii) the study identifies areas where the creation of stepping stone biotopes could improve functional connectivity. The contribution of kettle holes was assessed using GIS-based clustering within three research areas in Germany. It was found that the importance of kettle holes for providing amphibian habitats in the three studied areas was equal to or higher than that of other wetland habitats. The state of functional connectivity and the contribution of kettle holes differed strongly depending on the species’ range. For the short-range species, landscapes were highly fragmented, and the contribution of kettle holes was much smaller than that of corridor habitats. For the long-range species, all habitats suited for amphibian reproduction were connected, and the contribution of kettle holes was similar to that of corridor habitats. However, the contribution of both was mostly redundant. Overall, the results showed that kettle holes play a crucial role in habitat provision and function as important stepping stone biotopes in agricultural landscapes. The clustering method applied in this study provides a simple tool for landscape planning and environmental protection agencies, which can be easily adapted to analyze functional connectivity and habitat interactions for different species or landscapes.

TI  - Assessing the importance of artificial canopy bridge design for Costa Rican monkeys in an experimental setting
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Although artificial crossing structures are increasingly implemented by conservationists and wildlife managers to connect fragmented wildlife habitat, the study of artificial crossing structure design, particularly of canopy bridges, is an emerging field of study in primatology. We address this issue by evaluating five competing bridge models with varying width, material stiffness, and substrate spacing. We assessed bridge preference and performance by sampling the behavior of three species of Costa Rican monkeys (<jats:italic>Alouatta palliata</jats:italic>: n = 4, <jats:italic>Ateles geoffroyi</jats:italic>: n = 3, <jats:italic>Cebus imitator</jats:italic>: n = 3). In a semi-wild setting, we used focal individual sampling with instantaneous recording once every minute for ten-minute intervals and all occurrences sampling whenever study subjects used the bridge. We hypothesized that monkeys prefer bridges that are more stable, and that are made of materials that resemble tree branches. During nearly 37 sampling hours we observed 119 crossing events. We found that study subjects prefer bridge models that are built using more rigid materials, such as the bamboo pole bridge, or wider bridges that offer more stability than narrower bridges. The bridge type and the materials used to build the bridges are both significant predictors of bridge use. While preference for bridges and their performance varies by species, the bamboo pole bridge model and the horizontal mesh bridge were preferred and performed best in our study. The simple liana bridge model was the least preferred by all species and performed poorly in comparison to the other models. Our findings will help us better understand how design and materials impact the use of canopy bridges by monkeys, which can help improve biological corridors and offer new information for the management and conservation of primates living near infrastructure corridors and other kinds of dangerous matrix.</jats:p>

TI  - Review of Ecosystem Level Impacts of Emerald Ash Borer on Black Ash Wetlands: What Does the Future Hold?
PY  - 2018
AB  - The emerald ash borer (EAB) is rapidly spreading throughout eastern North America and devastating ecosystems where ash is a component tree. This rapid and sustained loss of ash trees has already resulted in ecological impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and is projected to be even more severe as EAB invades black ash-dominated wetlands of the western Great Lakes region. Using two companion studies that are simulating short- and long-term EAB infestations and what is known from the literature, we synthesize our current limited understanding and predict anticipated future impacts of EAB on black ash wetlands. A key response to the die-back of mature black ash will be higher water tables and the potential for flooding and resulting changes to both the vegetation and animal communities. Although seedling planting studies have shown some possible replacement species, little is known about how the removal of black ash from the canopy will affect non-ash species growth and regeneration. Because black ash litter is relatively high in nitrogen, it is expected that there will be important changes in nutrient and carbon cycling and subsequent rates of productivity and decomposition. Changes in hydrology and nutrient and carbon cycling will have cascading effects on the biological community which have been scarcely studied. Research to address these important gaps is currently underway and should lead to alternatives to mitigate the effects of EAB on black ash wetland forests and develop management options pre- and post-EAB invasion.

TI  - Multi-criteria spatial identification of carnivore conservation areas under data scarcity and conflict: a jaguar case study in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Human–wildlife conflict, habitat loss, and prey hunting are the main threats to carnivore species worldwide. Forest conversion as consequence of deforestation and agricultural expansion increases the proximity between carnivores and humans, thereby escalating conflicts. Knowledge about carnivore species in data-poor countries, such as Colombia, is scarce which has the potential to result in poor landscape planning decisions. For many species, the only existing spatial information resides in expert-driven approaches which result in coarse-resolution ‘extent-of-occurrence’ maps. There is an increasing need for the development of methodologies to identify conservation and management areas at appropriate scales. Multi-criteria approaches will allow the inclusion of diverse species attributes enabling environmental institutions to address complex landscape decisions that result in conservation and management of carnivore habitat. We present a multi-criteria spatial identification tool for conservation and management areas, focused on Jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in northern Colombia. Our approach identifies areas based on the relationship between three spatial criteria: (1) suitable habitat patches, (2) habitat connectivity, and (3) zones of higher likelihood of human–jaguar conflict. We identified areas with the presence of at least one spatial criteria in 32% of the study area. Only 16.28% of these occur within protected areas (PAs) and the remaining fall on private lands (83.72%), either within (35.68%) or outside (48.04%) buffer zones of PAs. Our results highlight the need for multi-stakeholder collaborative approaches given that most proposed conservation areas fall on private rather than public lands.

TI  - Characterizing surrogacy performance in the systematic conservation planning of riverine networks
PY  - 2020
AB  - Priority‐area selection is a core phase of systematic conservation planning, often carried out using a single (surrogate) taxon. Efficient surrogates are expected to yield taxonomically representative priority areas that embrace the populations not only of the surrogate but also the surrogated taxa. Compared with the terrestrial realm, surrogacy performance of riverine taxa has received much less attention. This study compared the surrogacy performance of fishes (FI), macrophytes (MP), and benthic macroinvertebrates (MI) in terms of total area, connectedness, spatial congruence, and taxonomic representativeness of priority areas in the Middle Danube basin (Hungary). Setting three target values for each surrogate group, nine area prioritization designs were run by using a purpose‐written connectivity‐centric algorithm to emphasize the importance of longitudinal connectivity. FI provided the smallest, MP the intermediate, and MI the largest priority areas or solutions. Connectedness was greatest for FI, being one order of magnitude higher than for the other two groups. Pairwise spatial congruence was highest between FI and MP, lowest between MP and MI, and intermediate for FI and MI. MI yielded the most representative solutions, although the number of occurrences of the surrogated taxa in the solution, as a criterion of representation, modified the ratio of the taxa represented. Areas compiled from the overlapping parts of the surrogate‐specific priority sets proved to be smaller than, and similarly representative of, single‐taxon solutions. Taxon‐rich groups such as MI can serve as efficient surrogates, but that can result in larger solutions than for less taxon‐rich surrogates. Apart from the size, the compactness of the solutions seems to be determined by the identity of the surrogate taxa, and FI can be alternative surrogates in connectivity‐centric prioritization. At the same time, multi‐group approaches can enhance the robustness of area prioritization in terms of representativeness compared with single‐taxon procedures.

TI  - Construction, Evaluation, and Optimization of a Regional Ecological Security Pattern Based on MSPA-Circuit Theory Approach.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecological security is crucial for regional sustainable development; however, as modern urbanization highlights ecological security challenges, major challenges have arisen. In this paper, we take the ecological region around Taihu Lake, China, as a typical research site, extract important ecological sources and key nodes using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and circuit theory, and propose a regulatory framework for the ecological security pattern (ESP) of the ecological region based on the spatial characteristics of sources, corridors, and nodes. We obtained the following results: (1) The ESP includes 20 ecological sources, 37 ecological corridors, 36 critical ecological protection nodes, and 24 key ecological restoration nodes. (2) Most ecological sources are large and concentrated in western Zhejiang and west of Taihu Lake, which are both important ecological sources and ecological resistance surfaces. (3) The ecological corridors spread east, west, and south from Taihu Lake, with high network connectivity. (4) Shanghai serves as the central node, with the Su-Xi-Chang town cluster and the Qiantang River town cluster serving as the extension axes for the ecological resistance hot-spot area. The center of the elliptical ecological resistance surface (standard deviation) lies in Suzhou City, located on the east shore of Taihu Lake. (5) Ecological nodes were mostly located in ecological corridors or junctions. A "four zones and one belt" pattern is suggested in order to make the land around Taihu Lake more connected and stable ecologically. This study can be used as a guide for building and improving an ecological safety network.

TI  - Designing a spatial pattern to rebalance the orientation of development and protection in Wuhan
PY  - 2020
AB  - Patterns of spatial development and protection form a basic category of geoscience, and redesigning them is a popular subject of research in regional sustainable development that is important for ecological civilization construction. The authors here report a case study of Wuhan city using the circuit theory model and minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model to rebalance its spatial protection and development. The results show the following: (1) Using the density of the gross domestic product (GDP), density of population, rate of urbanization, and access to transportation as evaluation indicators, seven core areas of development in Wuhan were identified, accounting for 59% of the total number of streets, that exhibited a “circular-satellite” spatial structure. (2) According to the importance of ecosystem services, ecological sensitivity, land use type, and slope of the terrain, the resistance surface of spatial development in Wuhan had a stereoscopic spatial form of an “inverted pyramid,” with high surroundings and a low center. The area of low resistance accounted for 6.64% of the total area of Wuhan. (3) Based on coupling analysis using the MCR and spatial morphological characteristics of current, nine axes of spatial development with a total area of 427.27 km2 and eight key strategic points with a total area of 40.02 km2 were identified. Streets that were prioritized for development accounted for 9.63% of Wuhan’s total area. (4) By combining the characterization of the development axis with the structure of the three-level core area, we extracted the structure of spatial development of “one heart, two wings, and three belts” in Wuhan. The research framework and empirical results can provide scientific guidance for the urban spatial layout, the development of regional linkages, and ecological environmental protection in China.

TI  - Considering plant functional connectivity in landscape conservation and restoration management
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Landscape connectivity has traditionally been studied for animal species rather than for plants, especially under a multispecies approach. However, connectivity can be equally critical for both fauna and flora and, thus, an essential point in the selection of key management areas and measures. This paper explores a spatially explicit framework to assess the contribution of habitat patches in the conservation and enhancement of plant functional connectivity and habitat availability in a multispecies context. It relies on graph theory and a habitat availability index and differentiates between two management scenarios: (i) conservation; and (ii) restoration, by considering current and potential species distribution based on species distribution models together with a vegetation survey. The results mapped at high spatial resolution priority target areas to apply management measures. We found that intervening in a small proportion of the study area may lead to double the average overall landscape connectivity of the studied species. This study aimed at proposing an innovative methodology that allows studying connectivity for multiple plant species at landscape scale while integrating their individual characteristics. The proposed framework is a step toward incorporating connectivity concerns into plant biodiversity management, based on a better understanding of landscape structure and functionality. Here, we illustrated its significant potential for local conservation and restoration planning and resource optimization.</jats:p>

TI  - Contrasting responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in unmanaged grasslands
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The area of semi-natural grasslands has decreased dramatically causing many grassland specialist species to persist in small habitat fragments. Furthermore, ecological communities once shaped by disturbances related to traditional agriculture now face the impacts of modern agriculture and urbanization. Many of the species have become endangered due to the combined effects of habitat destruction and degradation. We studied the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, while accounting for the effects of local environmental conditions. We conducted vegetation surveys in 33 fragmented, unmanaged dry grasslands in Southwest Finland. A total of 191 vascular plant species and 60 bryophyte species were recorded. Higher vascular plant diversity was associated with higher historical connectivity, whereas bryophyte diversity declined with increasing current connectivity. Edaphic conditions, microclimate and disturbances were found to structure both vascular plant and bryophyte communities, but the responses to individual environmental variables were very different. The contrasting responses could be explained by the differences between the typical life-history strategies in vascular plants and bryophytes as well as resource competition between the two groups. These results highlight the need to consider different species groups when planning conservation measures. Vascular plant richness may best be conserved in connected grasslands whereas bryophyte richness in isolated ones. The results also indicated that trampling by humans could result in positive disturbance and to some extent help maintain richness of grassland specialist species.</jats:p>

TI  - Integrating a landscape connectivity approach into mitigation hierarchy planning by anticipating urban dynamics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Urbanization leads to land-use changes and landscape fragmentation, impacting natural habitats and their connectivity. In principle, many local decision-makers are obliged to adopt a mitigation hierarchy whereby development projects must be designed to avoid impacts on biodiversity, reduce, and ultimately compensate for the remaining impacts to reach the goal of no net loss (NNL) of biodiversity. In practice, however, both developers and regulators lack relevant practical tools to support their strategies to better anticipate and plan this mitigation hierarchy. More importantly, the available tools generally ignore connectivity issues and ecological constraints. Here, we propose an original methodology that anticipates future urban needs under different development scenarios and selects the most relevant strategies for biodiversity offsets (BO). We used a spatialized digital simulator (called SimUrba) to model fine-scale urban dynamics, combining it with ecological networks modelling based on graph theory to assess the environmental impacts of urbanization on a habitat connectivity index for focal species. We test the different outcomes produced by adopting two offset ratios (1:1 and 2:1) using this approach. The methodology is applied to empirical data on the future urban sprawl of a large French city up to 2040 under two realistic development scenarios currently discussed by policy-makers, and on 20 species that we grouped by type of habitat. Our results reveal that that the most highly impacted species are those associated with open and semi-open areas, and cultivated plots. Then, we identify the most promising cells for BO implementation to compensate for negative effects on habitat area, according to gains in habitat connectivity. We further show that using both private and public land can maximize habitat connectivity by including larger plots and reducing the number of plots needing long-term monitoring. Finally, we demonstrate that using standard offset ratios that ignore connectivity issues is very risky and can compromise any BO objective. Overall, we show that this framework provides decision-makers with a valuable and precise strategic tool that articulates land-use planning with ecological constraints to identify whether, how and where NNL objectives can be achieved.

TI  - A framework for application of the landscape approach to forest conservation and restoration in Sierra Leone
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Sierra Leone has made some progress in creating protected areas for wildlife and biodiversity conservation. Yet deforestation and habitat loss remain pervasive, driven largely by unregulated exploitation and poor land use practices. With over 50% of the country (∼36,000 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) having climate that is favorable for tropical forest vegetation, there is considerable opportunity to advance the landscape approach for forest conservation. We propose a framework to address this need for the globally threatened Upper Guinea rainforest, which has its westernmost extent in Sierra Leone. The framework considers forest and tree cover in the following categories: old growth, disturbed old growth, secondary growth, and managed. We discuss how this typology can foster application of the landscape approach to forest conservation and restoration, including policy options to enhance protection of forests, increase tree cover in production systems, and incentivize innovative land use practices by local communities.</jats:p>

TI  - Identifying environmental drivers of spatial genetic structure of the European pine marten ( Martes martes )
PY  - 2017
AB  - In a global context of erosion of biodiversity, the current environmental policy in Europe is oriented towards the creation and the preservation of ecological networks for wildlife. However, most of the management guidelines arose from a structural landscape diagnostic without truly taking into consideration species’ needs. We tested whether and how landscape elements influence the functional connectivity of landscapes for a forest specialist species, the European pine marten (Martes martes), in Northeastern France. We collected pine marten scats and tissues from 13 evenly distributed study sites across the whole study area in order to test several types of barriers such as highways, waterways, and open agricultural fields. We crossed the results of several methods: spatial autocorrelation analysis, causal modelling framework, and clustering methods. The study indicates significant genetic differentiation among the sampling sites. A signal of isolation by distance was detected but disappeared after partialling out landscape or barrier resistance. The only model that was fully supported by causal modelling was the one identifying waterways as the main driver of genetic differentiation. Moreover, clustering analyses indicated the presence of genetic clusters, suggesting that pine marten spatial genetic pattern could be explained by the presence of waterways but also by their reluctance to cross open fields. The current ecological network could thus be improved by increasing permeability of waterways, in particular navigation canals, and by maintaining and restoring forested corridors in agricultural plains.

TI  - Landscape Diversity for Reduced Risk of Insect Damage: A Case Study of Spruce Bud Scale in Latvia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Spruce bud scale (Physokermes piceae (Schrnk.)) has gained attention due to recent outbreaks in the eastern Baltic Sea region—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. In the spring of 2010, it spread rapidly across Latvia, affecting large areas of Norway spruce stands. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the effects of landscape heterogeneity on the damage caused by spruce bud scale in Norway spruce stands. In this study, we evaluated landscape metrics for middle-aged (40 to 70 years old) Norway spruce-dominated stands (>70% of stand’s basal area) in four of the most affected forest massifs and two unaffected forest massifs. We used a binary logistic generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMMs) to assess the effect of environmental factors on the abundance of the spruce bud scale. Our results show that increased local diversity within 100 m of a forest patch apparently reduced the probability of spruce bud scale presence. We also found that the diversity within 1000 m of a patch was associated with an increased probability of spruce bud scale damage. A quantitative analysis of landscape metrics in our study indicated that greater landscape-scale diversity of stands may reduce insect damages.

TI  - When is connectivity important? A case study of the spatial pattern of sudden oak death
PY  - 2010
AB  - Although connectivity has been examined from many different angles and in many ecological disciplines, few studies have tested in which systems and under what conditions connectivity is important in determining ecological dynamics. Identifying general rules governing when connectivity is important is crucial not only for basic ecology, but also for our ability to manage natural systems, particularly as increasing fragmentation may change the degree to which connectivity influences ecological dynamics. In this study, we used statistical regression, least-cost path analysis, and model selection techniques to test the relative importance of potential connectivity in determining the spatial pattern of sudden oak death, a tree disease that is killing millions of oak and tanoak trees along coastal forests of California and Oregon. We hypothesized that potential connectivity, in addition to environmental conditions, is important in determining the spatial distribution of sudden oak death, the importance of connectivity is more apparent when measured using biologically meaningful metrics that account for the effects of landscape structure on disease spread, and the relative importance of environmental variables and connectivity is approximately equal. Results demonstrate that potential connectivity was important in determining the spatial pattern of sudden oak death, though it was relatively less important than environmental variables. Moreover, connectivity was important only when using biologically meaningful metrics as opposed to simple distance-based metrics that ignore landscape structure. These results demonstrate that connectivity can be important in systems not typically considered in connectivity studies – highlighting the importance of examining connectivity in a variety of different systems – and demonstrate that the manner in which connectivity is measured may govern our ability to detect its importance.

TI  - Spatial replacement of dung beetles in edge-affected habitats: biotic homogenization or divergence in fragmented tropical forest landscapes?
PY  - 2016
AB  - Aim In this study, we investigate whether anthropogenic land use and habitat fragmentation lead to a process of either homogenization (decreasing spatial replacement and increasing nestedness) or divergence (increasing spatial replacement and decreasing nestedness) of dung beetle assemblages in edge-affected habitats. Location A fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest of north-east Brazil. Methods We investigate the extent to which beta diversity of dung beetle assemblages varies in edge-affected habitats at different spatial scales (i.e. traps along an interior–exterior nonlinear gradient, within and among habitats). We compare species replacement and nestedness of dung beetle assemblages using (1) multiple dissimilarity measures accounting for compositional heterogeneity across forest (i.e. forest edges, core primary forest areas and small fragments) and matrix habitats (i.e. sugar cane plantations and pastures) and (2) distance matrices accounting for the multivariate structure of dissimilarity. Results (1) Each habitat supported a distinct dung beetle assemblage; (2) there was a strong influence of anthropogenic land use and fragmentation-related effects on dung beetle β-diversity, with species replacements increasing in edge-affected and matrix habitats providing support for the divergence hypothesis at all spatial scales; (3) edge effects enhanced species replacement across assemblages; (4) dung beetle assemblages were not randomly distributed, with habitat type leading to a strongly nested pattern of species composition; and (5) both dung beetle replacement and nestedness were not correlated with geographic distance, whereby neighbouring sites were not necessarily more similar in their community composition. Main conclusions Species replacement is strongly influenced by habitat configuration and β-diversity increases in edge-affected habitats. Accordingly, anthropogenic land use and habitat fragmentation clearly promote community-level taxonomic divergence in human-modified landscapes. Landscape-scale divergence likely results from a non-random distribution of both forest-dependent and disturbance-adapted species across all habitats, which are in marked contrast in terms of suitability.

TI  - Assessment of the resilience of socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes: A case study from Lefke Region of North Cyprus
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study is to assess the resilience of socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS) of Lefke Region in North Cyprus in the face of disturbance factors (e.g. drought, urbanization and land abandonment) by adopting a set of indicators. The main objectives of the study include measurement of the respective resilience of the ecological, social and agricultural systems of the SEPLS by using relevant indicators. The method of the study consists of three parts: (i) conceptualization of the resilience of the SEPLS of Lefke Region to address the key systems (ecosystem, agricultural and social), their hierarchical structures, components and interrelations; (ii) development of a set of suitable resilience assessment indicators for these systems; (iii) for the development of resilience assessment indicators a participatory approach was designated to collect the relevant data. Accordingly, a multiple-choice questionnaire – consisting of 5 choices – was prepared and relevant data were collected from December 2015 to March 2016 in 12 villages through personal interviews with 106 respondents. The respondents have expressed their preferences by selecting the most suitable choice in 5 which were ordered from the lowest to the highest degree of resilience (1–5 point scale). The results of the evaluation revealed that the average values (importance) of the ecological, agricultural and social resilience are respectively 2,87 (low), 3,44 (moderate) and 2,53 (low) out of maximum 5-points. The overall resilience of the SEPLS was estimated to be low with a 2,94 magnitude. Finally, some conclusions (e.g. integrated landscape management) for strengthening the resilience of the SEPLS in Lefke Region in terms of biodiversity conservation, agricultural production and sustainable livelihood development were drawn based on the major findings of the study. It is expected that the findings and conclusions of this study can draw attention of policy makers and natural resource managers on building and strengthening the resilience of the SEPLS of Lefke Region in terms of biodiversity conservation, sustainable agricultural production and livelihood development.

TI  - Hilltopping influences spatial dynamics in a patchy population of tiger moths
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dispersal is a key driver of spatial population dynamics. Dispersal behavior may be shaped by many factors, such as mate-finding, the spatial distribution of resources, or wind and currents, yet most models of spatial dynamics assume random dispersal. We examined the spatial dynamics of a day-flying moth species (<jats:italic>Arctia virginalis</jats:italic>) that forms mating aggregations on hilltops (‘hilltopping’) based on long-term adult and larval population censuses. Using time-series models, we compared spatial population dynamics resulting from empirically-founded hilltop-based connectivity indices, and modeled the interactive effects of temperature, precipitation, and density dependence. Model comparisons supported hilltop-based connectivity metrics over random connectivity, suggesting an effect of hilltopping behavior on dynamics. We also found strong interactive effects of temperature and precipitation on dynamics. Simulations based on fitted time series models showed lower patch occupancy and regional synchrony, and higher colonization and extinction rates when hilltopping was included, with potential implications for the probability of persistence of the patch network. Overall, our results show the potential for dispersal behavior to have important effects on spatial population dynamics and persistence, and we advocate inclusion of such non-random dispersal in metapopulation models.</jats:p>

TI  - Effects of wind-driven spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity on high-altitude wetland macroinvertebrate assemblages with contrasting dispersal modes
PY  - 2014
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Dispersal is a major determinant of connectivity between communities that may modulate theimportance of environmental and spatial processes on taxonomic composition. While wind is likelyto inﬂuence transport distance, rate and direction for numerous species, its effects on communitycomposition remain poorly understood.2. Using eigenvector-based spatial analyses, we investigated the inﬂuence of wind ﬂows, estimatedby mesoscale models, on the spatial structure of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages with con-trasting ﬂying abilities in high Andean wetlands (26–32 S). We further quantiﬁed the relative impor-tance of local and regional processes through a variation partitioning approach.3. The inﬂuence of environmental heterogeneity was prevalent and of relatively similar amplitude inboth ﬂying and non-ﬂying assemblages. Signiﬁcant spatial structure more strongly driven by windﬂows than by Euclidean schemes was detected for both assemblages. As expected, the highest levelsof spatial structure were observed for the ﬂying macroinvertebrate assemblage and they occurred ata much larger spatial scale in this group, suggesting a greater dispersal aptitude of the ﬂying taxa.4. Our results show that environmental effects are predominant in shaping the spatial structure ofmacroinvertebrate communities in high Andean wetlands, as generally found in other systems. Theyalso demonstrate the signiﬁcance of wind ﬂows in regulating high-altitude wetland macroinverte-brate communities and illustrate the importance of considering adequate spatial models and biologi-cal characteristics of species to advance our understanding of community patterns.Keywords: benthic macroinvertebrates, dispersal, eigenvector maps, wetlands, wind

TI  - MetaConnect, a new platform for population viability modelling to assist decision makers in conservation and urban planning
PY  - 2020
AB  - In a context of global change, scientists and policy-makers require tools to address the issue of biodiversity loss. Population viability analysis (PVA) has been the main tool to deal with this problem. However, the tools developed during the 90s poorly integrate recent scientific advances in landscape genetics and dispersal. We developed a flexible and modular modelling platform for PVA that addresses many of the limitations of existing software. MetaConnect is an individual-based, process-based and PVA-oriented modelling platform which could be used as a research or a decision-making tool. Here, we present the core base modelling of MetaConnect. We demonstrate its potential use through a case study illustrating the platform9s capability for performing integrated PVA including extinction probability estimation, genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity analysis. We used MetaConnect to assess the impact of infrastructure works on the natterjack toad metapopulation functioning.

TI  - Contemporary spatial and environmental factors determine vascular plant species richness on highly fragmented meadows in Central Finland
PY  - 2018
AB  - Habitat loss is a major threat to biodiversity. It can create temporal lags in decline of species in relation to destruction of habitat coverage. Plant species specialized in semi-natural grasslands, especially meadows, often express such extinction debt. We studied habitat loss and fragmentation of meadows and examined whether the changes in meadow coverage had caused an extinction debt on vascular plants. We also studied whether historical or present landscape patterns or contemporary environmental factors were more important determinants of species occurrence. We surveyed the plant species assemblages of 12 grazed and 12 mown meadows in Central Finland and detected the meadow coverages from their surroundings on two spatial scales and on three time steps. We modelled the effects of functional connectivity, habitat amount, and isolation on species richness and community composition. We observed drastic and dynamic meadow loss in landscapes surrounding our study sites during the last 150 years. However, we did not find explicit evidence for an extinction debt in meadow plants. The observed species richness correlated with contemporary factors, whereas both contemporary factors and habitat availability during the 1960s affected community composition. Effective conservation management of meadow biodiversity builds on accurate understanding of the relative importance of past and present factors on species assemblages. Both mown and grazed meadows with high species richness need to be managed in the future. The management effort should preferably be targeted to sites located near to each other.

TI  - Incorporating within- and between-patch resource selection in identification of critical habitat for brood-rearing greater sage-grouse
PY  - 2015
AB  - Incorporating information on animal behavior in resource-based predictive modeling (e.g., occurrence mapping) can elucidate the relationship between process and spatial pattern and depict habitat in terms of its structure as well as its function. In this paper, we assigned location data on brood-rearing greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) to either within-patch (encamped) or between-patch (traveling) behavioral modes by estimating a movement-based relative displacement index. Objectives were to estimate and validate spatially explicit models of within- versus between-patch resource selection for application in habitat management and compare these models to a non-behaviorally adjusted model. A single model, the vegetation and water resources model, was most plausible for both the encamped and traveling modes, including the non-behaviorally adjusted model. When encamped, sage-grouse selected for taller shrubs, avoided bare ground, and were closer to mesic areas. Traveling sage-grouse selected for greater litter cover and herbaceous vegetation. Preference for proximity to mesic areas was common to both encamped and traveling modes and to the non-behaviorally adjusted model. The non-behaviorally adjusted map was similar to the encamped model and validated well. However, we observed different selection patterns during traveling that could have been masked had behavioral state not been accounted for. Characterizing habitat that structured between-patch movement broadens our understanding of the habitat needs of brood-rearing sage-grouse, and the combined raster surface offers a reliable habitat management tool that is readily amenable to application by GIS users in efforts to focus sustainable landscape management.

TI  - On the limitations of graph‐theoretic connectivity in spatial ecology and conservation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Applications of graph-theoretic connectivity are increasing at an exponential rate in ecology and conservation. Here, limitations of these measures are summarized. 2. Graph-theoretic connectivity measures are fundamentally limited as they require specification of a habitat quality threshold to allow definition of habitat patches (nodes). Frequently, a second threshold (critical dispersal distance) is applied in the identification of graph edges. 3. Graph-theoretic measures are poorly applicable to large-scale, high-resolution, grid-based data that describe distributions of species in habitats of varying quality. 4. Graph-theoretic connectivity primarily concerns the emigration-immigration component of spatial population-dynamics. Therefore, it cannot alone answer questions about the regional population size, resilience or persistence of a focal species. 5.Synthesis and applications: Conservation managers in particular should appreciate these limitations before applying graph-theoretic analysis to spatial conservation planning.

TI  - Forest Connectivity Regions of Canada Using Circuit Theory and Image Analysis.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Ecological processes are increasingly well understood over smaller areas, yet information regarding interconnections and the hierarchical nature of ecosystems remains less studied and understood. Information on connectivity over large areas with high resolution source information provides for both local detail and regional context. The emerging capacity to apply circuit theory to create maps of omnidirectional connectivity provides an opportunity for improved and quantitative depictions of forest connectivity, supporting the formation and testing of hypotheses about the density of animal movement, ecosystem structure, and related links to natural and anthropogenic forces. In this research, our goal was to delineate regions where connectivity regimes are similar across the boreal region of Canada using new quantitative analyses for characterizing connectivity over large areas (e.g., millions of hectares). Utilizing the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of forests (EOSD) circa 2000 Landsat-derived land-cover map, we created and analyzed a national-scale map of omnidirectional forest connectivity at 25m resolution over 10000 tiles of 625 km2 each, spanning the forested regions of Canada. Using image recognition software to detect corridors, pinch points, and barriers to movements at multiple spatial scales in each tile, we developed a simple measure of the structural complexity of connectivity patterns in omnidirectional connectivity maps. We then mapped the Circuitscape resistance distance measure and used it in conjunction with the complexity data to study connectivity characteristics in each forested ecozone. Ecozone boundaries masked substantial systematic patterns in connectivity characteristics that are uncovered using a new classification of connectivity patterns that revealed six clear groups of forest connectivity patterns found in Canada. The resulting maps allow exploration of omnidirectional forest connectivity patterns at full resolution while permitting quantitative analyses of connectivity over broad areas, informing modeling, planning and monitoring efforts.

TI  - Reconstructing Long Term High Andean Forest Dynamics Using Historical Aerial Imagery: A Case Study in Colombia
PY  - 2020
AB  - High Andean forests are biodiversity hotspots that also play key roles in the provisioning of vital ecosystem services for neighboring cities. In past centuries, the hinterland of Andean fast-growing cities often experienced a dramatic decline in forested areas, but there are reports that forest cover has been recovering recently. We analyzed aerial imagery spanning the years 1940 to 2007 from nine administrative localities in the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia in order to elucidate precise patterns of forest vegetation change. To this aim, we performed image object-based classification by means of texture analysis and image segmentation. We then derived connectivity metrics to investigate whether forest cover trajectories showed an increase or decrease in fragmentation and landscape degradation. We observed a forest cover recovery in all the examined localities, except one. In general, forest recovery was accompanied by an increase in core habitat areas. The time scale of the positive trends identified partially coincides with the creation of protected areas in the region, which very likely furthered the recovery of forest patches. This study unveils the long-term dynamics of peri-urban high Andean forest cover, providing valuable information on historical vegetation changes in a highly dynamic landscape.

TI  - Landscape-level comparison of genetic diversity and differentiation in a small mammal inhabiting different fragmented landscapes of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
PY  - 2013
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have detrimental effects on all levels of biodiversity, including genetic variation. Most studies that investigate genetic effects of habitat loss and fragmentation focus on analysing genetic data from a single landscape. However, our understanding of habitat loss effects on landscape-wide patterns of biodiversity would benefit from studies that are based on quantitative comparisons among multiple study landscapes. Here, we use such a landscape-level study design to compare genetic variation in the forest-specialist marsupial Marmosops incanus from four 10,000-hectare Atlantic forest landscapes which differ in the amount of their remaining native forest cover (86, 49, 31, 11 %). Additionally, we used a model selection framework to evaluate the influence of patch characteristics on genetic variation within each landscape. We genotyped 529 individuals with 12 microsatellites to statistically compare estimates of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation in populations inhabiting different forest patches within the landscapes. Our study indicates that before the extinction of the specialist species (here in the 11 % landscape) genetic diversity is significantly reduced in the 31 % landscape, while genetic differentiation is significantly higher in the 49 and 31 % landscapes compared to the 86 % landscape. Results further provide evidence for non-proportional responses of genetic diversity and differentiation to increasing habitat loss, and suggest that local patch isolation impacts gene flow and genetic connectivity only in the 31 % landscape. These results have high relevance for analysing landscape genetic relationships and emphasize the importance of landscape-level study designs for understanding habitat loss effects on all levels of biodiversity.

TI  - Co-designing an Indicator of Habitat Connectivity for England
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Landscapes have been drastically transformed by human activities, generally resulting in the loss of semi-natural habitat. In the United Kingdom, wildlife habitat mainly consists of small patches of semi-natural habitat that are poorly connected to each other. In May 2019 the United Kingdom Government published an outcome indicator framework for measuring progress against the goals and outcomes of the 25 Year Environment Plan (YEP) for England. The indicator of the Quantity, Quality and Connectivity of Habitats (D1) is one of seven indicators within the Wildlife theme and it follows the principle of making areas of semi-natural habitat “more, bigger, better and joined up.” In this study, we describe the process of co-designing the connectivity metric for indicator D1. In consultation with experts and stakeholders we selected three candidate landscape connectivity metrics to produce the indicator. The first metric comes from a suite of rules of thumb for practitioners and it is the proportion of habitat patches in the landscape that have a nearest neighbor ≤ 1 km away. The second metric is a habitat fragmentation index from the Natural England National Biodiversity Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Tool (NBCCVAT). The third and final metric is from the software Condatis and it represents the ability of a species to move through a landscape. We tested each metric on a set of simulated landscapes representing different levels of habitat addition strategies and different spatial configurations. We asked if the metrics are able to detect changes in the connectivity of each of these landscapes after habitat addition. Two of the three metrics (NBCCVAT and Condatis) performed well and were sensitive to change. They both increased as the total extent of habitat increased and each showed particular sensitivity to one spatial arrangement over the other. Given these results, one or both of these metrics could be used to produce the indicator. We discuss the implications of using one or both of the metrics and highlight the fundamental choices that need to be made to produce the indicator.</jats:p>

TI  - Investigating and Managing the Rapid Emergence of White‐Nose Syndrome, a Novel, Fatal, Infectious Disease of Hibernating Bats
PY  - 2011
AB  - White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fatal disease of bats that hibernate. The etiologic agent of WNS is the fungus Geomyces destructans, which infects the skin and wing membranes. Over 1 million bats in six species in eastern North America have died from WNS since 2006, and as a result several species of bats may become endangered or extinct. Information is lacking on the pathogenesis of G. destructans and WNS, WNS transmission and maintenance, individual and site factors that contribute to the probability of an outbreak of WNS, and spatial dynamics of WNS spread in North America. We considered how descriptive and ana- lytical epidemiology could be used to fill these information gaps, including a four-step (modified) outbreak investigation, application of a set of criteria (Hill's) for assessing causation, compartment models of disease dynamics, and spatial modeling. We cataloged and critiqued adaptive-management options that have been either previously proposed for WNS or were helpful in addressing other emerging diseases of wild animals. These include an ongoing program of prospective surveillance of bats and hibernacula for WNS, treatment of individual bats, increasing population resistance to WNS (through vaccines, immunomodulators, or other methods), improving probability of survival from starvation and dehydration associated with WNS, modi- fying hibernacula environments to eliminate G. destructans, culling individuals or populations, controlling anthropogenic spread of WNS, conserving genetic diversity of bats, and educating the public about bats and bat conservation issues associated with WNS.

TI  - Functional connectivity in ruminants: A generalized state-dependent modelling approach.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Animal behaviour is increasingly seen as an important component in maintaining functional connectivity between patches in fragmented landscapes. However, models that explicitly incorporate behavioural trade-offs are rarely applied to landscape planning problems like connectivity. The aim of this study was to explore how state-dependent behaviour influenced functional connectivity between patches from a theoretical perspective. We investigated how inter-patch distances influenced functional connectivity using a dynamic state variable model framework. The decision making process of an individual ruminant facing fitness trade-offs in staying in its patch of origin or moving to another patch at various distances were explicitly modelled. We incorporated energetic costs and predation costs of feeding, ruminating, and resting while in the patch and for transit between patches based on inter-patch distance. Functional connectivity was maintained with isolated patches when they offered high intake and the inactivity of rumination associated with rapid gut fill resulted in reduced predation risk. Nevertheless, individuals in high energetic state often would forgo moving to another patch, whereas individuals in poor energetic states were forced to accept the cost of movement to best meet their requirements in the distant patch. The inclusion of state-dependent behavioural models provides important insights into functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes and helps integrate animal behaviour into landscape planning. We discuss the consequences of our findings for landscape planning to show how the approach provides a heuristic tool to assess alternative scenarios for restoring landscape functional connectivity.

TI  - Anthropogenic pressures drive population genetic structuring across a Critically Endangered lemur species range
PY  - 2019
AB  - In recent decades Madagascar has experienced significant habitat loss and modification, with minimal understanding of how human land use practices have impacted the evolution of its flora and fauna. In light of ongoing and intensifying anthropogenic pressures, we seek new insight into mechanisms driving genetic variability on this island, using a Critically Endangered lemur species, the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), as a test case. Here, we examine the relative influence of natural and anthropogenic landscape features that we predict will impose barriers to dispersal and promote genetic structuring across the species range. Using circuit theory, we model functional connectivity among 18 sampling localities using population-based genetic distance (FST). We optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and assessed their performance using maximum-likelihood population-effects mixed models. The best supported resistance model was a composite surface that included two anthropogenic features, habitat cover and distance to villages, suggesting that rapid land cover modification by humans has driven change in the genetic structure of wild lemurs. Primary conservation priority should be placed on mitigating further forest loss and connecting regions identified as having low dispersal potential to prevent further loss of genetic diversity and promote the survival of other moist forest specialists.

TI  - Robustness and disturbances in public transport
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Network-based systems are at the core of our everyday life. Whether it is electronic networking, electricity grids or transportation, users expect the networks to function properly and provide a feeling of safety and security. However, there may be disturbances. In this paper, we consider disturbances in the context of public transportation. The focus in this respect is on public transport planning and operations. To classify and cope with disturbances, one can find many ideas, including robustness, resilience, vulnerability, disruption mitigation or delay management. We survey related streams of literature and put them into perspective. As a major insight we show that different strands of literature exist that may benefit from becoming better connected and intertwined. Together with recent advances in information technology and solution methods, more integrated problem settings incorporating robustness and disturbances can play a major role in future planning and operations.</jats:p>

TI  - The ecological impact of city lighting scenarios: exploring gap crossing thresholds for urban bats.
PY  - 2015
AB  - As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps.

TI  - Conserving threatened riparian ecosystems in the American West: Precipitation gradients and river networks drive genetic connectivity and diversity in a foundation riparian tree (Populus angustifolia)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Gene flow is an evolutionary process that supports genetic connectivity and contributes to the capacity of species to adapt to environmental change. Yet, for most species, little is known about the specific environmental factors that influence genetic connectivity, or their effects on genetic diversity and differentiation. We used a landscape genetic approach to understand how geography and climate influence genetic connectivity in a foundation riparian tree (Populus angustifolia), and their relationships with specieswide patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation. Using multivariate restricted optimization in a reciprocal causal modelling framework, we quantified the relative contributions of riparian network connectivity, terrestrial upland resistance and climate gradients on genetic connectivity. We found that (i) all riparian corridors, regardless of river order, equally facilitated connectivity, while terrestrial uplands provided 2.5× more resistance to gene flow than riparian corridors. (ii) Cumulative differences in precipitation seasonality and precipitation of the warmest quarter were the primary climatic factors driving genetic differentiation; furthermore, maximum climate resistance was 45× greater than riparian resistance. (iii) Genetic diversity was positively correlated with connectivity (R2 = 0.3744, p = .0019), illustrating the utility of resistance models for identifying landscape conditions that can support a species' ability to adapt to environmental change. From these results, we present a map highlighting key genetic connectivity corridors across P. angustifolia's range that if disrupted could have long-term ecological and evolutionary consequences. Our findings provide recommendations for conservation and restoration management of threatened riparian ecosystems throughout the western USA and the high biodiversity they support.

TI  - Indicators for assessing the robustness of metapopulations against habitat loss
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from environmental changes are main drivers of global biodiversity loss, as the survival of metapopulations relies on the ability of individuals to disperse among suitable habitat patches. To prioritize conservation efforts, methods are needed for evaluating the robustness of metapopulations against habitat loss. We therefore investigate this robustness for different degrees of habitat loss, for different types of habitat loss (random, peripheral, and contagious) and of habitat networks, and for species differing in their local-extinction risks and dispersal ranges. In particular, we analyse several standard network types (with random, regular, small-world, or scale-free structure) and compare them with several alternative network types derived from real-world two-dimensional habitat landscapes (with random, clustered, or contiguous habitat allocation). Furthermore, we investigate how well 29 different graph-theoretic metrics of habitat networks can serve as indicators of metapopulation robustness against habitat loss – as this approach, where feasible, allows replacing complex simulation-based predictions with simple indicator-based predictions. We find that responses of species to habitat loss on the considered landscape-based habitat networks qualitatively differ from those on the considered standard habitat networks. This suggests that results obtained for the latter, albeit widely examined in the literature, can be unrepresentative and misleading. As expected, species with high risks of local extinction and short dispersal ranges are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss, across all considered types of habitat loss and habitat networks. The graph-theoretic network metric that best explains the robustness of metapopulations against habitat loss depends on the considered types of species, habitat networks, and habitat loss. None of the examined metrics give consistently reliable predictions under all circumstances. For sensitive species, characterized by high local-extinction risks and short dispersal ranges, a network’s average clique size, redundancy, average degree, connectance, clustering coefficient, and average closeness centrality are the best indicators of metapopulation robustness. For landscape-based habitat networks, a network’s average clique size, beta coefficient, clustering coefficient, redundancy, and cyclomatic number work best. For contagious habitat loss, the network type has a particularly strong impact on the species-specific robustness against habitat loss. In summary, our study introduces a method for evaluating the robustness of metapopulations against habitat loss and shows that a network’s clustering coefficient, under a wide range of circumstances, is a particularly reliable indicator of this robustness.

TI  - The dynamics of landscape-scale ecological connectivity based on least-cost model in Dongshan Island, China
PY  - 2017
AB  - As a hot topic in Landscape Ecology study, ecological connectivity is an important indicator for regional land sustainable use and biological protection. This paper conducted a systematic assessment of ecological connectivity using remote sensing images of Dongshan Island in 1994, 2003 and 2011. Based on least-cost modelling, the method takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use types to obtain the Barrier Effect Index (BEI) and Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI). The application of this method to Dongshan Island showed the ecological connectivity index (ECI) was low in 1994, improved in 2003, and decreased significantly in 2011. The results of the dynamic analysis of landscape structure showed farmland and roads were the main landscape classes that caused the low observed ECI in 1994 and 2003; these tended to divide the landscape and cause fragmentation. Construction land and roads were the main landscape classes resulting in low ECI in 2011, while forest and grassland had a high ECI. Trajectory analysis showed ECI tended to decrease in the low mountain forest zone of the northwestern and southeastern parts of Dongshan Island as well as in the coastal protection forest area. The areas where ECI became high were located in the northeastern part of Dongshan Island where cities and towns are concentrated with high human populations. Therefore, rapid urbanization has been the most important factor driving changes in landscape structure and patterns during the last 17 years on Dongshan Island. The approach not only assists us in revealing the driving mechanism of landscape dynamics from another aspect, but also can assess the impacts of regional and urban plans on landscape structure and function.

TI  - Mapping ecosystem services provided by wetlands at multiple spatiotemporal scales: A case study in Quebec, Canada.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Wetlands are affected by climate and anthropogenic changes, which influence the ecosystem services (ES) they provide. This study presents a spatially explicit quantification of wetland ESs. The study site is the Yamaska river watershed located in Quebec, Canada. The proposed approach includes four main steps: (1) statistical selection of function indicators (FI) to build a composite ecosystem service indicator (ESI); (2) temporal land use mapping for past (1984), recent (2011) and future scenarios (2050); (3) mapping and quantification of FIs and ESIs at all temporal and spatial scales; and (4) synthesis of multispatial and multitemporal information using a diagram representation. Results present the spatiotemporal evolution of the ES on maintaining habitat provided by wetlands in the studied watershed. The historical characterization shows a general degradation of this service on the entire study area for the last 30 years. The proposed approach can target priority sectors in which this service has deteriorated or is lacking. Future scenarios show the urgency to act in order to preserve current intact areas, because even the optimistic scenario indicates that the studied ES would not return to its 1984 state. The proposed approach allows a spatiotemporal mapping of ESs combined with a visualization of their ecological, social, and economic components in a context of territorial management scenarios. This multi-scale method is reproducible, robust and can be replicated for other ESs in different territories.

TI  - Quantifying changes of landscape connectivity based on ecological process simulation in a rapidly urbanized city: Nanjing, China
PY  - 2021
AB  - The dramatic land use and cover change (LUCC) is one of the major threats to biological conservation as landscape connectivity decreases and necessary ecological process is broken in rapidly urbanized regions. Although most ecological conservation plans aim to restore connectivity based on modeled data or empirical field investigation, few evaluate the changes of landscape connectivity quantitatively, especially from the perspective of regional LUCC analysis and simulation of potential ecological process. We took rapidly urbanized Nanjing in eastern China as the case, simulated potential ecological processes and mapped landscape corridors with minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. We then calculated the cumulative resistance values (CRVs) of the indicated corridors to reflect the quantitative changes of landscape connectivity. The potential least-cost paths (LCPs) of MCR model indicated the directions of the landscape corridors and they mostly followed the continuous rivers. Although most LCPs showed similar directions in 2000 and 2015, some significantly changed, especially those to the suburban targets where dramatic LUCCs formed barriers and caused obvious landscape fragmentation. The quantitative results of CRVs on the 2000’s LCPs showed a great increase from 2000 to 2015, indicating the decrease of landscape connectivity related with significant LUCCs from non-construction to construction lands. However, the CRVs of the 2015’s LCPs were mostly lower and did not change too much in 2000 and 2015. From the perspective of LUCCs, most inner buffers of the LCPs were dominated by waters and showed fewer changes comparing with outer buffers, especially those of the 2015’s LCPs. Therefore, it is concluded the 2015’s LCPs can maintain higher and more stable landscape connectivity as more ecologically suitable lands exist there in 2000 and 2015. To be specific, it is of lower cost to design the landscape corridors at the 0–50 m buffers, where limited land use adjustments are required in some new towns or industrial parks.

TI  - Assessing the role of landscape connectivity in recent woodpecker range expansion in Mediterranean Europe: forest management implications
PY  - 2012
AB  - Woodpecker species have significantly expanded their ranges in the last decades of the twentieth century in Mediterranean Europe, which seems to be closely related to forest maturation following large-scale decline in traditional uses. Here we assess the explicit role of forest landscape connectivity in the colonization of the Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) and the Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) in Catalonia (NE Spain). For this purpose we combined data on breeding bird atlas (10 × 10 km; 1980–2000) and forest inventories (c. 1 × 1 km, 2000). Forest connectivity was measured through graph theory and habitat availability metrics (inter- and intra-patch connectivity) according to species median natal dispersal distances. The best regressions from a set of alternative models were selected based on AICc. Results showed that connectivity between areas of mature forests [diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥ 35 cm] affected Black Woodpecker colonization events. The probability of colonization of the Great Spotted Woodpecker was greater at localities near the sources of colonization in 1980 and with a high connectivity with other less developed forest patches (dbh < 35 cm). The spatial grain at which landscape connectivity was measured influenced the model performance according to the species dispersal abilities, with the species with the lower mobility (D. major) responding better to the forest connectivity patterns at finer spatial scales. Overall, it seems that both species could expand further in European Mediterranean forests in upcoming years but at slower rates if landscape connectivity according to species requirements does not continue to increase. Hence, a proactive and adaptive management should be carried out in order to preserve these species while considering the related major impacts of global change in Mediterranean Europe.

TI  - Effect of Planning for Connectivity on Linear Reserve Networks
PY  - 2013
AB  - Although the concept of connectivity is decades old, it remains poorly understood and defined, and some argue that habitat quality and area should take precedence in conservation planning instead. However, fragmented landscapes are often characterized by linear features that are inherently connected, such as streams and hedgerows. For these, both representation and connectivity targets may be met with little effect on the cost, area, or quality of the reserve network. We assessed how connectivity approaches affect planning outcomes for linear habitat networks by using the stock-route network of Australia as a case study. With the objective of representing vegetation communities across the network at a minimal cost, we ran scenarios with a range of representation targets (10%, 30%, 50%, and 70%) and used 3 approaches to account for connectivity (boundary length modifier, Euclidean distance, and landscape-value [LV]). We found that decisions regarding the target and connectivity approach used affected the spatial allocation of reserve systems. At targets ≥50%, networks designed with the Euclidean distance and LV approaches consisted of a greater number of small reserves. Hence, by maximizing both representation and connectivity, these networks compromised on larger contiguous areas. However, targets this high are rarely used in real-world conservation planning. Approaches for incorporating connectivity into the planning of linear reserve networks that account for both the spatial arrangement of reserves and the characteristics of the intervening matrix highlight important sections that link the landscape and that may otherwise be overlooked. El Efecto de la Planeacion para la Conectividad en Redes de Reservas Lineales Resumen Aunque el concepto de conectividad tiene varias decadas sigue poco entendido y definido y hay quienes discuten que la calidad de habitat y area deberia partir del planeamiento de conservacion. Sin embargo los paisajes fragmentados caracterizados generalmente estan por caracteres lineales que estan inherentemente conectados, como arroyos e hileras de arbustos. Para estos, tanto la representacion como los objetivos de conectividad pueden ser enfrentados con pocos efectos en el costo, area, o calidad de los sistemas de la reserva. Evaluamos como las aproximaciones de conectividad afectan los resultados de planeacion para sistemas de habitats lineales utilizando el sistema de rutas de ganado de Australia como un estudio de caso. Con el objetivo de representar a las comunidades vegetales a traves del sistema con un costo minimo realizamos escenarios con un rango de objetivos de representacion (10%, 30%, 50% y 70%) y utilizamos 3 aproximaciones que representaron la conectividad (modificador de la longitud de frontera, distancia Euclidiana y valor de paisaje). Encontramos que las decisiones correspondientes al objetivo y a la aproximacion de conectividad que se usaron afectaron la colocacion espacial de los sistemas de reservas. En objetivos ≥50%, los sistemas disenados con distancia Euclidiana y aproximaciones de valor de paisaje consistieron de un mayor numero de reservas pequenas. Por lo tanto, al maximizar tanto la representacion como la conectividad, estos sistemas se comprometieron en areas contiguas mas grandes. Sin embargo, rara vez se usan objetivos tan altos en la planeacion de la conservacion. Las aproximaciones para incorporar la conectividad a las redes de reservas lineales que representan tanto el acomodo espacial de las reservas como las caracteristicas de la matriz resaltan secciones importantes que conectan al paisaje y que de otra forma podrian ser ignorados.

TI  - Ecosystem services provided by a complex coastal region: challenges of classification and mapping.
PY  - 2016
AB  - A variety of ecosystem services classification systems and mapping approaches are available in the scientific and technical literature, which needs to be selected and adapted when applied to complex territories (e.g. in the interface between water and land, estuary and sea). This paper provides a framework for addressing ecosystem services in complex coastal regions. The roadmap comprises the definition of the exact geographic boundaries of the study area; the use of CICES (Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services) for ecosystem services identification and classification; and the definition of qualitative indicators that will serve as basis to map the ecosystem services. Due to its complexity, the Ria de Aveiro coastal region was selected as case study, presenting an opportunity to explore the application of such approaches at a regional scale. The main challenges of implementing the proposed roadmap, together with its advantages are discussed in this research. The results highlight the importance of considering both the connectivity of natural systems and the complexity of the governance framework; the flexibility and robustness, but also the challenges when applying CICES at regional scale; and the challenges regarding ecosystem services mapping.

TI  - Pond creation and restoration: patterns of odonate colonization and community dynamics
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ponds are lentic waterbodies with a high conservation value for biodiversity that have long been overlooked by management policies. Recent initiatives aimed to promote the conservation of these ecosystems by restoring or creating new ponds throughout Europe. Therefore, studying responses of aquatic invertebrates to local pond characteristics and connectivity between them is determinant to understand community dynamics and colonization processes of these scattered ecosystems. We studied larval communities of odonates in 20 created or restored ponds to assess their colonization during the first 2 or 3 years. Community dynamics in relation to pond vegetation, landscape context and connectivity with other ponds were also investigated. No difference in species richness was found between restored and created ponds. Most species colonized the ponds during the first year, but a different pattern in colonization was observed between Anisoptera and Zygoptera. Community composition was related to the landscape context of ponds and the time since pond creation or restoration. Abundances were positively related to pond connectivity, especially in the suborder Zygoptera. No relationship was found between vegetation and Anisopteran larvae, while Zygoptera seem more sensible to the vegetation structure due to their endophytic oviposition. This work confirms the high colonization capacity of odonates and shows that creation of new ponds could be as efficient as pond restoration to enhance the conservation of freshwater species. It also highlights that landscape characteristics and connectivity between ponds are determinant to support higher abundances and a posteriori increase population viability at the landscape scale.

TI  - Combined Impacts of Predation, Mutualism and Dispersal on the Dynamics of a Four-Species Ecological System
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Multi-species and ecosystem models have provided ecologist with an excellent opportunity to study the effects of multiple biotic interactions in an ecological system. Predation and mutualism are among the most prevalent biotic interactions in the multi-species system. Several ecological studies exist, but they are based on one-or two-species interactions, and in real life, multiple interactions are natural characteristics of a multi-species community. Here, we use a system of partial differential equations to study the combined effects of predation, mutualism and dispersal on the multi-species coexistence and community stability in the ecological system. Our results show that predation provided a defensive mechanism against the negative consequences of the multiple species interactions by reducing the net effect of competition. Predation is critical in the stability and coexistence of the multi-species community. The combined effects of predation and dispersal enhance the multiple species coexistence and persistence. Dispersal exerts a positive effect on the system by supporting multiple species coexistence and stability of community structures. Dispersal process also reduces the adverse effects associated with multiple species interactions. Additionally, mutualism induces oscillatory behaviour on the system through Hopf bifurcation. The roles of mutualism also support multiple species coexistence mechanisms (for some threshold values) by increasing the stable coexistence and the stable limit cycle regions. We discover that the stability and coexistence mechanisms are controlled by the transcritical and Hopf bifurcation that occurs in this system. Most importantly, our results show the important influences of predation, mutualism and dispersal in the stability and coexistence of the multi-species communities</jats:p>

TI  - Spatial genetic analysis of the grass snake, Natrix natrix (Squamata: Colubridae), in an intensively used agricultural landscape
PY  - 2010
AB  - Both the conversion of natural habitats to farmland and efforts at increasing the yield of existing crops contribute to a decline in biodiversity. As a consequence of land conversion, specialised species are restricted to remnants of original habitat patches, which are frequently isolated. This may lead to a genetic differentiation of the subpopulations. We used seven microsatellite markers to examine the genetic population structure of the grass snake, Natrix natrix (Linnaeus, 1758), sampled in remnants of pristine habitat embedded in an intensively used agricultural landscape in north-western Switzerland. The study area, a former wetland, has been drained and gradually converted into an agricultural plain in the last century, reducing the pristine habitat to approximately 1% of the entire area. The grass snake feeds almost entirely on amphibians, and is therefore associated with wetlands. In Central Europe, the species shows severe decline, most probably as a result of wetland drainage and decrease of amphibian populations. We found no genetically distinct grass snake populations in the study area covering 90 km2. This implies that there is an exchange of individuals between small remnants of original habitat. Thus, gene flow may prevent any genetic differentiation of subpopulations distributed over a relatively large area. Our results show that a specialized snake species can persist in an intensively used agricultural landscape, provided that suitable habitat patches are interconnected. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 101, 51–58.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Mitigation Wetland Site Selection: A Case Study in Gwacheon, Korea
PY  - 2015
AB  - This paper presents an integrated approach to mitigation wetland site selection using functional landscape connectivity and landscape structure. This approach enables landscape designers to evaluate the relative priorities of mitigation wetland areas based on functional landscape connectivity and wildlife mobility, as well as landscape structure, composition, and configuration. The least-cost path method is used to evaluate candidate sites for mitigation wetlands with regard to wildlife movement. A set of assessments for landscape indices using FRAGSTATS was applied to identify suitable mitigation wetland areas on the basis of landscape connectivity, composition, and configuration. The study was conducted in Gwacheon, Korea, where there are plans for regional development that will change the landscape. In the first step, a group of 14 candidate sites is identified via analysis of functional landscape connectivity using the least-cost path method. In the second step, candidate mitigation wetland areas are ranked according to landscape connectivity and composition. The five mitigation wetland areas that were found to be suitable were analyzed based on landscape configuration at the class level. This study demonstrates that functional landscape connectivity and landscape structure are important aspects to consider when identifying suitable sites for mitigation wetland planning and restoration.

TI  - DESLOCAMENTO NA MATRIZ PARA ESPÉCIES DA MATA ATLÂNTICA E A DIFICULDADE DA CONSTRUÇÃO DE PERFIS ECOLÓGICOS
PY  - 2010
AB  - INTER-HABITAT MOVIMENT FOR ATLANTIC FOREST SPECIES AND THE DIFICULTY TO BUILD ECOPROFILES. Few studies have evaluated the animals' capacity of inter-patch movement, which contributed to the buildup over the years of approaches that use a target species to represent and protect the local biodiversity. Recently, the ‘ecoprofiles' approach, seeks to fill some gaps left by other approaches. The ecoprofiles taking into account three main characteristics (type of ecosystem, area requirements and capacity of inter-patch movement) of target species, which may serve as representatives of a range of species that do not possess such information and demanding ‘similar' ecological requirements. Here, we performed a scientometric study on the subject of inter-patch movement, focusing on Atlantic Forest species. We also evaluated the possible use of ecoprofiles approach for this biome. In a general view, Brazil contributed with 0.005% to the total of published articles worldwide on the subject, which permit to conclude that the Brazilian contribution on the subject is still recent and restricted. Focusing in the Atlantic Forest biome, we found 24 papers published until January 2010, 15 of which presented explicit results on inter-patch movement for Atlantic Forest species. Among these 15 papers, the most common objective was to evaluate the species' dispersal capacity (the capacity to cross the matrix from one remnant forest to another). The non-volant mammals were the most frequent group in the articles and the birds showed the highest number of species studied. Only birds and small mammals were studied, probably because they are easily found and captured in remnant forests. This fact resulted in low values of inter-patch movement found for Atlantic Forest species. Moreover, this contribution presents a strong regional bias, since the state of Rio de Janeiro contributed all information about the subject for non-volant mammals and Sao Paulo for birds. Considering all the studies analyzed, although several aspects of the issue have been addressed, it is clear that knowledge about the ability to shift in the matrix is still very restricted. This fact, coupled with the lack of information on area requirements of the species, makes it virtually impossible to apply the ecoprofiles approach for the Atlantic Forest, at least in the short term. Keywords: Functional connectivity; gap crossing; perceptual range; Landscape Ecology; scientometrics.

TI  - Informing conservation management about structural versus functional connectivity: a case-study of Cross River gorillas.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Connectivity among subpopulations is vital for the persistence of small and fragmented populations. For management interventions to be effective conservation planners have to make the critical distinction between structural connectivity (based on landscape structure) and functional connectivity (which considers both landscape structure and organism-specific behavioral attributes) which can differ considerably within a given context. We assessed spatial and temporal changes in structural and functional connectivity of the Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli (CRG) population in a 12,000 km2 landscape in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region over a 23-year period, comparing two periods: 1987–2000 and 2000–2010. Despite substantial forest connections between occupied areas, genetic evidence shows that only limited dispersal occurs among CRG subpopulations. We used remotely sensed land-cover data and simulated human pressure (using a spatially explicit agent-based model) to assess human impact on connectivity of the CRG population. We calculated cost-weighted distances between areas occupied by gorillas as measures of connectivity (structural based on land-cover only, functional based on both land-cover and simulated human pressure). Whereas structural connectivity decreased by 5% over the 23-year period, functional connectivity decreased by 11%, with both decreasing more during the latter compared to the earlier period. Our results highlight the increasing threat of isolation of CRG subpopulations due to human disturbance, and provide insight into how increasing human influence may lead to functional isolation of wildlife populations despite habitat continuity, a pressing and common issue in tropical Africa often not accounted for when deciding management interventions. In addition to quantifying threats to connectivity, our study provides crucial evidence for management authorities to identify actions that are more likely to be effective for conservation of species in human-dominated landscapes. Our approach can be easily applied to other species, regions, and scales. Am. J. Primatol. 76:978–988, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Integrating Ecological, Social and Cultural Dimensions in the Implementation of the Landscape Convention
PY  - 2013
AB  - Implementation of the European Landscape Convention requires new tools that link ecological, social and cultural dimensions in practical planning. Here, we propose connectivity as a conceptual tool to include different dimensions into landscape and spatial planning. We present a short review of the connectivity concept in relation to ecological, social and cultural dimensions and illustrate it by examples from a real landscape planning case.

TI  - Habitat connectivity for endangered Indochinese tigers in Thailand
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Habitat connectivity is crucial for the conservation of species restricted to fragmented populations within human-dominated landscapes. However, identifying habitat connectivity for apex predators is challenging because trophic interactions between primary productivity and prey species influence both the distribution of habitats, and predator movement. Our goal was to assess habitat connectivity for Indochinese tigers (Panthera tigris) in Thailand. We quantified suitable habitat and dispersal corridors based an ensemble species distribution model that included prey distributions, primary productivity, and abiotic variables and was based on camera-trap data from 1996 to 2013 in 15 protected areas. We employed graph theory to evaluate the relative importance of habitat patches and dispersal corridors to the overall connectivity network. We found that tiger occurrence models with and without prey distributions performed well (Area Under the Curve: 0.932–0.954). However, inclusion of prey distributions significantly improved model performance (P

TI  - Effective dispersal rate is a function of habitat size and corridor shape: mechanistic formulation of a two‐patch compartment model for spatially continuous systems
PY  - 2011
AB  - Two-patch compartment models have been explored to understand the spatial processes that promote species coexistence. However, a phenomenological definition of the inter-patch ‘dispersal rate’ has limited the quantitative predictability of these models to community dynamics in spatially continuous habitats. Here, we mechanistically rederived a two-patch Lotka–Volterra competition model for a spatially continuous reaction-diffusion system where a narrow corridor connects two large habitats. We provide a mathematical formula of the dispersal rate appearing in the two-patch compartment model as a function of habitat size, corridor shape (ratio of its width to its length), and organism diffusion coefficients. For most reasonable settings, the two-patch compartment model successfully approximated not only the steady states, but also the transient dynamics of the reaction–diffusion model. Further numerical simulations indicated the general applicability of our formula to other types of community dynamics, e.g. driven by resource-competition, in spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. Our results suggest that the spatial configuration of habitats plays a central role in community dynamics in space. Furthermore, our new framework will help to improve experimental designs for quantitative test of metacommunity theories and reduce the gaps among modeling, empirical studies, and their application to landscape management.

TI  - Hydrological connectivity drives the propagule pressure of Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) in a tropical river–floodplain system
PY  - 2021
AB  - River–floodplain systems are characterized by high connectivity, which favours the spread of non-native species. In floodplain, floods increase connectivity, which increases the similarity of abiotic conditions among environments. High connectivity and low environmental variability may favour the establishment of non-native species such as Limnoperna fortunei, but this has not yet been tested. We sampled L. fortunei larvae in nine connected lakes and nine isolated lakes to rivers in the upper Parana River floodplain to evaluate how spatial (connection) and abiotic (environmental variability) factors affect the larvae density of L. fortunei. We considered the rivers as propagule source of L. fortunei because this invasive species has successfully established in rivers, but not in lakes. Our findings revealed that connected lakes had a high larval density of L. fortunei, while isolated lakes had a low density. Isolated lakes presented a high multi-environmental variability, which was strong negatively related with the larval density of L. fortunei. However, the connectivity decreased the multi-environmental variability, indirectly increasing the larval density of L. fortunei. Our study illustrates that permanent connectivity with invaded environments increase the larvae density of L. fortunei in non-invaded environments, which occurs both directly (through propagule dispersion) and indirectly (by decreasing multi-environmental variability).

TI  - What comes down must go up: assessing the validity of stream connectivity techniques with the use of in situ fish movement and stream community metrics
PY  - 2014
AB  - Stream fragmentation is considered an important factor in the persistence of many aquatic species. My research is focused on validating local and riverscape metrics of connectivity to help assist in evaluating their efficacy. I used in situ brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) movements in Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, to determine the accuracy of local scale fish passability metrics and I used community assemblages in southern Ontario to evaluate a structural index used to measure the connectedness of a system. I found that local scales of passability were conservative in predicting brook trout passage and failed to consistently predict fish movement. Furthermore, I found that riverscape scale structural indices have power in explaining both community structure, species presence/absence and abundance. The results from my research will provide researchers future areas of study along with confidence in structural indices for the evaluation of watershed level connectivity metrics.

TI  - Hydrological connectivity assessment based on solute penetration
PY  - 2020
AB  - Wetlands are sensitive, easily disturbed, and globally important ecosystems which face lots of threats, such as global climate change and local human activities. Those might result in the degradation of wetlands. The relationship between hydrological connectivity and the degradation of wetlands has gained prominence among researchers as a simple way to quickly evaluate the degradation of wetlands. This metric is responsive to preferential flow, which can, to some extent, indicate hydrological connectivity. To quantify hydrological connectivity at soil column scales, we explored the relationships between soil properties and the strength of preferential flow in samples from a degrading wetland in which Chinese tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis Lour.) grow in the Yellow River Delta. We conducted laboratory solute penetration tests through the undisturbed soil sample columns and analyzed the relationship between the solute penetration test results and preferential flow. We then verified the applicability of the dual-permeability model to predict the results of the solute penetration test. Our results revealed that the discharge rate from the soil columns was the highest in samples from 20 to 40 cm soil depth and that the flow of discharge concentration remained stable for a long time before increasing rapidly, which exhibited rich medium porosity and macroporosity. We associated this with some improvement in hydrological connectivity, which was also consistent with our dual-permeability simulation results. In the future experimental operation, we can preliminarily predict the hydrological connectivity and preferential flow intensity of soil column by using the dual-permeability model with the discharge data of solute penetration test, which can help us know quickly to what extent are wetlands degraded.

TI  - Foraging behavior and patch size distribution jointly determine population dynamics in fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Increased fragmentation caused by habitat loss presents a major threat to the persistence of animal populations. Whereas the negative effects of habitat loss on biodiversity are well-known, the effects of fragmentation per se on population dynamics and ecosystem stability remain less understood. How fragmentation affects populations is strongly determined by the rate at which individuals can move between separated habitat patches within the fragmented landscape. Here, we use a computational, spatially explicit predator-prey model to investigate how the interplay between fragmentation per se and optimal foraging behavior influences predator-prey interactions and, ultimately, ecosystem stability. We study cases where prey occupies isolated habitat patches and let predators disperse between patches following a Levy random walk. Our results show that both the Levy exponent and the degree of fragmentation strongly determine coexistence probabilities. Brownian and ballistic predators go extinct in highly fragmented landscapes and only scale-free predators can coexist with prey. Furthermore, our results reveal that predation causes irreversible loss of prey habitat in highly fragmented landscapes due to the overexploitation of smaller patches. Moreover, our results show that predator movement can reduce, but not prevent not minimize, the amount of irreversibly lost habitat. Our results suggest that incorporating optimal foraging theory into population- and landscape ecology models is crucial to assess the impact of fragmentation on biodiversity and ecosystem stability.

TI  - Connectivity of fish assemblages along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum in Wenchang, China
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding the connectivity of fish among different typical habitats is important for conducting ecosystem-based management, particularly when designing marine protected areas (MPA) or setting MPA networks. To clarify of connectivity among mangrove, seagrass beds, and coral reef habitats in Wenchang, Hainan Province, China, the fish community structure was studied in wet and dry seasons of 2018. Gill nets were placed across the three habitat types, and the number of species, individuals, and body size of individual fish were recorded. In total, 3 815 individuals belonging to 154 species of 57 families were collected. The highest number of individuals and species was documented in mangroves (117 species, 2 623 individuals), followed by coral reefs (61 species, 438 individuals) and seagrass beds (46 species, 754 individuals). The similarity tests revealed highly significant differences among the three habitats. Approximately 23.4% species used two habitats and 11.0% species used three habitats. A significant difference (p<0.05) in habitat use among eight species (Mugil cephalus, Gerres oblongus, Siganus fuscescens, Terapon jarbua, Sillago maculata, Upeneus tragula, Lutjanus russellii, and Monacanthus chinensis) was detected, with a clear ontogenetic shift in habitat use from mangrove or seagrass beds to coral reefs. The similarity indices suggested that fish assemblages can be divided into three large groups namely coral, seagrass, and mangrove habitat types. This study demonstrated that connectivity exists between mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum in Wenchang area; therefore, we recommend that fish connectivity should be considered when designing MPAs or MPA network where possible.

TI  - River fragmentation and flow alteration metrics: a review of methods and directions for future research
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Rivers continue to be harnessed to meet humanity’s growing demands for electricity, water, and flood control. While the socioecological impacts of river infrastructure projects (RIPs) have been well-documented, methodological approaches to quantify river fragmentation and flow alteration vary widely in spatiotemporal scope, required data, and interpretation. In this review, we first present a framework to visualise the effects of different kinds of RIPs on river fragmentation and flow alteration. We then review available methods to quantify connectivity and flow alteration, along with their data requirements, scale of application, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, we present decision-making trees to help stakeholders select among these methods based on their objectives, resource availability, and the characteristics of the project(s) being evaluated. Thematic searches of peer-reviewed literature using topic-relevant keywords were conducted on Google Scholar. The bibliography of selected papers was also reviewed, resulting in the selection of 79 publications. Papers that did not define or apply a specific metric were excluded. With respect to fragmentation, we selected papers focused on instream connectivity and excluded those dealing with overland hydrologic connections. For flow alteration, we selected papers that quantified the extent of alteration and excluded those aimed at prescribing environmental flows. The expected hydrological consequences of various RIP types were ‘mapped’ on a conceptual fragmentation-flow alteration plot. We compiled 29 metrics of river fragmentation and 13 metrics to flow alteration, and used these to develop decision-making trees to facilitate method selection. Despite recent advances in metric development, further work is needed to better understand the relationships between and among metrics, assess their ecological significance and spatiotemporal scale of application, and develop more informative methods that can be effectively applied in data-scarce regions. These objectives are especially critical given the growing use of such metrics in basin-wide conservation and development planning.</jats:p>

TI  - Analysing Landscape Patterns
PY  - 2017
AB  - Very diverse phenomena compose the landscape, configuring complex patterns at different spatial scales. The properties of these patterns allow describing the transcendent and holistic qualities of the landscape, such as landscape heterogeneity, coherence, connectedness and diversity. Often methods and techniques are borrowed from different disciplines, adapted and used in a new context. Landscape ecology has been a catalyst in this process and laid the basis for quantitative pattern analysis and the use of landscape metrics. To reduce the complexity, several models are used to describe the spatial properties of landscape. Five are discussed based on the primitives considered: (1) element, component, structure, (2) point, line, polygon, surface, (3) patch, corridor, matrix, mosaic, (4) mass, screen, space, and (5) landmark, district, path, node, edge. Mapping landscape patterns causes an abstraction of the landscape, which does not guarantee to keep its holistic character. However, landscape metrics allow to describe some holistic meta-properties of the landscape such as its heterogeneity, diversity, information content and connectivity.

TI  - Do landscape and riverscape shape genetic patterns of the Neotropical otter, Lontra longicaudis, in eastern Mexico?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Functional connectivity of semiaquatic species is poorly studied despite that freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most threatened worldwide due to habitat deterioration. The Neotropical otter, Lontra longicaudis, is a threatened species that represents a good model to evaluate the effect of landscape-riverscape features on genetic structure and gene flow of freshwater species. We aimed to assess the spatial genetic structure of L. longicaudis and to evaluate the landscape-riverscape attributes that shape its genetic structure and gene flow at local sites (habitat patches) and between sites (landscape matrix). We conducted the study in three basins located in Veracruz, Mexico, which have a high degree of ecosystem deterioration. We used a non-invasive genetic sampling and a landscape genetics individual-based approach to test the effect stream hierarchical structure, isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-resistance on genetic structure and gene flow. We found genetic structure that corresponded to the latitudinal and altitudinal heterogeneity of the landscape and riverscape, as well as to the hierarchical structure of the streams. Open areas and steep slopes were the variables affecting genetic structure at local sites, whereas areas with suitable habitat conditions, higher ecosystem integrity and larger streams enhanced gene flow between sites. The landscape-riverscape characteristics that maintain functional connectivity of L. longicaudis differed between the upper, middle, and lower basins. Our results have important implications for the conservation of the species, including the maintenance of larger suitable areas in Actopan and the necessity to improve connectivity in Jamapa, through the establishment of biological corridors.

TI  - Proximity of breeding and foraging areas affects foraging effort of a crepuscular, insectivorous bird
PY  - 2018
AB  - When complementary resources are required for an optimal life cycle, most animals need to move between different habitats. However, the level of connectivity between resources can vary and, hence, influence individuals' behaviour. We show that landscape composition and configuration affect the connectivity between breeding (heathlands) and foraging habitats (extensively-grazed grasslands) of the European Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), a crepuscular insectivorous bird. On a daily basis, nightjars connect breeding and foraging sites by rapidly crossing unsuitable habitats in order to exploit a higher prey biomass in foraging sites. However, low availability of foraging habitat near breeding sites and clustered landscapes greatly increase foraging distance. Birds occupying these sub-optimal breeding areas compensate for longer travels by increasing foraging duration, and their physiology shows increased stress levels. All findings suggest that landscape heterogeneity can affect population dynamics of nightjars. Therefore, we recommend an integrated management approach for this EU-protected bird species.

TI  - Assessment of habitat fragmentation caused by traffic networks and identifying key affected areas to facilitate rare wildlife conservation in China
PY  - 2015
AB  - Context Traffic network construction is an essential method for enhancing the effectiveness of economic activities, but it can have various negative impacts on rare wildlife. In China, the rate of road construction has increased by over 300% during the past decade; however, the resulting fragmentation of rare habitats at a national scale remains uncertain. Aims This study mainly aimed to evaluate the impacts of road and railway networks on the fragmentation of habitats of endangered species in China. Another aim is to identify the key areas and road sections where improvements to habitat connectivity and integrity are urgently required. Methods We documented habitat information for 21 indicator species on the basis of two comprehensive datasets and over 120 previous studies. We combined this information to simulate the habitats of all these species by integrating a conceptual model and expert knowledge. We calculated the rates of change on the basis of three geometric habitat patterns for each species in traffic-clearing scenarios and road- and railway-overlay scenarios. An optimal algorithm, the core-area zonation cell-removal rule, was used to identify rare habitats affected by severe traffic stress. Key results According to our analysis, we ranked the road density in the habitats of all species as a straightforward evaluation of transportation stress. Among the different species considered, snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Cabot’s tragopan (Tragopan caboti) and Przewalski’s gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) appeared to be affected most severely by road-induced fragmentation. In addition, we classified five patterns of habitat fragmentation among species to facilitate wildlife management. On the basis of the trade-off between road density and conservation value per unit, we identified 17 unit sets as key traffic-affected areas, including 40 highways, 62 national roads and 51 railway sections. Conclusions Our results suggested that assessing the distributions of several key species can be effective in evaluating the impacts of roads on rare-wildlife habitats in China. Our results also indicated that the habitats of narrowly distributed species, such as Chinese alligator and Sichuan partridge, have high traffic densities, but core habitat degradation is even more serious for the habitats of species with higher intrinsic mobility or greater area requirements. Finally, we suggest that future conservation programs and restoration efforts should concentrate on roads or railway sections in the key areas that we identified. Implications In the present study, we obtained spatially explicit findings related to the maintenance of rare wildlife in a region where wildlife-protection information is lacking. Our site-selection results can be used to allocate highly limited conservation resources in a more efficient and effective manner, to facilitate wildlife protection in this region.

TI  - Applying circuit theory for corridor expansion and management at regional scales: tiling, pinch points, and omnidirectional connectivity.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Connectivity models are useful tools that improve the ability of researchers and managers to plan land use for conservation and preservation. Most connectivity models function in a point-to-point or patch-to-patch fashion, limiting their use for assessing connectivity over very large areas. In large or highly fragmented systems, there may be so many habitat patches of interest that assessing connectivity among all possible combinations is prohibitive. To overcome these conceptual and practical limitations, we hypothesized that minor adaptation of the Circuitscape model can allow the creation of omnidirectional connectivity maps illustrating flow paths and variations in the ease of travel across a large study area. We tested this hypothesis in a 24,300 km2 study area centered on the Monteregie region near Montreal, Quebec. We executed the circuit model in overlapping tiles covering the study region. Current was passed across the surface of each tile in orthogonal directions, and then the tiles were reassembled to create directional and omnidirectional maps of connectivity. The resulting mosaics provide a continuous view of connectivity in the entire study area at the full original resolution. We quantified differences between mosaics created using different tile and buffer sizes and developed a measure of the prominence of seams in mosaics formed with this approach. The mosaics clearly show variations in current flow driven by subtle aspects of landscape composition and configuration. Shown prominently in mosaics are pinch points, narrow corridors where organisms appear to be required to traverse when moving through the landscape. Using modest computational resources, these continuous, fine-scale maps of nearly unlimited size allow the identification of movement paths and barriers that affect connectivity. This effort develops a powerful new application of circuit models by pinpointing areas of importance for conservation, broadening the potential for addressing intriguing questions about resource use, animal distribution, and movement.

TI  - The Optimization of Urban Ecological Network Planning Based on the Minimum Cumulative Resistance Model and Granularity Reverse Method: A Case Study of Haikou, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - In recent years, the high-speed urbanization process and human activities have led to the fragmentation and the connectivity reduction of natural landscape patches, resulting in the degradation of urban ecological services and biodiversity. The construction of ecological network and the optimization of landscape pattern are significantly important to improve the urban ecological environment and urban ecological security. In this paper, a case study of Haikou, an island city of China is performed, the selection of ecological source areas is optimized by granularity reverse method and principal component analysis. The minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM) is used to construct the ecological resistance surface, and ecological corridors and ecological nodes are obtained, so as to optimize the urban ecological network and the connectivity of landscape patches. The results show that the 1400m granularity landscape component is the optimal landscape component structure for Haikou. There are 38 ecological source areas in Haikou, and 14 ecological landscape patches need to be added. The distribution of ecological source areas is mainly affected by topography and geomorphology. The northwest has huge and scattered ecological source areas, while the southeast has small and concentrated ecological source areas. In the areas around Meilan airport and Hongcheng lake, there is an ecological trap with significant difference between dominant and recessive ecological resistance separately. Haikou ecological network consists of 81 ecological corridors and 76 ecological nodes. Affected by the main urban area in the north, Haikou ecological network has the high density in the middle and southern areas. The construction of ecological network has significantly improved the overall connectivity of the ecosystem in the study region. This research provides a scientific basis for the future urban ecological environment planning of Haikou.

TI  - Effect of host species, host nest density and nest size on the occurrence of the shining guest ant Formicoxenus nitidulus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Understanding habitat requirements of species is important in conservation. As an obligate ant nest associate, the survival of the globally vulnerable shining guest ant, Formicoxenus nitidulus, is strictly tied to that of its hosts (mound building Formica ants). We investigated how host species, nest density, inter-nest distance and nest mound size relate to the occurrence of F. nitidulus. In total, 166 red wood ant nests were surveyed in SW Finland (120 Formica polyctena, 25 F. rufa, 14 F. aquilonia, 5 F. pratensis, and 2 F. lugubris). Overall, F. nitidulus was found in 60% of the nests. For the actual analysis, only F. polyctena and F. rufa nests were included due to the small number of other nests. F. nitidulus was more likely to be found among F. polyctena than F. rufa. Also, while inter-nest distance was not important, a high nest density, commonly found in polydomous (multi-nest) wood ant colonies, was beneficial for F. nitidulus. The guest ant was also more likely to be found in large host nests than small nests. Thus, our results show that the best habitat for the guest ant is a dense population of host nest mounds with a high proportion of large mounds. Conservation efforts should be directed at keeping the quality of the red wood ant habitats high to preserve their current populations and to increase colonization. This will not only benefit the guest ant, but also a plethora of other species, and help in maintaining the biodiversity of forests.

TI  - Using network connectivity to prioritise sites for the control of invasive species
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary 1.Habitat connectivity is a crucial determinant of population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. The corollary of the emphasis on maintaining connectivity to enhance the movement of organisms is that disrupting connectivity should minimise it. Here we evaluate the efficiency of an invasive species control strategy that targets the most connected habitats in a landscape. 2.A network (spatial graph) provides an intuitive representation of a landscape, and the topology of this network can be used to identify the most connected patches. We implemented a simulation model of the spread of an invasive species on a network and used it to evaluate whether targeting the better-connected components of the landscape enhances control effectiveness. 3.Control strategies based on network topology consistently outperformed both a null strategy of random habitat selection and one based on separation distance alone. The advantages of the connectivity-based strategy were strongest in the early phases of the invasion process, when a small number of habitats are occupied at low population density. However, if long distance dispersal events were common the advantages of the connectivity approach weakened. 4.The performance of the connectivity-based strategy is robust to habitat-level demographic stochasticity. In fact, connectivity-based targeting outperforms a strategy focussing on source habitats, with the additional benefit that it requires less information to be implemented. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our simulation model outcomes demonstrate that deliberately targeting the best-connected components of a landscape is an efficient control strategy for invasive species when long-distance dispersal is infrequent, and it is likely to be cheaper than other alternatives such as targeting population sources. Network scientists have developed a range of methods designed to identify the minimal set of nodes on a graph that will disrupt the network as a whole; these tools have potential to aid in the design of more effective control strategies.

TI  - Life in a fragment: Evolution of foraging strategies of translocated collared brown lemurs, Eulemur collaris, over an 18-year period
PY  - 2020
AB  - While the drivers of primate persistence in forest fragments have been often considered at the population level, the strategies to persist in these habitats have been little investigated at the individual or group level. Considering the rapid variation of fragment characteristics over time, longitudinal data on primates living in fragmented habitats are necessary to understand the key elements for their persistence. Since translocated animals have to cope with unfamiliar areas and face unknown fluctuations in food abundance, they offer the opportunity to study the factors contributing to successful migration between fragments. Here, we illustrated the evolution of the foraging strategies of translocated collared brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) over an 18-year period in the Mandena Conservation Zone, south-east Madagascar. Our aim was to explore the ability of these frugivorous lemurs to adjust to recently colonized fragmented forests. Although the lemurs remained mainly frugivorous throughout the study period, over the years we identified a reduction in the consumption of leaves and exotic/pioneer plant species. These adjustments were expected in frugivorous primates living in a degraded area, but we hypothesize that they may also reflect the initial need to cope with an unfamiliar environment after the translocation. Since fragmentation is often associated with the loss of large trees and native vegetation, we suggest that the availability of exotic and/or pioneer plant species can provide an easy-to-access, nonseasonal food resource and be a key factor for persistence during the initial stage of the recolonization.

TI  - Assessing Multi-Scale Landscape Connectivity Using Network Analysis
PY  - 2017
AB  - Landscape connectivity has implications for many ecological processes, including spread of invasive species and conservation of native ones. Because species have different minimum area requirements and different movement abilities, landscape designs suitable for one species (or group of species) may be inappropriate for other species. Methods from network analysis can be used to combine information on landscape pattern and species life history characteristics for species-specific assessments of potential connectivity. The lab is intended to provide students with the following opportunities.

TI  - Using animal movement behavior to categorize land cover and predict consequences for connectivity and patch residence times
PY  - 2017
AB  - Landscape-scale population dynamics are driven in part by movement within and dispersal among habitat patches. Predicting these processes requires information about how movement behavior varies among land cover types. We investigated how butterfly movement in a heterogeneous landscape varies within and between habitat and matrix land cover types, and the implications of these differences for within-patch residence times and among-patch connectivity. We empirically measured movement behavior in the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas phaeton) in three land cover classes that broadly constitute habitat and two classes that constitute matrix. We also measured habitat preference at boundaries. We predicted patch residence times and interpatch dispersal using movement parameters estimated separately for each habitat and matrix land cover subclass (5 categories), or for combined habitat and combined matrix land cover classes (2 categories). We evaluated the effects of including edge behavior on all metrics. Overall, movement was slower within habitat land cover types, and faster in matrix cover types. Butterflies at forest edges were biased to remain in open areas, and connectivity and patch residence times were most affected by behavior at structural edges. Differences in movement between matrix subclasses had a greater effect on predictions about connectivity than differences between habitat subclasses. Differences in movement among habitat subclasses had a greater effect on residence times. Our findings highlight the importance of careful classification of movement and land cover in heterogeneous landscapes, and reveal how subtle differences in behavioral responses to land cover can affect landscape-scale outcomes.

TI  - Reconstructing the collapse of wetland networks in the Swiss lowlands 1850–2000
PY  - 2011
AB  - In Central Europe vast wetland areas have been converted into agricultural land over the past few centuries. Long-term spatially explicit reconstructions of wetland cover changes at regional scale are rare but such information is vital for setting appropriate wetland conservation and restoration goals. In this study wetland cover change over the past 150 years was analyzed for the Canton Zurich (Switzerland) using information from historical and current topographical maps. Mapping instructions changed significantly over time, i.e., wetlands were mapped more conservatively on older maps. Therefore a technique was developed to account for changes in mapping instructions and to reconstruct a series of comparable maps spanning 1850–2000. Wetland cover dramatically decreased from 13,759 ha in 1850 (more than 8% of the total study area) to 1,233 ha in 2000 (less than 1%). Largest loss is observed for the first half of the twentieth century when more than 50% of the total wetland loss occurred. In 1850, almost all wetland patches were connected in two large networks defined by a 500 m buffer around all wetland patches to account for typical dispersal distances of wetland animals. Despite extensive wetland loss, this networks remained largely intact until 1950, but then collapsed into many medium and small networks consisting of only few wetland patches. In addition to the direct loss of wetland habitats increased habitat fragmentation is limiting metapopulation dynamics and hindering genetic exchange between populations. Amphibians and other wetland animals are particularly prone to habitat fragmentation because of their limited migration abilities. This may lead to time-delayed extinction in the future because current species occurrence might rather reflect historical than current wetland cover and habitat configuration. Future restoration efforts should focus on reestablishing connectivity between remaining smaller wetland networks.

TI  - Disobedient epiphytes: colonization and extinction rates in a metapopulation of Lepanthes rupestris (Orchidaceae) contradict theoretical predictions based on patch connectivity
PY  - 2014
AB  - The metapopulation concept is widely established in population biology. It predicts that the likelihood of colonization of an empty patch is positively correlated with its connectivity, because colonizers from occupied patches will be more likely to reach an empty patch if they are closer to it. Another prediction is that the likelihood of extinction of an occupied patch will be negatively correlated with its connectivity to other patches, as the occupied patch can be ‘reinforced’ by immigrants from patches that are close by. We tested these predictions using an extensive data set for an epiphytic orchid, Lepanthes rupestris from Puerto Rico. Our data did not support the first prediction, but we found that the likelihood of extinction is negatively correlated with patch connectivity. We hypothesize that this might be because most orchid seeds are wind dispersed and seeds that do not fall immediately below the mother plant are uniformly distributed after a steep leptokurtic distribution. We predict that taxa with similar seed and gene flow characteristics should show similar patterns in the association between colonization/extinction rates and patch connectivity. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 175, 598–606.

TI  - Context-dependent movement behavior of woodland salamanders (Plethodon) in two habitat types.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Animal movement is critical to the maintenance of functional connectivity at the landscape scale and can play a key role in population persistence and metapopulation dynamics. The permeability of habitat to animal movement may vary as a result of either differential mortality, physical resistance, or simply the behavioral responses of organisms to perceived habitat quality. Understanding how and when animal movement behavior varies among habitat types is critical for identifying barriers to dispersal and predicting species distributions in relation to landscape features. We conducted an experimental translocation study and compared the movement success and behavioral strategies of plethodontid salamanders in both forest and open-canopy habitat. We found that individuals in closed-canopy forest oriented more strongly towards their home ranges and moved significantly farther on their release night. In spite of the clear differences in movement paths, the ultimate movement success of homing salamanders did not appear to vary with habitat type. Our study contributes to a growing body of literature suggesting the importance of recognizing the context dependence of animal movement behavior. Because the movement rates of displaced salamanders were significantly reduced in open-canopy, dispersal rates of plethodontid salamanders in open-canopy habitat are likely lower than in control forest. Further mechanistic studies focusing on habitat-specific movement behavior and survival costs will be valuable for effectively identifying and mitigating barriers to animal movement.

TI  - IGARSS - Green and blue belt networks: Mapping connectivity areas at a regional scale using medium and high spatial resolution satellite images
PY  - 2012
AB  - The distribution of ecosystem sites, their connectivity and their evolution are key links between ecology and society, as these landscape patterns determine the regional sustainability for biodiversity and are subject to human interventions. While little attention has been paid to procedures for mapping connectivity among numerous “natural” landscape elements over large areas, the principal objective of this study was to map ecological corridors at a regional scale using remotely sensed data. To achieve this goal, we developed an approach including three stages: first, permanent “natural” landscape elements were identified from Landsat TM images; second, permanent grassland connected to these elements was extracted from a multitemporal series of MODIS images and aggregated to them; third, connectivity was depicted by least-cost modeling. The regional connectivity map can be analyzed at a regional scale to highlight large corridors, but also at a local scale to determine areas for conservation intervention.

TI  - The negative effects of habitat fragmentation operate at the scale of dispersal
PY  - 2018
AB  - Habitat loss is often considered the greatest near-term threat to biodiversity. Yet the impact of habitat fragmentation, or the change in habitat configuration for a given amount of habitat loss, has been intensely debated. We isolated effects of habitat loss from fragmentation on the demography, movement, and abundance of wild populations of a specialist herbivore, Chelinidea vittiger, by removing 2,088 patches across 15 landscapes. We compared fragmentation resulting from random loss, which is often considered in theory, to aggregated loss, which is often observed in the real world. When quantifying fragmentation caused by random vs. aggregated loss, aggregated loss led to less fragmented landscapes than random loss based on patch isolation, but more fragmented landscapes when based on isolation at a larger mesoscale scale defined by dispersal distances of C. vittiger. Overall, habitat loss decreased population size and demographic parameters, with thresholds occurring at approximately 70-80% patch loss. Synergistic effects also occurred, where an aggregated pattern of loss had negative effects at low, but not high, amounts of habitat loss. Effects on population size of C. vittiger were driven by reductions in movement and subsequent reproduction. The direction of habitat fragmentation effects from random and aggregated loss treatments, for a given habitat amount, was conflictingly positive or negative depending on the scale at which fragmentation was quantified. Fragmentation quantified at the scale of dispersal for this species best explained population size and highlighted that fragmentation had negative effects at a mesoscale. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying habitat fragmentation at biologically appropriate scales.

TI  - Hydrological connectivity for riverine fish: measurement challenges and research opportunities
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales >1000 km2 and >100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales ∼1–1000 km2 and <1–100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish. 2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes. 3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities.

TI  - Connecting natural landscapes using a landscape permeability model to prioritize conservation activities in the United States
PY  - 2012
AB  - Widespread human modification and conversion of land has led to loss and fragmentation of natural ecosystems, altering ecological processes and causing declines in biodiversity. The potential for ecosystems to adapt to climate change will be contingent on the ability of species to move and ecological processes to operate across broad landscapes. We developed a novel, robust modeling approach to estimate the connectivity of natural landscapes as a gradient of permeability. Our approach yields a map capable of prioritizing places that are important for maintaining and potentially restoring ecological flows across the United States and informing conservation initiatives at regional, national, or continental scales. We found that connectivity routes with very high centrality intersected proposed energy corridors in the western United States at roughly 500 locations and intersected 733 moderate to heavily used highways (104–106 vehicles per day). Roughly 15% of the most highly connected locations are currently secured by protected lands, whereas 28% of these occur on public lands that permit resource extraction, and the remaining 57% are unprotected. The landscape permeability map can inform land use planning and policy about places potentially important for climate change adaptation.

TI  - The Functional Linkage Index: A Metric for Measuring Connectivity among Habitat Patches Using Least-Cost Distances
PY  - 2009
AB  - Connectivity among habitat patches in fragmented landscapes is generally acknowledged as a key component in the conservation of biodiversity. This paper presents a new metric, the Functional Linkage Index, for measuring connectivity among groups of patches. The metric is based on the concept of the proximity index, but incorporates the use of least-cost distances as well as allowing for more robust measures of habitat value. It can be calculated using a publicly available tool that was developed for use in ESRI's ArcGIS® 9.2 or 9.3 software. The metric and tool can be of particular use in comparing relative changes to connectivity resulting from various development or restoration scenarios.

TI  - The effects of riverine impoundment on genetic structure and gene flow in two stream fishes in the Mobile River basin
PY  - 2013
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Riverine impoundments (reservoirs) are thought to impede natural migration in small-streaminhabiting fishes, resulting in spatially and genetically fragmented populations. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested, and the genetic consequences of riverine impoundment for stream fishes with differing dispersal capabilities are not well understood. 2. This study utilised a combination of microsatellite DNA loci from 479 individuals and the mitochondrial (mt) DNA cytochrome b gene (810–1140 bp) from 83 individuals from eight streams to compare genetic structure and diversity between reservoir-fragmented and non-fragmented groups of two species of stream fishes with differing dispersal capabilities in the Mobile River basin of the south-eastern United States. 3. For both species, analysis of microsatellite loci revealed genetic discontinuities between neighbouring tributaries that have been fragmented by reservoir construction. This finding was in stark contrast to the high degree of continuity for both species between reference tributaries in a natural river setting. Results from mtDNA revealed no significant genetic structure within reservoir-fragmented or non-fragmented groups, indicating a lack of historical genetic structure (i.e. prior to reservoir construction). Microsatellite-based estimates of genetic diversity and migration were differentially affected in the two species, indicating that stream fishes with relatively high dispersal abilities may be equally or more susceptible to reservoir fragmentation when compared to species with relatively low dispersal abilities. 4. Collectively, our data revealed that riverine impoundment and reservoir-induced habitat fragmentation adversely affect genetic characteristics in small-stream-inhabiting fishes. This is of particular interest in biodiversity hotspots such as the south-eastern United States where hydroelectric and recreational reservoirs restrict connectivity in aquatic systems.

TI  - Population and Conservation Genetics in an Endangered Lemur, Indri indri , Across Three Forest Reserves in Madagascar
PY  - 2016
AB  - Population decline and fragmentation often lead to reduced genetic diversity and population differentiation. Habitat destruction throughout Madagascar has caused population decline and extinction of many endemic species. Lemur populations, including those of the largest extant lemur, Indri indri, have been fragmented into remaining forest patches. We assessed the level of genetic diversity in indri populations in three protected reserves by genotyping a total of 43 individuals at 17 microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity was high in all three reserves, with no differences between reserves. Population structure and F ST analyses revealed Analamazaotra Forest Station and the Torotorofotsy Conservation Area, which are separated by ca. 18 km to be genetically differentiated from each other with some admixture. Betampona Strict Nature Reserve, which is separated from the other reserves by ca. 130 km, exhibited clear population genetic differentiation, with no signs of admixture with the other reserves. Our genetic diversity estimates are similar to those for other Indridae in similar habitats and may reflect past rather than current population processes, given that populations have declined recently. Our results suggest that Betampona may be genetically isolated and that it is important to maintain gene flow between remaining populations to prevent loss of genetic diversity for the future conservation of Indri indri.

TI  - A Landscape-Scale Adjoining Conservation (LAC) Approach for Efficient Habitat Expansion: The Case of Changbai Mountain, Northeast China
PY  - 2018
AB  - The biodiversity crisis and ecosystem degradation caused by habitat destruction and human activities can be reduced by organizing protected areas. However, many protected areas currently take the form of “green islands,” which has led to serious habitat isolation in many places. We thus introduce herein a landscape-scale adjoining conservation (LAC) approach for the protection and restoration of ecosystems across the boundaries between protected areas and surrounding non-protected areas. The strategy of the LAC approach is to effectively expand conservation areas by connecting isolated areas of important ecosystems or habitats outside of protected areas. The methodology of the LAC approach involves integrated analyses that consider both habitat quality and landscape patterns. Forest-habitat quality is characterized by species composition and stand structure, and habitat connectivity is quantified by the max patch area of habitat and total habitat area. The focal statistic is useful for examining habitat clumps that result from landscape fragmentation. As a case study, we apply the LAC approach to adjoining restoration of broadleaf Korean pine mixed forest on the Changbai Mountain in northeastern China. We developed a metric called the Restoration Efficiency of Landscape Expansion (RELE) to evaluate the LAC approach. The results indicate that a minimal restoration effort can produce significant effects in terms of the expansion of contiguous habitat, as quantified by RELE.

TI  - MAMÍFEROS DE MAIOR PORTE EM PAISAGENS TROPICAIS ALTERADAS: SEU PAPEL EM CASCATAS TRÓFICAS E FATORES QUE DETERMINAM SUA DISTRIBUIÇÃO
PY  - NA
AB  - Nesta dissertação investigamos o papel dos mamíferos em cascatas tróficas nas florestas tropicais, e os efeitos da configuração espacial e qualidade do habitat assim como das atividades humanas atuais sobre a distribuição de mamíferos de maior porte em uma paisagem rural de Mata Atlântica. No primeiro capítulo, através de uma revisão da literatura sumarizamos e avaliamos a evidência empírica de que mamíferos estão envolvidos em cascatas tróficas em florestas tropicais com o objetivo de indicar os avanços, os problemas e os desafios nessa área. Poucos estudos empíricos e conceituais foram encontrados na literatura, todos realizados nas últimas três décadas, enquanto que a maioria dos estudos empíricos foi realizada nos Neotrópicos. Grande parte das hipóteses relacionadas a cascatas tróficas foi apenas proposta, e considera o homem como predador de topo. Além da maior parte das variáveis quantificadas não serem adequadas para demonstrar efeitos em cascata, a escala temporal da maioria dos estudos revisados foi curta para acessar estes efeitos sobre a comunidade de plantas que contém espécies longevas. Nenhuma hipótese abordou o efeito dos predadores de topo sobre as populações de presas pequenas via o controle da densidade e distribuição de mesopredadores. A maioria das hipóteses que encontramos na literatura se refere a outros efeitos indiretos causados por mamíferos, em particular através da dispersão de sementes e da disponibilização de nutrientes via fezes. Dessa maneira, demonstramos que o termo \"cascata trófica\" tem sido utilizado amplamente, englobando outros efeitos indiretos que se propagam via outras interações que não tróficas, e que a evidência empírica disponível até o momento de que mamíferos desencadeiam cascatas tróficas em florestas tropicais é pequena. No segundo capítulo, através da amostragem de 23 remanescentes florestais e do uso de modelos de ocupação e da abordagem de seleção de modelos, investigamos como fatores associados à configuração espacial e qualidade do habitat e a outras atividades humanas em andamento interagem e condicionam a distribuição de mamíferos terrestres de maior porte em paisagens intensamente modificadas pelo homem. A assembléia de mamíferos de maior porte encontrada na paisagem estudada é simplificada e dominada por mamíferos silvestres generalistas de médio porte, sugerindo que o controle de mesopredadores e a regeneração das florestas podem estar comprometidos. Os resultados também sugerem que: (1) a distribuição de mamíferos de maior porte deve ser condicionada mais por fatores associados à configuração espacial do que à qualidade do habitat florestal; (2) as atividades humanas atuais são tão ou mais importantes que a configuração espacial e a qualidade do habitat para a maioria das espécies. O tamanho dos fragmentos e a distância a rodovias, entre os fatores associados à configuração espacial, e a caça e a presença do cachorro doméstico, entre as atividades humanas atuais, foram particularmente importantes para a distribuição das espécies de mamíferos de maior porte. A relevância das atividades humanas em andamento sugere que estratégias de manejo que foquem em mudanças na atitude da população humana, através de programas de conscientização e educação, podem ter resultados significativos em termos da persistência de populações de mamíferos em paisagens rurais.In this dissertation we investigated the role of large mammals in trophic cascades in tropical forests, and the effects of habitat configuration and quality as well as of current human activities on the distribution of large mammals in a rural Atlantic forest landscape. In the first chapter, through a literature review we summarized and evaluated the empirical evidence that mammals are involved in trophic cascades in tropical forest, with the aim of highlighting the progress, problems and challenges in this area. Few conceptual and empirical studies were found in the literature, all of which were performed in the last three decades, while most of the empirical studies were developed in the Neotropics. Most of the hypotheses related to trophic cascades were only proposed and not tested, and considered humans as top predators. Not only most of the quantified variables were not appropriate to demonstrate cascading effects, but also the temporal scale of most studies was short to detect these effects on plant communities composed of long-lived species. We did not find hypotheses addressing the effect of top predators on the populations of small prey through the control of mesopredator density and distribution. Most hypotheses in the reviewed literature refer to other indirect effects played by mammals, especially through seed dispersal and nutrient allocation via feaces. Thus, we demonstrate that the term \"trophic cascade\" has been used widely, encompassing other indirect effects that propagate through other, non-throphic interactions, and that the empirical evidence available so far that mammals are drivers of trophic cascades in tropical forest is weak. In the second chapter, through the sampling of 23 forest fragments and using occupancy models and a model selection approach, we investigated how factors associated with habitat configuration and quality and with other current human activities interact to define the distribution of terrestrial large mammals in human-modified landscapes. The large mammal assemblage from the studied landscape is impoverished and dominated by medium-sized generalist species, suggesting that both the control of mesopredators and forest regeneration may be compromised. Our results also suggest that: (1) the distribution of large mammals is determined mainly by aspects of habitat configuration rather than by aspects of habitat quality, and (2) current human activities are equally or more important than habitat configuration and quality for most of the species. Fragment size and distance to roads, among the factors associated with habitat configuration, and hunting pressure and domestic dog presence, among those associated with current human activities, were particularly important to the distribution of large mammal species. The relevance of current human activities suggests that management strategies that focus on changing people attitudes, through programs of education, can have significant results in terms of the persistence of mammal populations in rural landscapes

TI  - On the Interplay Between Ecology and Reliability
PY  - 2020
AB  - This chapter attempts to enhance the interplay between the ecology and reliability fields by employing Boolean-based reliability language and techniques to quantify ecological metrics related to connectivity and redundancy. We emphasize the question of connectivity in models of probabilistic networks as a common area of interest for both fields. The chapter borrows techniques from mainstream reliability theory to treat a prominent problem of ecology, namely that of survivability (of a species), defined here as the probability of successful migration of a certain organism escaping from critical source habitat patches and seeking refuge in specific destination habitat patches via heterogeneous deletable ecological corridors, possibly with uninhabitable stepping stones en route. This problem might be reformulated in contexts other than that of migration, including those of (a) dynamics of metapopulations, colonization, or invasion, (b) gene flow, (c) spread of infectious diseases, epidemics, or pandemics, and (d) energy transfer within food webs. Indicators of network connectivity in classical reliability theory are probabilities that might be designated according to the set of source nodes and the set of destination nodes as one to one, one to many, many to many, or all to all. Our present notion of survivability (of a species) is also a probability of connectivity, now measured from any node (among many nodes) to any node (among many nodes). We explore methods for computing the survivability (of a species) by adapting switching-algebraic techniques that are usually employed in the reliability field. In addition to this survivability metric, we comment on some other connectivity indicators that are currently used in ecology. We stress two recent contributions to the ecology literature, one employing analogy with electric circuit theory, and another concerning the most reliable (or minimum-lag) dispersal paths.

TI  - Yellow snapper (Lutjanus argentiventris) connectivity in the Southern Gulf of California
PY  - 2020
AB  - We analysed the genetic connectivity and larval transport routes of Lutjanus argentiventris to test if eddies could transport coastal-demersal fish larvae between the peninsular and mainland coasts of the Southern Gulf of California. Larval transport was estimated using the ROMS oceanographic model during the main spawning period (July–August). We used 12 microsatellite loci to assess genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow estimates in 233 L. argentiventris samples from nine sites. The oceanographic model suggested the existence of a stream flow and eddies that maintain connectivity in the Southern Gulf of California. The global AMOVA and paired FST showed no significant genetic differentiation among the sites, and the estimations of the number of migrants indicated moderate to high gene flow among locations. However, after testing five demographic scenarios of connectivity with a coalescent sampler, our results supported the presence of a metapopulation structure with source-sink dynamics. We discuss the challenges to reconcile our results considering the assumptions of the different analyses and the characteristics of marine metapopulations. Connectivity of L. argentiventris could be representative of other costal-demersal species with a similar life history and spawning season.

TI  - Dispersal in the Urban Matrix: Assessing the Influence of Landscape Permeability on the Settlement Patterns of Breeding Songbirds
PY  - 2017
AB  - The ability of organisms to disperse across urban landscapes is theorized to be constrained by habitat fragmentation. While previous research has shown the distribution of forest patches is a determinant of dispersal patterns among forest-obligate bird species, the impacts of habitat distribution on the dispersal of “urban-adapted” species, has yet to be examined. Here, we use capture-reencounter data of birds banded over a 9-year period at six banding stations in greater Washington, DC to assess dispersal in four species of songbirds and a translocation experiment to examine the influence of land cover on movement. Point count and land cover data were used to construct habitat suitability and landscape permeability surfaces, with the latter representing potential travels costs from the capture location to the surrounding landscape. To assess how dispersal processes are affected by urban land cover, we searched for previously banded birds at sampling locations within 1.5 km of each banding station and compared the distribution of sampling locations with and without observations of previously-banded birds. We found evidence that settlement of two of four focal species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), was more likely in sites with high relative permeability. To experimentally explore the consequences of the urban matrix habitat on movement, we attached radio transmitters to male Cardinals, translocated individuals 1.5 km across high-intensity urban, suburban, and forested landscapes, and recorded the time to return to their territory. Return time was dependent on land cover with Cardinals translocated across suburban habitats returning significantly faster than those moved across the other two land use classes. Combined, our findings suggest that, even among some “urban-adapted” species, dispersal within urban environments may be influenced by landscape structure and composition.

TI  - Model‐based estimators of density and connectivity to inform conservation of spatially structured populations
PY  - 2017
AB  - Conservation and management of spatially structured populations is challenging because solutions must consider where individuals are located, but also differential individual space use as a result of landscape heterogeneity. A recent extension of spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models, the ecological distance model, uses spatial encounter histories of individuals (e.g., a record of where individuals are detected across space, often sequenced over multiple sampling occasions), to estimate the relationship between space use and characteristics of a landscape, allowing simultaneous estimation of both local densities of individuals across space and connectivity at the scale of individual movement. We developed two model-based estimators derived from the SCR ecological distance model to quantify connectivity over a continuous surface: (1) potential connectivity—a metric of the connectivity of areas based on resistance to individual movement; and (2) density-weighted connectivity (DWC)—potential connectivity weighted by estimated density. Estimates of potential connectivity and DWC can provide spatial representations of areas that are most important for the conservation of threatened species, or management of abundant populations (i.e., areas with high density and landscape connectivity), and thus generate predictions that have great potential to inform conservation and management actions. We used a simulation study with a stationary trap design across a range of landscape resistance scenarios to evaluate how well our model estimates resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC. Correlation between true and estimated potential connectivity was high, and there was positive correlation and high spatial accuracy between estimated DWC and true DWC. We applied our approach to data collected from a population of black bears in New York, and found that forested areas represented low levels of resistance for black bears. We demonstrate that formal inference about measures of landscape connectivity can be achieved from standard methods of studying animal populations which yield individual encounter history data such as camera trapping. Resulting biological parameters including resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC estimate the spatial distribution and connectivity of the population within a statistical framework, and we outline applications to many possible conservation and management problems.

TI  - A stochastic movement simulator improves estimates of landscape connectivity.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Conservation actions often focus on restoration or creation of natural areas designed to facilitate the movements of organisms among populations. To be efficient, these actions need to be based on reliable estimates or predictions of landscape connectivity. While circuit theory and least-cost paths (LCPs) are increasingly being used to estimate connectivity, these methods also have proven limitations. We compared their performance in predicting genetic connectivity with that of an alternative approach based on a simple, individual-based "stochastic movement simulator" (SMS). SMS predicts dispersal of organisms using the same landscape representation as LCPs and circuit theory-based estimates (i.e., a cost surface), while relaxing key LCP assumptions, namely individual omniscience of the landscape (by incorporating perceptual range) and the optimality of individual movements (by including stochasticity in simulated movements). The performance of the three estimators was assessed by the degree to which they correlated with genetic estimates of connectivity in two species with contrasting movement abilities (Cabanis's Greenbul, an Afrotropical forest bird species, and natterjack toad, an amphibian restricted to European sandy and heathland areas). For both species, the correlation between dispersal model and genetic data was substantially higher when SMS was used. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that the improvement gained by using SMS is robust both to variation in spatial resolution of the landscape and to uncertainty in the perceptual range model parameter. Integration of this individual-based approach with other developing methods in the field of connectivity research, such as graph theory, can yield rapid progress towards more robust connectivity indices and more effective recommendations for land management.

TI  - Critical Linkages: Assessing Connectivity Restoration Potential for Culvert Replacement, Dam Removal and Construction of Wildlife Passage Structures in Massachusetts
PY  - 2012
AB  - The University of Massachusetts Amherst, working in partnership with The Nature Conservancy and state agencies, has integrated data related to landscape connectivity and human development and completed a comprehensive analysis of areas in Massachusetts where connections must be restored to support biodiversity and minimize vehicle-wildlife collisions. The Critical Linkages project has been developing spatially explicit tools, including maps and scenario-testing software, to mitigate impacts of roads on the environment and help inform the design of new roads. The project built on the existing Conservation Assessment and Prioritization System (CAPS), a computer model developed by UMass that incorporates biophysical and anthropogenic data to develop an index of ecological integrity. Within the framework of CAPS the connectedness and aquatic connectedness metrics were used to model various scenarios and quantify the differences among them. Using this approach the authors conducted a comprehensive statewide assessment of restoration potential for 1) dam removals, 2) culvert replacements and 3) construction of wildlife passage structures on roads and highways. A baseline assessment of connectedness and aquatic connectedness provided a statewide base scenario for comparison of restoration options. Scenario-testing software was developed to efficiently assess restoration potential for large numbers of possible restoration projects and then applied statewide to identify road segments, road-stream crossings and dams that currently obstruct aquatic and terrestrial wildlife movement and that offer the greatest opportunity for restoration of landscape connectivity in Massachusetts.

TI  - Forest area and connectivity influence root- Associated fungal communities in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2016
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is well known to affect plant and animal diversity as a result of reduced habitat area and connectivity, but its effects on microorganisms are poorly understood. Using high-throughput sequencing of two regions of the rRNA gene, we studied the effects of forest area and connectivity on the diversity and composition of fungi associated with the roots of the dominant tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, in a lava-fragmented landscape on the Island of Hawaii. We found that local fungal diversity increased with forest area, whereas fungal species composition was correlated with fragment connectivity. Fragment size and connectivity were significant predictors even when we included environmental covariates, which were also associated with fungal diversity and composition. Fungal species composition was more similar among highly connected fragments than among poorly connected ones. We also identified individual taxa that varied in abundance with connectivity. Taken together, our results show that habitat fragmentation can alter microbial diversity and composition via differential response among fungal phyla and individual taxa to habitat connectivity.

TI  - Connectivity modelling with automatic determination of landscape resistance values. A new approach tested on butterflies and burnet moths
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Our study presents a connectivity modelling approach to addressing issues relating to the decline in biodiversity in the landscape of Southern Moravia, one of the most productive agricultural areas in the Czech Republic, markedly changed in the post-war period of collectivization. A modified Hanski-based method was applied in modelling, with the use of least-cost distance evaluation. We propose a new concept of landscape resistance determination, based on occurrence data of species rather than expert opinion. This species-specific approach enables us not only to evaluate overall raster connectivity of landscape, but also to accurately identify locations where management intervention could support the targeted species, and where it would be ineffective. The approach is demonstrated using model groups of butterflies and burnets in the cadastral area of Sardice and its surroundings. Only day-active Lepidoptera associated with semi-natural grassland (43 species) were selected for connectivity modelling. Except for remnants of dry to mesic semi-natural grassland and transitional mosaic of grassland-forest habitat, the most preferable areas for the study and the model group are those of meadows and vineyards. Among the best routes for butterflies and burnets are the grassy verges of roads and railways. Closed forest, bushes, built-up areas and sports grounds are landscape segments of high resistance. The results suggest that, for organisms associated with open habitat, the existing platform for landscape protection is insufficient and, in some cases, even counterproductive.

TI  - Using fluid dynamic concepts to estimate species movement rates in terrestrial landscapes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Habitat loss and fragmentation threatens biodiversity and ecosystem function. ‘Permeability’ and ‘connectivity’ indices are used to estimate how individuals, populations or genes move spatially through a landscape. Yet, despite the analogies between landscape permeability and the physical definition of permeability (the ability for a porous media to transport a fluid), there have been few attempts to apply the physical concepts of permeability and fluid flow to problems in landscape movement ecology beyond some simple examples in the early literature. Here, we present a conceptual model linking physical principles to ecological terms and illustrate how concepts from Darcy’s Law of fluid flow through porous media could be used to quantify species movement rates through a heterogeneous terrestrial landscape. Although further refinement is needed to take this concept to two dimensions and into a full predictive model, the approach presented shows promise for quantifying the relative impacts of landscape change (e.g. habitat fragmentation or creation) on species movement rates.

TI  - Habitat connectivity in biodiversity conservation: A review of recent studies and applications
PY  - 2015
AB  - The study of landscape connectivity in conservation has increased considerably since the early part of the 21st century. While the implications of landscape connectivity are self-evident for conservation, they are also important for physical geography since a proper understanding of landscape patterns and processes allows for better landscape management practices, which are at the core of geography. This paper presents a review of the literature based on 162 publications from 2000 to 2013, in which we evaluated the current state and recent advances in the integration of landscape connectivity in the identification and planning of conservation areas. The literature review and data analysis were based on a database organized into five categories: General information, study areas, research objectives, research methods in connectivity studies, and integration of connectivity with conservation. We found a substantial increase in the number of publications relating to connectivity and conservation from 2008 to ...

TI  - Identifying multispecies dispersal corridor priorities based on circuit theory: A case study in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecological corridor networks can efficiently improve regional landscape connectivity. Corridors for multiple faunal species movements are receiving increasing attention and graph theory is considered a promising way to explore landscape connectivity. In Xishuangbanna, the circuit theory was applied to explore the corridor networks for biodiversity for the first time. In addition, disturbances caused by the road network and the protection efficiency of National Nature Reserves and planned area for corridors were evaluated. Results indicated that the regional corridor networks could be estimated using a modified circuit method and Zonation model. Spatially, the key corridors were concentrated in the central-western, southeastern and northern regions. We detected 66 main intersections between key corridors and the road buffer. Of these points, 65% are forest, 23% grassland and 12% farmland. More than half of the area of National Nature Reserves constituted the top 50% of the corridors, and the planned corridor areas could efficiently protect some key corridors. However, these reserves only protected about 17% of regional key corridors, and the corridor conservation area in the western and northern regions were absent. The issues addressed in our study aided in the elucidation of the importance of regional landscape connectivity assessments and operational approaches in conservation planning.

TI  - Prioritization of landscape connectivity for the conservation of Peary caribou.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Adequate connectivity between discontinuous habitat patches is crucial for the persistence of metapopulations across space and time. Loss of landscape connectivity is often a direct result of fragmentation caused by human activities but also can be caused indirectly through anthropogenic climate change. Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) are widely dispersed across the islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and rely on sea ice to move seasonally between island habitats throughout their range. Seasonal connectivity provided by sea ice is necessary to maintain genetic diversity and to facilitate dispersal and recolonization of areas from which caribou have been extirpated. We used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to model connectivity across Peary caribou range, and future climate projections to investigate how this connectivity might be affected by a warming climate. Further, we used measures of current flow centrality to estimate the role of High Arctic islands in maintaining connectivity between Peary caribou populations and to identify and prioritize those islands and linkages most important for conservation. Our results suggest that the Bathurst Island complex plays a critical role in facilitating connectivity between Peary caribou populations. Large islands, including Banks, Victoria, and Ellesmere have limited roles in connecting Peary caribou. Without rigorous greenhouse gas emission reductions our projections indicate that by 2100 all connectivity between the more southern Peary caribou populations will be lost for important spring and early-winter movement periods. Continued connectivity across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and possibly Peary caribou persistence, ultimately hinges on global commitments to limit climate change. Our research highlights priority areas where, in addition to emission reductions, conservation efforts to maintain connectivity would be most effective.

TI  - Combining movement and genetic data to assess a forest carnivore's response to forest fragmentation
PY  - 2013
AB  - Landscape modification is actually recognized as major threat to biodiversity. Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se are acknowledged as the main negative consequences caused by landscape changes. Especially, habitat fragmentation modify landscape configuration, creating several areas of lower quality (matrix). The division of large continuous patches into smaller habitat patches surrounded by a low permeable matrix, greatly disturbs connectivity across the landscape. This movement disruption, among other negative consequences, impedes gene flow across the landscape. Eventually, this phenomenon will lead populations to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity, reducing overall population fitness. In order to counteract these negative effects, conservation measures should be implemented. Nevertheless, accurate measures should be supported by solid scientific knowledge, and new research fields, like the landscape genetics prove to play an important role in conservation. Currently, Mediterranean landscapes are dominated by agro-forestry systems, where a great proportion of the original Mediterranean forest was transformed into agricultural fields. Therefore, genetic connectivity of several forest specialists, such as forest carnivores, may be particularly affected by these landscape changes. To understand the role of specific landscape features in shaping gene flow, it is fundamental to accurately quantify the resistance that these features impose to gene flow. Here, taking advantage of previously radio-tracking data collected for common genets (which are forest species) in an agro-forestry system in southern Portugal, a resource selection function (RSF) was estimated to objectively assess how landscape variables influenced genetic relatedness. Here, three hypotheses were tested: (1) radio-tracking data will reveal that common genets use more forested areas when compared with other types of habitats; (2) parental analysis and movement data will not present concordant results; and (3) models which assume habitat heterogeneity as a crucial factor that influences genetic variation between individuals will be more statistically supported than simpler models (for example, isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-barrier models). Seventeen microsatellites were successfully genotyped with low genotyping error rates for 74 samples, in order to estimate genetic relatedness between individuals. The conditional logistic regression equation calculated in the RSF was in accordance with previous studies, demonstrating that common genets select positively areas with high availability of ecological resources (montado forests and riparian corridors) and avoided agricultural fields and areas near human disturbance. Despite the highway disrupt movements (accordingly with radio-tracking data), this particular population is not genetically substructured probably due to the recent construction of this feature. Thus, the population did not have enough time to respond to the construction of the highway. Contrary to the initial hypotheses, the IBD (isolation-by-distance) model was more supported than the competing models, despite presenting low correlation values (Mantel r=-0.07; p<0.001). Most samples are clustered (non-random sampling) in a small region holding suitable contiguous habitat FCUP Combining movement and genetic data to assess a forest carnivore’s response to forest fragmentation vi which probably hampered the analyses. Since these samples are spatially close (increasing the probability of familiar relationships) in a favourable area, there are not great variations at the genetic level between individuals in that particular sampled zone. This implies that the different landscape features that were analysed are poorly represented in ecological distances calculations between individuals. Thus, in that particular region the geographical distance is probably the main factor influencing gene flow. Additionally, the role that riparian corridors may play as dispersal enhancers in unsuitable habitats and limitations concerning the modelling techniques used here, may have also contributed for the observed results. Refining the methodology employed here in the future, by accounting spatial and temporal scales that likely describe more realistically how processes responsible for genetic connectivity operate, is fundamental to obtain more robust results. This is very important, if conservation authorities want to reduce the effects of fragmentation in Mediterranean species in a near future..

TI  - A defender-attacker model and algorithm for maximizing weighted expected hitting time with application to conservation planning
PY  - 2017
AB  - ABSTRACTThis article studies an interdiction problem in which two agents with opposed interests, a defender and an attacker, interact in a system governed by an absorbing discrete-time Markov chain. The defender protects a subset of transient states, whereas the attacker targets a subset of the unprotected states. By changing some of the transition probabilities related to the attacked states, the attacker seeks to minimize the Weighted Expected Hitting Time (WEHT). The defender seeks to maximize the attacker’s minimum possible objective, mitigating the worst-case WEHT. Many applications can be represented by this problem; this article focuses on conservation planning. We present a defender–attacker model and algorithm for maximizing the minimum WEHT. As WEHT is not generally a convex function of the attacker’s decisions, we examine large-scale integer programming formulations and first-order approximation methods for its solution. We also develop an algorithm for solving the defender’s problem via mixed-...

TI  - Population Genetics Between an Insular and Coastal Population of Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) in Southwest Florida
PY  - 2017
AB  - Gopherus polyphemus (Gopher Tortoise) is a prominent species found in pine flatwoods, upland scrub, and coastal dunes of the southeast United States. Geoclimatic and anthropogenic sources of habitat changes have fragmented Gopher Tortoises into isolated populations that may reduce gene flow, promote inbreeding, and ultimately impact population viability. Rapid urbanization along the southwest Gulf Coast of Florida has degraded habitat, and fragmented insular and coastal populations. To assess the diversity in these vestige populations, we assessed the genetic structure of Gopher Tortoises on heavily developed Marco Island (n = 61) and the adjacent mainland within Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (RBNERR) (n = 23) in Collier County, FL. Using microsatellite markers, we determined that the Marco Island tortoises are genetically distinct from the RBNERR tortoises. We identified unique alleles and reduced allelic richness in both populations, suggesting isolation has reduced gene flow. We therefore encourage careful management of the Marco Island Gopher Tortoises to maintain the uniqueness of the population while preventing further loss of diversity.

TI  - The role of forest certification for biodiversity conservation: Lithuania as a case study
PY  - 2016
AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest certification system is a globally widespread market-driven mechanism that aims at responsible use and governance of forests, and its application is growing. However, the extent to which forest certification contributes effectively to maintaining forest biodiversity is an unresolved issue. We assessed the role of FSC certification for forest biodiversity conservation in Lithuania’s state forests. First, we analysed the indicators related to biodiversity conservation at different spatial scales in the FSC standard used in Lithuania. By applying morphological spatial pattern analysis and habitat suitability modelling, we explored the structural and functional connectivity of forest habitat patches of formally and voluntarily set-asides for biodiversity conservation. According to the Lithuanian FSC standard, active measures in forest management for biodiversity should be imposed at three spatial scales: ‘trees in a stand’, ‘stands in a landscape’, and ‘landscape in an ecoregion’. The total area set aside for biodiversity was 18.6 %, including 4.9 % voluntary set-asides. The quality of habitats in terms of forest stand age was low, only 9.4 % of all set-asides constituted older forests. The proportions of voluntary set-aside area varied among the different state forest enterprises, and the results indicated a clear trend to set aside non-forest or low productivity forest habitats. Small (<1 ha) habitat patches formed a major part of all set-asides, including formally protected areas. FSC certification alone was not able to maintain structural and functional connectivity of forests for species at multiple spatial scales in Lithuania. By keeping a minimum standard of 5 % forestland set aside for biodiversity, the state forest enterprises certified according to the FSC can only satisfy forest species with small habitat requirements. To maintain biodiversity, place-based learning among stakeholders for representative functional green infrastructures in concrete landscapes and regions, combined with transparent knowledge about the net effect of pressures and responses on the state of biodiversity, are necessary.

TI  - Farmland – an Elephant in the Room of Urban Green Infrastructure? Lessons learned from connectivity analysis in three German cities
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract In recent years, Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has gained broad political support and has evolved to become a new research topic in the area of sustainable urban development. The focus has been largely on green urban structures, such as parks and urban forest. The role and contribution of farmland has often been neglected. This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland’s contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria: Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly. Based on these results some recommendations have been formulated to enable a better appreciation of farmland and farmers as partners for effectively developing strategies for UGI planning and sustainable urban development.

TI  - Landscape spatial structure for predicting suitable habitat: The case of Dalea villosa in Saskatchewan
PY  - 2012
AB  - Prediction of potentially suitable habitat is important for the recovery of species protected by federal laws. Therefore, the objective of this research was to study the relationship between habitat configuration and hairy prairie-clover occurrence in order to predict suitable and unsuitable bare sand habitat across the study site. Bare sand patches were extracted from a land cover classification of the study site and several patch scaled metrics were calculated to characterize habitat spatial structure. Binary logistic regression was used to determine which metrics were significantly correlated with hairy prairie-clover occurrences. The logistic regression equation was subsequently used to predict suitable and unsuitable bare sand habitat for hairy prairie-clover based on the probability of occupancy. Results showed that about 29% of the variation in bare sand patch occupancy could be explained by the size, shape, and degree of isolation of a sand patch as well as the amount of vegetation on a sand patch in the early growing season. Based on these variables, 18.8% of bare sand patches in the study site were predicted to be unsuitable hairy prairie-clover habitat, 45.7% were predicted to be marginally unsuitable, 32.7% were predicted to be suitable, and 2.8% were predicted to be marginally suitable.

TI  - The Structure and Dynamics of Agricultural Landscapes as Drivers of Biodiversity
PY  - 2013
AB  - The study of the relationships between agriculture and biodiversity is important to sustain biodiversity for the future. The landscape level has an influence, which has been until now mainly related to the importance of semi-natural elements. But in agricultural areas crop land is often dominant and acts on biodiversity by the resources it provides and the effects of disturbances induced by agricultural practices. The mosaic of crops is ephemeral and highly dynamic in space and time according to farming practices and crop rotations. The aim of this chapter is to assess the role of agricultural landscape heterogeneity on biodiversity. Landscape heterogeneity may be measured from different perspectives, considering non-cropped areas versus crop ones, or taking into consideration the dynamics of the mosaic of crops and agricultural practices. From studies on a long term ecological research site in Brittany, France, we present how these different approaches of landscape heterogeneity allow a better understanding of the diversity of processes driving biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Most of all we underline the necessity to include knowledge of farming systems and farming practices in the analyses.

TI  - Orographic lift shapes flight routes of gulls in virtually flat landscapes.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Interactions between landscape and atmosphere result in a dynamic flight habitat which birds may use opportunistically to save energy during flight. However, their ability to utilise these dynamic landscapes and its influence on shaping movement paths is not well understood. We investigate the degree to which gulls utilise fine scale orographic lift created by wind deflected upwards over landscape features in a virtually flat landscape. Using accelerometer measurements and GPS tracking, soaring flight is identified and analysed with respect to orographic lift, modelled using high-resolution digital elevation models and wind measurements. The relationship between orographic lift and flight routes suggests gulls have advanced knowledge of their aerial surroundings and the benefits to be gained from them, even regarding small features such as tree lines. We show that in a landscape constantly influenced by anthropogenic change, the structure of our landscape has an aerial impact on flight route connectivity and costs.

TI  - Measuring landscape connectivity: On the importance of within-patch connectivity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Many connectivity metrics have been used to measure the connectivity of a landscape and to evaluate the effects of land-use changes and potential mitigation measures. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of how to accurately quantify landscape connectivity. A number of metrics only measure between-patch connectivity, i.e. the connectivity between different habitat patches, which can produce misleading results. This paper demonstrates that the inclusion of within-patch connectivity is important for accurate results. The behavior of two metrics is compared: the Connectance Index (CONNECT), which measures only between-patch connectivity, and the effective mesh size (meff), which includes both within-patch and between-patch connectivity. The connectivity values of both metrics were calculated on a set of simulated landscapes. Twenty cities were then added to these landscapes to calculate the resulting changes in connectivity. We found that when using CONNECT counter-intuitive results occurred due to not including within-patch connectivity, such as scenarios where connectivity increased with increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. These counter-intuitive results were resolved when using meff. For example, landscapes with low habitat amount may be particularly sensitive to urban development, but this is not reflected by CONNECT. Applying misleading results from metrics like CONNECT can have detrimental effects on natural ecosystems, because reductions in within-patch connectivity by human activities are neglected. Therefore, this paper provides evidence for the crucial need to consider the balance between within-patch connectivity and between-patch connectivity when calculating the connectivity of landscapes.

TI  - Being Well-Connected Pays in a Disturbed World: Enhanced Herbivory in Better-Linked Habitats
PY  - 2020
AB  - Seascapes are typically comprised of multiple components that are functionally linked by the movement of organisms and fluxes of matter. Changes to the number and spatial arrangement of these linkages affect biological connectivity that, in turn, can alter ecological functions. Herbivory is one such function, pivotal in controlling excessive algal growth when systems become disturbed. Here, we used microcosm experiments to test how the change to connectivity affects herbivory under different levels of disturbance. We applied network theory to measure types of connectivity at different scales (patch and whole system) and quantified herbivory by a crustacean mesograzer exposed to excess algae, mimicking pulse and press disturbances. We demonstrate that greater connectivity significantly enhances herbivory in Clibanarius virescens: Both the number of linkages and their spatial arrangement interact to shape the response of herbivory in systems to disturbance. Our findings highlight the value of controlled experiments for advancing theories about the potential effects of connectivity on important ecological functions, such as herbivory, and justify further investigation to measure how connectivity might affect the resilience of ecosystems. We posit that the variation in the type, and scale, of spatial linkages might have profound consequences for managing the capacity of ecosystems to respond to disturbance.

TI  - History matters: village distances, grazing and grassland species diversity
PY  - 2010
AB  - 1. Temperate semi-natural grasslands are characterized by high levels of species diversity and have a high conservation value. Plant species diversity in grazed semi-natural grasslands is known to be influenced by management intensity and habitat connectivity. Both grazing pressure and between-patch connectivity are expected to depend on the movement patterns of livestock in the landscape. 2. The present study examines associations between fine-scale (within 0.25 m(2) plots) plant species diversity in semi-natural grasslands and present grazing intensity, present and historical habitat connectivity, and the (present and historical) distance from the nearest village. The study area was a local (4.5 x 4.5 km) agricultural landscape on the island of Oland, Sweden. 3. Fine-scale (Shannon) diversity and species richness were unimodally associated with the distance from the nearest historical (ad 1800) village, with maximum values c. 1-1.5 km from villages. These associations suggest that the distance from historical villages behaves as an integrated descriptor of variation in long-termmanagement intensity (livestock movements) and reflects aspects of the functional connectivity between plant communities in semi-natural grasslands. 4. Groups of variables characterizing village distances, grazing pressure and habitat connectivity had overlapping effects on species diversity. Grazing intensity had the largest individual impact on diversity, followed by the distance from the nearest historical village and present-day habitat connectivity. 5. Synthesis and applications. The study indicates the importance of viewing grassland diversity in the context of local landscape history. Unimodal associations between fine-scale plant species diversity and the distance from the nearest village in ad 1800 suggest that information on the proximity to villages in the historical landscape has a potential use in conservation planning - as an indicator of variation in long-term grassland management intensity. Conservation programmes for grazed temperate grasslands should (1) give priority to old grasslands with an uninterrupted history of grazing management, (2) ensure a moderate grazing intensity, (3) avoid overgrazing and/or long breaks in the continuity of grazing management.

TI  - Maximising the clustering coefficient of networks and the effects on habitat network robustness.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The robustness of networks against node failure and the response of networks to node removal has been studied extensively for networks such as transportation networks, power grids, and food webs. In many cases, a network's clustering coefficient was identified as a good indicator for network robustness. In ecology, habitat networks constitute a powerful tool to represent metapopulations or -communities, where nodes represent habitat patches and links indicate how these are connected. Current climate and land-use changes result in decline of habitat area and its connectivity and are thus the main drivers for the ongoing biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts are therefore needed to improve the connectivity and mitigate effects of habitat loss. Habitat loss can easily be modelled with the help of habitat networks and the question arises how to modify networks to obtain higher robustness. Here, we develop tools to identify which links should be added to a network to increase the robustness. We introduce two different heuristics, Greedy and Lazy Greedy, to maximize the clustering coefficient if multiple links can be added. We test these approaches and compare the results to the optimal solution for different generic networks including a variety of standard networks as well as spatially explicit landscape based habitat networks. In a last step, we simulate the robustness of habitat networks before and after adding multiple links and investigate the increase in robustness depending on both the number of added links and the heuristic used. We found that using our heuristics to add links to sparse networks such as habitat networks has a greater impact on the clustering coefficient compared to randomly adding links. The Greedy algorithm delivered optimal results in almost all cases when adding two links to the network. Furthermore, the robustness of networks increased with the number of additional links added using the Greedy or Lazy Greedy algorithm.

TI  - The conservation value of Australia's stock route network : a multi-taxonomic approach to management and planning
PY  - NA
AB  - Stock routes have been a feature of the Australian landscape since the mid-1800s. Originally established to provide corridors of forage and shelter for livestock droved 'on the hoof', the vegetation within them remained standing while vast tracts in the surrounding landscape were cleared to make way for agriculture. However, livestock are now more commonly transported in trucks, so managing authorities no longer receive adequate income from droving permits to offset costs. At the commencement of this PhD it was being suggested that some stock routes would be lost to freehold tenure, in spite of the fact that many scientists believed them to be of great value for conservation. This project was structured into three distinct sections, aimed at providing evidence for the values of stock routes, and advice on how to best manage and plan for them into the future. The first section took the form of a literature review and spatial analysis, where I demonstrated that stock routes plays a considerable role in biodiversity conservation, recreation, tourism, preserving Indigenous cultural heritage, and as a stock refuge. I also found that they occupy fertile, low-lying areas of the landscape, and contain associated vegetation communities which have been preferentially cleared for agriculture and are under-represented in protected areas. In the second empirical section of the project I conducted surveys of three taxonomic groups which provide ecosystem services: woodland birds, wild bees, and insectivorous microbats. Data were collected from 32 stock routes which varied in width and vegetation condition, and in the fields adjacent to these stock routes. Statistical modelling was then used to quantify the response of each group to local and landscape variables characterising the survey sites. Although specific responses were different for each taxonomic group, there were some consistencies in my findings. Scattered trees in fields had a positive effect on all taxa, and the value of both native pastures and formal conservation areas close to the stock routes was also a recurring pattern. In the final section of my thesis I concentrated on the debate surrounding connectivity; whether it should be included as a goal in conservation planning, and whether this will result in trade-offs with habitat area and quality, or economic costs. It would seem logical to plan for connectivity if some stock routes are to be sold whilst others are retained for conservation purposes. Using them as a case study, I ran a Marxan minimum-set analysis which demonstrated that only certain connectivity approaches had effects on the costs and siting of reserves in conservation planning, and these effects were substantial only when conservation targets were set high. At the time of writing, the future of the stock route network remains as uncertain as it was in 2009. However, through this work I have been able to provide a much more solid foundation for potential conservation decisions than was previously available. I have also demonstrated that the stock route network is an indispensible environmental heritage asset, which should be retained and managed for conservation in perpetuity.-- provided by Candidate

TI  - Climate change, connectivity and conservation decision making: back to basics
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. The challenge of climate change forces us to re-examine the assumptions underlying conservation planning. 2. Increasing ‘connectivity’ has emerged as the most favoured option for conservation in the face of climate change. 3. We argue that the importance of connectivity is being overemphasized: quantifying the benefits of connectivity per se is plagued with uncertainty, and connectivity can be co-incidentally improved by targeting more concrete metrics: habitat area and habitat quality. 4. Synthesis and applications. Before investing in connectivity projects, conservation practitioners should analyse the benefits expected to arise from increasing connectivity and compare them with alternative investments, to ensure as much biodiversity conservation and resilience to climate change as possible within their budget. Strategies that we expect to remain robust in the face of climate change include maintaining and increasing the area of high quality habitats, prioritizing areas that have high environmental heterogeneity and controlling other anthropogenic threatening processes.

TI  - A multi-state conditional logistic regression model for the analysis of animal movement
PY  - 2017
AB  - A multi-state version of an animal movement analysis method based on conditional logistic regression, called Step Selection Function (SSF), is proposed. In ecology SSF is developed from a comparison between the observed location of an animal and randomly sampled locations at each time step. Interpretation of the parameters in the multi-state model and the impact of different sampling schemes for the random locations are discussed. We prove the relationship between the new model, called HMM-SSF, and a random walk model on the plane. This relationship allows one to use both movement characteristics and local discrete choice behaviors when identifying the model’s hidden states. The new HMM-SSF is used to model the movement behavior of GPS-collared bison in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, where it successfully teases apart areas used to forage and to travel. The analysis thus provides valuable insights into how bison adjust their movement to habitat features, thereby revealing spatial determinants of functional connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - A management-oriented framework for selecting metrics used to assess habitat- and path-specific quality in spatially structured populations
PY  - 2016
AB  - Mobile species with complex spatial dynamics can be difficult to manage because their population distributions vary across space and time, and because the consequences of managing particular habitats are uncertain when evaluated at the level of the entire population. Metrics to assess the importance of habitats and pathways connecting habitats in a network are necessary to guide a variety of management decisions. Given the many metrics developed for spatially structured models, it can be challenging to select the most appropriate one for a particular decision. To guide the management of spatially structured populations, we define three classes of metrics describing habitat and pathway quality based on their data requirements (graph-based, occupancy-based, and demographic-based metrics) and synopsize the ecological literature relating to these classes. Applying the first steps of a formal decision-making approach (problem framing, objectives, and management actions), we assess the utility of metrics for particular types of management decisions. Our framework can help managers with problem framing, choosing metrics of habitat and pathway quality, and to elucidate the data needs for a particular metric. Our goal is to help managers to narrow the range of suitable metrics for a management project, and aid in decision-making to make the best use of limited resources.

TI  - Lepidopteran species richness of alpine sites in the High Sudetes Mts.: effect of area and isolation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Alpine sites in the High Sudetes Mts. host—due to their history and special climatic conditions—unique assemblages of lepidopteran species. We used data from ten of these sites to study species richness of the lepidopteran fauna and to test the effect of site area, distance to the nearest site and connectivity. For this, we used cluster analyses, species–area relationship and the incidence function model, followed by canonical analysis to test the importance of individual factors. The list of species was compiled from available literature sources with regard to recent findings. Species richness depended significantly on all geographic factors—area, distance and connectivity. Large alpine sites were more species-rich than smaller ones and remote sites differed in species composition from the others. We conclude that any decrease of the area of these sites will drastically affect the unique lepidopteran assemblages living in the High Sudetes Mts.

TI  - LiDAR-derived three-dimensional ecological connectivity mapping for urban bird species
PY  - 2021
AB  - Although many studies have considered urban structure when investigating urban ecological networks, few have considered the three-dimensional (3D) structure of buildings as well as urban green spaces. Airborne LiDAR datasets provide an opportunity to quantify 3D structure and evaluate 3D metrics in connectivity mapping. We examined an urban ecological network using the 3D structure of both green spaces and buildings. Using breeding-season bird species observations and airborne LiDAR data collected, we assessed the influence of 3D structural variables on species diversity. We used correlation analyses to determine if vertical distribution, volume, area, and height of both buildings and vegetation were related to bird species diversity. Then we conducted circuit theory-based current flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) analysis using the LiDAR-derived structural variables. We found that the volumes of buildings and 8–10 m vegetation heights were both highly correlated with species richness per unit area. There were significant differences between 2D and 3D connectivity analysis using LiDAR-derived variables among urban forest patches, boulevards, and apartment complexes. Within urban forest patches and parks, 3D CFBC represented canopy structural characteristics well, by showing high variance in spatial distributions. The 3D CFBC results indicated that adjacent high-rise buildings, dense apartment complexes, and densely urbanized areas were isolated, as characterized by low centrality values, but that vegetation planted in open spaces between buildings could improve connectivity by linking isolated areas to core areas. Our research highlights the importance of considering 3D structure in planning and managing urban ecological connectivity.

TI  - Integrating graph-based connectivity metrics into species distribution models
PY  - 2012
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used in ecology to map the probability of species occurrence on the basis of predictive factors describing the physical environment. We propose an improvement on SDMs by using graph methods to quantify landscape connectivity. After (1) mapping the habitat suitable for a given species, this approach consists in (2) building a landscape graph, (3) computing patch-based connectivity metrics, (4) extrapolating the values of those metrics to any point of space, and (5) integrating those connectivity metrics into a predictive model of presence. For a given species, this method can be used to interpret the significance of the metrics in the models in terms of population structure. The method is illustrated here by the construction of an SDM for the European tree frog in the region of Franche-Comte (France). The results show that the connectivity metrics improve the explanatory power of the SDM and emphasize the important role of the habitat network.

TI  - L’infrastructure verte dans l’aire urbaine de Montréal: la multifonctionnalité des espaces végétalisés en question
PY  - 2021
AB  - Depuis une dizaine d’annees, on observe un engouement croissant des chercheurs pour les infrastructures vertes dans l’optique d’ameliorer la qualite de vie des habitants, notamment en identifiant les services ecosystemiques. Cette mise en reseau des espaces vegetalises urbains permet egalement d’augmenter leurs resiliences face a des perturbations (especes invasives, degradations des habitats, mauvaises pratiques de gestions, brassage genetique insuffisant, etc.). Cette multifonctionnalite des espaces vegetalises sera interrogee dans l’agglomeration montrealaise. Le paysage vegetal sera pris en compte a travers sa qualite ecologique et les usages que les urbains en font. Ce paysage vegetal est mobilise grâce a des cartes des formations vegetales identifiees par leurs especes dominantes, ce qui permet une approche plus fine que la plupart des recherches sur les infrastructures vertes par images satellites. Une evaluation criteriee nous permettra d’estimer la qualite ecologique et l’interet social des espaces vegetalises selon leurs situations dans l’espace urbain. De plus, Montreal s’est dote d’un outil d’amenagement qui correspond aux definitions d’une infrastructure verte, les ecoterritoires. Les opportunites de developpement d’une infrastructure verte seront comparees a la disposition des ecoterritoires, dans la perspective d’evaluer leurs potentiels.

TI  - Targeting Enhanced Spatial Configuration in Biodiversity Conservation Incentive Payment Programs
PY  - 2011
AB  - Spatial configuration, such as connectivity between conserved sites or complementarity of habitat types, is desirable in many conservation programs. However, such objectives frequently get limited consideration due to the additional complexity required in assessing alternative potential projects. We present a framework for incorporating spatial configuration into the assessment methods used in conservation incentive programs, while at the same time providing landholders with additional incentives for desired for including desired spatial characteristics into their project proposals. To achieve the best results, projects should be valued at the landscape-scale, rather than on a property-by-property basis. This can be done either by assessing the marginal contribution of individual projects to the landscape, or by assessing the total ecological value of the landscape under alternative packages of projects. If spatial configuration is valued in the bid assessment process, landholders have an incentive to offer it within their projects. Where coordination between landholders is required (for example, forming a conservation corridor across a landscape), this can be achieved by extending the bidding process, to allow landholders to modify their bids in order to better align with those of their neighbours. The complexity of landscape-focussed approaches can be readily tailored to fit a wide variety of purposes and budgets. At their most basic they can employ virtually identical input data to that employed by traditional project-focussed approaches. Taking the landscape-scale approach offers an opportunity to more directly target ecological function in incentive programs, increasing the cost effectiveness of public investment and better protecting species and ecological communities.

TI  - Generalizing matrix structure affects the identification of least-cost paths and patch connectivity
PY  - 2017
AB  - Understanding and assessing landscape connectivity is often a primary goal when studying patchy or spatially structured populations. It is commonly accepted that the matrix plays a role in determining connectivity; however, it is not clear how the process of assessing connectivity is impacted by different ways in which the matrix may be represented, particularly if matrix structure is generalized to expedite analysis. We conducted a controlled experiment using computer simulations to evaluate the impact of increasing levels of matrix generalization on connectivity assessment using a constant arrangement of habitat patches. We varied matrix generalization for six simulated landscape patterns by adjusting the number of classes and level of pattern grain in 16 ways to yield sets of landscapes for which the matrix ranged from not generalized (i.e., heterogeneous) to completely generalized (i.e., homogeneous) while habitat placement was held constant. Least-cost paths were calculated for each landscape, and a spatial interaction model (SIM) was implemented to model the counts of patch inflows (immigration) and pairwise exchange. Applying a SIM allowed us to generate absolute outputs and explicitly compare the effect of changes to matrix generalization on connectivity. We found that both assessment of connections (i.e., measured distance and spatial delineation of least-cost paths) and patch inflows/pairwise exchange were highly sensitive to matrix generalization and that effects were inconsistent and unpredictable across the range of matrix representations, especially when estimating connectivity for individual patches. We conclude that matrix pattern may have an underappreciated effect on connectivity and that least-cost path delineation and connectivity assessment may be very sensitive to generalizations of the matrix. We suggest that sensitivity analysis of the matrix representation should be performed when conducting connectivity analyses.

TI  - Species diversity of insects in Japan: their origins and diversification processes.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Japan is considered a global hot spot of biodiversity. With regard to species diversity, insects are no exception. To date, more than 32,000 insect species have been identified in Japan, while around 100,000 species of insects are estimated to inhabit this country. In this paper, we outline background factors having contributed to diversification of Japanese insects. Of course, the high degree of Japanese insect diversity is the result of many complex factors. In addition to the humid Asian monsoon climate and the extensive latitudinal gradient of habitats, the extremely complex geological history has contributed as an important factor to generate and maintain the high species diversity and endemism. In particular, the independent origins of northeastern and southwestern Japan from the Eurasian continent have greatly contributed to the diverse composition of Japanese insect fauna. To highlight the importance of this process, we introduce some case studies and previously published papers focusing on several insect groups with low dispersal ability. Those cases indicate that the geological history of Japan has played an important role in the differentiation of Japanese insect species. Besides such geological factors, climatic and ecological factors in combination have contributed to the formation of Japanese insect fauna in complicated ways and produced its particularly high degree of biodiversity. The knowledge compiled here will provide useful information for future studies aiming to understand more deeply the processes of speciation and faunal formation of Japanese insects.

TI  - gflow: software for modelling circuit theory‐based connectivity at any scale
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary Increasing habitat connectivity is important for mitigating the effects of climate change, landscape fragmentation and habitat loss for biodiversity conservation. However, modelling connectivity at the relevant scales over which these threats occur has been limited by computational requirements. Here, we introduce the open-source software gflow, which massively parallelizes the computation of circuit theory-based connectivity. The software is developed for high-performance computing, but scales to consumer-grade desktop computers running modern Linux or Mac OS X operating systems. We report high computational efficiency representing a 173× speedup over existing software using high-performance computing and a 8·4× speedup using a desktop computer while drastically reducing memory requirements. gflow allows large-extent and high-resolution connectivity problems to be calculated over many iterations and at multiple scales. We envision gflow being immediately useful for large-landscape efforts, including climate-driven animal range shifts, multitaxa connectivity, and for the many developing use-cases of circuit theory-based connectivity.

TI  - Participatory and deliberative assessment of the landscape and natural resource social values of marine and coastal ecosystem services: the case of Kyrenia (Girne) Region from Northern Cyprus.
PY  - 2021
AB  - This paper aims to identify and evaluate the landscape and natural resource (traditional ecological knowledge) social values of marine and coastal ecosystem services (MCESs) in Kyrenia (Girne) Region of Northern Cyprus. To this end, the objectives of the study were (1) to identify and evaluate the key landscape social values of MCESs, and (2) to record and assess the major marine and coastal natural resources harvested as traditional ecological knowledge. Participatory and deliberative research techniques were used to uncover both value types. The data on the marine and coastal natural resources as traditional ecological knowledge were obtained from the stakeholders through 6 in-depth discussion groups and 9 in-depth interviews. The quantitative data on the landscape social values of MCESs were collected with a questionnaire designed. Within this context; the respondents scored the importance of MCESs on a five-point Likert scale. The results showed that the stakeholders hold six landscape social values of MCESs: aesthetic, entertainment, life-sustaining, biodiversity, recreation, and nutrition. However, the total average relative degree of MCESs was found to be very low with 1.71 points. Besides, it was determined that the stakeholders harvest 29 fishes and 3 plant species from the marine and coastal ecosystems. The landscape and natural resource social values of MCESs, and relevant traditional ecological knowledge are important cultural heritage and guiding principles, which should be incorporated into the landscape and natural resource management policies in the region and elsewhere. A greater focus should also be given to integrating the values identified in the ecosystem services assessment.

TI  - How Predation and Landscape Fragmentation Affect Vole Population Dynamics
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Microtine species in Fennoscandia display a distinct north-south gradient from regular cycles to stable populations. The gradient has often been attributed to changes in the interactions between microtines and their predators. Although the spatial structure of the environment is known to influence predator-prey dynamics of a wide range of species, it has scarcely been considered in relation to the Fennoscandian gradient. Furthermore, the length of microtine breeding season also displays a north-south gradient. However, little consideration has been given to its role in shaping or generating population cycles. Because these factors covary along the gradient it is difficult to distinguish their effects experimentally in the field. The distinction is here attempted using realistic agent-based modelling. Methodology/Principal Findings: By using a spatially explicit computer simulation model based on behavioural and ecological data from the field vole (Microtus agrestis), we generated a number of repeated time series of vole densities whose mean population size and amplitude were measured. Subsequently, these time series were subjected to statistical autoregressive modelling, to investigate the effects on vole population dynamics of making predators more specialised, of altering the breeding season, and increasing the level of habitat fragmentation. We found that fragmentation as well as the presence of specialist predators are necessary for the occurrence of population cycles. Habitat fragmentation and predator assembly jointly determined cycle length and amplitude. Length of vole breeding season had little impact on the oscillations. Significance: There is good agreement between our results and the experimental work from Fennoscandia, but our results allow distinction of causation that is hard to unravel in field experiments. We hope our results will help understand the reasons for cycle gradients observed in other areas. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of landscape fragmentation for population cycling and we recommend that the degree of fragmentation be more fully considered in future analyses of vole dynamics.

TI  - Multilevel Spatial Structure Impacts on the Pollination Services of Comarum palustre (Rosaceae)
PY  - 2014
AB  - Habitat destruction and fragmentation accelerate pollinator decline, consequently disrupting ecosystem processes such as pollination. To date, the impacts of multilevel spatial structure on pollination services have rarely been addressed. We focused on the effects of population spatial structure on the pollination services of Comarum palustre at three levels (i.e. within-population, between-populations and landscape). For three years, we investigated 14 Belgian populations, which differed in their within-population flower density, population surface, closure (i.e. proportion of the population edge that consisted of woody elements) and isolation (i.e. percentage of woody area cover within a 500 m radius from the population centre). We tested whether these spatial characteristics impact on pollinator abundance and visitation rate and thus, reproductive success of C. palustre. Insects were observed in 15 randomly-chosen plots in each population. We tested for pollen limitation with supplemental hand-cross pollination. Bumble bees and solitary bees were the major pollinators through all populations. Within populations, plots with high flower densities attracted high numbers of bumble bees and other insects. High bumble bee and solitary bee abundance was observed in populations presenting high proportions of woody edges and in populations within landscapes presenting high proportions of woody areas. Seed set resulting from open pollination varied with bumble bee and solitary bee visitation rate, leading to increased pollen limitation when pollinators were scarce. Since the reproductive success depended on the visitation rate of the main pollinators, which depended on multilevel spatial structure, wetland management plans should pay special attention to favour a mosaic of biotopes, including nesting sites and food resources for insects. This study particularly supports the relevance of a mix wetlands and woody habitats to bees.

TI  - Identifying ecological corridors for Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) and Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis)
PY  - 2015
AB  - The rapid explosion of human populations and the associated development of human-dominated landscapes have drastically reduced and fragmented habitat for tigers (Panthera tigris) and leopards (Panthera pardus) across Asia, resulting in multiple small populations. However, Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) habitat in Russia has remained largely interconnected, except for a break between tigers in southwest Primorye and the southern Sikhote-Alin Mountains. This habitat patch in southwest Primorye also retains the last population of Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis). Genetic differentiation of tigers in southwest Primorye and the Sikhote-Alin Mountains along with survey data suggest that habitat fragmentation is limiting movement of tigers and leopards across the Razdolnaya River basin. We looked at historical and recent survey data on tigers and leopards and mapped existing cover types to examine land-use patterns of both large felids and humans in the development strip along the Razdolnaya River. We then used least-cost distance analyses to identify the most effective potential corridor to retain connectivity for large felids between Land of the Leopard National Park and Ussuriskii Zapovednik (Reserve). We identified a single potential corridor that still exists with a total distance of 62.5 km from Land of the Leopard National Park to Ussuriskii Zapovednik, mostly (93%) through forested habitat. We recommend formal recognition of a Razdolnaya ecological corridor and provide specific recommendations for each of 3 proposed management sections.

TI  - Butterfly dispersal in inhospitable matrix: rare, risky, but long-distance
PY  - 2013
AB  - Metapopulation models typically assume that suitable habitats occupied by local populations and unsuitable matrix separating them form a 'black- and-white' landscape mosaic, in which dispersal is primarily determined by the spatial configuration of habitat patches. In reality, however, the matrix com- position is also likely to influence dispersal. Using intensive mark-recapture surveys we investigated inter-patch movements in Maculinea (Phengaris) nausithous and M. teleius occurring sympatrically in six metapopulations. Three of these metapopulations had the matrix dominated by forest, an inhospitable environment for grassland butterflies, whereas in the remaining three the matrix was mostly composed of open environments. Dispersal parameters derived with the Virtual Migration model revealed significant differences between both groups of metapopulations. Both species had a lower propensity to emigrate from their natal habitat patches, and they suffered substan- tially higher dispersal mortality in the metapopula- tions with forest matrix. On the other hand, mean dispersal distances were roughly an order of magni- tude longer in forest matrix as compared with open landscapes (ca. 500-1,500 vs. 100-200 m). Our results suggest that inhospitable forest matrix induces strong selection against dispersal, leading to a reduced emigration rate. At the same time, the selection may promote emigrants with good dispersal abilities, which are able to perform long-distance movements. Thus, while it is generally believed that a matrix

TI  - Landscape fragmentation in coffee agroecological subzones in central Kenya: a multiscale remote sensing approach
PY  - 2020
AB  - Smallholder agroecological subzones (AEsZs) produce an array of crops occupying large areas throughout Africa but remain largely unmapped. We explored multisource satellite datasets to produce a seamless land-use and land-cover (LULC) and fragmentation dataset for upper midland (UM1 to UM4) AEsZs in central Kenya. Specifically, the utility of PlanetScope, Sentinel 2, and Landsat 8 images for mapping coffee-based landscape were tested using a random forest (RF) classifier. Vegetation indices, texture variables, and wavelength bands from all satellite data were used as inputs in generating four RF models. A LULC baseline map was produced that was further analyzed using FRAGSTAT to generate landscape metrics for each AEsZs. Wavelength bands model from Sentinel 2 had the highest overall accuracy with shortwave near-infrared and green bands as the most important variables. In UM1 and UM2, coffee was the dominant cover type, whereas annual and other perennial crops dominated the landscape in UM3 and UM4. The patch density for coffee was five times higher in UM4 than in UM1. Since Sentinel 2 is freely available, the approach used in our study can be adopted to support land-use planning in smallholder agroecosystems.

TI  - The sound of management: Acoustic monitoring for agricultural industries
PY  - 2019
AB  - Global biodiversity is declining rapidly while the human population grows exponentially. This creates pressure for agricultural industries to improve productivity, but also demonstrate that on-farm management actions are minimising impacts on biodiversity. However, the costs and logistical considerations of traditional biodiversity assessment methods are beyond the scope of many agricultural industries and landholders. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for acoustic biodiversity monitoring in agricultural systems. We assessed a range of species-specific and more general acoustic indices using five key criteria (i.e. relevance to industry, diagnostic capability, spatio-temporal scale, logistical feasibility, and utility as a biodiversity surrogate) to determine whether they were suitable for assessing biodiversity outcomes for agricultural industries and individual farmers. Based on these assessment criteria, species-specific or guild-specific acoustic bioindicators that are processed using automatic recognisers are more appropriate for biodiversity monitoring when the goal is to assess industry- or farm-specific impacts on biodiversity. If there is no need to establish a diagnostic link between on-farm management practices and biodiversity, then acoustic indices are more logistically feasible to use and may more accurately reflect overall biodiversity. We also recommend using birds and bats for acoustic monitoring in agricultural systems because they are relatively easy to monitor, exhibit peaks in activity around dusk or dawn, and are not necessarily water dependent. We believe that acoustic monitoring has the potential to deliver consistent, repeatable results at a relatively low cost compared to traditional biodiversity monitoring, which will allow individual farmers and agricultural industries to more easily track their sustainability performance. This becomes even more critical as we consider the increasing role that agricultural regions will have in sustaining the world’s rapidly declining biodiversity.

We studied the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the dispersal of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an endangered social lemur species living in a restricted and highly fragmented landscape. We combined spatial analysis and population genetics methods to describe population units and identify the environmental factors which best predict the rates and patterns of genetic differentiation within and between populations. We used non-invasive methods to genotype 230 individuals at 13 microsatellites in all the main forest fragments of its entire distribution area. Our analyses suggest that the Manankolana River and geographical distance are the primary structuring factors, while a national road crossing the region does not seem to impede gene flow. Altogether, our results are in agreement with a limited influence of forest habitat connectivity on gene flow patterns (except for North of the species’ range), suggesting that dispersal is still possible today among most forest patches for this species. Within forest patches, we find that dispersal is mainly among neighbouring social groups, hence confirming previous behavioural observations.

TI  - Combining a dispersal model with network theory to assess habitat connectivity
PY  - 2010
AB  - Assessing the potential for threatened species to persist and spread within fragmented landscapes requires the identification of core areas that can sustain resident populations and dispersal corridors that can link these core areas with isolated patches of remnant habitat. We developed a set of GIS tools, simulation methods, and network analysis procedures to assess potential landscape connectivity for the Delmarva fox squirrel (DFS; Sciurus niger cinereus), an endangered species inhabiting forested areas on the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. Information on the DFS's life history and dispersal characteristics, together with data on the composition and configuration of land cover on the peninsula, were used as input data for an individual-based model to simulate dispersal patterns of millions of squirrels. Simulation results were then assessed using methods from graph theory, which quantifies habitat attributes associated with local and global connectivity. Several bottlenecks to dispersal were identified that were not apparent from simple distance-based metrics, highlighting specific locations for landscape conservation, restoration, and/or squirrel translocations. Our approach links simulation models, network analysis, and available field data in an efficient and general manner, making these methods useful and appropriate for assessing the movement dynamics of threatened species within landscapes being altered by human and natural disturbances.

TI  - Future losses of playa wetlands decrease network structure and connectivity of the Rainwater Basin, Nebraska
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Rainwater Basin in south-central Nebraska once supported a complex network of ~ 12,000 spatially-isolated playa wetlands, but ~ 90% have been lost since European settlement. Future losses are likely and expected reductions in connectivity could further isolate populations, increasing local extinction rates of many wetland species. However, to what extent future losses will affect wildlife likely depends on the role of lost wetlands in maintaining connectivity. We compared the current Rainwater Basin network to future wetland loss scenarios to assess minimum, mean, and maximum effects of losses on network connectivity for a range of wildlife taxa. We used network models to rank wetlands by their functionality and relative importance in maintaining connectivity. We then removed 10–50% of high-ranked, low-ranked, or random subsets of wetlands and assessed connectivity of the remaining network. A 10% loss of highly-ranked wetlands substantially decreased connectivity for species with dispersal capabilities < 5.5 km, while a 40–50% loss reduced connectivity for all tested dispersal distances (0.5–12.0 km). When large proportions of highly-ranked wetlands were lost, the eastern and western halves of the Rainwater Basin network were no longer connected for any dispersal distance. Loss of low-ranked wetlands had minimal effects on network connectivity, until at least the lowest-ranked 50% were removed. Many highly-ranked playa wetlands in the Rainwater Basin are currently unprotected and might disappear from the landscape. Protecting wetlands that are key in maintaining connectivity especially benefits species with limited dispersal capabilities (< 5.5 km) for which consequences of future habitat losses might be worst.

TI  - Role of habitat heterogeneity and landscape connectivity in shaping gene flow and spatial population structure of a dominant rodent species in a tropical dry forest
PY  - 2015
AB  - Evaluating how habitat heterogeneity and landscape connectivity influence fine-scale population processes of gene flow and spatial population structure is key for understanding animal dispersal. Liomys pictus is a heteromyid rodent that inhabits tropical dry deciduous and semideciduous forests, where it is a dominant, abundant species and a key element on the ecosystem as seed disperser. We evaluated how landscape features shaped the genetic structure and gene flow at a fine scale among L. pictus populations in a well-conserved natural environment. On the basis of L. pictus ecological characteristics (e.g. dominant species, female philopatry), we predicted that forested areas (irrespective of vegetation type) should facilitate dispersal if the forest vegetation acted as a kind of corridor, and that these patterns will be different between sexes. We tested these assumptions (104 individuals, six sampling localities, 14 microsatellite loci) after checking for discrete genetic groups using Bayesian clustering methods, by assessing the effect of landscape variables on patterns of gene flow combining Mantel and partial Mantel tests, least-cost path and circuit theories. L. pictus differentiated into genetic clusters delimited by clear landscape boundaries. Accordingly, resistance hypotheses results showed that precipitation and stream channels were the main environmental and landscape attributes influencing gene flow. Exchange of a majority of migrants was detected from the center into other sampling localities, indicating higher dispersal throughout deciduous and semideciduous forest corridors, whereas isolation by distance was found only for females. Our approach allowed us to elucidate animal environmental space use, identifying some of the landscape features linked to the species dispersal patterns, which can serve as a basis for the study and comparison with other tropical forests and species. It can also have conservation applications, for instance, preserving the forested corridors we identified as significant for dispersal can likely benefit other codistributed, threatened rodent species.

TI  - Colonization of central European abandoned fields by dry grassland species depends on the species richness of the source habitats: a new approach for measuring habitat isolation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abandoned fields are perceived as potential habitats for species of threatened semi-natural dry grasslands. However, information is lacking regarding how the spontaneous colonization of abandoned fields depends on the broader spatial context. We recorded the occurrence of 87 target species in 46 abandoned fields and 339 dry grasslands. We tested the effect of the isolation of abandoned fields from source grasslands on the number of dry grassland species occurring in abandoned fields either with or without habitat characteristics being used as covariates. The isolation of the fields was calculated using the distance and area (IA) or distance and species richness (IS) of source habitats. IS always explained the number of grassland species in the abandoned fields better than IA. The effect of isolation became smaller or even non-significant with the inclusion of covariates; it also changed with the method used for measuring distance (edge-to-edge or center-to-center), and it was lower when other abandoned fields were considered as additional source habitats. The different performance of the two isolation measures can be explained by the weak species–area relationship in the grasslands, indicating differences in their habitat quality. Species richness is a better proxy of habitat importance in terms of propagule source than habitat area, and the new isolation measure is therefore suitable for studying the effects of landscape structure on species richness in landscapes presenting a weak species–area relationship, such as areas exhibiting pronounced effects of land-use history. Inclusion of habitat characteristics as covariates may considerably alter conclusions regarding the effect of isolation, which might actually be overestimated when assessed separately.

TI  - Landscape connectivity among remnant populations of guanaco (Lama guanicoe Müller, 1776) in an arid region of Chile impacted by global change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Connectivity between populations plays a key role in the long-term persistence of species in fragmented habitats. This is of particular concern for biodiversity preservation in drylands, since water limited landscapes are typically characterized by little suitable habitat cover, high habitat fragmentation, harsh matrices, and are being rapidly degraded at a global scale. In this study, we modelled landscape connectivity between 11 guanaco Lama guanicoe populations in Chile's arid Norte Chico, a region that supports the last remnant coastal populations of this emblematic herbivore indigenous to South America. We produced a habitat suitability model to derive a regional surface resistance map, and used circuit theory to map functional connectivity, investigate the relative isolation between populations, and identify those that contribute most to the patch connectivity network. Predicted suitable habitat for L. guanicoe represented about 25% of the study region (i.e., 29,173 km2) and was heterogeneously distributed along a continuous stretch along the Andes, and discontinuous patches along the coast. As a result, we found that high connectivity current flows in the mid and high Andes formed a wide, continuous connectivity corridor, enabling connectivity between all high Andean populations. Coastal populations, in contrast, were more isolated. These groups demonstrate no inter-population connectivity between themselves, only with higher altitude populations, and for two of them, animal movement was linked to the effectiveness of wildlife crossings along the Pan-American highway. Our results indicate that functional connectivity is an issue of concern for L. guanicoe in Chile's Norte Chico, implying that future conservation and management plans should emphasize strategies aimed at conserving functional connectivity between coastal and Andean populations, as well as the protection of habitat patches likely to act as stepping stones within the connectivity network.

TI  - Extent of Kentucky Bluegrass and Its Effect on Native Plant Species Diversity and Ecosystem Services in the Northern Great Plains of the United States
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Kentucky bluegrass, a nonnative species, has invaded rangelands in the United States and is currently present in most rangelands across the Northern Great Plains. Despite its accelerated expansion, the consequences of Kentucky bluegrass on the diversity of native plant species and on ecosystem services remain largely unknown. We synthesized the available data related to Kentucky bluegrass and how it affects native plant diversity and ecosystem services. We found that invasion may bring negative consequences to ecosystem services, such as pollination, habitat for wildlife species, and alteration of nutrient and hydrologic cycles, among others. To maintain the flow of ecosystem goods and services from these rangeland ecosystems, range science must adapt to the challenge of introduced, cool-season grass dominance in mixed-grass prairie. Based on our findings, we identify research needs that address ecosystem changes brought on by Kentucky bluegrass invasion and the corresponding effects these change...

TI  - Effects of within-patch heterogeneity on connectivity in pond-breeding amphibians studied by means of an individual-based model
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract. The metapopulation framework presumes the habitat of a local population to be continuous and homogenous, and patch area is often used as a proxy for population size. Many populations of pond-breeding amphibians are assumed to follow metapopulation dynamics, and connectivity is mostly measured between breeding ponds. However, the habitat of pond-breeding amphibians is not only defined by the pond but, typically, consists of a breeding pond surrounded by clusters of disjoint summer-habitat patches interspersed with an agricultural/semi-urban matrix. We hypothesise that the internal structure of a habitat patch may change connectivity in two ways: (i) by affecting animal movements and thereby emigration and immigration probabilities; and (ii) by affecting habitat quality and population size. To test our hypotheses, we apply a spatially explicit individual-based model of Moor frog dispersal. We find that the realised connectivity depends on internal structure of both the target and the source patch as well as on how habitat quality is affected by patch structure. Although fragmentation is generally thought to have negative effects on connectivity, our results suggest that, depending on patch structure and habitat quality, positive effects on connectivity may occur.

TI  - Impact of human pressure and forest fragmentation on the Endangered Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus in the Middle Atlas of Morocco
PY  - 2013
AB  - Overexploitation of forests by humans can lead to highly fragmented populations of forest-dependent species that have poor dispersal abilities. We tested the influence of habitat quality, landscape structure and human pressure on densities of the Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus in the largest wild population, in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. We surveyed 14 forest fragments of 5-142 km2 that are separated from each other by an inhospitable matrix. We estimated the habitat quality of these forest patches by analysing the vegetation structure and the intensity of human pressure. We studied the distribution of forest patches and estimated macaque densities by combining line-transect sampling and complete group counts. We estimated mean density of individuals to be 9 km−2 (range 0.2-23 km−2). Differentiation of forest patches by a principal component analysis did not show any significant relationship between vegetation type and macaque density. A linear regression model showed that human pressure had a negative impact on density and that density responded positively to patch size. Patch shape, connectivity and altitude did not explain variation in population density. The size of this population is estimated to be c. 5,000 individuals. The survival of several small subpopulations is seriously threatened. As the Middle Atlas is the stronghold of this Endangered species, we recommend modifying forestry practices, reducing overgrazing by livestock within forests, and halting clear-cutting of holm oaks.

TI  - Testing source-sink theory: the spill-over of mussel recruits beyond marine protected areas
PY  - 2012
AB  - Source-sink theory has contributed to our understanding of the function of protected areas, particularly due to their role as population sources. Marine reserves are a preferred management tool for the conservation of natural populations, creating areas of good quality habitat and thus improving population connectivity by enhancing larval supply and recruitment among shores. Despite recent advances in the study of protected areas in the context of the source-sink theory, rigorous and empirical testing of marine reserves as metapopulation sources for the adjacent areas remain largely unexplored. We investigated the role of marine reserves as population sources, whether there was spill-over beyond the reserve boundaries and if so, whether spill-over was directional. We measured percentage cover and recruitment of mussels (Perna perna) at two reserves and two comparably sized exploited control areas on the south-east coast of South Africa where unprotected populations are severely affected by artisanal exploitation. Adult abundances were enhanced within reserves, but decreased towards their edges. We predicted that recruitment would mirror adult abundances and show directionality, with northern shores having greater recruitment following the prevalent northward flow of near-shore currents. There were, however, no correlations between adult abundances and recruitment for any months or shores, and no clear spatial patterns in recruitment (i.e. similar patterns occurred at reserves and controls). The results emphasise that, while reserves may act as important refuges by protecting adult abundances, their influence on promoting recovery of near-by exploited shores through larval spill-over may be overestimated.

TI  - How has the state-of-the-art for quantification of landscape pattern advanced in the twenty-first century?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Landscape ecology was founded on the idea that there is a reciprocal relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes. I provide a retrospective look at how the state-of-the-art of landscape pattern analysis has changed since 1998. My objective is to show how pattern analysis techniques have evolved and identify some of the key lessons learned. The state-of-the-art in 1998 was derived from information theory, fractal geometry, percolation theory, hierarchy theory and graph theory, relying heavily on the island-patch conceptual model using categorical maps, although point-data analysis methods were actively being explored. We have gradually winnowed down the list of fundamental components of spatial pattern, and have clarified the appropriate and inappropriate use of landscape metrics for research and application. We have learned to let the objectives choose the metric, guided by the scale and nature of the ecological process of interest. The use of alternatives to the binary patch model (such as gradient analysis) shows great promise to advance landscape ecological knowledge. The patch paradigm is often of limited usefulness, and other ways to represent the pattern of landscape properties may reveal deeper insights. The field continues to advance as illustrated by papers in this special issue.

TI  - Regional Index of Ecological Integrity: A need for sustainable management of natural resources
PY  - 2011
AB  - An ecosystem is a complex composition of physical, chemical and biological components. This complex system remains in a healthy state if the system can maintain the ecological equilibrium among its components. Anthropogenic disturbances are the prime stressors that affect this equilibrium through creating fragmentation, ecosystem sensitivity, loosening landscape connectivity and disrupting ecological integrity. As different types of ecosystem are interconnected, a comprehensive monitoring and evaluating criteria is needed for measuring its integrity at regional level for conservation planning. A Regional Index of Ecological Integrity can be a suitable approach for sustainable management of regional ecosystem. Therefore, this paper presents (i) the characteristics of ecological integrity, (ii) the spatial processes induced by anthropogenic stressors and (iii) an approach to develop a composite Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI). The prime objective is to establish a thought and a way to develop a composite index of ecological integrity at the regional level. Here, we demonstrate different compositional, structural and functional indicators/indices related to fragmentation, representativeness of protected area, ecosystem sensitivity, and landscape connectivity for the development of a Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI).

TI  - Understanding the impacts of temporal variability on estimates of landscape connectivity
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Landscape connectivity estimates are widely used to inform species conservation management. However, although many landscapes and species behaviours change over time, such as between seasons, the vast majority of studies view connectivity as static. Calls have therefore been made to use multiple connectivity estimates to adequately capture periodic (e.g., seasonal) temporal changes. These periodic temporal changes are also influenced by stochastic perturbations, such as extreme weather events, and this variability is likely to increase due to ongoing climate change. We aimed to investigate: 1) how variability interacts with periodic landscape changes to alter connectivity estimates, and 2) how these alterations change over longer time-periods. To achieve this we used a virtual ecology approach in which we simulated 100 landscapes. Each simulation ran for 20 seasons with the landscape experiencing regular seasonal changes. Each simulation was then rerun five times with increasing levels of variability super-imposed on the seasonal dynamics. Connectivity for each landscape and every season was calculated using least-cost paths modelling, and the differences between connectivity estimates calculated. We found that the variation in connectivity estimates between seasons increased with temporal variability. Differences in connectivity accumulated over time, meaning that as the variability increased connectivity estimates changed more quickly and by larger amounts. Our study demonstrates that increasing temporal variability will become a challenge for the successful use of static connectivity estimates.

TI  - Predicting ectotherm disease vector spread--benefits from multidisciplinary approaches and directions forward.
PY  - 2013
AB  - The occurrence of ectotherm disease vectors outside of their previous distribution area and the emergence of vector-borne diseases can be increasingly observed at a global scale and are accompanied by a growing number of studies which investigate the vast range of determining factors and their causal links. Consequently, a broad span of scientific disciplines is involved in tackling these complex phenomena. First, we evaluate the citation behaviour of relevant scientific literature in order to clarify the question “do scientists consider results of other disciplines to extend their expertise?” We then highlight emerging tools and concepts useful for risk assessment. Correlative models (regression-based, machine-learning and profile techniques), mechanistic models (basic reproduction number R 0) and methods of spatial regression, interaction and interpolation are described. We discuss further steps towards multidisciplinary approaches regarding new tools and emerging concepts to combine existing approaches such as Bayesian geostatistical modelling, mechanistic models which avoid the need for parameter fitting, joined correlative and mechanistic models, multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic profiling. We take the quality of both occurrence data for vector, host and disease cases, and data of the predictor variables into consideration as both determine the accuracy of risk area identification. Finally, we underline the importance of multidisciplinary research approaches. Even if the establishment of communication networks between scientific disciplines and the share of specific methods is time consuming, it promises new insights for the surveillance and control of vector-borne diseases worldwide.

TI  - A Biophysical Model and Network Analysis of Invertebrate Community Dispersal Reveals Regional Patterns of Seagrass Habitat Connectivity
PY  - 2021
AB  - The dispersal of marine organisms is a critical process for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across a seascape. Understanding the patterns of habitat connectivity that arise from the movement of multiple species can highlight the role of regional processes in maintaining local community structure. However, quantifying the probability and scale of dispersal for marine organisms remains a challenge. Here, we use a biophysical model to simulate dispersal, and we conduct a network analysis to predict connectivity patterns across scales for the community of invertebrates associated with seagrass habitat in British Columbia, Canada. We found many possible connections and few isolated habitat meadows, but the probability of most connections was low. Most habitat connections occurred within 3 days of dispersal time over short distances, indicating potential limits to long distance dispersal and little effect of species-specific dispersal abilities on the potential spatial extent of habitat connectivity. We then highlight the different roles that individual seagrass meadows can play in maintaining network connectivity. We also identify clusters of connected meadows and use these clusters to estimate the spatial scale of community dynamics. The connectivity patterns generated by our dispersal simulations highlight the importance of considering marine communities in their broad seascape context, with applications for the prioritization and conservation of habitat that maintains connectivity.

TI  - Primacy of seascape connectivity effects in structuring coral reef fish assemblages
PY  - 2012
AB  - Connectivity has fundamental consequences for the productivity, persistence and management of coral reefs. The area and position of adjacent mangroves and seagrass can affect the demography of reef fish populations and the composition of reefal assemblages. To date, no studies have attempted to partition the influences of these habitats on reef fish assemblages. We used an exploratory seascape approach to separate the effects of connectivity with mangroves and seagrass on reef fish in Moreton Bay, Australia. We then compared the performance of seascape connectivity and reef complexity (i.e. coral cover, rugosity and area) in structuring these assemblages. Our results suggest a hierarchy of seascape connectivity effects, with reef fish assemblages being primarily distinguished by isolation (i.e. separation distance) from mangroves and secondarily by proximity (an index incorporating habitat isolation and area) to seagrass. Importantly, measures of reef complexity were only useful in separating reef fish assemblages within levels of connectivity with mangroves and seagrass. We demonstrate that neighbouring mangroves and seagrasses can exert different effects on reef fish assemblages, with 25% of all species being primarily influenced by mangroves and a different 25% being affected by seagrass. These findings have important implications for the design of marine reserve networks. They show that position in the seascape can be of greater significance than reef area or complexity to the composition of reef fish assemblages and highlight the value of incorporating seascape connectivity into conservation planning.

TI  - Maggengo meadow patches enclosed by forests in the Italian Alps: evidence of landscape legacy on plant diversity
PY  - 2011
AB  - The maggenghi are mid slope meadows typical of all the southern and of great parts of the northern European Alps, for centuries managed with traditional and low intensity techniques. Usually, they are scattered patches in surrounding forests. The spontaneous expansion of trees and shrubs, favored by the recent decline of mountain agriculture, lead the maggengo patches patterns and shapes to change. Our objective was to analyze the effect of this change on current plant diversity of the remnant patches, as the adaptive response could be slow and possibly related more to historical than to current landscape patterns. We analyzed the trend of the size, shape, elongation, fractal dimension and connectivity of maggengo patches of a Central-Eastern Italian Alpine district, in four time steps, from 1973 to 2006, and in 1859, when mountain agriculture was still widespread. Then, we studied the relationships between those landscape metrics and two current patch-level plant diversity measures: interior species richness and species density. Aerial photographs were used to investigate that trend, while a historical cadastral map was used to assess the landscape metrics in 1859. As expected, in the last 30 years, the total size of maggenghi has been reduced by 57% while their shapes have been progressively simplified. Interior species richness was positively related to size, both in 2006 and over the past 30 years, but not to any 1859 measures. Conversely, species density was positively correlated only with 1859 size, shape index and connectivity. We conclude that the historical shape, size and connectivity are some of the key variables affecting the plant species density of maggengo patches, but not of their interior plant species richness.

TI  - Moving Targets and Biodiversity Offsets for Endangered Species Habitat: Is Lesser Prairie Chicken Habitat a Stock or Flow?
PY  - 2014
AB  - The US Fish and Wildlife Service will make an Endangered Species Act listing decision for the lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; “LPC”) in March 2014. Based on the findings of a single, Uzbek antelope study, conservation plans put forth for the LPC propose to modify and re-position habitat in the landscape through a series of temporary preservation/restoration efforts. We argue that for certain species, including the LPC, dynamic habitat offsets represent a dangerous re-interpretation of habitat provision and recovery programs, which have nearly-universally viewed ecosystem offsets (habitat, wetlands, streams, etc.) as “stocks” that accumulate characteristics over time. Any effort to create a program of temporary, moving habitat offsets must consider species’ (1) life history characteristics, (2) behavioral tendencies (e.g., avoidance of impacted areas, nesting/breeding site fidelity), and (3) habitat restoration characteristics, including long temporal lags in reoccupation. If misapplied, species recovery programs using temporary, moving habitat risk further population declines.

TI  - Effect of connectivity and habitat availability on the occurrence of the Chestnut-throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos castaneus, Rhinocryptidae) in fragmented landscapes of central Chile
PY  - 2018
AB  - Although small isolated habitat patches may not be able to maintain a minimum viable population, small patches that are structurally isolated may be functionally connected if individuals can cross the gaps between them, in which case, their areas could be added to form a larger habitat patch, eventually surpassing the size threshold for holding a viable population. We studied whether models based on the size and isolation of habitat patches could be used to predict the distribution of the Chestnut-throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos castaneus) in fragmented landscapes of the coastal range of the Maule region, central Chile. We selected seven 10,000-ha landscapes (8.4–70.7% forest cover). For each habitat patch we made 18 predictions of the presence of the species based on the combination of two thresholds: three critical patch sizes for maintaining a viable population (62.5, 125 and 250 ha) and six critical isolation distances between patches (0, 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 m). We used playbacks in 59 sampling points to estimate the species’ presence/absence. We used logistic regressions to test whether the output of the patch-matrix models could explain part of the variation in the presence of Pteroptochos castaneus. The best predictions for the presence of P. castaneus were obtained with the most conservative scenarios (125–250 ha to 0–10 m), including a positive effect of the understory cover and a lack of effect of the forest type (native or exotic). Our findings suggest that the long term persistence of P. castaneus may depend on the existence of large and/or very connected forest tracts.

TI  - Effects of connectivity on animal-dispersed forest plant communities in agriculture-dominated landscapes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Questions: How does connectivity affect animal-dispersed plant assemblages in woodlots of agriculture-dominated landscapes? Is this effect dependent on zoochorous dispersal modes? Location Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) site of "Zone Atelier Armorique" (ca. 150 km(2)), Brittany, western France.Methods: We sampled 26 small post-agricultural woodlots embedded in an agricultural matrix (1-7 ha). We assessed the connectivity of each woodlot using habitat reachability metrics (i.e. Proportion of Total Potential Dispersal Flux in the Landscape) calculated along a range of dispersal distances from 100 to 1,500 m. This metric was based on graph theory and was calculated as a function of landscape matrix permeability to animal movement (i.e. seed plant dispersal vectors). We analysed the composition of plant assemblages in the core and margins of woodlots. We calculated the proportion of species richness and cover of zoochorous species within these assemblages and for specific zoochorous modes (i.e. epi-, endo- and dys-zoochorous species). We analysed the effects of Proportion of Total Potential Dispersal Flux at different dispersal distances and woodlot sizes on the functional dispersal structure of the plant community using linear models.Results: We demonstrated that overall plant zoochorous assemblages only depend on woodlot size in the range of dispersal distances tested. The proportion of richness of zoochorous species within the community increased with habitat size. Connectivity influenced only the relative proportions of the different zoochorous modes, except for the dys-zoochorous group, which was primarily influenced by woodlot size. Both epi-zoochorous and endo-zoochorous species were impacted by the interaction between connectivity and woodlot area. Connectivity increased the proportion of epi-zoochorous species richness and the proportion of endo-zoochorous cover in assemblages in large woodlots. These effects were detected at short dispersal distances. Our results were supported in both total and core plant assemblages.Conclusion: This study indicates that both habitat isolation and decrease in habitat size contribute towards shaping the functional structure of the plant community, but they act at different levels of dispersal mode. Our results suggest that in these fragmented landscapes long-distance dispersal has been lost either because of the selection of small-sized animal movements or of the rareness of plant species needing large habitat size. Maintaining woodlot connectivity in the woodland surroundings seems to be sufficient to preserve short-distance dispersal, although a more thorough restoration of landscape connectivity is necessary to recover the functional composition of the community with the whole set of dispersal patterns.

TI  - Developing Urban Green Spaces and Effective Use of Rooftop Spaces for Cooling and Urban Biodiversity
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban green spaces, which are important for people and wildlife, have been deteriorated due to urbanisation. As a result, our living environment is threatened by Unban Heat Island (UHI), poor urban biodiversity, and so on. It is, therefore, an urgent work to restore urban green spaces, despite that there are not enough open spaces. This is why rooftops of buildings, which had not previously been regarded as spaces for planting for vegetation, have been utilised as a type of open space, and so green roofing has become one of the gradually developing fields of urban ecological engineering. In Japan, the number of green roofs has increased for the past decade, especially extensive green roofs for cooling. However, our experiment shows that plants on extensive roofs can hardly affect the cooling effect because water evaporation on the soil surface is the most important for it. At the same time, green roofs are asked to be habitats for urban wildlife. Due to this, we explored brown/biodiverse roofing in UK, which is a relatively new type of extensive roofing used to provide brownfield wildlife with mimic brownfields. Many of the well-known urban environmental issues are caused by loss of biodiversity and natural habitats, mainly as a result of surface sealing through construction measures, increased UHI, and emission of green gases. Those issues can be partially mitigated by altering buildings’ surface properties. The first step to avoid these issues is to increase the amount of open spaces and permeable surfaces as much as possible.

TI  - Modelling landscape connectivity for greater horseshoe bat using an empirical quantification of resistance
PY  - 2018
AB  - International audience1.Habitat fragmentation and isolation as a result of human activities have been rec-ognized as great threats to population viability. Evaluating landscape connectivity in order to identify and protect linkages has therefore become a key challenge in applied ecology and conservation.2.One useful approach to evaluate connectivity is least- cost path (LCP) analysis. However, several studies have highlighted importance of parameterization with empirical, biologically relevant proxies of factors affecting movements as well as the need to validate the LCP model with an independent dataset.3.We used LCP analysis incorporating quantitative, empirical data about behaviour of the greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum to build up a model of functional connectivity in relation to landscape connecting features. We then vali-dated the accumulated costs surface from the LCP model with two independent datasets; one at an individual level with radiotracking data and one at a population level with acoustic data.4.When defining resistance, we found that the probability of bat presence in a hedgerow is higher when the distance between hedgerows is below 38 m, and decrease rapidly when gaps are larger than 50 m. The LCP model was validated by both datasets: the independent acoustic data showed that the probability of bat presence was significantly higher in areas with lower accumulated costs, and the radiotracking data showed that foraging was more likely in areas where accumu-lated costs were significantly lower.5.Synthesis and applications. Through our modelling approach, we recommend a maximum of 38 m (and no more than 50 m) between connecting features around colonies of greater horseshoe bats. Our quantitative study highlights the value of this framework for conservation: results are directly applicable in the field and the framework can be applied to other species sensitive to habitat loss, including other bats. Provided that it is parameterized with empirical, biologically relevant data, this modelling approach can be used for restoring and evaluating green net-works in agri- environmental schemes and management plans

TI  - Analysis on the Evolution and Resilience of Ecological Network Structure in Wuhan Metropolitan Area
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>With the accelerated urbanization and frequent occurrence of climate extremes, the regional ecosystem service level has ushered in a great challenge, and the resilience of the ecological network has gradually weakened, leading to lower ecological benefits and production levels. As a core ecologically sensitive area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan metropolitan area has been expanding outward with rapid urbanization, crowding out surrounding arable and ecological land, and facing serious challenges to the sustainable development of the national space, while current cross-regional ecological protection measures need to be strengthened urgently, and exploring the structural resilience of its ecological network is of great significance to promote regional stability. In this study, Wuhan metropolitan area is taken as an example, and we explore the evolution and laws of ecological network structure from the perspective of network analysis by constructing ecological networks in Wuhan metropolitan area in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Firstly, we select regions from the ecological control line developed in China as ecological source sites, and also select multivariate data to supplement them. Then, the ecological network was established using the MCR model. Finally, network analysis was applied to discuss the evolution of network structure under multiple times and propose corresponding conservation strategies. The results show that (1) the major ecological resistance of Wuhan urban area has increased by 5.24% in 20 years. (2) The centrality and connectivity of the network nodes have increased over the 20-year period, and the overall structure of the network has stabilized and the resilience of the network has increased. (3) There is a strong link between changes in the network as a whole and local resilience. The results of the study will help analyze the relationship between the network as a whole and the region, and provide reference for optimizing the ecological network and constructing the systematic management of ecological security pattern.</jats:p>

TI  - Genetic structure in the wood mouse and the bank vole: contrasting patterns in a human-modified and highly fragmented landscape
PY  - 2018
AB  - Habitat fragmentation related to human activities modifies the distribution and the demographic trajectory of a species, often leading to genetic erosion and increased extinction risks. Understanding the impact of fragmentation on different species that co-exist in the same area becomes extremely important. Here we estimated the impact produced by different natural and anthropic landscape features on gene flow patterns in two sympatric species sampled in the same locations. Our main goal was to identify shared and private factors in the comparison among species. 199 bank voles and 194 wood mice were collected in 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape, and genotyped at 8 and 7 microsatellites, respectively. Genetic variation and structure were analysed with standard approaches. Effective migration surfaces, isolation by resistance analysis, and regression with randomization were used to study isolation by distance and to estimate the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. Genetic structure was similarly affected by isolation by distance in these species, but the isolation-by-resistance analysis suggests that i) the wood mouse has constrained patterns of dispersal across woodland patches and facilitated connectivity in cultivated areas; ii) the bank vole connectivity is hindered by urban areas, while permeability is facilitated by the presence of woodlands, and cultivated terrains. Habitat loss and fragmentation can therefore influence genetic structure of small sympatric mammal species in different ways, and predicting the genetic consequences of these events using only one species may be misleading.

TI  - A methodology to assess habitat fragmentation effects through regional indexes: Illustration with forest biodiversity hotspots
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The fragmentation of natural environments is a critical issue involving major challenges for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Large-scale information on areas sensitive to fragmentation is needed to improve the effectiveness of planning efforts. One promising metric combining the landscape spatial configuration with species characteristics is the metapopulation capacity λ, which can be used to rank different fragmented landscapes in terms of their capacity to support viable metapopulations. A methodology to globally derive a fragmentation metric based on metapopulation capacity, at appropriate and meaningful spatial scales for fragmentation mechanisms, was developed. To illustrate the applicability and interest of the methodology, worldwide regionalised fragmentation indexes, calculated with a dispersal distance of 1 km valid for a broad range of species, were provided for all forest ecoregions included in the biodiversity hotspots. Ecoregions were divided by a virtual grid and a statistical analysis of metapopulation capacity values calculated at the grid square scale was performed to obtain a Forest Fragmentation Potential FFP at three levels of spatial aggregation within the ecoregion (highly converted forest, entire forest, and the whole ecoregion). The results highlighted significant intra- and inter-ecoregions differences, showing great potential to extend the use of these indexes to land use planning and areas prioritisation for both ecological protection and restoration. The influence of the different parameters used in the proposed approach is discussed as well as the limitations of the main assumptions. One important result is that the derived methodology can be easily adapted to a large number of species, scales, or regions to improve the coverage of fragmentation indexes.

TI  - Landscape connectivity and spatial prioritization in an urbanising world: A network analysis approach for a threatened amphibian
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects amphibian populations worldwide. Urban expansion and associated infrastructure are a main cause of habitat degradation and loss of landscape-scale habitat connectivity. Mitigation measures such as underpasses and associated fences are implemented to reduce the impacts of development on protected species. However, such efforts focus largely on local outcomes rather than envisioning how mitigation may contribute to habitat connectivity and population persistence at the landscape scale. We used a graph-theoretic approach to model structural and functional connectivity for a widespread but declining pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). This involved assessing species movement among breeding ponds and associated landscapes with different levels of urban and rural development and linear barriers. We used recent regional pond survey data for great crested newts combined with published data on movement and habitat use to explore connectivity. Landscape connectivity was affected by factors such as habitat quality and quantity, scale of movement and different degrees of road permeability. Linear barriers to movement and differences in their permeability were critical for predicting their impact on both migratory and dispersal movements in Triturus cristatus. Incorporating landscape connectivity modelling which includes the impact of barriers such as roads would substantially improve population-level outcomes from mitigation schemes. An accurate understanding of the far-reaching consequences of road mitigation as well as immediate, local effects, combined with our methods of assessing road permeability could transform future mitigation efforts by directing action to places that not only improve individual survival but also maximise connectivity at the landscape-scale.

TI  - Identifying critical habitat for threatened species: concepts and challenges
PY  - NA
AB  - Critical habitat is defined scientifically as the subset of habitat necessary for the long-termpersistence of a given species. Based on this definition, loss of any part of the critical habitat wouldresult in extinction of the species. In the United States, Australia, and Canada, critical habitat ofthreatened species is protected, to various degrees, under endangered species legislation. Effectiveprotection of critical habitat depends on it being identified accurately. Where there is potential forconflict with landowners and industry stakeholders, accurate critical habitat identifications are moredefensible in court, and minimise the opportunity costs of protecting areas that may not be asbeneficial to species persistence. However, obtaining the data required to accurately identify criticalhabitat can take up considerable time and resources that may otherwise be spent on conservationactions. At the same time, delaying protection of critical habitat to improve knowledge can result infurther habitat loss. In this thesis, I review key concepts and challenges surrounding theidentification of critical habitat, and develop decision tools to assist in deciding when and how toidentify it.In Chapter 2, I present a systematic review of critical habitat documentation from the United States,Canada, and Australia to identify the types of data and criteria that have been used to identifycritical habitat in the last decade. Contrary to scientific recommendations that long-term speciespersistence should be used as the criterion for identifying critical habitat, information about thelocation of species occurrences and particular habitat features were used instead to identify criticalhabitats for most of the species reviewed. Insufficient data and the desire to avoid potentialopposition from landowners are likely to be the main reasons for the use of such approaches tocritical habitat identification. Chapter 3 continues with an examination of the merits of the differentcriteria that could be used to inform critical habitat identification, and the types of errors associatedwith each. I also considered the potential consequences of the errors, and recommended that moreexplicit recognition of the potential for errors is important in minimising their negativeconsequences for species persistence.While the accuracy of critical habitat identification may be improved by collecting more data,delaying protection to do so may result in additional habitat loss if habitats are left unprotected inthe meantime. In Chapter 4, I used an optimisation approach to examine this trade-off between thebenefits of delaying protection to improve accuracy and the costs of additional habitat loss in theinterim. I modelled the change in the proportion of habitat correctly identified over time as afunction of both accuracy and habitat loss, and determined the optimal amount of time to spend learning that maximises this value. I found that at low rates of habitat loss, slow learning ratesresulted in a longer optimal learning period. At high rates of habitat loss, however, the improvementin accuracy no longer compensates for the loss of habitat, and the optimal amount of time to spendlearning becomes less than three years, regardless of the learning rate.Given the need for prompt critical habitat protection to avoid additional habitat loss, how should weidentify critical habitat to maximise accuracy while minimising the amount of time and resourcesspent in the process? I addressed this question in Chapter 5 by describing how a structured decisionmakingframework can be applied to help decide which types of data and approaches should beused to identify critical habitat, based on the conservation objectives, movement and habitat usepatterns, and the amount of habitat currently available for the species. Using a structured decisionframework to guide critical habitat identification can also help improve the consistency andtransparency of identification, as well as increase confidence in the validity of critical habitatidentification.This thesis aimed to recommend improvements to the identification of critical habitat by reviewingcurrent practices and potential errors in critical habitat identification, examining the potentialconsequences of these errors for conservation, and developing decision tools to assist in decidingwhen and how critical habitat should be identified. However, it is important to note that adequateenforcement of critical habitat protection also plays a crucial role in ensuring long-term speciespersistence. Further studies to examine how critical habitat protections are implemented andenforced will help to evaluate the overall impact of critical habitat identification on the recovery ofthreatened species, and provide insight into how critical habitats can be protected more effectively.

TI  - Large-scale effects of forest management in Mediterranean landscapes of Europe
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract: Forest landscapes are fundamental components of the living environment and consist of complex assemblages of forest and non-forest elements whose arrangement reflects, in part, the magnitude, intensity, and type of management. Because forests change across regions and scales, a variety of approaches have been proposed to support research and applicable goals. The most promising way to analyze forest landscapes is through the application of the landscape ecological approach, which is the study of ecological patterns and processes in heterogeneous, mostly human-modified, landscapes. In this paper, we analyze the role of landscape ecology in the context of forest landscapes. We discuss the main factors related to forest management which may affect landscape composition and configuration by referencing examples from the Mediterranean landscapes of Europe. Finally, we discuss the key issues for incorporating landscape ecological principles into forest planning and management and provide directions for future research in the emerging context of ecosystem services.

TI  - Comprehensive Value Discovery of Land Consolidation Projects: An Empirical Analysis of Shanghai, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - The purpose of land consolidation is to promote moderately sized agricultural operations, intensive land use, concentrated population living and agglomerated industrial development. Previous research has primarily been macro- or mesoscale studies based on land ledger data, and analyzed only the effect of land consolidation on landscape ecological changes, only the resource and economic effects, or social effects or environmental effects of land consolidation. Aimed at addressing these shortcomings, an empirical analysis on the micro-scale based on land use patch data rather than land ledger data was conducted. Then, comprehensive research on land consolidation projects by integrating landscape pattern analysis with production, living, and ecological benefit assessments was performed. Furthermore, the relationship between land consolidation projects and the “Three Concentrations” policy was considered. The results show that: (1) land consolidation has directly or indirectly improved landscape ecological patterns of the project area; and (2) land consolidation has clearly improved the balanced distribution of cultivated land and the concentrated distribution of construction land in the project area. These changes not only improve the living conditions of farmers but also meet the construction requirements of the “Three Concentrations” in the Shanghai metropolitan suburbs.

TI  - Graph-theoretic connectivity measures: what do they tell us about connectivity?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Graph-theoretic connectivity analyses have received much attention in connectivity evaluation during the last few years. Here, we explore the underlying conceptual differences of various graph-theoretic connectivity measures. Based on connectivity analyses from three reserve networks in forested landscapes in Central Finland, we illustrate how these conceptual differences cause inconsistent connectivity evaluations at both the landscape and patch level. Our results also illustrate how the characteristics of the networks (patch density) may affect the performance of the different measures. Many of the connectivity measures react to changes in habitat connectivity in an ecologically undesirable manner. Patch prioritisations based on a node removal analysis were sensitive to the connectivity measure they were based on. The patch prioritisations derived from different measures showed a disparity in terms of how much weight they put on patch size versus patch location and how they value patch location. Although graphs operate at the interface of structure and function, there is still much to do for incorporating the inferred ecological process into graph structures and analyses. If graph analyses are going to be used for real-world management and conservation purposes, a more thorough understanding of the caveats and justifications of the graph-theoretic connectivity measures will be needed.

TI  - The Species and Genetic Diversities of Insects in Japan, with Special Reference to the Aquatic Insects
PY  - 2016
AB  - Japan is often referred to as a global hotspot of biodiversity. With regard to species diversity, insects are no exception. To date, more than 30,000 insect species have been identified in Japan, and yet about 100,000 species of insects are considered to inhabit this country. In this chapter, we outline background factors contributing to the degree of diversification in the Japanese insect fauna. Of course, the high degree of Japan’s insect diversity is perpetuated as a result of many complex factors. Among these factors, the humid Asian monsoon climate and the geography that stretches out from north to south are important. Furthermore, the relevance of the extremely complex geological history is believed to be especially important. In particular, the independent origin of northeastern and southwestern Japan from the Eurasian Continent must have also contributed greatly to the establishment of biodiversity. In view of these circumstances, we introduce several case studies focusing on aquatic insects with low dispersal ability. In addition, we investigate the phenomenon of genetic differentiation and species differentiation deeply associated with the geohistory of Japan. These selected species offer high potential to effectively investigate various evolutionary issues: that is, they are one of the typical ‘key taxa’ in terms of phylogeography and evolutionary biology.

TI  - Connectivity and invasive species management: Towards an integrated landscape approach
PY  - 2013
AB  - Invasive plants and animals are a major cause of global biodiversity loss. Invasive Species Management (ISM) helps conserve localized populations and ecosystems, but rarely have its potential benefits been explored at the landscape scale. We explore how ISM can enhance landscape connectivity, and how its incorporation into conservation planning algorithms could help design optimal reserve networks. Conversely, conservation planning and connectivity modelling can optimize targeting of ISM, achieving benefits for a wider range of taxa and ecological processes, without the need for additional resources. Empirical research must investigate the spatial pattern of benefits from ISM, and when to target priority conservation sites or the areas (matrix) between them. By bolstering populations within—and increasing connectivity between—focal patches, ISM should move beyond conserving individual sites to creating functionally connected networks of conservation areas.

TI  - Integrating functional connectivity and fire management for better conservation outcomes.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Globally, the mean abundance of terrestrial animals has fallen by 50% since 1970, and populations face ongoing threats associated with habitat loss, fragmentation, climate change, and disturbance. Climate change can influence the quality of remaining habitat directly and indirectly by precipitating increases in the extent, frequency, and severity of natural disturbances, such as fire. Species face the combined threats of habitat clearance, changing climates, and altered disturbance regimes, each of which may interact and have cascading impacts on animal populations. Typically, conservation agencies are limited in their capacity to mitigate rates of habitat clearance, habitat fragmentation, or climate change, yet fire management is increasingly used worldwide to reduce wildfire risk and achieve conservation outcomes. A popular approach to ecological fire management involves the creation of fire mosaics to promote animal diversity. However, this strategy has 2 fundamental limitations: the effect of fire on animal movement within or among habitat patches is not considered and the implications of the current fire regime for long-term population persistence are overlooked. Spatial and temporal patterns in fire history can influence animal movement, which is essential to the survival of individual animals, maintenance of genetic diversity, and persistence of populations, species, and ecosystems. We argue that there is rich potential for fire managers to manipulate animal movement patterns; enhance functional connectivity, gene flow, and genetic diversity; and increase the capacity of populations to persist under shifting environmental conditions. Recent methodological advances, such as spatiotemporal connectivity modeling, spatially explicit individual-based simulation, and fire-regime modeling can be integrated to achieve better outcomes for biodiversity in human-modified, fire-prone landscapes. Article impact statement: Land managers may conserve populations by using fire to sustain or enhance functional connectivity.

TI  - Banff Wildlife Crossings Project: Integrating Science and Education in Restoring Population Connectivity Across Transportation Corridors
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Banff Wildlife Crossings Project's (BWCP’s) monitoring and wildlife research, coupled with outreach and education, aims to properly inform the transportation community and wildlife managers of the environmental and societal benefits of Banff’s highway infrastructure investments. In addition, the Project seeks to share its findings on wildlife crossing design elements, requirements and their effectiveness. The BWCP goal is to increase transportation and wildlife agency understanding and community awareness so that other busy roads in the mountain parks and other locales in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the United States benefit from the findings of the BWCP. This will allow other communities to develop sustainable transportation practices that provide ecological connectivity for wildlife across their transportation corridors as well as maintain motorist safety.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of road network and road development priority in three parallel rivers region in Yunnan, China: An evaluation based on modified kernel distance estimate
PY  - 2014
AB  - Road network is a critical component of public infrastructure, and the supporting system of social and economic development. Based on a modified kernel density estimate (KDE) algorithm, this study evaluated the road service capacity provided by a road network composed of multi-level roads (i.e. national, provincial, county and rural roads), by taking account of the differences of effect extent and intensity for roads of different levels. Summarized at town scale, the population burden and the annual rural economic income of unit road service capacity were used as the surrogates of social and economic demands for road service. This method was applied to the road network of the Three Parallel River Region, the northwestern Yunnan Province, China to evaluate the development of road network in this region. In results, the total road length of this region in 2005 was 3.70 × 104 km, and the length ratio between national, provincial, county and rural roads was 1:2:8:47. From 1989 to 2005, the regional road service capacity increased by 13.1%, of which the contributions from the national, provincial, county and rural roads were 11.1%, 19.4%, 22.6%, and 67.8%, respectively, revealing the effect of ‘All Village Accessible’ policy of road development in the mountainous regions in the last decade. The spatial patterns of population burden and economic requirement of unit road service suggested that the areas farther away from the national and provincial roads have higher road development priority (RDP). Based on the modified KDE model and the framework of RDP evaluation, this study provided a useful approach for developing an optimal plan of road development at regional scale.

TI  - Trends in Wildlife Connectivity Science from the Biodiverse and Human-Dominated South Asia
PY  - 2021
AB  - The threat of habitat fragmentation and population isolation looms large over much of biodiversity in this human-dominated epoch. Species-rich South Asia is made particularly vulnerable by its high human density and anthropogenic habitat modification. Therefore, reliably estimating wildlife connectivity and the factors underpinning it become crucial in mitigating extinction risk due to isolation. We analysed peer-reviewed literature on connectivity and corridors for terrestrial mammals in South Asia to identify trends in connectivity research. We identify key research gaps and highlight future directions that may aid efforts to robustly study connectivity. We found a significant bias towards charismatic megafauna and their habitats. Methodologically, although we observed a range of approaches reflecting some of the advances and innovations in the field, several studies lacked data on animal movement/behaviour, leading to potentially biased inferences of how species disperse through human-modified landscapes. New avenues for connectivity research, though currently under-explored in South Asia, offer alternatives to the heavily used but less-reliable habitat suitability models. We highlight the advantages of landscape genetic methods that reflect effective dispersal and are made feasible through non-invasive and increasingly more cost-effective sampling methods. We also identify important gaps or areas of focus that need to be addressed going forward, including accounting for animal movement/behaviour, human impacts and landscape change for dynamic and adaptive connectivity planning for the future.

TI  - Towards landscape ecological modelling of marine reserves
PY  - 2010
AB  - The dispersal of propagules is a critical process for most terrestrial and marine systems. For example, it has been shown that larval dispersal enables to connect fish populations in networks of marine reserves. However, most current marine reserves models include an over- simplified representation of dispersal. The major limitation to using more sophisticated approaches has traditionally been the uncertainty surrounding larval dispersal patterns. We report recent improvements in methods and tools for modelling and measuring larval dispersal and show how they will allow integrating modelling of marine reserves into the wider field of landscape modelling.

TI  - Landscape patterns and diversity of meadow plants and flower-visitors in a mountain landscape
PY  - 2018
AB  - Wild flowering plants and their wild insect visitors are of great importance for pollination. Montane meadows are biodiversity hotspots for flowering plants and pollinators, but they are contracting due to tree invasion. This study quantified flowering plants and their flower-visitor species in montane meadows in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. Species diversity in small, isolated meadows was expected to be lower and nested relative to large meadows. Alternatively, landform features may influence richness and spatial turnover. Flowering plants and their visitors were sampled in summers of 2011–2017 in twelve montane meadows with varying soil moisture. All flowering plants and all flower-visitors were recorded during five to seven 15 min watches in ten 3 × 3 m plots in each meadow and year. A total of 178 flowering plant species, 688 flower-visitor species and 137,916 interactions were identified. Richness of flower-visitors was related to meadow patch size, but neither plant nor flower-visitor richness was related to isolation measured as meadow area within 1000 m. Species in small meadows were not nested subsets of those in large meadows. Species replacement accounted for more than 78% of dissimilarity between meadows and was positively related to differences in soil moisture. Although larger meadows contained more species, landform features have influenced meadow configuration, persistence, and soil moisture, contributing to high plant and insect species diversity. Hence, conservation and restoration of a variety of meadow types may promote landscape diversity of wild plants and pollinators.

TI  - Habitat quality of source patches and connectivity in fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Because spatial connectivity is critical to dispersal success and persistence of species in highly fragmented landscapes, the way that we envision and measure connectivity is consequential for biodiversity conservation. Connectivity metrics used for predictive modeling of spatial turnover and patch occupancy for metapopulations, such as with Incidence Function Models (IFM), incorporate distances to and sizes of possible source populations. Here, our focus is on whether habitat quality of source patches also is considered in these connectivity metrics. We propose that effective areas (weighted by habitat quality) of source patches should be better surrogates for population size and dispersal potential compared to unadjusted patch areas. Our review of a representative sample of the literature revealed that only 12.5% of studies incorporated habitat quality of source patches into IFM-type connectivity metrics. Quality of source patches generally was not taken into account in studies even if habitat quality of focal patches was included in analyses. We provide an empirical example for a metapopulation of a rare wetland species, the round-tailed muskrat (Neofiber alleni), demonstrating that a connectivity metric based on effective areas of source patches better predicts patch colonization and occupancy than a metric that used simple patch areas. The ongoing integration of landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics could be hastened by incorporating habitat quality of source patches into spatial connectivity metrics applied to species conservation in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Open-source Tools in R for Landscape Ecology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landscape ecology, the study of the complex interactions between landscapes and ecological processes, has hugely benefited from the increase in widely available open-source software in recent years. In particular, the R programming language provides a wealth of community developed tools for landscape ecology. In this paper, we examine existing packages for downloading, processing and visualisation of spatial data, as well as those specifically developed for spatial ecological analysis. Additionally, we outline the results of a survey of R users within the landscape ecology community. We found that landscape ecologists are generally satisfied with the functionality available within R, and that as a community they are continually further developing the functionality available. Suggested future developments include improvement of computation performance; additional methods for landscape characterisation such as surface metrics; and advanced, accessible visualisation tools.

TI  - A multiple scale, function, and type approach to determine and improve Green Infrastructure of urban watersheds
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Fragmentation and service provision by green infrastructures varies across spatial scales. • Landscape metrics of high resolution land cover enables green infrastructures characterization. • Multi-functionality guides prioritization of green infrastructure development. • Improvement potential depends on types of green infrastructures and spatial scale. Green Infrastructure (GI) connects different types of green features via various scales, thereby supporting urban biodiversity and service provision. This study presents a methodology capable of identifying multiple functions to assess GI in less-developed countries, where such methodologies are lacking. GI was assessed based on a high-resolution land use classification using both landscape metrics and spatial data within an urbanized region of San José, Costa Rica, at different scales (watershed, neighbourhood, object). Results showed highly fragmented green spaces (often <10 ha), typically unable to support high levels of biodiversity, along with a low amount of green space per inhabitant (<7.4 m²) within the watershed. Substantially higher tree cover (x6) and tree density (x5) were found in the greenest neighbourhood in comparison to the least green neighbourhood. Potential areas for new GI in the form of green roofs (4.03 ha), permeable pavement (27.3), and potential retention areas (85.3) were determined. Several green spaces (n = 11) were identified as promising GI sites with the potential to increase provision (18.6 m²/inhabitant). The adopted methodology demonstrates the potential of GI for increasing recreational green space access, runoff reduction, and flood retentions while supporting biodiversity, validating its utility in guiding decision-making and policy generation.

TI  - Disentangling community assemblages to depict an indicator of biological connectivity: A regional study of fragmented semi-natural grasslands
PY  - 2013
AB  - Under the current context of global change that largely threatens overall biodiversity in increasingly fragmented landscapes, more insights are needed into the drivers of biological connectivity between communities (i.e. the flow of species among a set of local communities responding to landscape structure). This study aims at estimating an indicator of regional biological connectivity of semi- natural grasslands from the expected correlation between the degree of community assemblage (i.e. composition similarity) and landscape features directly related to dispersal among local communities. Large-scale plant distributions characterizing semi- natural grassland communities were gathered from the atlas of Brittany flora (NW France; UTM grid of 10 km × 10 km). The analysed variables were computed considering the focal UTM square and its immediate neighbours, and the modelling encompassed different regression techniques accounting for spatial autocorrelation [Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) error models] and non-stationarity [Geographically Weighted Regressions (GWR)]. The degree of community assemblage allocated to biological connectivity was 10.4% (adjusted-R2); it was mainly correlated to decreasing hedgerow length and secondly to increasing structural connectivity of semi- natural grasslands once spatial autocorrelation was accounted for. The estimation of the indicator of biological connectivity (0.05 ± 0.01 from the SAR models) were improved when considering non-stationarity issues, particularly for the Eastern part of Brittany (up to 0.12 in terms of biological connectivity). Overall, the proposed indicator and estimation methodology represent a step ahead in connectivity analysis at the community level, potentially relevant in the detection of hotspots of biological connectivity which can help buffer current large-scale biodiversity threats due to global change.

TI  - Assessing habitat loss, fragmentation and ecological connectivity in Luxembourg to support spatial planning
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The increasing global population requires new infrastructure and urban development, and these land use changes have an impact on habitats and their ecological connectivity. To anticipate and minimise these impacts, environmental and urban planners require tools and methods that they can use at early planning stages. This paper investigates and selects landscape ecology techniques that can be used by planners to assess the effects in terms of changes in habitat loss, fragmentation and ecological connectivity due to expected land use changes. The selected techniques were tested in Luxembourg. Twelve landscape metrics, four connectivity indices, and one connectivity model were selected based on their straightforwardness, widespread application, and accessibility. Land cover maps and proposed areas of urban development up to 2030 were used as input data, together with adapted resistance surfaces from previous studies and a matrix of presence/absence for six target species. The combined analysis reveals a trend of increasing habitat fragmentation and loss of habitats, as well as a reduction of ecological connectivity with regard to all the targeted species, and suggests that this trend will likely continue in the near future. The selected landscape metrics, connectivity indices, the connectivity model and the software used to run them makes the abovementioned techniques easy to use by non-experts, and their combination helps to reduce some of the limitations of each individual technique. Both aspects might be useful in order to mainstream the use of landscape ecology techniques in spatial planning processes.

TI  - Quantifying apart what belongs together: A multi-state species distribution modelling framework for species using distinct habitats
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary 1.Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to inform scientists and conservationists about the status and change of occurrence patterns in threatened species. Many mobile species use multiple functionally distinct habitats, and cannot occupy one habitat type without the other being within a reachable distance. For such species, classical applications of SDMs might lead to erroneous representations of habitat suitability, as the complex relationships between predictors are lost when merging occurrence information across multiple habitats. To better account for the spatial arrangement of complementary—yet mandatory—habitat types, it is important to implement modeling strategies that partition occurrence information according to habitat use in a spatial context. Here, we address this issue by introducing a multi-state SDM framework. 2.The multi-state SDM framework stratifies occurrences according to the temporal or behavioral use of distinct habitat types, referred to as “states.” Multiple SDMs are then run for each state and statistical thresholds of presence are used to combine these separate predictions. To identify suitable sites that account for distance between habitats, two optional modules are proposed where the thresholded output is aggregated and filtered by minimum area size, or through moving windows across maximum reachable distances. 3.We illustrate the full use of this framework by modeling the dynamic terrestrial breeding habitat preferences of the New Zealand sea lion (NZSL; Phocarctos hookeri), using Maxent and trialing both modules to identify suitable sites for possible recolonization. 4.The Maxent predictions showed excellent performance, and the multi-state SDM framework highlighted 36 to 77 potential suitable breeding sites in the study area. 5.This framework can be applied to inform management when defining habitat suitability for species with complex changes in habitat use. It accounts for temporal and behavioral changes in distribution, maintains the individuality of each partitioned SDM, and considers distance between distinct habitat types. It also yields one final, easy-to-understand output for stakeholders and managers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing spatial contiguity in reserve network design
PY  - 2011
AB  - Landscape fragmentation is a well-recognized threat to the long-term survivability of many plant and animal species. As a complex concept, fragmentation has multiple spatial and functional components, of which spatial contiguity is of great importance. A contiguous landscape provides physical condition and increases the opportunities for species dispersal and migration. However, in real planning situations, contiguity is either too expensive to achieve or impractical because of barriers of urban landscapes. As such, the traditional yes/no function of contiguity has been extended into a notion of relative contiguity which has the value range between zero and one. Relative contiguity measures levels of interconnectivity of landscapes based on graph theory and spatial interaction. It takes into account both inner-reserve relationship (i.e. reserve sizes) and inter-reserve spatial proximity. This paper presents a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm approach to maximizing relative contiguity in reserve network design. This approach obtains solutions that maximize the measure of relative contiguity, minimize the total acquisition area, and satisfy constraints on the coverage of individual species. Application results show the developed algorithm has significant advantages in optimizing relative contiguity and generating a variety of alternative solutions.

TI  - Exploring the use of a fragmented landscape by a large arboreal marsupial using incidental sighting records from community members
PY  - 2016
AB  - Effective conservation of large mammalian species within a human-modified landscape depends on the knowledge of their ability to utilise available suitable habitat within a matrix of unsuitable habitat. We use incidental sightings of Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) in north-eastern Australia that were recorded by community members in a non-standardised way to assess the functional connectivity of the highly fragmented landscape of the Atherton Tablelands for this species. By applying spatial analytical tools to available mapped information on landscape attributes and the reported sightings it was found that the species shows a low matrix resistance. Since most sightings within the matrix were found within 150 m of a patch with suitable habitat and the average distance between these patches was 77 m it can be concluded that Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroos are able to reach most fragmented suitable habitat given certain limitations of the accuracy of the used maps and sighting locations. Based on distances between suitable habitat patches and their predominant size of up to 2 ha we expect that the species can include several fragments into its home range. More sightings of Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroos than expected by chance within the matrix during dry seasons combined with shorter than expected distances into the matrix suggests the existence of seasonal resource-driven movements of this species. Due to the non-standardised nature of the data the derived conclusions need to be tested in rigorous scientific projects before they can be integrated into the development of conservation strategies for Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroos on the Atherton Tablelands.

TI  - Dispersal ecology of deadwood organisms and connectivity conservation.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Limited knowledge of dispersal for most organisms hampers effective connectivity conservation in fragmented landscapes. In forest ecosystems, deadwood-dependent organisms (i.e., saproxylics) are negatively affected by forest management and degradation globally. We reviewed empirically established dispersal ecology of saproxylic insects and fungi. We focused on direct studies (e.g., mark-recapture, radiotelemetry), field experiments, and population genetic analyses. We found 2 somewhat opposite results. Based on direct methods and experiments, dispersal is limited to within a few kilometers, whereas genetic studies showed little genetic structure over tens of kilometers, which indicates long-distance dispersal. The extent of direct dispersal studies and field experiments was small and thus these studies could not have detected long-distance dispersal. Particularly for fungi, more studies at management-relevant scales (1-10 km) are needed. Genetic researchers used outdated markers, investigated few loci, and faced the inherent difficulties of inferring dispersal from genetic population structure. Although there were systematic and species-specific differences in dispersal ability (fungi are better dispersers than insects), it seems that for both groups colonization and establishment, not dispersal per se, are limiting their occurrence at management-relevant scales. Because most studies were on forest landscapes in Europe, particularly the boreal region, more data are needed from nonforested landscapes in which fragmentation effects are likely to be more pronounced. Given the potential for long-distance dispersal and the logical necessity of habitat area being a more fundamental landscape attribute than the spatial arrangement of habitat patches (i.e., connectivity sensu strict), retaining high-quality deadwood habitat is more important for saproxylic insects and fungi than explicit connectivity conservation in many cases.

TI  - Spatial scale affects landscape genetic analysis of a wetland grasshopper.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Most landscape genetic studies assess the impact of landscape elements on species' dispersal and gene flow. Many of these studies perform their analysis on all possible population pairs in a study area and do not explicitly consider the effects of spatial scale and population network topology on their results. Here, we examined the effects of spatial scale and population network topology on the outcome of a landscape genetic analysis. Additionally, we tested whether the relevant spatial scale of landscape genetic analysis could be defined by population network topology or by isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns. A data set of the wetland grasshopper Stethophyma grossum, collected in a fragmented agricultural landscape, was used to analyse population network topology, IBD patterns and dispersal habitats, using least-cost transect analysis. Landscape genetic analyses neglecting spatial scale and population network topology resulted in models with low fits, with which a most likely dispersal habitat could not be identified. In contrast, analyses considering spatial scale and population network topology resulted in high model fits by restricting landscape genetic analysis to smaller scales (0-3 km) and neighbouring populations, as represented by a Gabriel graph. These models also successfully identified a likely dispersal habitat of S. grossum. The above results suggest that spatial scale and potentially population network topology should be more explicitly considered in future landscape genetic analyses.

TI  - A bird’s eye view: using circuit theory to study urban landscape connectivity for birds
PY  - 2017
AB  - Connectivity is fundamental to understanding how landscape form influences ecological function. However, uncertainties persist due to the difficulty and expense of gathering empirical data to drive or to validate connectivity models, especially in urban areas, where relationships are multifaceted and the habitat matrix cannot be considered to be binary. This research used circuit theory to model urban bird flows (i.e. ‘current’), and compared results to observed abundance. The aims were to explore the ability of this approach to predict wildlife flows and to test relationships between modelled connectivity and variation in abundance. Circuitscape was used to model functional connectivity in Bedford, Luton/Dunstable, and Milton Keynes, UK, for great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), drawing parameters from published studies of woodland bird flows in urban environments. Model performance was then tested against observed abundance data. Modelled current showed a weak yet positive agreement with combined abundance for P. major and C. caeruleus. Weaker correlations were found for other woodland species, suggesting the approach may be expandable if re-parameterised. Trees provide suitable habitat for urban woodland bird species, but their location in large, contiguous patches and corridors along barriers also facilitates connectivity networks throughout the urban matrix. Urban connectivity studies are well-served by the advantages of circuit theory approaches, and benefit from the empirical study of wildlife flows in these landscapes to parameterise this type of modelling more explicitly. Such results can prove informative and beneficial in designing urban green space and new developments.

TI  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions in Spain
PY  - 2015
AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) are important in wildlife management due to their increasing socioeconomic impacts and pervasive effect on some endangered species. In this study, we depict the involved species and evaluate the geographic distribution and economic cost of this human-animal interaction in Spain. We used unpublished information on 74,600 WVC reported by police statements from 2006 to 2012. These collisions accounted for 8.9 % of all reported road traffic accidents in the country. They were unevenly distributed, with WVC accounting for 30–50 % of all road traffic accidents in some mountainous provinces in the north. Results show that wild boar (Sus scrofa) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), two abundant free-ranging ungulates (O. Artiodactyla) whose populations have expanded throughout Spain during the last few decades, were involved in 79 % of WVC. These species were responsible for most economic losses and, in the case of the wild boar, for most human injuries. The number of vehicle collisions involving large carnivores (O. Carnivora) was small, with the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) present in most cases (70 %). They included some endangered species (brown bear, Ursus arctos, and Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus). The results provide a reliable picture of WVC in Spain and provide the first assessment of the economic cost of this wildlife-human interaction (105 million € yearly).

TI  - The responses of British butterflies to four decades of climate change
PY  - 2014
AB  - Species are responding to climate change by shifting their distributions polewards and/or uphill. However, the rates at which distributions are changing vary greatly among species. An understanding of how species’ distributions are changing, and what drives the rate of distribution change, is necessary in order to identify which conservation strategies have the potential to facilitate range shifts and to prevent population and species losses. I studied the responses of southerly-distributed butterflies in Britain to four decades of climate change. I found that not only did the rates of species’ distribution area, northern range margin and abundance changes vary amongst species, but that rates of change also varied within species over time. Some of the variation in distribution change was explained by species’ abundance trends; species required stable or increasing abundances in order to expand their distribution areas. Once species were expanding their range, however, the rate of expansion was affected by the amount of suitable habitat available in the landscape. The application of a simulation model, SPEED, to project species’ distribution change supported these conclusions; all species modelled were capable of distribution expansion given sufficiently high population growth rate. Moreover, increased habitat availability allowed greater rates of distribution expansion. The observed trend towards more negative abundance changes in recent years suggests that habitat quality has deteriorated. Results from this thesis showing that stable or increasing abundance trends are a prerequisite for distribution expansion imply that conservation strategies should focus on improving species’ abundance trends through increasing habitat quality. Results also support the notion that conservation efforts aiming to protect and restore as much natural habitat as possible, in order to facilitate species’ distribution expansion under climate change, are likely to be effective.

TI  - Climate change impacts on connectivity in the ocean: Implications for conservation
PY  - 2014
AB  - Effective spatial management in the ocean requires a network of conservation areas that are connected by larval and adult dispersal. We propose a conceptual framework for including the likely impacts of a changing climate on marine connectivity, and synthesize information on the relationships between changing ocean temperature and acidification, connectivity and conservation tools. Our framework relies on concepts of functional connectivity, which depends on an organism's biological and behavioral responses to the physical environment, and structural connectivity, which describes changes in the physical and spatial structure of the environment that affect connectivity and movement. Our review confirms that ocean climate change likely reduces potential dispersal distance and therefore functional connectivity. Structural connectivity in the ocean will inevitably change with the spatial arrangement of biogenic habitats resulting from disturbance as well as enhanced growth and mortality due to climate change. Climate change will also likely reduce the spatial scale of connectivity, suggesting that we will need more closely spaced protected areas.

TI  - The genetic structure and connectivity in two sympatric rodent species with different life histories are similarly affected by land use disturbances
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The negative impact of habitat fragmentation due to human activities may be different in different species that co-exist in the same area, with consequences on the development of environmental protection plans. Here we aim at understanding the effects produced by different natural and anthropic landscape features on gene flow patterns in two sympatric species with different specializations, one generalist and one specialist, sampled in the same locations. We collected and genotyped 194 wood mice (generalist species) and 199 bank voles (specialist species) from 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape characterized by different potential barriers to dispersal. Genetic variation and structure were analyzed in the two species, respectively. Effective migration surfaces, isolation-by-resistance (IBR) analysis, and regression with randomization were used to investigate isolation-by-distance (IBD) and the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. We observed similar patterns of heterozygosity and IBD for both species, but the bank vole showed higher genetic differences among geographic areas. The IBR analysis suggests that (i) connectivity is reduced in both species by urban areas but more strongly in the specialist bank vole; (ii) cultivated areas act as dispersal corridors in both species; (iii) woodlands appear to be an important factor in increasing connectivity in the bank vole, and less so in the wood mouse. The difference in dispersal abilities between a generalist and specialist species was reflected in the difference in genetic structure, despite extensive habitat changes due to human activities. The negative effects of fragmentation due to the process of urbanization were, at least partially, mitigated by another human product, i.e., cultivated terrains subdivided by hedgerows, and this was true for both species.</jats:p>

TI  - Lake connectivity and fish species richness in southern Brazilian coastal lakes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Connectivity is a key factor in metacom- munity ecology, because it influences dispersal and colonization rates. However, it has received less attention in aquatic than in terrestrial ecology research. We investigated whether connectivity is a good predictor of species richness in functional fish communities (freshwater, FS; estuarine, ES and estu- arine-freshwater, EFS) from 31 coastal lakes in southern Brazil. We used a model selection approach, including lake area and distance from the ocean as additional predictors of species richness and two connectivity metrics: primary connectivity (CP) and estuarine connectivity (CE), which measure connec- tivity to neighboring lakes and system-wide connec- tivity, respectively. Both metrics estimate functional connectivity and were calculated on habitat-based cost distances. Connectivity was more important for pre- dicting richness of functional communities than for total richness, particularly CE, which was distinctively related to each functional fish community richness (directly related to ES and EFS, and inversely related to FS; CP was related only to ES). Remarkably, connectivity was more important than area for predicting ES and EFS richness. These results add support to dispersal limitation as an important mech- anism influencing fish communities. We suggest that incorporating environmental filters (habitat type) to quantify connectivity is useful for accessing the patterns of species richness.

TI  - Go with the flow: geospatial analytics to quantify hydrologic landscape connectivity for passively dispersed microorganisms
PY  - 2013
AB  - Understanding the diverse ways that landscape connectivity influences the distribution of microbial species is central to managing the spread and persistence of numerous biological invasions. Here, we use geospatial analytics to examine the degree to which the hydrologic connectivity of landscapes influences the transport of passively dispersed microbes, using the invasive plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum as a case study. Pathogen occurrence was analyzed at 280 stream baiting stations across a range of watersheds – exposed to variable inoculum pressure – in California over a 7-year period (2004–2010). Using logistic regression, we modeled the probability of pathogen occurrence at a baiting station based on nine environmental variables. We developed a novel geospatial approach to quantify the hydrologic connectivity of host vegetation and inoculum pressure derived from least cost distance analyses in each watershed. We also examined the influence of local environmental conditions within the immediate ne...

TI  - Supplementary materials for: a proposal for an integrated modelling framework to characterise habitat pattern
PY  - 2014
AB  - In Estreguil et al. (Environ Modell Softw 52, 176-191, 2014), an integrated modelling framework is proposed to characterise habitat pattern. The modelling approach is there exemplified by deriving a set of twelve indices aggregated into four categories: general landscape composition, habitat morphology, edge interface and connectivity. The easy and reproducible computability is ensured with the integrated use of publicly available software (GUIDOS free-download software, Conefor free software) and of newly programmed tools. A statistical analysis is then conducted using classical linear correlation and nonlinear Brownian Distance Correlation (Mastrave free software modelling library) as an alternative to traditional dimensionality-reduction techniques and with an effort towards reusability in other contexts and reproducible research, by means of concise semantic array programming codelets. Here, a reasoned set of materials and methods is presented to complement that proposal. Supplementary tables and figures are provided as well as the dataset of indices used in the analyses, the detailed mathematical formulation of landscape indices and concise semantic array programming codelets to reproduce the statistical computations. This extended version of the supplementary materials of Estreguil et al. (2014) provides a more articulated presentation of the original content with an enriched bibliographic apparatus. Highlights • Habitat pattern characterisation as methodological guidance for fragmentation assessments (applied in Europe). • Reproducible integration of three landscape models with GIS and semantic array programming. • Four families indices: landscape composition, edge interface, habitat morphology and connectivity. • New indices: edge interface context of morphological shapes; Power Weighted Probability of Dispersal family for connectivity. • Non-linear statistical correlation analysis based on Brownian Distance Correlation.

TI  - Improving Models of Species Ecological Niches: A Remote Sensing Overview
PY  - 2019
AB  - Effective conservation capable of mitigating global biodiversity declines require thorough knowledge on species distributions and their drivers. A species ecological niche determines its geographic distribution, and species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict them. For various reasons, e.g., the lack of spatial data on relevant environmental factors, SDMs fail to characterize important ecological relationships. We argue that SDMs do not yet include relevant environmental information, which can be measured with remote sensing (RS). RS may benefit SDMs because it provides information on e.g., ecosystem function, health and structure, complete spatial assessment, and reasonable temporal repeat for the processes that determine geographical distributions. However, RS data is still seldom included in such studies with the exception of climate data. Here we provide a guide for researchers aiming to improve their SDM studies, describing how they might include RS data in their specific study. We propose how to improve models of species ecological niches, by including measures of habitat quality (e.g., productivity), nutritional values, and seasonal or life-cycle events. To date, several studies have shown that using ecologically-relevant environmental predictors derived from RS improve model performance and transferability, and better approximate a species ecological niche. These data, however, are not a panacea for SDMs, as there are cases in which RS predictors are not appropriate, too costly, or exhibit low predictive power. The integration of multiple environmental predictors derived from RS in SDMs can thus improve our knowledge on processes driving biodiversity change and improve our capacity for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Small mammal community composition varies among Ozark glades
PY  - 2019
AB  - Island biogeography theory (IBT) explains and estimates large-scale ecological patterns among islands and isolated habitat patches. Specifically, IBT predicts that the number of species per habitat patch differs as a function of area and isolation as a result of local colonization and extinction. Accurate estimates of species richness are essential for testing predictions of IBT, but differences in detectability of species can lead to bias in empirical data. Hierarchical community models correct for imperfect detection by leveraging information from across the community to estimate species-specific occupancy and detection probabilities. Using the fragmented Ozark glades as our model system, we constructed a hierarchical community model to 1) estimate site-level and regional species richness of small mammals while correcting for detection error, and 2) determine environmental covariates driving occupancy. We sampled 16 glades in southwestern Missouri in summer 2016–2017 and quantified mammal community structure within the glade network. The detected species pool included eight species, and the model yielded a regional species estimate of 8.6 species, with a mean of 3.47 species per glade. Species richness increased with patch area but not isolation, and effects of patch shape varied between species in the community.

TI  - Connectivity and runoff dynamics in heterogeneous basins
PY  - 2011
AB  - A drainage basin's runoff response can be determined by the connectivity of generated runoff to the stream network and the connectivity of the downstream drainage network. The connectivity of a drainage basin modulates its ability to produce streamflow and respond to precipitation events and is a function of the complex and variable storage capacities throughout the drainage basin and along the drainage network. An improved means to measure and account for the dynamics of stream network connectivity at the catchment scale is needed to predict basin scale streamflow. At a 150 km2 subarctic Precambrian Shield catchment where the poorly drained heterogeneous mosaic of lakes, exposed bedrock, and soil filled areas creates variable contributing areas, hydrological connectivity was measured in 11 sub-basins with a particular focus on three representative sub-basins. The three sub-basins, although of similar relative size, vary considerably in the dominant typology and topology of their constituent elements. At a 10-m spatial resolution, saturated areas were mapped using both multispectral satellite imagery and onsite measurements of storage according to land cover. To measure basin-scale hydrological connectivity, the drainage network was represented using graph theory where stream reaches are ‘edges’ connecting sub-basin ‘nodes’. The overall hydrological connectivity of the stream network was described as the ratio of actively flowing relative to potentially flowing stream reaches. The hydrological connectivity of the stream network to the outlet was described as the ratio of actively flowing stream reaches that were connected to the outlet to the potentially flowing stream reaches. Hydrological connectivity was then related to daily average streamflow and basin runoff ratio. Improved understanding of causal factors for the variable streamflow response to runoff generation in this environment will serve as a first step towards improved streamflow prediction in formerly glaciated landscapes, especially in small ungauged basins.

TI  - Remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring: a review of methods for biodiversity indicator extraction and assessment of progress towards international targets
PY  - 2015
AB  - Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.

TI  - A framework for modeling habitat quality in disturbance-prone areas demonstrated with woodland caribou and wildfire
PY  - 2017
AB  - Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition, connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods, areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions. The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes. It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.

TI  - Modeling Ecoregional Connectivity
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nature reserves increasingly function as islands in a human-dominated matrix. Habitat conservation initiatives that seek to reconnect patches using functional corridors are increasingly part and ­parcel of conservation planning projects. Numerous methods have evolved all based on similar of least cost paths, functional rather than structural connectivity, and landscape resistance. However significant differences in approach exist including whether a network of patches is considered simultaneously or as patch–patch pairs, and whether the goal is to model spatially explicit corridors or movement bottlenecks. We review these approaches and then describe ecological connectivity modeling for an ecoregion using the graph-theoretic approach considering two different patch-node scenarios, at the ecoregion scale and apply a more localized connectivity modeling exercise for a subregion and a single focal species the American Black bear (Ursus americanus). We discuss the difficulties of attempting to model functional corridors for focal species over heterogenous landscapes, and the potential benefits of using ‘naturalness’ or Human Footprint surrogates for connectivity.

TI  - Metapopulation processes affecting diversity and distribution of myrmecophiles associated with red wood ants
PY  - 2015
AB  - Red wood ants support a diverse community of myrmecophiles in their nest mounds. Given that nest mounds provide fairly constant and distinct habitat patches for myrmecophiles, metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics can be expected to play an important role in structuring myrmecophile communities. Here, we investigate how site, site size (i.e. number of mounds per site), mound isolation, mound size, moisture, pH and red wood ant host (Formica rufa and Formica polyctena) affect the (meta)community composition and species richness. We demonstrate that community composition is structured by site and within-site isolation. In addition, species richness per unit volume is negatively correlated with increasing nest mound isolation. Mound size and site size at a higher spatial scale had no effect on community composition or diversity. The latter suggests that few mounds are required to support the minimum viable metapopulation size. We did not find support that the environmental variables mound moisture and pH affect the myrmecophile community or its species richness. Finally, the communities of the two closely related wood ant species F. rufa and F. polyctena were very similar. Overall, our results demonstrate, in accordance with metapopulation theory, that isolated mounds support fewer myrmecophile species. Diverse myrmecophile metacommunities also occur in small red wood ant sites, with well connected nest mounds. We discuss the powerful potential of ant nests, and particularly red wood ant mounds, for metapopulation and metacommunity research.

TI  - Piloting a Non-Invasive Genetic Sampling Method for Evaluating Population-Level Benefits of Wildlife Crossing Structures
PY  - 2010
AB  - Intuitively, wildlife crossing structures should enhance the viability of wildlife populations. Previous research has demonstrated that a broad range of species will use crossing structures, however, questions remain as to whether these measures actually provide benefits to populations. To assess this, studies will need to determine the number of individuals using crossings, their sex, and their genetic relationships. Obtaining empirical data demonstrating population-level benefits for some species can be problematic and challenging at best. Molecular techniques now make it possible to identify species, individuals, their sex, and their genetic relatedness from hair samples collected through non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS). The authors describe efforts to pilot a method to assess potential population-level benefits of wildlife crossing structures. They tested the feasibility of a prototype NGS system designed to sample hair from black bears (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bears (U. arctos) at two wildlife underpasses. The piloted hair-sampling method did not deter animal use of the trial underpasses and was effective at sampling hair from more than 90% of the bear crossing events at the underpasses. Hair samples were also obtained from non-target carnivore species, including three out of five (60%) cougar (Puma concolor) crossing events. Individual identification analysis revealed that three female and two male grizzly bears used one wildlife underpass, whereas two female and three male black bears were identified as using the other underpass. Of the 36 hair samples from bears analyzed, five failed, resulting in an 87% extraction success rate, and six more were only identified to species. Overall, 70% of the hair samples from bears collected in the field had sufficient DNA for extraction purposes. Preliminary data from our NGS suggest the technique can be a reliable method to assess the population-level benefits of Banff wildlife crossings. Furthermore, NGS can be an important tool for the conservation value of wildlife crossings for other taxa, and we urge others to carry out evaluations of this emerging methodology.

TI  - Organisms and Landscape Pattern
PY  - 2015
AB  - Organisms live in heterogeneous environments; they grow, reproduce, disperse, and die in landscapes that are spatially variable and temporally dynamic. Understanding the interactions of organisms with their environment is, of course, a major focus of ecology; understanding the interactions of organisms with the spatial heterogeneity in their environment is a key emphasis of landscape ecology. Much research relating organisms to landscape pattern was motivated by issues associated with and . In many landscapes worldwide, expanding human land use has caused natural habitats to decline, and remaining habitat often has been apportioned into small, isolated patches (Fig. 7.1). Landscape ecologists have mounted field studies, developed simulation models, and conducted experiments to understand and predict the consequences of habitat fragmentation for a wide variety of organisms (e.g., Debinski and Holt 2000; Fahrig 2003; Lindenmayer 2006; Collinge 2009). To maintain biodiversity (the abundance, variety, and genetic constitution of native animals and plants), ecologists also recognized the need for a landscape perspective to complement population, community, and ecosystem considerations (Franklin 1993). It is not only the local habitat amount and quality that matters for organisms, but also the composition and configuration of the surrounding landscape. John Wiens laid out many of these considerations in 1976 in a seminal review article, “Population dynamics in patchy environments,” which still makes for excellent reading. In the introduction, Wiens wrote:

TI  - Improved connectivity analysis using multiple low-cost paths to evaluate habitat for the endangered San Martin titi monkey (Plecturocebus oenanthe) in north-central Peru
PY  - 2019
AB  - Graph-theoretic evaluations of habitat connectivity often rely upon least-cost path analyses to evaluate connectedness of habitat patches, based on an underlying cost surface. We present two improvements upon these methods. As a case study to test these methods, we evaluated habitat connectivity for the endangered San Martin titi monkey (Plecturocebus oenanthe) in north-central Peru, to prioritize habitat patches for conservation. First, rather than using a single least-cost path between habitat patches, we analyzed multigraphs made up of multiple low-cost paths. This allows us to differentiate between patches connected through a single narrow corridor, and patches connected by a wide swath of traversable land. We evaluate potential movement pathways by iteratively removing paths and recomputing connectivity metrics. Second, instead of performing a sensitivity analysis by varying costs uniformly across the landscape, we generated landscapes with spatially varying costs. This approach produced a more informative assessment of connectivity than standard graph analyses. Of the 4340 habitat patches considered across the landscape, we identified the most important 100, those frequently ranked highly through repeated network modifications, for multiple metrics and cost surfaces. These methods represent a novel approach for assessing connectivity, better accounting for spatial configurations of habitat patches and uncertainty in cost surfaces. The ability to identify habitat patches with more possible routes to other patches is of interest for resiliency planning and prioritization in the face of continued habitat loss and climate change. These methods should be broadly applicable to conservation planning for other wildlife species.

TI  - Landscape composition and configuration influences woodland caribou calf recruitment
PY  - 2010
AB  - Newfoundland woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou ) populations are in steep decline and disturbance-related habitat loss and fragmentation have been blamed for similar woodland caribou population declines across the country. Research has focused on caribou habitat selection, and there is a need for studies to focus on landscape components that can be managed, and their relationships with caribou vital rates. I quantified landscape composition and configuration within the calving/post-calving range (CPCR) of female woodland caribou belonging to six herds in Newfoundland to explore their influence on calf recruitment over four years. I identified the CPCR of radio-collared female caribou and calculated the total disturbance area (area of forest fires and area within 250m of human disturbance sources), area occupied by natural landcover types, and three fragmentation measures (effective mesh size, edge to area ratio, and fragmentation extent) for each female's CPCR, and averaging them yearly for each herd. Total disturbance area and the area occupied by mixed forests were found to have negative effects on calf recruitment, whereas no significant direct relationship was found between either of the fragmentation measures and calf recruitment. Using Information Theoretic Approach, I found that the most parsimonious model to explain variation in calf recruitment included total disturbance area, the area occupied by mixed forests and wetlands, and the edge to area ratio measure of fragmentation. The effect of total disturbance area was negative, while the effect of wetlands was positive. It appears that combining quantitative measures of disturbance-related landscape structure (i.e. composition as well as configuration) to explain variation in woodland caribou calf recruitment, or other vital rates, would improve our ability to relate scientific research findings to wildlife management and land-use issues.

TI  - Butterfly and plant specialists suffer from reduced connectivity in fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Calcareous grasslands are diversity hotspots for plant and butterfly species in Europe, but connectivity of these grasslands has been reduced by habitat loss and fragmentation in recent decades. Reduced habitat area leads to biodiversity loss, but the significance of habitat connectivity independent of patch size and habitat quality is unclear. 2. Here, we focus on the impact of habitat connectivity on both butterfly and plant species richness and compare (i) a connectivity index, (ii) percentage habitat cover and (iii) distance to the next suitable habitat patch as alternative measures of connectivity. Species were recorded in 2007 in northern Bavaria (Germany) in paired large and small study sites in 31 independent landscapes. 3. We found that total loss of grassland connectivity would reduce species richness of specialist butterflies (38–69%) and specialist plants (24–37%). A connectivity index combining patch size and distance in the surrounding landscape was a better measure of connectivity than percentage habitat cover or distance to the next suitable habitat. 4. Species richness, species density and abundance of habitat-specialist butterflies and plants were significantly higher in large compared with small study sites. 5.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that connectivity is highly relevant for conservation of butterfly and plant species with specialized habitat requirements, but the decision as to which connectivity measure is most appropriate depends on patch configuration, landscape context and study design. We suggest that management strategies should aim to increase connectivity by active restoration of former calcareous grasslands to ensure long-term survival of habitat-specialist species.

TI  - Feeder-trunk and direct-link schemes for public transit: a model to evaluate the produced accessibility
PY  - 2021
AB  - In a public transport network, a more intense integration between lines generally involves, on one hand, the reduction in the number of direct links, which forces users to perform more transfers, and on the other hand, the possibility of achieving a greater number of rides with the same whole mileage. Thus, the move towards feeder-trunk schemes produces both negative and positive effects on accessibility and on the quality of service perceived by users. That implies the need to evaluate accessibility realized on a territory by transit service patterns characterized by different levels of line integration. This research was focused on the development of an accessibility model able to estimate an equivalent travel time and to consider the discomfort resulting from possible transfers between vehicles and the benefits arising from available transit rides. As reported in this paper, the proposed model, that measures accessibility through an equivalent travel time, determines the latter as a function, in addition to the time spent inside the vehicle, also of the time and discomfort consequent to the transfers as well as of the number of supplied rides. With reference to the regional public transport, the values obtained by the calibration of the constants show how the waiting time has a weight for the user twice as much compared to the time spent on the vehicle, whilst the time required for the transfer has about a one and a half weight. Finally, the discomfort caused by each transfer is evaluated by the user as an increase to the overall travel time of about 3 and a half minutes. The calibrated model has been applied to a real case, in order to validate it and highlight benefits and limitations resulting from feeder-trunk supply patterns. The developed tool is useful in the design of a public transport service, especially in areas with weak demand, allowing to compare, in terms of produced accessibility, supply schemes with different levels of line integration, variable from direct-link type (also called point to point) to that feeder-trunk.

TI  - Assessing effects of land use on landscape connectivity: loss and fragmentation of western U.S. forests.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Effects of land-use change on the conservation of biodiversity have become a concern to conservation scientists and land managers, who have identified loss and fragmentation of natural areas as a high-priority issue. Despite urgent calls to inform national, regional, and state planning efforts, there remains a critical need to develop practical approaches to identify where important lands are for landscape connectivity (i.e., linkages), where land use constrains connectivity, and which linkages are most important to maintain network-wide connectivity extents. Our overall goal in this paper was to develop an approach that provides comprehensive, quantitative estimates of the effects of land-use change on landscape connectivity and illustrate its use on a broad, regional expanse of the western United States. We quantified loss of habitat and landscape connectivity for western forested systems due to land uses associated with residential development, roads, and highway traffic. We examined how these land-use changes likely increase the resistance to movement of forest species in non-forested land cover types and, therefore, reduce the connectivity among forested habitat patches. To do so, we applied a graph-theoretic approach that incorporates ecological aspects within a geographic representation of a network. We found that roughly one-quarter of the forested lands in the western United States were integral to a network of forested patches, though the lands outside of patches remain critical for habitat and overall connectivity. Using remotely sensed land cover data (ca. 2000), we found 1.7 million km2 of forested lands. We estimate that land uses associated with residential development, roads, and highway traffic have caused roughly a 4.5% loss in area (20 000 km2) of these forested patches, and continued expansion of residential land will likely reduce forested patches by another 1.2% by 2030. We also identify linkages among forest patches that are critical for landscape connectivity. Our approach can be readily modified to examine connectivity for other habitats/ecological systems and for other geographic areas, as well as to address more specific requirements for particular conservation planning applications.

TI  - Comparative conservation genetics of protected endemic fishes in an arid-land riverscape
PY  - 2015
AB  - Conservation genetic studies are challenged by the fact that populations of many imperiled species have experienced declines and fragmentation to the degree they no longer exhibit natural, self-sustaining metapopulation processes; characteristics of great importance to managers charged with their protection. Genetic patterns of species from minimally impacted systems can inform management practices for populations in more modified and fragmented systems. We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity and differentiation using microsatellites for three imperiled fishes of the unfragmented upper Gila River, New Mexico, USA. Estimates of contemporary effective size were low for these species, but we observed little genetic evidence of inbreeding. Overall genetic structure was low (all species FST < 0.025) suggesting moderate to high gene flow for all species, but each exhibited different patterns of spatial structuring. Gila nigra (a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act) appears most at risk of short-term loss of genetic variation and local extinction relative to Meda fulgida or Rhinichthys (Tiaroga) cobitis (both federally endangered) because G. nigra exhibited the lowest diversity, smallest effective size (Ne ~100) and temporally unstable population structure. Meda fulgida and R. cobitis exhibited temporally stable spatial structure related to riverscape features but connectivity among occupied habitats is threatened by a proposed diversion structure. Data from this comparatively pristine system can inform management of these species in fragmented portions of their ranges.

TI  - Early successional dynamics of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in the tropical dry forest ecosystem in Colombia.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Little is known about the successional dynamics of insects in the highly threatened tropical dry forest (TDF) ecosystem. For the first time, we studied the response of carabid beetles to vegetal succession and seasonality in this ecosystem in Colombia. Carabid beetles were collected from three TDF habitat types in two regions in Colombia: initial successional state (pasture), early succession, and intermediate succession (forest). The surveys were performed monthly for 13 months in one of the regions (Armero) and during two months, one in the dry and one in the wet season, in the other region (Cambao). A set of environmental variables were recorded per month at each site. Twenty-four carabid beetle species were collected during the study. Calosoma alternans and Megacephala affinis were the most abundant species, while most species were of low abundance. Forest and pasture beetle assemblages were distinct, while the early succession assemblage overlapped with these assemblages. Canopy cover, litter depth, and soil and air temperatures were important in structuring the assemblages. Even though seasonality did not affect the carabid beetle assemblage, individual species responded positively to the wet season. It is shown that early successional areas in TDF could potentially act as habitat corridors for species to recolonize forest areas, since these successional areas host a number of species that inhabit forests and pastures. Climatic variation, like the El Nino episode during this study, appears to affect the carabid beetle assemblage negatively, exasperating concerns of this already threatened tropical ecosystem.

AB  - The Cuitzeo Lake Basin is covered with forests and scrublands with high ecological importance, which have experienced fragmentation resulting from human activities. In this study we analyzed changes in the structural connectivity of the Cuitzeo Lake basin, Michoacan, between 1975 and 2008. We used land cover databases for the years 1975, 1996, 2000, 2003 and 2008. For each year, landscape composition metrics were applied, such as isolation and structural connectivity metrics at the landscape and class levels. Finally we performed a comparative analysis. The forest cover presented low structural connectivity values in contrast to the human activity related land covers, which dominated the landscape over time. The information on changes in landscape structural connectivity and fragmentation from this study provide a useful tool for landscape management and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Role of forest certification in biodiversity conservation in Lithuania
PY  - 2015
AB  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification scheme emerged as an instrument to notify well managed forests. There are endless discussions about the actual FSC certification contribution to biodiversity conservation. In this thesis Lithuanian FSC certified forests were assessed regarding biodiversity protection measures implemented on the ground. First, FSC Lithuanian standard indicators concerning biodiversity measures were selected and grouped according to the spatial scales of forest management that had to be performed in order to satisfy a certain indictor. Secondly, voluntary and formally set-aside areas for biodiversity conservation in FSC certified State Forest Enterprises (SFE) were compared. Lastly I examined structural habitat connectivity using morphological spatial pattern analysis tool. Lithuanian FSC standard indicators requirements were focused on the stand and landscape scales, while there were no indicators regarding ecoregion. The formally set-aside area was more than two times larger than voluntary. Structural habitat analysis showed that the most set-aside patches were smaller than 10 ha and had a small fraction of old forests. I discuss that FSC standard focuses on species with small habitat requirements. Moreover formal forest protection, due to several protection levels does not provide the same conservation measures, while voluntary set-asides are treated evenly. I conclude that to understand a role of FSC certification in forest biodiversity conservation it is important to evaluate formally and voluntary set-asides from protected species perspective to see functionality of the protected areas.

TI  - The disappearing Dry Chaco, one of the last dry forest systems on earth
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Dry Chaco spans more than 87 million hectares across Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. This unique forest system has experienced extensive loss and fragmentation due to land-use change, with different land-use histories in the three countries. This forest loss has altered landscape connectivity for the Dry Chaco’s associated biota. We compared patterns of deforestation-induced fragmentation and concomitant changes in structural landscape connectivity between 2000 and 2019 in the three countries to identify consistent patterns that might facilitate biome-wide conservation. We quantified forest cover in the Dry Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay for the years 2000 and 2019 at 30 m resolution. We analyzed structural connectivity at three scales. Then, we identified and visualized the most important stepping stones per country per year. Between 2000 and 2019, the overall extent of Dry Chaco forest cover decreased by 20.2% (9.5 million ha). All three counties experienced substantial reductions, with Paraguay undergoing the greatest loss and fragmentation relative to 2000. Most of the overall network metrics decreased from 2000 to 2019 for Paraguay and Bolivia, but Argentina experienced increased coalescence distance and average nodal connectance. Dispersal-level metrics showed clustering threshold distances between 1000 and 2000 m for each country in both years. The large number of forest fragments and distances between them suggest that some mammals characteristic of the biome may be experiencing negative impacts from this fragmentation. Contemporary and future challenges of uncoordinated national conservation and management policies, land speculation, and increased human infrastructure will accelerate the rate of deforestation.

TI  - Functional connectivity in forest birds: evidence for species-specificity and anisotropy
PY  - 2019
AB  - Functional connectivity is assumed to play a critical role in population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Although it is generally summarized as an isotropic metric, functional connectivity may be anisotropic, i.e. may vary as a function of movement axis and direction. In addition, variation in functional connectivity among species within the same landscape has rarely been examined. Here, we asked to what extent the functional connectivity of managed forest landscapes is species-specific, and whether there is evidence for directional anisotropy in functional connectivity for two species of forest songbirds. We performed 6-km reciprocal translocations between two pairs of sites and we monitored return times of territorial male Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla; n = 47) and Black-throated Green Warblers (Setophaga virens; n = 37) in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Each landscape was dominated by deciduous forest and comprised a 500- to 900-m wide strip of conifer plantation perpendicular to the movement axis. Homing time was shorter for Black-throated Green Warbler than for Ovenbird and anisotropy in functional connectivity was detected in the Ovenbird in one of the landscapes. Differences between species may reflect the Ovenbird’s narrower habitat and foraging niche. Our results indicate that spatially-explicit population models should account for variability in functional connectivity among species, even when they are closely related. Our findings also suggest that anisotropy can be present under specific conditions.

TI  - The effects of rapid urbanization on forest landscape connectivity in Zhuhai City, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban forests can provide the necessary ecosystem services for their residents and play an important part in improving the urban environment. Forest landscape connectivity is a vital indicator reflecting the quality of the ecological environment and ecological functions. Detecting changes in landscape connectivity is, therefore, an important step for providing sound scientific evidence for the better urban planning. Using remote sensing images of a study area in Zhuhai City in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013, the dynamic forest landscape connectivity of Zhuhai city can be evaluated based on a graph-theoretic approach. The aims of our study were to discover and interpret the effect of rapid urbanization on forest landscape connectivity. The construction of ecological corridors helps us specifically compare the landscape connectivity of three parts of urban forests. On the basis of functional landscape metrics, the correlation of these metrics and patch area was discussed in order to comprehensively identify the key patches. The analysis showed that the total areas of forestlands reduced from 1999 to 2009 and then increased from 2009 to 2013, and the same trend was found in overall forest landscape connectivity. To improve the overall landscape connectivity, construct urban ecological network and appropriately protect biodiversity in the future, the existing important patches with large areas or key positions should be well protected. This study revealed that urbanization reduced the area of key patches and consequently reduced the forest landscape connectivity, which increased while the patch areas increased due to the environmental protection policy. Functional connectivity indicators could provide more comprehensive information in the development of environmental protection strategies.

TI  - Evaluating biodegradable alternatives to plastic mesh for small‐scale oyster reef restoration
PY  - 2022
AB  - Polyethylene plastic mesh is commonly used for containing oyster shells in small-scale oyster reef restoration, but environmental and public health concerns have prompted investigations of biodegradable alternatives. Shallow (<0.5 m) and deep (~1 m) oyster reefs (~6 m2) were constructed in the Mission-Aransas Estuary, Texas, U.S.A., in March 2020 using recycled oyster shells placed into four different replicated mesh bag types: polyethylene (plastic) and three biodegradable alternatives (cellulose, cotton, and jute). Biodegradable alternatives (cellulose, cotton, and jute) all completely degraded within two months of deployment, leaving piles of loose shell, while polyethylene bags remained intact. Despite rapid degradation, the biodegradable / loose shell successfully recruited and developed larger oysters (mean of 46 mm) than on the polyethylene-bagged shell (mean of 40 mm) after seven months, although at less than half the density. Associated motile fauna density in the bagged shell was 2.4 times higher than in the loose shell after seven months at both the deep and shallow locations. Faunal community composition and diversity varied more with reef depth than by bag type. The total cost of using polyethylene bags was lower than for biodegradable alternatives (22-45% the cost of cellulose, 35-72% the cost of jute, 49-99% the cost of cotton. However, because our estimate of the environmental cost of polyethylene plastic mesh only included impacts on marine natural capital, the true cost is likely much higher. Despite higher costs, biodegradable alternatives can still be successful for use in small-scale oyster restoration events without introducing plastics into the marine environment.

TI  - Evaluating the Barrier Assessment Technique Derived from FishXing Software and the Upstream Movement of Brook Trout through Road Culverts
PY  - 2013
AB  - AbstractAnthropogenic barriers to fish passage, such as culverts and dams, are major factors impeding the persistence and recovery of aquatic species. Considerable work has focused on mitigating these impacts; however, activities associated with measuring and restoring connectivity of aquatic ecosystems often face challenges in determining the passability of barriers by aquatic species. Hydrological modeling software that incorporates biological aspects of a focal species is often used as a relatively inexpensive method for assessing barrier passability for restoration decisions. However, the biological relevance of these approaches remains to be rigorously tested. We assessed passage rates of PIT-tagged Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis through four road culverts and adjacent reference sites (unaltered areas of the streams) on the island of Newfoundland to determine whether upstream passage through road culverts was more restrictive than unaltered reference areas of the stream. Next, we examined the usef...

TI  - Functional habitat connectivity for beach mice depends on perceived predation risk
PY  - 2013
AB  - Landscape features that promote animal movement contribute to functional habitat connectivity. Factors that affect the use of landscape features, such as predation risk, may alter functional connectivity. We identify factors important to functional habitat connectivity by quantifying movement patterns of the Santa Rosa beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus leucocephalus) in relation to landscape features and by examining how ambient perceived predation risk, which is altered by moon phase, interacts with landscape features. We use track paths across the sand to relate the probability that beach mice cross gaps between vegetation patches to gap width, patch quality, landscape context and moon phase. Overall activity levels were lower during full versus new moon nights, demonstrating that beach mice respond negatively to moonlight. Gap crossing was more likely during new moon nights (25 % of gaps crossed vs. 7 % during full moon nights), and across narrower gaps ( 11.75 m2). This study suggests that vegetation recovery is necessary for functional connectivity in post-hurricane landscapes commonly inhabited by beach mice and provides initial guidelines for restoring landscape connectivity. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of considering predation risk when quantifying landscape connectivity, as landscape features that facilitate connectivity when predation risk is low may be ineffective if predation risk increases over time or across space.

TI  - Spatial graphs as templates for habitat networks in boreal landscapes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Network topology serves as a useful model for biological systems at various scales. Contrary to many biological systems, spatial reference is crucial for habitat networks. Boreal forest landscapes provide a wide gradient of spatial patterns and, thus, unique network structures. Assuming forest-dwelling organisms in general aim to minimize travel distances during foraging, dispersal, etc., linear links across the landscape matrix constitute expected movement routes among forested areas in boreal landscapes. We quantified the number and length of links in a set of 57 boreal forest landscapes for four hierarchically nested graphs in order to compare the incremental changes in characteristics of resulting graph measures. The forest cover graphs consisted of the same set of forest patches, and hierarchical link types extracted from real landscapes: nearest neighbour graph (NN), minimum spanning tree (MST), Gabriel graph (GG) and minimum planar graph (MPG). Most of the links in graphs were NN and GG links. Commonly links were 100–200 m in length, but link lengths particularly in the GG and MPG shorten when the proportion of forest in landscapes increased. Most nodes had 3–5 links each, but the number of links per node depended on node size and the proportion of forest cover. GG and MPG graphs retain the topology of the underlying node layout. Changes in node pattern alter the NN and MST graphs more than GG and MPG. Variation in regional network topologies is likely to affect connectivity patterns in a landscape and, thus, many ecological processes that occur at a local scale. An appropriate network analysis enables the discovery and comparison of distinctive network patterns. Understanding network topologies provide practical tools for land use planning and biodiversity management of broader areas that target functional habitat networks.

TI  - What can studies of woodland fragmentation and creation tell us about ecological networks? A literature review and synthesis
PY  - 2014
AB  - The development of ecological networks could help reverse the effects of habitat fragmentation on woodland biodiversity in temperate agricultural landscapes. However, efforts to create networks need to be underpinned by clear evidence of the relative efficacy of local (e.g. improving or expanding existing habitat patches) versus landscape-scale actions (e.g. creating new habitat or corridors in the landscape matrix). Using cluster analyses we synthesised the findings of 104 studies, published between 1990 and 2013 focusing on the responses of woodland vascular plant, vertebrate, cryptogam and invertebrate species to local and landscape variables. Species responses (richness, diversity, occurrence) were strongly influenced by patch area, patch characteristics (e.g. stand structure) and isolation (e.g. distance between habitat patches). Patch characteristics were of overriding importance for all species groups, especially cryptogams. Many studies recording significant species responses to patch characteristics did not record significant responses to patch area and vice versa, suggesting that patch area may sometimes act as a surrogate for patch characteristics (i.e. larger patches being of ‘better quality’). Ecological continuity was important for vascular plants, but assessed in only a few vertebrate and invertebrate studies. Matrix structure (e.g. presence of corridors) was important for vertebrates, but rarely assessed for other species groups. Actions to develop ecological networks should focus on enhancing the quality and/or size of existing habitat patches and reducing isolation between patches. However, given that very few studies have assessed all local and landscape variables together, further information on the relative impacts of different attributes of ecological networks in temperate agricultural landscapes is urgently needed.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta from 1983 to 2016
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The Mississippi Delta in coastal Louisiana has some of the highest rates of land loss in the world. This land-loss crisis might become a global problem because most major deltas are expected to be vulnerable to land loss during the remainder of the 21st century and beyond. Despite this predicament, we do not understand how land loss in a deltaic environment proceeds in time and space. Here, we evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta (LMRD) region using spatial statistics and landscape metrics. We used nearly 4800 Landsat images to construct a series of three-year cloud-free composites from 1983 to 2016. From these data, we created a stability index (SI), which is a dimensionless measure of the number of land-to-water transitions that a land pixel makes before being considered lost. Our results indicate that on the LMRD, 75% of land loss is a single transition from land to water, while about 25% of land pixels have two or more transitions before being considered lost. Using a local indicator of spatial association, we show that pixels with similar SI tend to cluster together. Single transition clusters (low SI) form elongated shapes, they are densely packed, and they are predominantly, but not always, found on marsh edges. On the other hand, multi-transition clusters (high SI) form square-like shapes, they are more fragmented, and they are usually found in marsh interiors. Our analysis further shows that the land-loss area within the spatial patches with both high and low stability is strongly related to the density of land patches and their shape (R2 of 0.717 and 0.545 respectively). Our analysis suggests that land-loss pixels on the marsh edges undergo different temporal patterns of land loss compared to those in the marsh interior. We hypothesize that this arises because wave edge-erosion drives land loss on marsh edges, whereas subsidence-related flooding drives land loss in marsh interiors. The stability index provides a useful way to characterize the processes causing land loss.

TI  - Influence of spatial distribution and size of clones on the realized outcrossing rate of the marsh cinquefoil (Comarum palustre)
PY  - 2013
AB  - † Background and Aims Clonal growth is a common feature in flowering plants. As clone size increases, the selfing rate in self-compatible species is likely to increase due to more frequent geitono-pollination events (i.e. pollination among flowers within the same genet). This study investigated the breeding system of the marsh cinquefoil (Comarum palustre) and assessed spatial distribution of clones, clone size and architecture, and their effects on realized outcrossing rates. In addition, pollen dispersal was investigated in two patchy populations. † Methods The species’ breeding system was investigated under controlled conditions through hand pollinations (self- vs. cross-pollination). Using microsatellite markers, an assessment was made of the realized outcrossing rates and the genetic diversity in four natural populations, the clonal structure in two populations within five 15 × 15 m sampling plots following 0.5 × 0.5 m grids, and the pollen dispersal through paternity assignment tests in those two populations. † Key Results Comarum palustre is a self-compatible species but only presents a low rate of spontaneous self-pollination. The occurrence of inbreeding depression was not detected at the seed set stage (dSS ¼ 0.04). Clones were spatially clumped (AC ¼ 0.60 ‐0.80), with intermediate to no intermingling of the ramets (DC ¼ 0.40 ‐1.00). Genet size ranged from one to 171 ramets. Patchy populations had low outcrossing rates (tm ¼ 0.33‐ 0.46). Large clones showed lower outcrossing rates than small clones. Pollen dispersal mainly occurred within patches as only 1‐7 % of the pollination events occurred between patches of .25 m separation. Seedling recruitment events were detected. † Conclusions Genet size together with distances between patches, through increasing geitono-pollination events, appeared to be important factors influencing realized outcrossing rates. The study also revealed seed flow allowing seedling recruitment, which may contribute to increasing the number of new patches, and potentially further enhance gene flow within populations.

TI  - Network modularity reveals critical scales for connectivity in ecology and evolution
PY  - 2013
AB  - For nearly a century, biologists have emphasized the profound importance of spatial scale for ecology, evolution and conservation. Nonetheless, objectively identifying critical scales has proven incredibly challenging. Here we extend new techniques from physics and social sciences that estimate modularity on networks to identify critical scales for movement and gene flow in animals. Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale. We argue that network modularity reveals critical meso-scales that are probably common in populations, providing a powerful means of identifying fundamental scales for biology and for conservation strategies aimed at recovering imperilled species.

AB  - Context Functional connectivity reflects the ease with which an organism can access different locations within its environment. Because functional connectivity can significantly influence dispersal, habitat selection, and ultimately the viability of populations, it is central to understanding and predicting biological responses to anthropogenic disturbance. Currently, no consensus exists on how to measure functional connectivity.

TI  - Use of Centrality Metrics to Protect Wildlife Ecology and Habitat Connectivity Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim of study: Aim of this study was to conduct a habitat connectivity analysis using centrality metrics to protect the regional wildlife-habitat connections of the Siirt landscape, and to ensure the continuity of ecological flows in the landscape. Area of study: Increasing urbanisation trend in recent years and human impact on natural resources cause the diversity in Siirt landscape to be negatively affected. Centrality metrics were sampled in Siirt landscape in terms of re-establishing and maintaining the connectivity in the landscape. Material and methods: Environmental Plan was used to define the core areas. Land cover/land uses were digitised using Geographical Information Systems. Firstly, landscape connectivity corridors defined with least-cost-path and secondly, current flow centrality was used with circuit theory. Main results: The core area with the strongest flow centrality was forest, with a value of 14.6, and the core area with the weakest flow centrality was marsh at 8.23. The core areas that establish the easiest and strongest connection with each other are wetland-pasture, pasture-geologically reserved area, and pasture-ecological area. Highlights: The greater the distance between core areas, the weaker the degree of connectivity between species and habitats. Increasing the distance between core areas negatively affects the ecological flow.

TI  - Effects of different matrix representations and connectivity measures on habitat network assessments
PY  - 2014
AB  - Assessing landscape connectivity is important to understand the ecology of landscapes and to evaluate alternative conservation strategies. The question is though, how to quantify connectivity appropriately, especially when the information available about the suitability of the matrix surrounding habitat is limited. Our goal here was to investigate the effects of matrix representation on assessments of the connectivity among habitat patches and of the relative importance of individual patches for the connectivity within a habitat network. We evaluated a set of 50 × 50 km2 test areas in the Carpathian Mountains and considered three different matrix representations (binary, categorical and continuous) using two types of connections among habitat patches (shortest lines and least-cost paths). We compared connections, and the importance of patches, based on (1) isolation, (2) incidence-functional, and (3) graph measures. Our results showed that matrix representation can greatly affect assessments of connections (i.e., connection length, effective distance, and spatial location), but not patch prioritization. Although patch importance was not much affected by matrix representation, it was influenced by the connectivity measure and its parameterization. We found the biggest differences in the case of the integral index of connectivity and equally weighted patches, but no consistent pattern in response to changing dispersal distance. Connectivity assessments in more fragmented landscapes were more sensitive to the selection of matrix representation. Although we recommend using continuous matrix representation whenever possible, our results indicated that simpler matrix representations can be also used as a proxy to delineate those patches that are important for overall connectivity, but not to identify connections among habitat patches.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring of changes in forest habitat connectivity following the great eastern Japan earthquake and tsunami
PY  - 2020
AB  - In March of 2011 a huge tsunami devastated forest habitats along the coast of Sendai Bay in northeastern Japan. Evaluation and monitoring of the changes in habitat connectivity caused by this disaster are essential for managing the recovery of ecosystems and biodiversity. This research is designed to clarify changes in habitat connectivity caused by the tsunami, as well as subsequent changes due to the process of recovery and restoration. Forest patch distribution maps were constructed from remote sensing data for 2010, just before the tsunami, 2011, immediately after the tsunami, and 2012 and 2016. A binary connection model was employed to generate forest patch network maps for each of the target years, for connectivity distances of 100 m, 800 m and 2500 m. Also, two quantitative connectivity indices, the Integral Index of Connectivity and Class Coincidence Probability were used to assess the changes in continuity. The forest patch network map and quantitative indices analysis both showed that not only had the forest habitats been reduced and fragmented by the tsunami, but that continuity kept declining in the following year. By 2016, however, newly established forest patches connected with extant ones, resulting in a slight recovery in habitat connectivity. The network maps allowed clear visualization of changes in connectivity over the study period, and were backed up by quantitative results from the indices. This method is relevant for conservation of species with diverse mobility and habitat continuity needs, and for management and restoration of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Moving through the mosaic: identifying critical linkage zones for large herbivores across a multiple‐use African landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Reduced connectivity across grassland ecosystems can impair their functional heterogeneity and negatively impact large herbivore populations. Maintaining landscape connectivity across human-dominated rangelands is therefore a key conservation priority. Integrate data on large herbivore occurrence and species richness with analyses of functional landscape connectivity to identify important areas for maintaining or restoring connectivity for large herbivores. The study was conducted on a landscape with a mosaic of multiple land uses in Laikipia County, Kenya. We used occupancy estimates for four herbivore species [African elephant (Loxodonta africana), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), plains zebra (Equus quagga), and Grevy’s zebra (Equus grevyi)] and species richness estimates derived from aerial surveys to create resistance surfaces to movement for single species and a multi-species assemblage, respectively. We validated single-species resistance surfaces using telemetry data. We used circuit theory and least cost-path analyses to model linkage zones across the landscape and prioritize areas for connectivity restoration. Resistance layers approximated the movements of our focal species. Results for single-species and multi-species connectivity models were highly correlated (rp > 0.9), indicating similar spatial patterns of functional connectivity between individual species and the larger herbivore assemblage. We identified critical linkage zones that may improve permeability to large-herbivore movements. Our analysis highlights the utility of aerial surveys in modeling landscape connectivity and informing conservation management when animal movement data are scarce. Our results can guide management decisions, providing valuable information to evaluate the trade-offs between improving landscape connectivity and safeguarding livelihoods with electrified fences across rangelands.

TI  - Anthropogenic Stressors Shape Genetic Structure: Insights from a Model Freshwater Population along a Land Use Gradient
PY  - 2016
AB  - Environmental pollution including mutagens from wastewater effluents and discontinuity by man-made barriers are considered typical anthropogenic pressures on microevolutionary processes that are responsible for the loss of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Here, we tested for the effects of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), weirs and other stressors on the invertebrate species Gammarus pulex at the population genetic level combining evolutionary ecotoxicology, body burden analysis and testing for exposure to mutagens. Exposure to chemical pollution alone and in combination with the presence of weirs resulted in a depression of allelic richness in native G. pulex populations. Our results suggest that the input of a mutagenic effluent from a WWTP resulted in a strong increase in private alleles over the affected populations. In addition, the presence of weirs along the river disrupted the migration across the river and thus the gene flow between G. pulex upstream and downstream. This study provides str...

TI  - Evaluating functional connectivity with matrix behavior uncertainty for an endangered butterfly
PY  - 2013
AB  - Understanding animal responses to landscape elements helps forecast population reactions to changing landscape conditions. The challenge is that some behaviors are poorly known and difficult to estimate. We assessed how uncertainty in behavioral responses to dense woods, an avoided landscape structure, impacts functional connectivity among reproductive habitat patches for Fender’s blue butterfly, an endangered prairie species of western Oregon, USA. We designed a factorial simulation experiment using a spatially explicit individual-based model to project functional connectivity for female butterflies across current and alternative landscapes. We varied the probability of dense woods entry and turning angle standard deviation for movements within the dense woods over a range of biologically reasonable and observed values. Butterflies in the current landscape (46 % dense woods) and one with prairie encroached by forest (60 % dense woods) showed reductions in functional connectivity estimates consistent with the expectations of habitat fragmentation. Although dense woods entrance uncertainty impacted functional connectivity projections, uncertainty in the dense woods turning angle standard deviation had comparatively little impact on connectivity estimates. Reduction and reconfiguration of the current dense woods to 27 % cover (restored landscape) appeared to facilitate a corridor behavior in dispersing individuals, likely providing a functional connectivity estimate comparable to the historic landscape (<5 % dense woods). Our simulations suggest that additional study of butterfly movement within the dense woods is unnecessary and that a partial reduction in dense woods would be sufficient to achieve historic levels of functional connectivity for Fender’s blue across the study landscape.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract: Through the classification of current and historical aerial photosbetween 1973 and 2006, we analysed the evolution of size, shape and connectivity of 59 mountain meadows (maggenghi) of the Pejo district (Trentino, Northern Italy). The maggenghi are scattered patches within a forested matrix. We conducted the same analysis on an Austro-Hungarian cadastral map of 1859. The total surface covered by maggenghi was 137.4 ha in 1973, and decreased to 78.3 ha (57%) in 2006. The mean shape and connectivity index in 1973 are significantly lower than those of 2006. Within a 1-km radius around the studied patches, woodlands increased by 7% in the same time range. Among the 25 maggenghi present in 1958, 12 has been subdivided into 39 smaller fragments and 13 has been reduced in their size without any fragmentation. A general process of meadow patches evolution which included area and connectivity reduction and shape simplification has been noticed. This process is common to many other alpine landscapes. The study of these processes is fundamental for policies aimed to conservation of mountain meadows, as well as to identify the single patches deserving conservation for their current and historical landscape structure, as many studies report their significant effects on local floristic diversity.

TI  - Designing Green Corridors Network Within Cities: A Case Study in Vienna
PY  - 2017
AB  - The notion of green cities is not green enough. There is a necessity to readapt consumption modes and rethink urban spaces in order to ensure the long-term viability of the built environment. Urban agriculture on roofs could play a great role in this transformation process. The question is: where and in what conditions would rooftop gardens have the most significant and positive influence on our existing urban system? This chapter presents a method, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and parametric modelizations, which provides an effective planning strategy of the green corridors network within a city. This interdisciplinary research is based on different parameters: the lead angle of the Viennese rooftops, the existing urban green spaces and the pollinator’s flight foraging distance. After importing the suitable rooftop surfaces into Grasshopper (Algorithmic modeling for Rhinoceros 3D, a CAD software), the model identifies the key surfaces capable to create large green corridors network and to connect existing green spaces in Vienna.

TI  - A predictive model of avian natal dispersal distance provides prior information for investigating response to landscape change
PY  - 2011
AB  - 1. Informative Bayesian priors can improve the precision of estimates in ecological studies or estimate parameters for which little or no information is available. While Bayesian analyses are becoming more popular in ecology, the use of strongly informative priors remains rare, perhaps because examples of informative priors are not readily available in the published literature. 2. Dispersal distance is an important ecological parameter, but is difficult to measure and estimates are scarce. General models that provide informative prior estimates of dispersal distances will therefore be valuable. 3. Using a world-wide data set on birds, we develop a predictive model of median natal dispersal distance that includes body mass, wingspan, sex and feeding guild. This model predicts median dispersal distance well when using the fitted data and an independent test data set, explaining up to 53% of the variation. 4. Using this model, we predict a priori estimates of median dispersal distance for 57 woodland-dependent bird species in northern Victoria, Australia. These estimates are then used to investigate the relationship between dispersal ability and vulnerability to landscape-scale changes in habitat cover and fragmentation. 5. We find evidence that woodland bird species with poor predicted dispersal ability are more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation than those species with longer predicted dispersal distances, thus improving the understanding of this important phenomenon. 6. The value of constructing informative priors from existing information is also demonstrated. When used as informative priors for four example species, predicted dispersal distances reduced the 95% credible intervals of posterior estimates of dispersal distance by 8-19%. Further, should we have wished to collect information on avian dispersal distances and relate it to species' responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, data from 221 individuals across 57 species would have been required to obtain estimates with the same precision as those provided by the general model.

TI  - Hydrological connectivity for riverine fish: measurement challenges and research opportunities
PY  - 2010
AB  - SUMMARY 1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales >1000 km 2 and >100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales1–1000 km 2 and <1–100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish. 2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes. 3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities.

TI  - Ecological connectivity framework in the state of Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia: A potential conservation strategy in the rapid changing tropics
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ecological connectivity refers to the structural and functional connectivity of landscapes that facilitates suitable habitats for flora and fauna. The state of Selangor, peninsular Malaysia, is hosting a natural mosaic of landscapes ranging from montane, hill, lowland, peat-swamp, and mangrove forests to lake, river and coastal landscapes. This is a unique feature in the tropics and valuable habitat for diverse flora and fauna. It is reported from many studies that a considerable number of the species are vulnerable and endangered. This unique region has been facing tremendous pressure from anthropogenic activities. Commercial agriculture, urbanization and industrialization are causing a massive threat to sustain its unique natural heritage. Understanding the need for restoring connectivity within its natural habitat is important to conserve the uniqueness of such tropical landscapes. Therefore, this paper discusses (i) the understanding of importance of the ecological connectivity within the remnant habitats for restoration and conservation planning and (ii) the approach to develop a framework for ecological connectivity network through bridging science and policy. Though Malaysian National Physical Plan grossly identifies the issues but scientific assessment is lacking there. This study will give a guide line to the understanding of the importance of ecological connectivity network, in one hand, and it will help to develop an approach for the ecological connectivity network in such rapidly changing region in the other. Key words: Ecological connectivity network, functional connectivity, structural connectivity, conservation, landscape planning.

TI  - Evaluation model for local transit effectiveness to support the service design in weak demand areas
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>In a public transport network, an integration between lines generally involves, on one hand, the reduction in the number of direct links, which forces users to perform more vehicle switches, and on the other hand, the possibility of supplying a greater number of rides with the same mileage. Thus, the conversion of a direct link scheme to a feeder-trunk one to improve transit service efficiency in weak demand areas produces both negative and positive effects on accessibility. This paper deals with the built of a model able to estimate an equivalent travel time, taking into account the discomfort caused to users by the vehicle switch and the benefit arising from the greater availability of public transit rides. To validate this model and highlight benefits and limitations resulting from feeder-trunk supply schemes an application to a case study was developed.</jats:p>

TI  - Human impacts on connectivity in marine and freshwater ecosystems assessed using graph theory: a review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Human activities are altering the processes that connect organisms within and among habitats and populations in marine and freshwater (aquatic) ecosystems. Connectivity can be quantified using graph theory, where habitats or populations are represented by ‘nodes’ and dispersal is represented by ‘links’. This approach spans discipline and systemic divides, facilitating identification of generalities in human impacts. We conducted a review of studies that have used graph theory to quantify spatial functional connectivity in aquatic ecosystems. The search identified 42 studies published in 2000–14. We assessed whether each study quantified the impacts of (1) habitat alteration (loss, alteration to links, and gain), (2) human movements causing species introductions, (3) overharvesting and (4) climate change (warming temperatures, altered circulation or hydrology, sea-level rise) and ocean acidification. In freshwater systems habitat alteration was the most commonly studied stressor, whereas in marine systems overharvesting, in terms of larval dispersal among protected areas, was most commonly addressed. Few studies have directly assessed effects of climate change, suggesting an important area of future research. Graph representations of connectivity revealed similarities across different impacts and systems, suggesting common strategies for conservation management. We suggest future research directions for studies of aquatic connectivity to inform conservation management of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Woodland bird response to landscape connectivity in an agriculture-dominated landscape: a functional community approach
PY  - 2014
AB  - Over the last 30 years, ecological networks have been deployed to reduce global biodiversity loss by enhancing landscape connectivity. Bird species dwelling in woodland habitats that are embedded in agriculture-dominated landscapes are expected to be particularly sensitive to the loss of connectivity. This study aimed to determine the role of landscape connectivity in woodland bird species richness, abundance, and community similarity in north-east Brittany (north-west France). An exhaustive woodland selection protocol was carried out to minimize the effects of woodland size on the response variables. Connectivity of the woodland and forest network in the study area was evaluated using graph-theory, accounting for matrix permeability, and a characteristic median natal dispersal distance at the community level based on the bird species pool recorded in the sampled woodlands. Information-theoretic model selection, controlling for woodland size in all the cases, depicted the response of woodland birds at the community level to the connectivity of agriculture-dominated landscapes. On average, the sampled woodlands (n = 25) contained 15.5 ± 2.4 bird species, with an abundance of 25.1 ± 3.9, and had highly similar bird communities (species composition and proportion); eight species represented 57% of total abundance and were present in at least 22 woodlands. The performance of models improved when using effective, rather than Euclidean, interpatch distances in the connectivity assessment. Landscape connectivity was only significantly related to similarity of proportional species composition. Large woodlands contained communities with more similar species proportions in an inhospitable agricultural landscape matrix than in a more permeable one. Woodland size was the most relevant factor determining species abundance, indicating that the bird population sizes are primarily proportional to the local habitat availability. Connectivity in relation to landscape matrix permeability did not seem to induce the flow of woodland-dependent bird species that are dominant in the community but rather of matrix-dwelling bird species that are less dependent on woodland patch area. In conclusion, both habitat conservation and restoration (i.e., amount and quality), in combination with permeable landscape structures (such as heterogeneous land cover mosaics), are advocated for community level conservation strategies.

TI  - STRUCTURAL VERSUS FUNCTIONAL HABITAT CONNECTIVITY MEASURES TO EXPLAIN BIRD DIVERSITY IN FRAGMENTED ORCHARDS
PY  - 2010
AB  - Habitat connectivity plays a paramount role in the biodiversity of fragmented landscapes. Commonly, connectivity is measured using simple structural metrics, e.g. Euclidean distances between habitat patches. Recently, functi onal measures such as cost-distance metrics have been proposed. Cost-distance metrics a ccount for behavioural aspects of investigated organisms. They weight the habitats of the investigated landscape according to specific cost values, and model the optimal dispers al corridor according to these values. This study investigated i) if structural or functio nal connectivity measures explain biodiversity in a focal habitat better and ii) if t he appropriateness of the measure differs between patch and landscape scale. We mapped the landscapes within a 500 m radius around 30 fragmented traditional orchards (focal pa tch). Connectivity measures were based on either Euclidean distances (structural) or cost- distances (functional) to other suitable habitat patches. Birds were used as biodiversity in dicators. For analysis, we calculated species richness and total abundance of all species with a preference for woody habitats. In addition, abundances of four wood-preferring bird s pecies were also examined individually. Linear models were created using stepwise forward s election. The relative performance of structural and functional connectivity measures was scale dependent. Structural metrics explained more variance at the patch scale whereas functional metrics explained more variance at the landscape scale. We conclude that s imple structural metrics can be used to investigate local or small-scale effects on bird di versity but that investigations of landscape scale connectivity should consider behavioural aspe cts by using more complex functional metrics. The comparison between group and single species showed that not all individual species behave similarly to group results. Whilst t he use of organism groups must be treated

TI  - Green Infrastructure as a tool to support spatial planning in European urban regions
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract: The last decades have seen a major shift in the planning and development of ecosystem and landscape management in Europe. First of all, in line with international developments, the life-support services of ecosystems have come to the fore through the application of the concept of “ecosystem services”. Secondly, drawing on the principles of landscape ecology linkages between ecosystems are being stressed through the concept of “ecological networks”. Thirdly, there is increasing recognition of the beneficial relationship between access to green space and improved public “health and well-being”. These services and relationships are being linked together in both academic literature and policy practice in what is termed the Green Infrastructure (GI) approach. It is argued that GI networks are discernible at different scales, and across urban, peri-urban and rural landscapes. Furthermore, GI is considered as supportive of ecological processes whilst simultaneously contributing to better human health and well-being. Moreover, especially in urban regions, GI is being placed at the same level as other essential urban infrastructure. Recognising these developments the authors have devised an updated conceptual framework for the development, management, and analysis of GI networks by focusing on contemporary drivers nested together at the territorial level and with a prominent role for temporal considerations. The latter has hitherto been only weakly presented in the GI discourse. Development of the conceptual model has been informed by reference to examples drawn from across Europe. Finally, directions are provided for future research, and for developing and delivering GI in the emerging context of ecosystem services and human well-being.

TI  - Microbiome-mediated effects of habitat fragmentation on native plant performance.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a leading cause of biodiversity and ecosystem function loss in the Anthropocene. Despite the importance of plant-microbiome interactions to ecosystem productivity, we have limited knowledge of how fragmentation affects microbiomes and even less knowledge of its consequences for microbial interactions with plants. Combining field surveys, microbiome sequencing, manipulative experiments, and random forest models, we investigated fragmentation legacy effects on soil microbiomes in imperiled pine rocklands, tested how compositional shifts across 14 fragmentation-altered soil microbiomes affected performance and resource allocation of three native plant species, and identified fragmentation-responding microbial families underpinning plant performance. Legacies of habitat fragmentation were associated with significant changes in microbial diversity and composition (across three of four community axes). Experiments showed plants often strongly benefited from the microbiome's presence, but fragmentation-associated changes in microbiome composition also significantly affected plant performance and resource allocation across all seven metrics examined. Finally, random forest models identified ten fungal and six bacterial families important for plant performance that changed significantly with fragmentation. Our findings not only support the existence of significant fragmentation effects on natural microbiomes, but also demonstrate for the first time that fragmentation-associated changes in microbiomes can have meaningful consequences for native plant performance and investment.

TI  - Landscape Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Natural and Human-Altered Ecosystems
PY  - 2012
AB  - A central challenge to studying emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) is a landscape dilemma: Our best empirical understanding of disease dynamics occurs at local scales, whereas pathogen invasions and management occur over broad spatial extents. The burgeoning field of landscape epidemiology integrates concepts and approaches from disease ecology with the macroscale lens of landscape ecology, enabling examination of disease across spatiotemporal scales in complex environmental settings. We review the state of the field and describe analytical frontiers that show promise for advancement, focusing on natural and human-altered ecosystems. Concepts fundamental to practicing landscape epidemiology are discussed, including spatial scale, static versus dynamic modeling, spatially implicit versus explicit approaches, selection of ecologically meaningful variables, and inference versus prediction. We highlight studies that have advanced the field by incorporating multiscale analyses, landscape connectivity, and dynamic modeling. Future research directions include understanding disease as a component of interacting ecological disturbances, scaling up the ecological impacts of disease, and examining disease dynamics as a coupled human-natural system.

TI  - r.pi: A grass gis package for semi-automatic spatial pattern analysis of remotely sensed land cover data
PY  - 2017
AB  - Analyzing the changing spatial patterns of landscapes due to climate change or anthropogenic impact is important for various disciplines. Land cover change and its resulting modification of spatial patterns in the landscape influence various geographical or ecological parameters. Changing formerly continuous into discontinuous ecosystems due to land cover conversion causes isolated fragments in the landscape. Maintaining the connectivity of a fragmented landscape is relevant for e.g. nutrient cycle, water-runoff or species population persistence. Satellite imagery derived land cover can be used to analyze continuously the changing spatial arrangement of land cover types. However, analyses are computer intensive and require robust and efficient processing routines. We developed a patch-based spatial analysis system (r.pi) integrated natively into a Free and Open Source GIS (GRASS GIS) to be able to analyze large amounts of satellite derived land cover data in a semi-automatic manner, and to ensure high reproducibility and robustness. Various established and newly developed indices for spatial pattern analysis are provided in this program, to derive further meaningful information like spatial configuration, patch irreplaceability or connectivity of fragments based on a dispersal model approach.

TI  - Landscape disturbance models consistently explain variation in ecological integrity across large landscapes
PY  - 2017
AB  - The generally negative effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the quality of habitats for species viability makes it a common focus of conservation assessment and prioritization efforts. Although many available spatial models and metrics (e.g., distance to or density of disturbance) characterize impact patterns of anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape, a general evaluation of model performance against empirical measurements of ecological integrity is lacking. We tested both distance-based and disturbance-density models in relation to ecological indicators. The models included roads, residential and commercial development, agricultural land use, mining, energy development infrastructure, and transmission structures as disturbance sources. Model parameters were based on expert input and results from the published literature. The disturbance models were tested against two disparate and independent measures of habitat quality: a floristic quality index and measures of greater sage-grouse population integrity. Floristic quality scores were significantly lower in vegetation plots closer to disturbances in a general distance-based disturbance model across Colorado. Although the proportion of variation in floristic quality explained by anthropogenic disturbance was relatively low (8.5–11.8%), it appeared to represent a ubiquitous baseline negative effect of proximity to anthropogenic disturbance on the quality of vegetation communities. For both distance- and density-based greater sage-grouse models, modeled disturbance indices were significantly lower (10–12 times) near active than historic leks, and numbers of males counted at leks increased significantly (3.2–3.4 times) as modeled disturbance decreased. Our findings indicate that as a general class, geospatial models can depict effects of anthropogenic disturbance on both plant communities and individual animal species. Empirical validation of disturbance models focused on other species or regions is recommended to further evaluate the utility and reliability of these methods.

TI  - Improving wetland connectivity through the promotion of wet arable land
PY  - 2020
AB  - Modern agricultural practices have rendered habitat scarce and isolated for wetland species throughout the Swiss lowlands. The targeted promotion of practices that embrace wet arable land rather than drain it may be the key to establishing a robust and thriving wetland network. We test the ability of a recently developed national wetness-potential map (WP-map) to predict the spatial distributions of wetland species of open environments (OW-species), and use the map to model dispersal corridors between Switzerland’s protected wetlands. We first defined a set of OW-species by examining the occurrence of wetland species in relation to land cover types across Switzerland. Using Circuitscape, we then validated a cost raster derived from the WP-map by examining the correlation between OW-species presence and areas with a high probability of movement. Finally, we used the cost raster to generate a Swiss-wide map of least-cost corridors. Overall, OW-species were not only more likely to be found within wet zones of the WP-map, but the effect was amplified in well-connected regions. The pattern was strongest amongst fauna, flora, and bryophytes but mostly absent from fungi and lichens. Our resulting corridor map highlights and ranks potential routes between protected wetland sites according to their permeability and centrality, allowing spatially-explicit prioritization of re-wetting initiatives. When combined with its logistical value in identifying suitable areas for the restoration of wet habitat, the WP-map’s ability to explain the dispersal patterns of the very species suitable to these habitats makes it an invaluable tool for land-use planners.

TI  - Environmental and land use determinants of grassland patch diversity in the western and eastern Alps under agro-pastoral abandonment
PY  - 2016
AB  - Agro-pastoral decline in European mountain areas has recently caused changes to traditional landscapes with negative consequences on semi-natural grassland conservation and the associated biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the Italian Alps, grassland patches enclosed in a forest matrix are progressively disappearing. Two alpine valleys (Pesio and Pejo), having similar land-use history, were chosen as representative of management conditions of western and eastern Italian Alps, respectively. This study aims at interpreting the effect of abandonment on grassland patch plant diversity, considering land cover changes of the last 60 years, and assessing the role of ecological, topographic, management and landscape configuration on current grassland species richness. The total area of grassland patches has declined by 54 and 91 % at Pesio and at Pejo, respectively. Actual grassland patch species richness was mostly influenced by ecological factors, such as quantity of light, soil moisture and reaction, then by topographic features, especially slope, and finally by management intensity. Landscape factors exerted a slightly significant effect on plant diversity. In the two valleys, differences on management practices were detected. Even though in the western valley the conservation of several grazing activities contributed to slow down the process of patch reduction, many species-rich grasslands were generally under-grazed. Conversely, in the eastern valley, despite a denser road network, the stronger decline of grassland patch extension was linked to the hay making decline. At the same time, overuse of grassland patches near farms reduced plant species richness. As a conclusion, plant species richness was weakly related to the area of grassland patches and current and historical landscape configuration were of relatively lower importance than ecological, topographic and management factors, when evaluated at patch-level.

TI  - Spatio‐temporal connectivity: assessing the amount of reachable habitat in dynamic landscapes
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary Landscape heterogeneity and habitat connectivity affect species movements, playing an important role in determining the likelihood of species persistence. However, landscape connectivity is usually evaluated using static snap-shots, which do not account for the sequential interactions among habitat patches through time. We developed a network-based model of landscape dynamics, and corresponding connectivity metrics, to account for the reachable habitat across space and time. We illustrate the behaviour of these metrics, using fragmented forested landscapes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We parametrized the models using the dispersal capacities of selected bird and small mammal species. We found that when considering spatio-temporal links, connectivity is estimated to be on average 30% higher (with a maximum of 150% higher) than what is estimated from purely spatial models. This higher degree of spatio-temporal connectivity arises due to connections through temporal stepping-stone patches that appear (habitat gain) and disappear (habitat loss) over time. Species with short dispersal distances (<1000 m) particularly benefited from the spatio-temporal connections. The contribution of spatio-temporal connectivity to habitat reachability increased with higher habitat loss rates. Moreover, it depended on the amount of habitat in the landscape, being higher at intermediate habitat amounts (∼30%). We showed that accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity is critical for understanding ecological patterns and processes in dynamic landscapes, and that a series of purely spatial connectivity metrics underestimates the actual connectivity patterns across time. The proposed spatio-temporal connectivity approach and metrics can be applied to evaluate the effective connectivity patterns and trends in a variety of dynamic landscapes, avoiding the potential overestimates of population isolation and extinction probabilities that may result from widely used purely spatial connectivity models.

TI  - The typology of connectivity in landscape architecture: A review of studies on Landscape Connectivity (LC)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Connectivity is an important landscape characteristic that is essential for health, welfare and aesthetic values in human societies as well as for the protection of native ecosystems. Diversity in objectives, approaches, definitions and methods in studies on connectivity and its widespread use in the field of landscape ecology are reasons why Landscape Connectivity (LC) in landscape architecture has been deemed as the counterpart of Ecological Connectivity leading to neglect of other aspects of this comprehensive concept. This study, reviews and classifies studies carried out in the field of landscape with a focus on connectivity in order to achieve a comprehensive definition of LC and its various components in landscape architecture literature. The research method used in this study was quantitative-qualitative. In the first phase, the literature was collected using library research and internet search via a descriptive-analytical approach. Then, an inductive constructionist strategy using Delphi technique was used to classify and categorize relevant studies, and logical argumentation was used to develop the concept of LC in landscape architecture literature. Finally, the objectivist Descriptive/Synthetic Modelling strategy was used to provide a conceptual model of urban landscape connectivity (ULC). The key finding of this study is the researcher-made conceptual model of ULC, its corresponding components and parameters with the viewpoint of landscape architecture.

TI  - The demographic contributions of connectivity versus local dynamics to population growth of an endangered bird
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conservation and management increasingly focus on connectivity, because connectivity driven by variation in immigration rates across landscapes is thought to be crucial for maintaining local population and metapopulation persistence. Yet, efforts to quantify the relative role of immigration on population growth across the entire range of species and over time have been lacking. We assessed whether immigration limited local and range-wide population growth of the endangered snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) in Florida, USA, over 18 years using multi-state, reverse-time modeling that accounts for imperfect detection of individuals and unobservable states. Demographic contributions of immigration varied depending on the dynamics and geographic position of the local populations, were scale-dependent, and changed over time. By comparing the relative contributions of immigration versus local demography for periods of significant change in local abundance, we found empirical evidence for a disproportionately large role of immigration in facilitating population growth of a centrally-located population-a connectivity 'hub'. The importance of connectivity changed depending of the spatial scale considered, such that immigration was a more important driver of population growth at small versus large spatial scales. Furthermore, the contribution of immigration was much greater during time periods when local population size was small, emphasizing abundance-dependent rescue effects. Our findings suggest that efforts aimed at improving local breeding habitat will likely be most effective at increasing snail kite population growth. More broadly, our results provide much needed information on the role of connectivity for population growth, suggesting that connectivity conservation may have the greatest benefits when efforts focus on centrally located habitat patches and small populations. Furthermore, our results highlight that connectivity is highly dynamic over time and that interpreting the effects of connectivity at local scales may not transfer to region-wide dynamics.

TI  - Linking Landscape Connectivity and Ecosystem Service Provision: Current Knowledge and Research Gaps
PY  - 2013
AB  - Human activities are rapidly changing ecosystems, landscapes and ecosystem service provision, yet there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the spatial ecology of ecosystem services. These gaps hinder our ability to manage landscapes effectively for multiple ecosystem services. In particular, we do not fully understand how changes in landscape connectivity affect ecosystem service provision, despite theory suggesting that connectivity is important. Here, we perform a semi-quantitative review of the literature that investigates how landscape connectivity affects the provision of specific ecosystem services. The vast majority of studies, including reviews, models, and field studies, suggest that decreased connectivity will have negative effects on ecosystem service provision. However, only 15 studies provided empirical evidence of these effects. Average effect sizes from these 15 studies suggest negative effects of connectivity loss on pollination and pest regulation. We identify a number of significant gaps in the connectivity-ecosystem services literature, including: a lack of multiple service studies, which precludes identification of trade-offs between services as connectivity changes; few studies that directly measure organism movement and its effects on ecosystem services; and few empirical studies that investigate the importance of abiotic flows on service provision. We propose that future research should aim to understand how different aspects of connectivity affect ecosystem service provision; which services are most influenced by connectivity; and how connectivity influences how humans access and benefit from ecosystem services. Studies that answer these questions will advance our understanding of connectivity-ecosystem service provision relationships and allow for better ecosystem and landscape management and restoration.

TI  - Maximizing Conservation and Production with Intensive Forest Management: It’s All About Location
PY  - 2015
AB  - Functional zoning has been suggested as a way to balance the needs of a viable forest industry with those of healthy ecosystems. Under this system, part of the forest is set aside for protected areas, counterbalanced by intensive and extensive management of the rest of the forest. Studies indicate this may provide adequate timber while minimizing road construction and favoring the development of large mature and old stands. However, it is unclear how the spatial arrangement of intensive management areas may affect the success of this zoning. Should these areas be agglomerated or dispersed throughout the forest landscape? Should managers prioritize (a) proximity to existing roads, (b) distance from protected areas, or (c) site-specific productivity? We use a spatially explicit landscape simulation model to examine the effects of different spatial scenarios on landscape structure, connectivity for native forest wildlife, stand diversity, harvest volume, and road construction: (1) random placement of intensive management areas, and (2–8) all possible combinations of rules (a)–(c). Results favor the agglomeration of intensive management areas. For most wildlife species, connectivity was the highest when intensive management was far from the protected areas. This scenario also resulted in relatively high harvest volumes. Maximizing distance of intensive management areas from protected areas may therefore be the best way to maximize the benefits of intensive management areas while minimizing their potentially negative effects on forest structure and biodiversity.

TI  - Landscape structure mediates the effects of a stressor on field vole populations
PY  - 2013
AB  - Spatio-temporal landscape heterogeneity has rarely been considered in population-level impact assessments. Here we test whether landscape heterogeneity is important by examining the case of a pesticide applied seasonally to orchards which may affect non-target vole populations, using a validated ecologically realistic and spatially explicit agent-based model. Voles thrive in unmanaged grasslands and untreated orchards but are particularly exposed to applied pesticide treatments during dispersal between optimal habitats. We therefore hypothesised that vole populations do better (1) in landscapes containing more grassland and (2) where areas of grassland are closer to orchards, but (3) do worse if larger areas of orchards are treated with pesticide. To test these hyposeses we made appropriate manipulations to a model landscape occupied by field voles. Pesticide application reduced model population sizes in all three experiments, but populations subsequently wholly or partly recovered. Population depressions were, as predicted, lower in landscapes containing more unmanaged grassland, in landscapes with reduced distance between grassland and orchards, and in landscapes with fewer treated orchards. Population recovery followed a similar pattern except for an unexpected improvement in recovery when the area of treated orchards was increased. Outside the period of pesticide application, orchards increase landscape connectivity and facilitate vole dispersal and so speed population recovery. Overall our results show that accurate prediction of population impact cannot be achieved without taking account of landscape structure. The specifics of landscape structure and habitat connectivity are likely always important in mediating the effects of stressors.

TI  - An exposition of system reliability analysis with an ecological perspective
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract This paper attempts to set the stage for a prospective interplay between ecology and reliability theory concerning the common issues of network connectivity and redundancy. The paper treats the problem of survival reliability which is the probability of successful migration of a specific species from a critical habitat patch to destination habitat patches via heterogeneous imperfect corridors. The paper surveys techniques of system reliability in an ecological setting and contributes methods for computing a new measure of reliability that arises when paths to destination habitat patches share common corridors. Care is taken to ensure that the reliability expressions obtained are as compact as possible and to check them for correctness.

TI  - The conservation corridors of the Benue National Park: Disconnected connection devices?
PY  - 2020
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the viability of wildlife corridors between the Benue National Park and the Faro National Park through the hunting areas, by identifying the main threats to their integrity, mapping of land use, characterization of their flora and the wildlife inventory that frequents these corridors in order to propose measures for their sustainable management. Field observations, land use mapping from the 2016 Landsat 8 image classification, and 60 floristic surveys at six sites (corridors) on 20 m × 20 m plots treated under R resulted in the following results: nine types of activities were identified, including logging, agriculture, grazing and forestry. With ggold panning the main threats to corridors, the species mostly used by these farmers are Piliostigma thonningii (82.674 ± 4.24), Combretum sp. (78.18 ± 4.01) and Tamarindus indica (75.06 ± 3.85) among the most threatened woody species. On the floristic level, vegetations under the influence of anthropic activities present a large number of rejections, a small number of adult stems. The Shannon diversity index varies between 4.30 and 5.07 in all corridors. On the other hand, the index of equitability varies from 0.50 to 0.59. On the faunal plan, 204 individuals, belonging to 12 animal species, grouped into 6 families frequent the corridors. This number is well below what was achieved in 2010 when there was a decrease of 1024 individuals in the corridors, a decrease rate of 83.38%. In the face of these threats, which risk irreversibly damaging the corridors, a restoration and conservation plan for these corridors that will integrate community management based on strengthening the participatory approach is essential. Key words: Corridor, planning, national park, biodiversity, inventory, socio-economic surveys, anthropogenic activities, north.

TI  - Maximizing the ecological contribution of conservation banks
PY  - 2014
AB  - In 1995, California established the first conservation banking program in the United States to provide a new financial mechanism to conserve wildlife and natural communities in rapidly developing regions. Conservation banks are lands protected and managed for conservation of species of concern. Developers may purchase species credits from a conservation bank to offset adverse impacts of development at another site. Conservation banks facilitate pooling of mitigation resources from multiple development projects to protect planned habitat reserves of greater ecological value than can be achieved with project-byproject mitigation. In this study, we conducted the first ever assessment of the ecological performance of the California Conservation Banking Program. Specifically, we investigated to what extent conservation banks contribute to achieving regional conservation objectives.We hypothesized that conservation banks within a region should have similarly high ecological values if they are appropriately evaluated and prioritized based on principles of conservation planning. We created a new ecological value metric to evaluate and rank conservation banks and used it to compare potential conservation banks or reserves within a region. We found the ecological value of banks within regions varied and concluded that maximizing the ecological contribution of conservation banks requires prioritization of lands for potential bank sites and reserves. Our analysis identified circumstances where conservation banking is not an appropriate mitigation mechanism to protect rare species and natural communities. We concluded that limited funding for conservation planning should be directed toward regions where species of concern are wide-ranging, biodiversity is highly variable, threats to species of concern are highly varied, and there are many potential conservation bank sites. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

TI  - Landscape Composition Weakly Affects Home Range Size in Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Landscape composition and habitat quality influence the abundance, population structure, and movements of animals. Understanding how an animal interacts with elements of the landscape helps predict its response to habitat loss and changes in land cover. We tested the hypothesis that the extent of movement depends on landscape composition in a threatened freshwater turtle, Emydoidea blandingii. We measured habitat composition at multiple spatial scales, ranging from the home range to the landscape scale. We built multiple linear regression models to predict home range size from the proportional use of 5 land-use categories, while controlling for intrinsic factors (sex, body size). We found that landscape composition significantly influenced home range size in the Blanding's turtle; however, the models explained a low proportion of the observed variation in home range size, meaning that landscape composition had a weak effect on movement. Our results also suggest that sex and body size have little influence on home range size in Blanding's turtles. More research is needed to determine the factors driving movement in this species, and overall, we recommend cautious use of models predicting space use as a function of landscape composition in a conservation context. Keywords: Blanding's turtle, conservation, habitat loss, home range, landscape composition, movement modelling. Resume : La composition du paysage et la qualite d'habitat influencent l'abondance, la structure et les deplacements des populations animales. Comprendre l'interaction entre une espece et son environnement permet de predire sa reponse a la perte d'habitat et aux changements dans la composition du paysage. Nous avons etudie la relation entre la composition du paysage et l'etendue des deplacements chez Emydoidea blandingii, une tortue d'eau douce au statut menace. Nous avons mesure la composition de l'habitat a plusieurs echelles spatiales, allant du domaine vital a l'echelle du paysage. Nous avons construit des modeles de regression lineaire multiple afin de predire la taille du domaine vital a partir des proportions de 5 types d'habitats, en controlant pour le sexe et la taille des animaux. Nos resultats montrent que la composition du paysage influence significativement la taille du domaine vital chez la tortue mouchetee. Par contre, les modeles ne predisaient qu'une faible proportion de la variation observee dans la taille des domaines vitaux, suggerant que la composition du paysage a peu d'influence sur les deplacements. Nos resultats suggerent egalement que la taille corporelle et le sexe influencent peu la taille du domaine vital chez la tortue mouchetee. Des recherches supplementaires seront necessaires afin d'identifier les facteurs determinants dans les deplacements de l'espece. De facon generale, nous recommandons l'utilisation prudente des modeles predisant l'utilisation du territoire en fonction de la composition du paysage dans un contexte de conservation.

TI  - Prioritizing Urban Habitats for Connectivity Conservation: Integrating Centrality and Ecological Metrics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Connectivity among fragmented areas of habitat has long been acknowledged as important for the viability of biological conservation, especially within highly modified landscapes. Identifying important habitat patches in ecological connectivity is a priority for many conservation strategies, and the application of 'graph theory' has been shown to provide useful information on connectivity. Despite the large number of metrics for connectivity derived from graph theory, only a small number have been compared in terms of the importance they assign to nodes in a network. This paper presents a study that aims to define a new set of metrics and compares these with traditional graph-based metrics, used in the prioritization of habitat patches for ecological connectivity. The metrics measured consist of "topological" metrics, "ecological metrics," and "integrated metrics," Integrated metrics are a combination of topological and ecological metrics. Eight metrics were applied to the habitat network for the fat-tailed dunnart within Greater Melbourne, Australia. A non-directional network was developed in which nodes were linked to adjacent nodes. These links were then weighted by the effective distance between patches. By applying each of the eight metrics for the study network, nodes were ranked according to their contribution to the overall network connectivity. The structured comparison revealed the similarity and differences in the way the habitat for the fat-tailed dunnart was ranked based on different classes of metrics. Due to the differences in the way the metrics operate, a suitable metric should be chosen that best meets the objectives established by the decision maker.

TI  - River fragmentation increases localized population genetic structure and enhances asymmetry of dispersal in bullhead (Cottus gobio)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Man-made habitat fragmentation is a major concern in river ecology and is expected to have particularly detrimental effects on aquatic species with limited dispersal abilities, like the bullhead (Cottus gobio). We used ten microsatellite markers to investigate small-scale patterns of gene flow, current dispersal and neutral genetic diversity in a morphologically diverse river where fragmented and unfragmented sections could be compared. We found high genetic differentiation between sampling sites with a maximum F ST of 0.32 between sites separated by only 35 km. A significant increase of genetic differentiation with geographical distance was observed in the continuous river section as well as in the full dataset which included headwater populations isolated by anthropogenic barriers. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that such barriers completely block upstream movement while downstream dispersal may be little affected. In the unfragmented habitat, dispersal rates were also higher in the direction of water flow than against it. The resulting asymmetry in gene flow likely contributes to the decrease of genetic variation observed from the lower reaches towards the headwaters, which is particularly pronounced in physically isolated populations. Our findings suggest that headwater populations, due to their isolation and low genetic variation, may be particularly vulnerable to extinction.

TI  - Influence of land-use/land-cover change on landscape connectivity for an endemic threatened amphibian (Argenteohyla siemersi pederseni, Anura: Hylidae)
PY  - 2020
AB  - Modifications in natural landcover generally result in a loss of habitat availability for wildlife and it’s persistence will depend largely on their spatial configuration and functional connections. Argenteohyla siemersi is a threatened and endemic amphibian whose habitat is composed of forest patches near rivers and water bodies edges. This study aimed to analyse the accessible habitat for this species and identify key elements to maintain its ecological network in two different types of land uses: an anthropized area with extensive cattle raising and a protected area. The structural and functional characteristics of both landscapes were analyzed. The connectivity at landscape level and the contribution of each habitat patch were evaluated through simulation models with different dispersion distances in the context of the graph theory. In both landscapes, nine types of landcover were identified with different compositions. Remarkable differences were found in habitat connectivity for this amphibian species between both landscapes. As the percentage of dispersion distance increases, reachable habitat increases as well, although with higher percentages in the protected area. Two corridors were identified in the protected landscape and one in the rangeland one; patches and key links constituted all of them. The present work provides spatially explicit results with a quantitative basis. It could be useful as a tool for the development of management plans aimed at guaranteeing the functionality of the ecological network for this endangered species and, therefore, contribute to its long-term conservation.

TI  - Distribution patterns and niche segregation of three closely related Japanese ephemerid mayflies: a re-examination of each species’ habitat from “megadata” held in the “National Census on River Environments”
PY  - 2021
AB  - Changes in river environments due to elevation gradients have a great impact on living organisms. In particular, with respect to aquatic insects, it has been recognized that even in closely related species there is a tendency for species to be replaced between upstream and downstream environments. Such a distribution tendency has also been suggested for the three species of the genus Ephemera of interest in this study. We used the “Megadata” on the distribution of each Ephemera mayfly species and comprehensively analyzed habitat information, GIS and data on multiple environmental factors. As a result, it became clear that environmental factors closely related to the altitudinal gradient were closely related to the distribution patterns of three Ephemera mayflies. In addition, we simulated how their distribution areas have changed due to Quaternary climate change cycles using the software MAXENT. Although it was revealed that there were niche differentiations within the three Ephemera mayflies, there were overlaps in their respective preferred niche widths. Therefore, it is considered that the distribution pattern of the three Ephemera mayflies according to the altitudinal gradient represents mild niche differentiation, and also slight inter-species competition.

TI  - Ecological Corridor Construction Based on Least-Cost Modeling Using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Light Data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anthropic pressure is one of the main drivers of landscape change and biodiversity loss. Artificial nighttime light, which can affect species behavior, is an important human-induced threat to biodiversity, but it is often ignored in ecological connectivity research. To mitigate the adverse impacts of artificial lighting on biodiversity, this study integrates artificial nighttime light in landscape ecology and analyzes the influence of artificial nighttime light on landscape connectivity. A quantitative approach integrating nighttime light brightness from a Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is proposed to estimate the matrix resistance, which can identify the sensitive areas that are disrupted by nighttime light. It was found that the nightscape in the study area is significantly disrupted by nighttime light and the matrix resistance in the center of the study area significantly increases. Compared to the least-cost routes from the NDVI, the “dark” least-cost ecological corridors constructed using our approach apparently change in both location and distance. The corridors moved to the outer suburbs and rural areas, and the maximum increase in distance of the least-cost paths was 37.94%. Due to less disturbance from human activity and the maintenance of a pristine nightscape, “dark” ecological corridors can reduce the adverse effects of night lights and contribute to biodiversity. However, natural habitats have been greatly affected by nighttime light with the increase in global illumination, and it is essential that we improve public awareness of light pollution and formulate light-reduction policies and legislation.

TI  - Evaluating connectivity and ecological linkages between Perth’s protected areas to support biodiversity
PY  - 2020
AB  - While protected areas in urban environments provide island refuges for species survival within a hostile urban matrix, linkages between them are necessary to sustain biodiversity. This is especially important for cities such as Perth situated in Western Australia’s global ‘biodiversity hotspot’, where there is high species richness with many now endangered. This research estimated the degree of connectivity for ‘formal’ and ‘semi-formal’ protected area networks of the Perth and Peel region of WA. Four metrics providing alternative patch and landscape level perspectives were used to estimate and validate the degree of connectivity. Least-cost path modelling was then used to identify effective placement of ecological linkages for species of different dispersal capabilities, testing a range of ecological distance thresholds (EDT) between 50-1500m. Connectivity between protected areas within the region was low. For example, connectivity for species with an EDT of 1500m, such as the threatened Calyptorhynchus latirostris, was at ~0.0005 (range 0-1) for formally protected areas, increasing to 0.0016 when ‘semi-formal’ areas were included, and much lower for lower EDTs. The importance of ‘semi-formal’ areas (especially Bush Forever sites) in connectivity was further highlighted with the number of isolated protected areas dropping from 50% to 25% at 50m EDT and the number of protected areas within the largest linked network increasing from ~25% to ~80% at 1000m EDT, when they were included. This lack of connectivity highlights the need of biodiversity conservation planning decisions to be based on ecological information that enhances species movement. The least-cost path modelling identified routes of potential ecological linkages between protected areas through the urban matrix. Analysis of these detailed maps highlighted a suite of strategies to enhance connectivity, including where to break barriers to movement, enhance green spaces, and provide protection for native vegetation. This provides a resource to enable land managers and planners to make appropriate biodiversity conservation actions.

TI  - The challenge of assaying landscape connectivity in a changing world: A 27-year case study in the southern Great Plains (USA) playa network
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Many habitat resources fluctuate in availability due to natural environmental variability and anthropogenic influences. These fluctuations pose challenges to organisms attempting to move from one habitat patch to another, and also pose challenges to detecting and managing factors impacting landscape connectivity. Our understanding of these relationships is further hampered by lack of precedence on how to quantify dynamic connectivity. The ephemeral freshwater wetlands of the southern Great Plains of the USA (playas) form a dynamic habitat network that serves as a case study of these challenges and allows us to propose a suite of connectivity metrics to monitor changes in network topology and evaluate the management importance of individual wetlands. We used satellite imagery to examine inundation patterns of >7000 playas in a 29,083 km2 portion of Texas on 80 dates from 1984 to 2011. Based on historic locations of playa basins, approximately 85% of playas (particularly those ≤10 ha) have lost the capacity to hold water even during regionally wet times, resulting in a ∼69% reduction of surface water area. These losses were associated with proximity to cropland, with total cropland acreage increasing by 0.07–17.34% of county land area during our focal time span in 10 of the 14 counties in our study area. We examined connectivity at wetland and whole-network scales to determine effects of playa losses on network topology and thus on connectivity. We evaluated 11 metrics for this purpose, which quantified the number of wet playas present on each date, their degree of connectedness, their clustering, path redundancy within the network, overall network topology, the importance of individual playas in various roles, and the size of a single playa that would provide equivalent connectivity (amount of reachable habitat) as in the actual network. Topology has thinned over the past three decades with playa losses, reflected in increasing graph density, average path length, degree of connectivity for highly linked hubs, and average number of cutpoints. Similarly, graph diameter is currently less than half of the historic potential maximum, and the equivalent connected area has declined by over 23% since 1984 (and by over 82% relative to historic values). These patterns suggest that path redundancy through the network has declined such that dispersers currently have fewer connectivity options compared to a few decades ago. Relatively high transitivity scores indicate that the playa network is still populated with a large (but diminishing) number of wetlands, and the dwindling surface water present in the remaining playas is not compensating for playa losses over time. Average coalescence distances are currently higher than the dispersal capacity of many organisms, meaning that the playa network is fragmented such that only an extremely vagile disperser (capable of moving at least 18–45 km) would be able to traverse the landscape via the remaining wetlands, even if all were wet simultaneously. These findings illustrate the importance of using multiple indicators in assaying dynamic connectivity and provides a framework of possible metrics to use for monitoring and assessment of any dynamic habitat network.

TI  - Green and blue infrastructure design in a semi-arid region
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a new approach for dealing with biodiversity conservation based on maintaining the ecological networks by ensuring the survival of animal and plant species. GBI is considered a new public policy to avoid the loss of biodiversity by preserving landscape connectivity and protecting natural habitats from fragmentation. Countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Japan, China, Brazil, and Turkey are seeking to integrate this concept into their environmental policies. This study proposed a methodology to design a GBI at a regional scale applied to the Sousse region in Tunisia. Two main approaches were used. The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them. This methodological approach and the characterization of the Sousse city GBI map represent the first innovative research applied in Tunisia. This prototype can be a reference for other local or regional spaces, contributing toward realizing a national GBI and promoting sustainable projects.</jats:p>

TI  - Emerging concepts in temporary‐river ecology
PY  - 2010
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Temporary rivers and streams are among the most common and most hydrologically dynamic freshwater ecosystems. The number of temporary rivers and the severity of flow intermittence may be increasing in regions affected by climatic drying trends or water abstraction. Despite their abundance, temporary rivers have been historically neglected by ecologists. A recent increase in temporary-river research needs to be supported by new models that generate hypotheses and stimulate further research. In this article, we present three conceptual models that address spatial and temporal patterns in temporary-river biodiversity and biogeochemistry. 2. Temporary rivers are characterised by the repeated onset and cessation of flow, and by complex hydrological dynamics in the longitudinal dimension. Longitudinal dynamics, such as advancing and retreating wetted fronts, hydrological connections and discon- nections, and gradients in flow permanence, influence biotic communities and nutrient and organic matter processing. 3. The first conceptual model concerns connectivity between habitat patches. Variable connectivity suggests that the metacommunity and metapopulation concepts are applicable in temporary rivers. We predict that aggregations of local communities in the isolated water bodies of temporary rivers function as metacommunities. These metacom- munities may become longitudinally nested due to interspecific differences in dispersal and mortality. The metapopulation concept applies to some temporary river species, but not all. In stable metapopulations, rates of local extinction are balanced by recolonisation. However, extinction and recolonisation in many temporary-river species are decoupled by frequent disturbances, and populations of these species are usually expanding or contracting. 4. The second conceptual model predicts that large-scale biodiversity varies as a function of aquatic and terrestrial patch dynamics and water-level fluctuations. Habitat mosaics in temporary rivers change in composition and configuration in response to inundation and drying, and these changes elicit a range of biotic responses. In the model, aquatic biodiversity initially increases directly with water level due to increasing abundance of aquatic patches. When most of the channel is inundated and most aquatic patches are connected, further increases in aquatic habitat and connectivity cause aquatic biodiversity to decline due to community homogenisation and reduced habitat diversity.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing and Species Distribution Modelling to Assess Pinus hartwegii Response to Climate Change and Land Use from Izta-Popo National Park, Mexico
PY  - 2021
AB  - A detailed analysis of distribution shifts in Pinus hartwegii Lindl. is provided across time for Izta-Popo National Park (Mexico). Combining satellite images, species distribution models, and connectivity analysis we disentangled the effect of climate change and anthropogenic land use on the habitat availability. Twenty-four Maxent habitat suitability models with varying complexity were combined with insights on vegetation and land cover change derived from two Landsat satellite images at 30-m resolution from 1993 and 2013. To evaluate effects of climate change on Izta-Popo’s P. hartwegii forest, projections for future climatic conditions (averaged for 2050 and 2070) were derived using two General Circulation Models under three Representative CO2 concentration pathways (RCPs). Calculated fragmentation and connectivity indexes (Equivalent Connected Area and Probability of Connectivity metrics) showed significant habitat loss and habitat fragmentation that weakens P. hartwegii dispersion flux and the strength of connections. Projections of future climate conditions showed a reduction of P. hartwegii habitat suitability as populations would have to migrate to higher altitudes. However, the impact of anthropogenic land use change documented over the 20 years masks the predicted impact of climate change in Izta-Popo National Park.

TI  - Contribution of habitat type to residency and dispersal choices by overwintered and summer adult Colorado potato beetles
PY  - 2015
AB  - The walking and flight dispersal of marked overwintered and summer Colorado potato beetles (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), released in field box-plots was monitored simultaneously in six habitats over a period of 4 days. The emigration out of plots by walking beetles was calculated from the catch in linear pitfall traps completely surrounding each box-plot and emigration flight was estimated from the number of beetles missing from the plot or captured by the trap. Overwintered beetles dispersed sooner after release than summer beetles. Overall, the mean number of beetles retained by the habitat was significantly higher in the host habitat (potato) than in any non-host habitat tested (soybean, pasture, bare ground, water, woodland). Unexpectedly, there was no or little difference in overall beetle retention between non-host habitats except for higher retention in the water habitat. No difference in the ratio of flight over walking could be detected by the study between overwintered and summer CPB except in the water and woodland habitats. Twenty-four hours after release, the highest ratios were obtained in the water and woodland habitats and the lowest in the bare-ground habitat, but ratios were similar for all habitats, except water, after 96 h. As a population, under these experimental conditions, 96 h after release, it seems that CPB displayed a slight preference for flight over walking, with walking as a default mode. A fed and starved pre-release treatment had no effect on dispersal rates or mode of dispersal. Essentially, our results showed that over a 96-h period, northeastern North American CPB emigrated at similar rates from the various non-host habitats encountered, except for water, using walking as much as flight. The host habitat retained CPB significantly longer than non-host habitats but with a mode of dispersal ratio similar to that in non-host habitats. The impact on dispersal of the various habitats encountered by CPB in the agro-ecosystem was less important than expected suggesting that the interaction of environmental parameters is likely to have the most significant impact in determining dispersal rates and dispersal modes.

TI  - Connectivity metrics for conservation planning and monitoring
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Conservation plans increasingly include goals to maintain a connected network. For example, planners might design a linkage between two conserved areas, or the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity might set targets for a well-connected system of protected areas for each nation. Here we describe 35 metrics that can quantify connectivity of focal patches or of networks and monitor changes over time in an ecoscape (landscape or seascape). The connectivity metrics fall into four categories: (1) structural connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-nonspecific spatial functions, (2) connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-specific population sizes and dispersal functions (3) metrics derived from multi-state maps and species responses to those states, and (4) metrics of functional connectivity reflecting observed flow of organisms or genes. We provide a decision tree to select which of these metrics are most appropriate for a given conservation goal and broad ecoscape context. Functional connectivity metrics may be preferred if conservation is focused on particular species or if data are available to parameterize models for a suite of species that represent needs of the focal biota. However, with climate change, ecoscapes need to facilitate movements of all species that need to adapt by shifting their ranges. Because an intact network of relatively natural areas may support movement for many species, structural metrics that consider the human footprint should be used in all coarse filter approximations of functional connectivity in shared ecoscapes.

TI  - Quantifying landscape connectivity through the use of connectivity response curves
PY  - 2014
AB  - Habitat connectivity is an essential component of biodiversity conservation. Simulated landscapes were manipulated to quantify the impact of changes to the amount, fragmentation and dispersion of habitat on a widely applied landscape connectivity metric, the probability of connectivity index. Index results for different landscape scenarios were plotted against the dispersal distances used for their calculation to create connectivity response curves for each scenario. Understanding index response to controlled changes in landscape structure at a range of spatial scales can be used to give context to comparison of alternative landscape management scenarios. Increased amounts of habitat, decreased fragmentation and decreased inter-patch distances resulted in increased connectivity index values. Connectivity response curves demonstrated increases in assessed connectivity for scenarios with continuous corridors or “stepping stone” connectors. The sensitivity of connectivity response curves to controlled changes in landscape structure indicate that this approach is able to detect and distinguish between different types of landscape changes, but that delineation of habitat and method of quantifying dispersal probability incorporate assumptions that must be recognized when interpreting results to guide landscape management. Representing landscape connectivity in this manner allows for the impacts of alternative landscape management strategies to be compared visually through comparative plots, or statistically through the parameters that describe connectivity response curves.

TI  - Outline of a Market for Ecological Connectivity
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper presents some preliminary thinking about a possible market for ecological connectivity. A recent article in the journal Nature identified the world’s biodiversity loss as far exceeding humanity’s safe level. Other work has identified ecological connectivity – the ability of species to move across land – as critical for biodiversity. The paper starts with a short literature review on ecological connectivity. This paper then explores one idea for using a market to improve ecological connectivity. The ecological value of connecting two regions can depend on whether regions are connected to other regions. Consequently, the problem will need to be solved with an integer program. This paper explores how such a combinatorial market might be operated. The market should incentivise relevant parties, such as government agencies and farms, to implement specific changes to roads and other barriers to wildlife, to improve ecological connectivity within a given budget. Finally, the paper briefly examines the rights associated with ecological connectivity. Ideally, users would trade with each other, rather than simply have an expensive government procurement. But this will require an enormous change in mindset, and the nature of the tradable rights is highly complicated.

TI  - Biodiversity Assessment: moving towards an evidence-based index for biodiversity offsetting
PY  - 2016
AB  - Biodiversity offsetting is a mechanism for providing physical compensation to redress losses to species and habitats caused by development projects. As offsetting becomes more widespread, so has the evolution and development of frameworks, tools and methodological approaches for assessing biodiversity and implementing offsets. In this context and with a specific focus on assessment methodology this research takes a scientific and pragmatic approach to bridge the gap between empirical approaches to biodiversity assessment and the practical, often subjective, methods used by practitioners. Although commonalities among methodologies exist, systematically reviewing the state of the art, revealed a complicated situation which would benefit from methodological standardisation. The challenge of determining which components of biodiversity should be assessed by a standardised approach was informed with data gained through a survey that questioned biodiversity practitioners on which criteria and attributes they considered the most important indicators of biodiversity value. Results of an extensive field study of three habitat types are reported and the new data are employed; (a) to examine the sensitivity of a metric proposed for pilot offsets in England, and (b) to develop a novel multi-metric index with potential for wide use in biodiversity offsetting. From an array of forty five metrics a reduced index was produced which conveys information from measurements pertaining to four important biodiversity components. The new index is objective, relatively quick to produce, replicable and scientifically defensible. Compatible with existing frameworks the new index comprises information practitioners would expect to see i.e. biodiversity data (beta-diversity), temporal risk, (time to maturity) habitat rarity and structural connectivity. It can reliably provide a measure of value to biodiversity, inform spatial planning decisions, generate data for monitoring and aid the comparison of two or more sites of similar habitat. In concluding, the thesis discusses practical limitations of the index and, more generally, limitations for biodiversity offsetting.

TI  - Trait-specific effects of habitat isolation on carabid species richness and community composition in managed grasslands
PY  - 2010
AB  - . 1. Isolation of natural and semi-natural habitats, a consequence of increasing management intensification, has been identified as a major threat to the diversity of many taxa in agricultural landscapes. Yet, it is increasingly apparent that the effects of habitat isolation vary not only among distantly but also closely related taxa, depending on their respective ecological traits. 2. We studied the effects of habitat isolation on carabid beetles with different dispersal potential in common perennial grasslands. The grasslands belonged to three isolation classes: (i) situated in a continuous belt of grasslands, (ii) in an arable matrix but connected to the continuous belt via corridors or (iii) completely isolated in the arable matrix. 3. Neither total carabid species richness nor richness of carabids with high dispersal potential was affected by habitat isolation. In contrast, richness of carabid species with low dispersal potential was more than two times lower in isolated than in continuous grasslands. Communities of isolated sites were characterised by species with high dispersal potential whereas species with low dispersal potential were associated with continuous or well connected grasslands. 4. Our results revealed trait-specific responses of carabids to habitat isolation and highlight the need for considering these differences when predicting effects of landscape structure on carabid diversity. Grassy corridors seemed to assist the dispersal of carabids with low dispersal potential, thereby allowing these species to persist also in non-continuous but connected habitats. Thus, corridors represent a suitable measure to maintain the diversity of carabids in spatially structured grasslands in agricultural landscapes.

Here, we review ongoing developments in connectivity science, providing perspectives on recent advances in identifying, quantifying, modelling and analysing connectivity, and highlight new applications for conservation. We also address ongoing challenges for connectivity research, explore opportunities for addressing them and highlight potential linkages with other fields of research. Continued development of connectivity science will provide insights into key aspects of ecology and the evolution of species, and will also contribute significantly towards achieving more effective conservation outcomes.

TI  - Grasshopper response to reductions in habitat area as mediated by subfamily classification and life history traits
PY  - 2010
AB  - Although the loss of species is often attributed to reductions in habitat area, heterogeneity and connectivity, species specific traits and taxonomic relatedness can be important in explaining which species groups may be most impacted by the fragmentation process. In this study, using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae, Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size, dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time) explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially, with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and mixed-feeders, respectively). Species that differed in body size and dispersal ability did not display differential responses to reductions in habitat area.

TI  - Estimating natural landscape changes from 1992 to 2030 in the conterminous US
PY  - 2010
AB  - Quantifying landscape dynamics is a central goal of landscape ecology, and numerous metrics have been developed to measure the influence of human activities on natural landscapes. Composite scores that characterize human modifications to landscapes have gained widespread use. A parsimonious alternative is to estimate the proportion of a cover type (i.e. natural) within a spatial neighborhood to characterize both compositional and structural aspects of natural landscapes. Here I extend this approach into a multi-scale, integrated metric and apply it to national datasets on land cover, housing density, road existence, and highway traffic volume to measure the dynamics of natural landscapes in the conterminous US. Roughly one-third of the conterminous US (2.6 million km2) in 1992 was classified as human-dominated. By 2001 this expanded by 80,800 km2, and forecasted residential growth by 2030 will potentially lead to an additional loss of up to 92,200 km2. Wetland cover types were particularly affected. The natural landscapes metric developed here provides a simple, robust measure of landscape dynamics that has a direct physical interpretation related to proportion of natural habitat affected at a location, represents landscapes as a gradient of conditions rather predicated on patch/matrix definition, and measures the spatial context of natural areas.

TI  - Using forest history and spatial patterns to identify potential high conservation value forests in Romania
PY  - 2013
AB  - Naturally dynamic forests have a high proportion of biotopes with old large trees, diverse vertical and horizontal structure at multiple scales, and much dead wood. As such, they provide habitat to species and ecosystem processes that forests managed for wood production cannot provide to the same degree. Whether termed old-growth, ancient, virgin, intact, primeval or continuity forests, a major challenge and need is to map such potential high conservation value forest for subsequent inclusion in functional habitat networks for biodiversity conservation in forest landscapes. Given that the delivery time of natural forest properties is much longer than of industry wood, we explore the usefulness of using historical maps to identify forests that have been continuously present for 220 years (potential old-growth) versus 140 years (potential aging forest) in a case study in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains (see Online Resource 1). While the total forest cover increased by 35 % over the past two centuries, the area of potential aging and potential old-growth forest declined by 56 and 34 %, respectively. Spatial modelling of edge effects and patch size for virtual species with different requirements indicated an even greater decrease in the area of functional habitat networks of old-growth and ageing forest. Our analyses show that compared to simple mapping of potential high conservation forests, the area of functional habitat patches is severely overestimated, and caution is needed when estimating the area of potential high conservation value forests that form functional habitat networks, i.e. a green infrastructure. In addition, the landscape and regional scale connectivity of patches needs to be considered. We argue that the use of historical maps combined with assessment of spatial patterns is an effective tool for identifying and analyzing potential high conservation value forests in a landscape context.

TI  - Urban Wastelands’ Contribution to Ecological Connectivity
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban wastelands can play a significant role in habitat continuity in fragmented landscapes such as cities, as they can act as stepping-stones for urban green networks that should be considered in ecological planning. This study aims to characterize urban wasteland contributions to the green network in two urban areas in France by studying their structural connectivity, to test the link between urbanization and wasteland plant communities, and to assess the extent that potential connectivity is considered in ecological planning. We suggest that spatial proximity, and especially urban similarity, influence wasteland plant communities: increasingly different urban characteristics result in increasingly dissimilar plant communities. We also show that plant community diversity is influenced by urban characteristics: plant communities are more similar in low urbanization contexts and more diversified in highly urbanized areas. The comparison between potential wasteland connectivity mapped at the city scale and the current ecological plan shows that urban wasteland potentialities for ecological connectivity are considered in ecological planning. In addition to integrating specific urban areas in ecological mapping, green networks should consider the importance of temporary spaces of nature, such as wastelands, since their spatiotemporal dynamics may contribute greatly to biodiversity conservation within cities.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Nesse trabalho, estudamos fatores determinantes da ocorrencia de onca-pintada (Panthera onca) em uma paisagem fragmentada com implicacoes para o delineamento e manejo de corredores ecologicos. No primeiro capitulo, avaliamos o efeito espacialmente estruturado da riqueza de presas naturais sobre a ocorrencia de onca-pintada e de predacao dessa sobre rebanhos bovinos, bem como a influencia da cobertura vegetal sobre esses processos. Nossos resultados mostram que a ocorrencia da onca-pintada e fortemente explicada pela riqueza de suas presas e pelo componente espacial, mostrando que a riqueza de presas aumenta a qualidade do local e que o contagio age de forma positiva para a especie. A predacao de rebanho domestico, por sua vez, nao possui um componente espacial significativo, estando diretamente relacionada a abundância do predador. Por ultimo, destacamos a ausencia de efeito da cobertura vegetal sobre a riqueza de presas e predacao de rebanho domestico. No segundo capitulo, avaliamos o efeito do isolamento e area de fragmentos naturais, da intensidade da agricultura e da estrutura espacial sobre a probabilidade de ocorrencia da oncapintada. Verificamos que a agricultura pode ser considerada uma barreira de dispersao para a onca-pintada e a existencia de contagio na distribuicao dessa especie. Outro resultado sugere que a presenca de pelo menos um fragmento grande alem de outros menores, aumenta a probabilidade de ocorrencia da onca. Esses resultados mostram que a especie e eficiente em colonizar manchas de vegetacao natural e que stepping stones podem ser usados em estrategias de conservacao para manter ou restabelecer conectividade em uma paisagem para a onca-pintada.

TI  - Genetic population structure of the grass snake (Natrix natrix) in human-altered landscapes in Switzerland
PY  - NA
AB  - Both the conversion of natural habitats to farmland and efforts at increasing the yield of existing crops contribute to a decline in biodiversity. As a consequence of land conversion, specialised species are restricted to remnants of original habitat patches, which are frequently isolated. This may lead to a genetic differentiation of the subpopulations. A lack of gene flow may also result in genetically impoverished subpopulations increasing the risk of local extinction. Highly variable genetic markers, like microsatellites, can be used to investigate genetic differences among subpopulations. The grass snake (Natrix natrix) primarily feeds on amphibians and is therefore associated with wetlands. As a result of pronounced changes in land use, the area actually occupied by the grass snake in Switzerland is restricted to remnants of pristine habitats and the populations are declining in many regions. A few years ago, microsatellite markers were not available for the grass snake. Therefore, six microsatellite markers were developed for the grass snake (N. natrix) and three microsatellite markers of the dice snake (Natrix tessellata) were checked for cross-amplification. These microsatellite loci were used to examine the genetic structure of grass snakes sampled in remnants of pristine habitat embedded in an intensively used agricultural landscape and in a former floodplain in the Swiss lowlands, as well as in a rural valley in the Bernese Alps. The three study areas were 30–100 km apart, but were interconnected by the river Aare. At the local scale, no genetic differentiation was found in either of the N. natrix populations inhabiting the intensively used agricultural area or the rural alpine valley. However, two subpopulations in the former wetland area were genetically differentiated as indicated by a low but significant FST-value. This slight genetic differentiation can be explained by isolation by distance. At the regional scale, significant genetic differentiation between N. natrix populations inhabiting the three study areas was found. The genetic structure was highly related to isolation by distance with 85% of the among-population genetic variance explained only by the geographical distance between subpopulations. The present findings indicate regular gene flow between N. natrix subpopulations. Human activity and habitat alteration do not seem to reduce significantly the movements of grass snakes. These results suggest that conservation actions in landscapes altered by humans should focus on the maintenance of a habitat mosaic with anuran breeding ponds and adequate oviposition sites. Another aspect of this thesis was to investigate the occurrence and frequency of multiple paternity in the grass snake as a source of genetic diversity. Males can enhance their reproductive success through mating with multiple females. For females, however, one mating is usually sufficient to inseminate all their ova. Females may benefit from multiple mating by producing genetically more diverse offspring, and by having the opportunity to choose sperm of the genetically most compatible male. The frequency of multiple paternity was assessed in 11 clutches of the grass snake using the microsatellite markers. Two and more fathers were found to sire offspring in 27% of the clutches using a very conservative estimate. However, based on a maximum likelihood, multiple paternity occurred in 91% of the clutches with 2–5 contributing males per clutch. This is the first study demonstrating multiple paternity in a European natricine, with a frequency similar to those found in new world natricines. To sum up, this thesis demonstrated that the genetic variability in grass snake populations is maintained by regular gene flow between subpopulations, and through multiple mating by females resulting in multiple paternity.

TI  - Landscape Metrics: Past Progress and Future Directions
PY  - 2017
AB  - This paper reviews progress in the field of landscape ecology related to the development of landscape metrics (i.e., spatial pattern indices). We first review the major formative historical developments that contributed to the coalescence of landscape metrics as a sub-field of landscape ecology and then examine recent literature highlighting several shortcomings related to their utility for understanding ecological processes and discuss several alternative approaches. Recent research recognizes some limitations of the patch-mosaic model (PMM), including the landscape metrics based on it, for capturing landscape heterogeneity and measuring functionality. Collapsing land cover information into nominal classes complicates identification of ecologically meaningful relationships and effective management. We explore several alternative methods for capturing landscape functionality and spatial heterogeneity including graph-based networks and gradient surface models with associated surface metrics. With complementary patch-based, gradient, and graph network models available, the goal for landscape ecologists is to select the correct approach, or combination of approaches, for investigating the issue at hand. Biases associated with the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and its connection to heterogeneity and scale—both grain and extent—complicate these decisions, but empirical tools from spatial allometry may improve the ability for landscape ecologists to assess where metrics are capturing ecological processes versus the scale-dependency of the metrics themselves.

TI  - Evaluating resilience for the management of social–ecological production landscapes and seascapes in Lefke Region of North Cyprus through adaptive comanagement
PY  - 2018
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate resilience for the management of social–ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS) in Lefke Region of North Cyprus through adaptive comanagement (ACM). To this end, the following key attributes of ACM within the context of resilient landscape management were evaluated: diversity of social learning approaches, stakeholders and social networks, the role of traditional knowledge in management, effectiveness of the existing institutions for landscape conservation and management and potential policy responses for building and strengthening the landscape resilience. The method of the study comprised: development of an ACM evaluation framework for the SEPLS, exploration of the potential indicators for assessing the resilience, data collection with the semi-structured interviews and data evaluation. The collected data were evaluated based on a 1–5 Likert scale. The result of the evaluation revealed that the current governance of the SEPLS is far from being successful. The average relative value of the key attributes of the resilience for the management of the SEPLS seems to change from moderate to a very low degree. However, it is argued that the mechanism of ACM can be built particularly based on collaboration and power sharing, among the key stakeholders operating at different levels. Finally, a set of policy-oriented responses were recommended to contribute to the resilient landscape management in the region. It is expected that the results of this study can help policy makers, resource and landscape planners to establish and strengthen the resilient landscape management in Lefke Region and elsewhere.

TI  - Reintroduction of songbirds from captivity: the case of the Great-billed Seed-finch (Sporophila maximiliani) in Brazil
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ex situ breeding programs are a relevant strategy for recovering populations that are threatened in the wild. Thus, it is important to evaluate how different reintroduction strategies can affect population establishment, dynamics, survival, and local persistence. Herein, we use the Great-billed Seed-finch (Sporophila maximiliani), a songbird threatened with extinction in most Brazilian biomes, as an example. To identify scenarios that could result in viable populations in nature, we considered an introduction successful when the chance of surviving for 100 years was > 90%. Knowing the distribution of the captive populations, we also investigated where reintroductions should be promoted, considering the fragmented status of the natural vegetation and human pressures along the original southern range of S. maximiliani. We modeled the population viability under four different release schemes: one single area versus three different areas and, for each scheme, with or without the supplementation of individuals. The reintroductions would be successful if a minimum of 24 individuals were released in one single area or in three different areas, both with supplementation of four pairs per area over 5 years. However, few regions were appropriate for reintroduction from captivity, such as the central part of the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest in the species distribution range. Specifically, areas such as veredas (palm swamps) should be target sites for reintroductions since the species is primarily common in these unique ecosystems. Our data indicated that any reintroduction needs monitoring, and individuals should be tracked to evaluate their effective establishment in the release areas.

TI  - Alien arthropod predators and parasitoids: interactions with the environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Many species of entomophagous arthropods have been introduced either intentionally (through the practice of biological control) or unintentionally to new regions. We examine interactions of these aliens with their new environments in the context of rapid global change linked to human activity. We consider effects of such interactions on establishment and spread of the alien species and effects on indigenous biota and ecosystems. Major elements of global change that affect alien-environment interactions include landscape modifications by humans (e.g., cultivation, habitat loss and fragmentation) and increases in atmospheric CO2 and other gases resulting in climate change and other effects (e.g., changes in food quality for herbivores that affect higher trophic levels as well). Alien arthropod predators can alter landscapes for their benefit, to the detriment of indigenous species. A brief review also of blood-feeding alien arthropods makes clear that interactions with the environment critically influence invasions of zoophagous arthropods in general.

TI  - Applications of landscape genetics in conservation biology: concepts and challenges
PY  - 2010
AB  - Landscape genetics plays an increasingly important role in the management and conservation of species. Here, we highlight some of the opportunities and challenges in using landscape genetic approaches in conservation biology. We first discuss challenges related to sampling design and introduce several recent methodological developments in landscape genetics (analyses based on pairwise relatedness, the application of Bayesian methods, inference from landscape resistance and a shift from population-based to individual-based analyses). We then show how simulations can foster the field of landscape genetics and, finally, elaborate on technical developments in sequencing techniques that will dramatically improve our ability to study genetic variation in wild species, opening up new and unprecedented avenues for genetic analysis in conservation biology.

TI  - Impact of deforestation on habitat connectivity thresholds for large carnivores in tropical forests
PY  - 2017
AB  - Deforestation significantly impacts large carnivores that depend on large tracts of interconnected forest habitat and that are sensitive to human activities. Understanding the relationship between habitat use and spatial distribution of such species across human modified landscapes is critical when planning effective conservation strategies. This study assessed the presence of potential landscape connectivity thresholds resulting from habitat fragmentation associated with different deforestation patterns using a scale-based approach that links species-specific home ranges with the extent of anthropogenic activities. The objectives were (1) to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of natural vegetation for five common deforestation patterns and (2) to evaluate the connectivity associated with these patterns and the existence of potential thresholds affecting jaguar dispersal. The Bolivian lowlands, located within jaguar conservation units, were analysed with landscape metrics to capture the spatial and temporal changes within deforested areas and to determine potential impact on jaguar connectivity and connectivity thresholds for dispersal. Over the period of 1976–2005, the amount of natural vegetation has decreased by more than 40% in all locations with the biggest changes occurring between 1991 and 2000. Landscape spatial structure around jaguar locations showed that jaguars used areas with mean proportion of natural areas = 83.14% (SE = 3.72%), mean patch density = 1.16 patches/100 ha (SE = 0.28 patches/100 ha), mean patch area = 616.95 ha (SE = 172.89 ha) and mean edge density = 705.27 m/ha (SE = 182.19 m/ha).We observed strong fragmentation processes in all study locations, which has resulted in the connectivity of jaguar habitat decreasing to <20% by 2005. A connectivity threshold zone was observed when the proportion of natural vegetation was less than 58.4% (SE = 1.3). Assessing fragmentation and connectivity for carnivores within the extent of human-modified landscapes proved to be an effective way to understand the changes caused by deforestation and their potential effects on large carnivore habitats. Our study highlights the importance of scale-based approaches for assessing current conservation challenges to protect large carnivores.

TI  - Another Mechanism to Control Invasive Species and Population Explosion: “Ecological” Damping Continued
PY  - 2017
AB  - The control of nonnative species is a central problem in spatial ecology. Data on the invasive Burmese python (Python bivittatus) in the Florida everglades, show an exponential increase in python population, which have resulted in local prey populations reducing severely (Dorcas et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 109:2418–2422, 2012). This is exacerbated by the inability to harvest pythons by law, in Everglades National Park, where their concentration is extremely high. We consider a two species predator–prey model with Beddington–DeAngelis functional response, and show that it blows up in finite time, thus mimicking an “exploding” python population. Given current government policy that requires complete protection of species in national parks, we investigate novel alternative population control measures that promote efficient eco-system engineering. We establish such measures are feasible in our setting by rigorously proving boundary damping effects. That is we show that an exploding population in a region can be controlled, solely via manipulation of the boundary, such as effective corridor design. Detailed numerical simulations are performed to justify our analytical results.

TI  - Towards an index of biodiversity potential: example in an anthropised and fragmented landscape matrix
PY  - 2022
AB  - Promoting biodiversity is a major issue in urban planning. Estimating the biodiversity potential of patches in the landscape matrix often uses the tools of spatial analysis and landscape ecology indices, especially in large study areas. In this paper, we present the construction of a composite biodiversity potential index (CBPI) based on structural and functional approaches of landscape ecology. The CBPI is composed of eight indices (quality: permeability, fragmentation, environmental management; shape: size, shape complexity; configuration: contrast between neighbouring patches, distance to the most favourable habitats, distance from built-up areas). The CBPI appears to be suitable for anthropised and fragmented landscape matrices. It can be used to identify ecological networks in an ‘Avoid, Reduce, Compensate’ approach and can be readily updated with new map databases.

TI  - Role of Planners and Public Participation in Planning for Biodiversity
PY  - 2011
AB  - The European Union (EU) is committed to conserving biodiversity, both in terms of natural and cultural legacies, and also to limiting biodiversity loss. Relevant policies have underlined the importance of considering ecological and social issues, as well as the complex relations between the two spheres in conservation of biodiversity. These policies have clear implications for all sectors responsible for planning for biodiversity conservation. In order to be consistent with international legislation, it is necessary to move beyond protected areas and include biodiversity conservation considerations in planning activities of various sectors, and also to involve relevant stakeholders in the planning process. This is in line with the landscape approach to planning that has recently been advocated in research and practical planning. The landscape approach has a holistic perspective that encompasses both ecological and social considerations. This thesis focuses on the implementation of policies regarding biodiversity conservation and public participation; that is, the ecological and social dimensions of spatial planning in landscapes. In particular, I examine the role of people, such as planners implementing policies and other stakeholders who might influence biodiversity conservation. The studies within this thesis concern Poland and Sweden, and three sectors: regional, road and forestry planning. The thesis is comprised of four papers. Paper I deals with planners working to implement biodiversity and public participation policies. Paper II concentrates on the issues of stakeholder involvement in the Environmental Impact Assessment of road planning. Paper III investigates a specific conflict that influenced the conservation of biodiversity in an important biodiversity hotspot. Paper IV is a conceptual paper that discusses the tools used to integrate ecological and social dimensions when implementing the European Landscape Convention. The studies included in this thesis reveal that successfully implementing biodiversity conservation and public participation policies may require more than just ecological knowledge about how biodiversity should be maintained, and more than just formal guidelines regarding how the public should be treated in the planning process. In addition, the role of people who may influence the planning and decision making processes is crucial. Accordingly, there is a need for two key developments. Firstly, planners and the general public should be properly educated about conservation-related issues. Secondly, various incentives should be introduced that influence the behaviour and, in the longer term, the attitudes of the people who may affect biodiversity.

TI  - Ecological quality assessment of urban green spaces based on landscape metrics: A case of Nanjing, China
PY  - 2014
AB  - China’s ongoing urbanization is having a profound effect on the environment, and Nanjing, as one of the most important metropolitan areas of the city cluster in China’s Yangtze River Delta, is not immune to this development; as such, it is greatly affecting the scale and structure of its urban green spaces. An ecological quality assessment of Nanjing’s green spaces is fundamentally significant to appropriate spatial planning and the implementation of sustainable development ideas. This study uses ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) remote-sensing image data to map the distribution of urban green spaces in Nanjing, and employs various landscape metrics to analyze and evaluate the city’s spatial layout and ecological quality. Results of the study reveal that the distribution of urban green spaces in Nanjing is highly uneven, with most located in suburban areas and few within the city’s core. Green space within the urban area is highly centralized around the Zijin Mountain woodlands, while green space in the suburbs is highly dispersed and fragmented. A large proportion of Nanjing’s green space comprises farmlands, primarily distributed on the outskirts of the city and in the suburbs. The amount of farmland, however, is continuously decreasing, as the land is being used in the ongoing urban development. This is expected to rapidly lower the ecological quality of the region’s green spaces. In order to improve the ecological quality here, both recreational and ecologic functions of green space should be considered during the phases of spatial planning. It also is suggested that more core green spaces be built, such as ecological country parks, to increase the ratio of woodlands, enhance the management of ecological spaces in suburban areas, establish ecologic greenways, and strengthen the connectivity of green spaces.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity Monitoring of Cropland Evolution and Its Impact on Grain Production Changes in the Southern Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>High-speed cropland changes are taking place in Northeast China, bringing about the sustainable changes in ecological landscape and food production; however, the lack of continuous research limits the revelation of new findings in this region. The integrated approach of land migration tracking, ecological landscape and mathematical statistics was established to conduct a comprehensive survey of land change–landscape–food security in a typical grain-planting region of Northeast China to reveal new changes from 1990 to 2020. Results display that the cropland area continued to increase from 25,885.16 km2 in 1990 to 31,144.46 km2 in 2020, leading to the loss of forest land, grassland, water body and unused land. For cropland structure, the proportion of paddy fields in cropland increased rapidly from 7.18 to 39.53% during 1990–2020; in contrast, upland crops decreased sharply. The richness of landscape presented gradually complex characteristics with SHDI from 0.258 to 0.671 and other ecological indicators underwent similar changes with strong regularity. Total grain production displayed a continuous increase, with values from 523.79 × 104 t to 1839.12 × 104 t, increasing by 2.51 times from 1990 to 2020. We also revealed the contribution rate of unchanged upland crops to grain increments was the largest (i.e., 46.29%), and the conversion of internal cropland structure (i.e., the paddy fields converted from upland crops) contributed 12.17% from 1990 to 2020, showing a positive signal for food security. These new findings provide studies on land use change, ecological landscape and food security in China and abroad.</jats:p>

The development of a green infrastructure network can enhance the provision of ecosystem services connecting ecosystem features. We review and explore the concepts, methodologies, and applications that allow to analyse connectivity of green infrastructure networks and the role of spatial connectivity for supporting and maintaining ecosystem services. Together with connectivity, the quality, quantity, diversity, redundancy, and distances of ecosystem elements result to be important characteristics to support the provision of services. We report how spatial and connectivity-based methodologies (for example, network indices and spatial pattern analysis) can support characterisation and prioritization of green infrastructure networks for crucial interventions, both for preserving and restoring connection elements.</jats:p>

PY  - 2010
AB  - Intuitively, wildlife crossing structures should enhance the viability of wildlife populations. Previous research has demonstrated that a broad range of species will use crossing structures, however, questions remain as to whether these measures actually provide benefits to populations. To assess this, studies will need to determine the number of individuals using crossings, their sex, and their genetic relationships. Obtaining empirical data demonstrating population-level benefits for some species can be problematic and challenging at best. Molecular techniques now make it possible to identify species, individuals, their sex, and their genetic relatedness from hair samples collected through non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS). We describe efforts to pilot a method to assess potential population-level benefits of wildlife crossing structures. We tested the feasibility of a prototype NGS system designed to sample hair from black bears (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bears (U. arctos) at two wildlife underpasses. The piloted hair-sampling method did not deter animal use of the trial underpasses and was effective at sampling hair from more than 90% of the bear crossing events at the underpasses. Hair samples were also obtained from non-target carnivore species, including three out of five (60%) cougar (Puma concolor) crossing events. Individual identification analysis revealed that three female and two male grizzly bears used one wildlife underpass, whereas two female and three male black bears were identified as using the other underpass. Of the 36 hair samples from bears analyzed, five failed, resulting in an 87% extraction success rate, and six more were only identified to species. Overall, 70% of the hair samples from bears collected in the field had sufficient DNA for extraction purposes. Preliminary data from our NGS suggest the technique can be a reliable method to assess the population-level benefits of Banff wildlife crossings. Furthermore, NGS can be an important tool for the conservation value of wildlife crossings for other taxa, and we urge others to carry out evaluations of this emerging methodology.

TI  - Is realised connectivity among populations of aquatic fauna predictable from potential connectivity
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Effective management of aquatic fauna requires knowledge of the ways in which populations in different catchments and sub-catchments are connected. A powerful way to estimate this is using genetic markers, which provide information on the average amount of genetic connectivity among populations over generations. Although many studies of genetic connectivity have appeared in the literature, there are innumerable species that have not been studied. 2. This study explores whether it is possible to make broad generalisations about population connectivity, based on readily available information in the form of species life history and architecture of the aquatic habitat. 3. A number of models have been proposed to explain the pattern of connectivity shown by aquatic species with different life-history characteristics, for example, the stream hierarchy model, Isolation by Distance, the Death Valley Model, the headwater model and panmixia. 4. In this study, we propose a dichotomous key to assign species to different models of potential connectivity. The key is based on a few very simple questions about the life history of the species and the geographical arrangement of study sites. We then assessed the performance of the key with 109 data sets of Australian fish and macroinvertebrates, using genetic data to provide an estimate of realised connectivity. 5. The realised connectivity fitted the proposed potential connectivity model in over 70% of cases, and we suggest this might be a useful initial approach for managers where empirical data are lacking.

TI  - Methodology for Identifying Ecological Corridors: A Spatial Planning Perspective
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Recent studies carried out by landscape and urban ecologists have shown that habitat fragmentation has negative environmental effects and is accountable for the loss of biodiversity. The development and extension of road infrastructure to support economic growth, the urbanization and the land-use changes are major drivers of habitat fragmentation. Planners have attempted to develop tools for restoring connectivity and stopping biodiversity loss at the landscape scale and which can be applied at the urban scale, too. The study fills in the gap by developing a methodology for identifying the ecological corridors of a Romanian large carnivore (brown bear) in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains at several spatial scales. The methodology relies on geospatial data; this is equally its most important advantage and challenge. Our findings suggest that the implementation of ecological corridors in current planning practice must be completed cautiously, provided the possible restrictions are imposed on economic activities by plans, and highlight the importance of field data in increasing the scientific soundness of the results. In addition, the findings show the need to interconnect spatial planning policies with environmental policies by improving the actual legislation.</jats:p>

AB  - Overexploitation of forests by humans can lead to highly fragmented populations of forest-dependent species that have poor dispersal abilities. We tested the influence of habitat quality, landscape structure and human pressure on densities of the Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus in the largest wild population, in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. We surveyed 14 forest fragments of 5-142 km 2 that are separated from each other by an inhospitable matrix. We estimated the habitat quality of these forest patches by analysing the vegetation structure and the intensity of human pressure. We studied the distribution of forest patches and estimated macaque densities by combining line-transect sampling and complete group counts. We estimated mean density of individuals to be 9 km �2 (range 0.2-23 km �2 ). Differentiation of forest patches by a principal component analysis did not show any significant relation- ship between vegetation type and macaque density. A linear regression model showed that human pressure had a negative impact on density and that density responded positively to patch size. Patch shape, connectivity and altitude did not explain variation in population density. The size of this population is estimated to be c.5,000individuals. The survival of several small subpopulations is seriously threatened. As the Middle Atlas is the stronghold of this Endangered species, we recommend modifying forestry practices, reducing overgrazing by livestock within forests, and halting clear-cutting of holm oaks.

TI  - Building 'blue': An eco-engineering framework for foreshore developments.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanisation in terrestrial systems has driven architects, planners, ecologists and engineers to collaborate on the design and creation of more sustainable structures. Examples include the development of 'green infrastructure' and the introduction of wildlife corridors that mitigate urban stressors and provide positive ecological outcomes. In contrast, efforts to minimise the impacts of urban developments in marine environments have been far more restricted in their extent and scope, and have often overlooked the ecological role of the built environment as potential habitat. Urban foreshore developments, i.e. those built on the interface of intertidal and/or subtidal zones, have the potential to incorporate clear multi-functional outcomes, by supporting novel ecosystems. We present a step-by-step eco-engineering framework for 'building blue' that will allow coastal managers to facilitate planning and construction of sustainable foreshore developments. Adopting such an approach will incorporate ecological principles, thereby mitigating some of the environmental impacts, creating more resilient urban infrastructure and environments, and maximising benefits to the multiple stakeholders and users of marine urban waterfronts.

TI  - Genets in the city: community observations and perceptions of large-spotted genets ( Genetta tigrina ) in an urban environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - The global increase in urbanization has resulted in exclusion of many carnivore species from human-altered landscapes due to a variety of anthropogenic impacts. However, despite the negative impacts of urbanization on carnivores, certain species exhibit an ability to survive within urban areas. The aim of the study was to solicit community-based information, using a questionnaire mainly, to investigate the distribution of Large-spotted Genets (Genetta tigrina) within the urban environment of the greater Durban district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and investigate their reported use of anthropogenic structures for resting, breeding and foraging. The study was also designed to determine possible areas of conflict, habitat use and residents’ attitudes towards G. tigrina. Consequently, interviews were conducted in the suburbs of Kloof and Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal to establish information pertaining to genet behaviour, land-use, potential wildlife conflicts and public perceptions with their presence in urban areas. Walking between areas (during foraging bouts or between roost sites) was the main activity observed. Domestic pet food was the main food item genets were observed eating. The most cited cause of genet fatalities were attacks by domestic dogs and collisions with vehicles. Genets were reported using roof spaces for resting during daylight hours and for breeding. Respondents reported providing supplementary food such as meat, chicken and pet food to urban genets. The majority of respondents expressed positive attitudes towards genets in urban Kloof. Negative views stemmed from concerns of disease transfer (RABV) and impacts on wild bird populations. This study illustrated the adaptability of genets to live in urban areas and their ability to utilise anthropogenic resources. Furthermore, the study identified various potential threats to genets in an urban environment.

TI  - ECOLOGY OF ORGANISMS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS Urban drivers of plant-pollinator interactions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary 1. Plant–pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the impacts of many global change drivers on plant–pollinator interactions. 2. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter plant–pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of plant–pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination outcomes. 3. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments, where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many other environments. 4. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent changes in pollinator phenology. 5. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the same time, diversity among species’ phenological responses could buffer plant–pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better understanding the warming effects on plant–pollinator interactions. 6. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal pollution have been examined with respect to plant–pollinator interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which environmental contaminants drive plant–pollinator interactions in actual urban landscapes is, however, currently unknown. 7. Important knowledge gaps that require research attention include understanding the consequences of plant and pollinator trait filtering on plant–pollinator interactions, and expanding the literature to include underrepresented biomes and pollinator taxa.

TI  - Urbanization reduces genetic connectivity in bobcats (Lynx rufus) at both intra- and interpopulation spatial scales.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization is a major factor driving habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss in wildlife. However, the impacts of urbanization on connectivity can vary among species and even populations due to differences in local landscape characteristics, and our ability to detect these relationships may depend on the spatial scale at which they are measured. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are relatively sensitive to urbanization and the status of bobcat populations is an important indicator of connectivity in urban coastal southern California. We genotyped 271 bobcats at 13,520 SNP loci to conduct a replicated landscape resistance analysis in five genetically distinct populations. We tested urban and natural factors potentially influencing individual connectivity in each population separately, as well as study-wide. Overall, landscape genomic effects were most frequently detected at the study-wide spatial scale, with urban land cover (measured as impervious surface) having negative effects and topographic roughness having positive effects on gene flow. The negative effect of urban land cover on connectivity was also evident when populations were analyzed separately despite varying substantially in spatial area and the proportion of urban development, confirming a pervasive impact of urbanization largely independent of spatial scale. The effect of urban development was strongest in one population where stream habitat had been lost to development, suggesting that riparian corridors may help mitigate reduced connectivity in urbanizing areas. Our results demonstrate the importance of replicating landscape genetic analyses across populations and considering how landscape genetic effects may vary with spatial scale and local landscape structure.

TI  - Life in linear habitats: the movement ecology of an endangered mammal in a peri-urban landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Animal movement can be significantly altered in human‐dominated landscapes such as urban and peri‐urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human‐dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri‐urban Melbourne, Australia’s second‐largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non‐dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human‐dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off‐reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.

TI  - Temporal Continuities of Grasslands and Forests as Patches of Natural Land in Urban Landscapes: A Case Study of the Tsukuba Science City
PY  - 2020
AB  - Development has fragmented urban nature, and target sites for conservation strategies need to be those that have long maintained their original land cover in a clustered area. Additionally, continuously grasping changes from rural to urban as well as changes over decades after urbanization is essential. Therefore, this study identified and investigated natural patches in urban landscapes, clarified actual management practices in the identified patches, and traced changes in land ownership and land cover during the past 130 years in the Tsukuba Science City, Japan. We first identified areas containing clusters of urban grasslands and forest patches that have existed since the 2010s. We then identified urban green space patches that since the 1880s have remained undeveloped after being agricultural landscapes, despite the rapid urbanization of the Tsukuba Science City since the 1970s. These patches of urban green space were mainly identified near rural communities, research institutions, planned development sites, and golf courses. The findings of this study highlighted the need for new policy implications through systematic arrangement of diverse conservation strategies to maintain urban green space patches. Further investigation is required to elucidate the ecosystem services provided by these remnant green patches.

TI  - Functional and structural responses to marine urbanisation
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban areas have broad ecological footprints with complex impacts on natural systems. In coastal areas, growing populations are advancing their urban footprint into the ocean through the construction of seawalls and other built infrastructure. While we have some understanding of how urbanisation might drive functional change in terrestrial ecosystems, coastal systems have been largely overlooked. This study is one of the first to directly assess how changes in diversity relate to changes in ecosystem properties and functions (e.g. productivity, filtration rates) of artificial and natural habitats in one of the largest urbanised estuaries in the world, Sydney Harbour. We complemented our surveys with an extensive literature search. We found large and important differences in the community structure and function between artificial and natural coastal habitats. However, differences in diversity and abundance of organisms do not necessarily match observed functional changes. The abundance and composition of important functional groups differed among habitats with rocky shores having 40% and 70% more grazers than seawalls or pilings, respectively. In contrast, scavengers were approximately 8 times more abundant on seawalls than on pilings or rocky shores and algae were more diverse on natural rocky shores and seawalls than on pilings. Our results confirm previous findings in the literature. Oysters were more abundant on pilings than on rocky shores, but were also smaller. Interestingly, these differences in oyster populations did not affect in situ filtration rates between habitats. Seawalls were the most invaded habitats while pilings supported greater secondary productivity than other habitats. This study highlights the complexity of the diversity-function relationship and responses to ocean sprawl in coastal systems. Importantly, we showed that functional properties should be considered independently from structural change if we are to design and manage artificial habitats in ways to maximise the services provided by urban coastal systems and minimise their ecological impacts

TI  - Exploring the Effects of “Smart City” in the Inner-City Fabric of the Mediterranean Metropolis: Towards a Bio-Cultural Sonic Diversity?
PY  - 2021
AB  - “Smart city”, driven by digital technology is not only a technological but also a social, cultural and political project. A socially and culturally significant new urban ideal is born. This research paper is based on the narrative that the city appears as a palimpsest of interventions of all natures. History and shared memory, composition and superimposition, coherence and divergence are fundamental for its evolution. It is thus evident that ”Smart city” as a rather new urban ideal, but also as a disruptive innovation process, cannot be conceived nor implemented all at once; it must follow analogous processes of buildup and stratification. On the other hand, sounds are part of cities, of their sensory landscape, of their identity. They are one of the urban markers, along with the visual landscape. In this context, the paper focuses on the sound identity of the inner-city areas of the Mediterranean metropolis, posing the following research question: What are the transformations that “Smart city” can cause to the sound identity of a city? In dense urban fabric with high-rise buildings, high rates of exploitation, frequent transgressions of the legal construction and least free space in private plots, what can be the prospects of using “smart transport”, for enriching the city with positive soundscapes, thus improving its environmental quality? Following the metaphor of urban and acoustic palimpsest, we examine narratives of replacement of conventional cars with autonomous vehicles (AVs) and of private cars with car-pooling systems. The article concludes that spatialized intelligence can substantially and positively transform the sound identity of the Mediterranean metropolis and be the spearhead for an increase in bio-cultural sonic diversity. At least during the era when the city still appears as a palimpsest of interpositions, evoking the historic time.

TI  - Area is the primary correlate of annual and seasonal patterns of avian species richness in urban green spaces
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Urban green spaces (UGS) often support diverse bird assemblages. Current evidence suggests large UGS that are circular in shape and contain abundant tree canopy cover will support more bird species independent of UGS isolation. Here, we use bird occurrence information from the eBird citizen-science database over an 18-year period (2002–2019) to estimate annual and seasonal patterns of avian species richness in well-surveyed New York City green spaces. Area was the strongest correlate of annual (n = 102 UGS) and seasonal species richness (n = 43 UGS), whereas shape and isolation lacked significant relationships. Increasing area by 50% resulted in an 11.5% increase in annual and an 8.2% increase in seasonal species richness. There was no evidence that these relationships contained an upper limit. Tree canopy cover was weakly correlated with annual species richness. The richness of nocturnally migrating species was strongly correlated with area in the spring and autumn, especially for non-passerine species. The species richness of nocturnally migrating passerines was strongly correlated with tree canopy cover in the spring, where a 50% increase in canopy cover resulted in a 23.3% increase in species richness. Our findings emphasize the broad importance of area, the value of tree canopy cover for spring migrants, and the limited relevance of shape and isolation. Efforts to enhance area and tree canopy cover will increase the number of resident and migratory bird species, which will likely increase the number of other area-sensitive forest taxa that occur in urban environments.

TI  - Network analysis can guide resilience-based management in forest landscapes under global change
PY  - 2020
AB  - Forests are projected to undergo dramatic compositional and structural shifts prompted by global changes, such as climatic changes and intensifying natural disturbance regimes. Future uncertainty makes planning for forest management exceptionally difficult, demanding novel approaches to maintain or improve the ability of forest ecosystems to respond and rapidly reorganize after disturbance events. Adopting a landscape perspective in forest management is particularly important in fragmented forest landscapes where both diversity and connectivity play key roles in determining resilience to global change. In this context, network analysis and functional traits combined with ecological dynamic modeling can help evaluate changes in functional response diversity and connectivity within and among forest stands in fragmented landscapes. Here, we coupled ecological dynamic modeling with functional traits analysis and network theory to analyze forested landscapes as an interconnected network of forest patches. We simulated future forest landscape dynamics in a large landscape in southern Quebec, Canada, under a combination of climate, disturbance, and management scenarios. We depicted the landscape as a functional network, assessed changes in future resilience using indicators at multiple spatial scales, and evaluated if current management practices are suitable for maintaining resilience to simulated changes in regimes. Our results show that climate change would promote forest productivity and favor heat-adapted deciduous species. Changes in natural disturbances will likely have negative impacts on native conifers and will drive changes in forest type composition. Climate change negatively impacted all resilience indicators and triggered losses of functional response diversity and connectivity across the landscape with undesirable consequences on the capacity of these forests to adapt to global change. Also, current management strategies failed to promote resilience at different spatial levels, highlighting the need for a more active and thoughtful approach to forest management under global change. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of combining dynamic landscape-scale simulation modeling with network analyses to evaluate the possible impacts of climate change as well as human and natural disturbances on forest resilience under global change.

TI  - A Protected Area Connectivity Evaluation and Strategy Development Framework for Post-2020 Biodiversity Conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Maintaining and improving the connectivity of protected areas (PAs) is essential for biodiversity conservation. The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) aims to expand the coverage of well-connected PAs and other effective area-based conservation measures to 30% by 2030. We proposed a framework to evaluate the connectivity of PAs and developed strategies to maintain and improve the connectivity of PAs based on PA connectivity indicators, and we applied this framework to China’s terrestrial PAs. We considered that the concept of PA connectivity is at the level of both PA patches and PA networks, including four aspects: intra-patch connectivity, inter-patch connectivity, network connectivity, and PA–landscape connectivity. We found that among China’s 2153 terrestrial PA patches, only 427 had good intra-patch connectivity, and their total area accounted for 11.28% of China’s land area. If inter-patch connectivity, network connectivity, and PA–landscape connectivity were taken as the criteria to evaluate PA connectivity, respectively, then the coverage of well-connected terrestrial PAs in China was only 4.07%, 8.30%, and 5.92%, respectively. Only seven PA patches have good connectivity of all four aspects, covering only 2.69% of China’s land. The intra-patch, inter-patch, network, and PA–landscape connectivity of China’s terrestrial PA network reached 93.41%, 35.40%, 58.43%, and 8.58%, respectively. These conclusions indicated that there is still a big gap between China’s PA connectivity and the Post-2020 GBF target, which urgently needs to be improved. We identified PA patches and PA networks of ecological zones that need to improve PA connectivity and identified improvement priorities for them. We also identified priority areas for connectivity restoration in existing PAs, potential ecological corridors between PAs, and priority areas for PA expansion to improve the connectivity of PAs in China. Application of our framework elsewhere should help governments and policymakers reach ambitious biodiversity conservation goals at national and global scales.</jats:p>

TI  - Urban Ecological Networks for Biodiversity Conservation in Cities
PY  - 2017
AB  - Triggered by concerns of global biodiversity loss, cities are increasingly called upon to play an increased role in biodiversity conservation, leading to a surge in interest in urban biodiversity conservation. In playing this role, greening of cities needs to move beyond mere provision of amenities or ecosystem services to one of providing habitats for native biodiversity. This chapter describes one of the approaches for enhancing urban biodiversity conservation through the ecological network approach. The concept of ecological networks is not new in the field of ecology. However, its application to cities, both in conceptual and operational forms, is highly limited. As a high-rise, high-density city in which biodiversity conservation is threatened by other competing land uses, Singapore is used as an example to illustrate the development and application of the ecological network approach. The ecological network is built on the concept of network, spatial and landscape cohesions. Using methods in landscape ecology, remote sensing, biodiversity conservation and the Analytic Hierarchy Process, this chapter describes how a toolkit for ecological network can be developed, as well as the efficacy of its use for biodiversity management. The toolkit is categorized into monitoring tools, mapping tools, and communication and decision making tools. The learning outcomes gleaned from the research are presented as the 5-multis: multispecies, multiscalar, multilevel, multifunctionality, and multidisciplinarity.

TI  - Genetic structure across urban and agricultural landscapes reveals evidence of resource specialization and philopatry in the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica L.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Human activity continues to impact global ecosystems, often by altering the habitat suitability, persistence, and movement of native species. It is thus critical to examine the population genetic structure of key ecosystemservice providers across human-altered landscapes to provide insight into the forces that limit wildlife persistence and movement across multiple spatial scales. While some studies have documented declines of bee pollinators as a result of human-mediated habitat alteration, others suggest that some bee species may benefit from altered land use due to increased food or nesting resource availability; however, detailed population and dispersal studies have been lacking. We investigated the population genetic structure of the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, across 14 sites spanning more than 450 km, including dense urban areas and intensive agricultural habitat. X. virginica is a large bee which constructs nests in natural and human-associated wooden substrates, and is hypothesized to disperse broadly across urbanizing areas. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we detected significant genetic isolation by geographic distance and significant isolation by land use, where urban and cultivated landscapes were most conducive to gene flow. This is one of the first population genetic analyses to provide evidence of enhanced insect dispersal in human-altered areas as compared to semi-natural landscapes. We found moderate levels of regional-scale population structure across the study system (G'ST = 0.146) and substantial co-ancestry between the sampling regions, where co-ancestry patterns align with major human transportation corridors, suggesting that human-mediated movement may be influencing regional dispersal processes. Additionally, we found a signature of strong site-level philopatry where our analyses revealed significant levels of high genetic relatedness at very fine scales (<1 km), surprising given X. virginica's large body size. These results provide unique genetic evidence that insects can simultaneously exhibit substantial regional dispersal as well as high local nesting fidelity in landscapes dominated by human activity.

TI  - Eco-engineering urban infrastructure for marine and coastal biodiversity: Which interventions have the greatest ecological benefit?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Along urbanised coastlines, urban infrastructure is increasingly becoming the dominant habitat. These structures are often poor surrogates for natural habitats, and a diversity of eco‐engineering approaches have been trialled to enhance their biodiversity, with varying success. We undertook a quantitative meta‐analysis and qualitative review of 109 studies to compare the efficacy of common eco‐engineering approaches (e.g. increasing texture, crevices, pits, holes, elevations and habitat‐forming taxa) in enhancing the biodiversity of key functional groups of organisms, across a variety of habitat settings and spatial scales. All interventions, with one exception, increased the abundance or number of species of one or more of the functional groups considered. Nevertheless, the magnitude of effect varied markedly among groups and habitat settings. In the intertidal, interventions that provided moisture and shade had the greatest effect on the richness of sessile and mobile organisms, while water‐retaining features had the greatest effect on the richness of fish. In contrast, in the subtidal, small‐scale depressions which provide refuge to new recruits from predators and other environmental stressors such as waves, had higher abundances of sessile organisms while elevated structures had higher numbers and abundances of fish. The taxa that responded most positively to eco‐engineering in the intertidal were those whose body size most closely matched the dimensions of the resulting intervention. Synthesis and applications. The efficacy of eco‐engineering interventions varies among habitat settings and functional groups. This indicates the importance of developing site‐specific approaches that match the target taxa and dominant stressors. Furthermore, because different types of intervention are effective at enhancing different groups of organisms, ideally a range of approaches should be applied simultaneously to maximise niche diversity.

TI  - Industrial energy development decouples ungulate migration from the green wave.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The ability to freely move across the landscape to track the emergence of nutritious spring green-up (termed 'green-wave surfing') is key to the foraging strategy of migratory ungulates. Across the vast landscapes traversed by many migratory herds, habitats are being altered by development with unknown consequences for surfing. Using a unique long-term tracking dataset, we found that when energy development occurs within mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) migration corridors, migrating animals become decoupled from the green wave. During the early phases of a coalbed natural gas development, deer synchronized their movements with peak green-up. But faced with increasing disturbance as development expanded, deer altered their movements by holding up at the edge of the gas field and letting the green wave pass them by. Development often modified only a small portion of the migration corridor but had far-reaching effects on behaviour before and after migrating deer encountered it, thus reducing surfing along the entire route by 38.65% over the 14-year study period. Our study suggests that industrial development within migratory corridors can change the behaviour of migrating ungulates and diminish the benefits of migration. Such disruptions to migratory behaviour present a common mechanism whereby corridors become unprofitable and could ultimately be lost on highly developed landscapes.

TI  - A New Framework for Urban Ecology: An Integration of Proximate and Ultimate Responses to Anthropogenic Change
PY  - 2018
AB  - As urban areas continue to grow, understanding how species respond and adapt to urban habitats is becoming increasingly important. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind observed phenotypic changes of urban-dwelling animals will enable us to better evaluate the impact of urbanization on current and future generations of wildlife and predict how animals respond to novel environments. Recently, urban ecology has emerged not only as a means of understanding organismal adaptation but also as a framework for exploring mechanisms mediating evolutionary phenomena. Here, we have identified four important research topics that will advance the field of urban ecology and shed light on the proximate and ultimate causes of the phenotypic differences commonly seen among species and populations that vary in their responses to urbanization. First, we address the ecological and socio-economic factors that characterize cities, how they might interact with each other, and how they affect urban species. Second, we ask which are the proximate mechanisms underlying the emergence over time of novel traits in urban organisms, focusing on developmental effects. Third, we emphasize the importance of understanding the ultimate causations that link phenotypic shifts to function. This question highlights the need to quantify the strength and direction of selection that urban individuals are exposed to, and whether the phenotypic shifts associated with life in the city are adaptive. Lastly, we stress the need to translate how individual-level responses scale up to population dynamics. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of variation among populations and species in their responses to urbanization will unravel species resilience to environmental perturbation, which will facilitate predictive models for sustainability and development of green cities that maintain or even increase urban biodiversity and wildlife health and wellbeing.

TI  - Effects of environmental factors and landscape features on movement patterns of Florida black bears
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A greater understanding of how environmental factors and anthropogenic landscape features influence animal movements can inform management and potentially aid in mitigating human–wildlife conflicts. We investigated the movement patterns of 16 Florida black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus; 6 females, 10 males) in north-central Florida at multiple temporal scales using GPS data collected from 2011 to 2014. We calculated bi-hourly step-lengths and directional persistence, as well as daily and weekly observed displacements and expected displacements. We used those movement metrics as response variables in linear mixed models and tested for effects of sex, season, and landscape features. We found that step-lengths of males were generally longer than step-lengths of females, and both sexes had the shortest step-lengths during the daytime. Bears moved more slowly (shorter step-lengths) and exhibited less directed movement when near creeks, in forested wetlands, and in marsh habitats, possibly indicating foraging behavior. In urban areas, bears moved more quickly (longer step-lengths) and along more directed paths. The results were similar across all temporal scales. Major roads tended to act as a semipermeable barrier to bear movement. Males crossed major roads more frequently than females but both sexes crossed major roads much less frequently than minor roads. Our findings regarding the influence of landscape and habitat features on movement patterns of Florida black bears could be useful for planning effective wildlife corridors and understanding how future residential or commercial development and road expansions may affect animal movement.</jats:p>

TI  - Biodiversity in cities. The effect of spatial scale and biodiversity data in heterogeneous landscapes.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The assessment and monitoring of biodiversity in urban areas has been performed until now through dedicated on site studies and a small number of studies using online digital biodiversity databases. The question remains as to what extent an efficient and effective monitoring scheme could be implemented, one that not only facilitates comparisons across time and space, but also serves as an early change detection tool that complement local studies. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has been promoted for its central role, gathering and harmonizing biodiversity data worldwide, thereby facilitating the assessment and monitoring of biodiversity in multiple ecosystems. While GBIF data has been investigated for its potential at large scales (national, global) and in natural ecosystems, the question remains as to what extent, and in which context, is GBIF data applicable to urban biodiversity assessment and monitoring. In this study we have shown that the type of organisms surveyed -as well as its ecology and the spatial scale(s) of the assessments are critical to identify the effect of urban and green infrastructure in cities.</jats:p>

TI  - The Effects of Climate Change on Habitat Connectivity: A Case Study of the Brown-Eared Pheasant in China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Climate change has caused habitat fragmentation and reduced connectivity. The Fen River Basin in Shanxi Province, China is an important habitat for the central population of the brown-eared pheasant (BEP). The effects of climate change need to be considered in the conservation planning of BEP habitats. We used a species dispersion model to determine the BEP core habitat and graph theory to explore the connectivity of the BEP’s main habitats. The pinch point areas of BEP dissemination were determined by circuit theory. Least-cost pathways were used to identify the critical corridors for BEP dissemination. A gap analysis was conducted to estimate the efficiency of BEP conservation measures. Under the future climate scenarios, BEP habitats decreased by between 54.69% and 97.63%, and the connectivity of the main habitats was reduced by a similar magnitude. The BEP core habitat shifted to the southwestern region under the influence of climatic conditions. Currently, 90.84% of the species’ critical habitat remains unprotected. Due to climate change, the core habitat in the future was projected to differ from the current protected area. Enhancing the protection of the pinch point region may aid in the restoration of habitat connectivity.</jats:p>

TI  - Estimation of Ecological Connectivity in a City Based on Land Cover and Urban Habitat Maps
PY  - 2020
AB  - Anthropogenic land use has led to the loss and fragmentation of native habitats and disruption to ecosystem processes, resulting in a decline in landscape connectivity and biodiversity. Here, in order to find the potentials of improvements in ecological connectivity, we provide a spatial analysis to present differences in ecological connectivity based on land cover maps and urban habitat maps in Suwon city, Republic of Korea. We generated two permeability maps for use in a network analysis, one being land cover and the other urban habitat, including a 5-km buffer area from the city boundary. We then determined the current-flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) for each map. Our results indicate that forests are typically the most highly connected areas in both maps. However, in the land cover map results, nearly all high-priority areas were in the mountainous region (CFBC value: 0.0100 ± 0.0028), but the urban habitat indicated that grasslands and rivers within the city also significantly contribute to connectivity (CFBC value: 0.0071 ± 0.0022). The CFBC maps developed here could be used as a reference when introducing green infrastructure in cities. Before establishing ecological networks for urban areas, future work should integrate the land use and ecological data of different administrative districts with continuous ecological connection.

TI  - Habitat-Related Differences in Winter Presence and Spring–Summer Activity of Roe Deer in Warsaw
PY  - 2021
AB  - Preliminary research conducted in Warsaw in the 1970s and 2000s showed that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) stayed in forest habitat and avoided anthropogenic areas. Activity and exploration patterns of animals are shaped by indices of anthropogenic disturbances, elevated in large cities. The aims of the study were (1) to compare the presence of roe deer in natural and anthropogenic habitats of Warsaw during three periods: 1976–1978, 2005–2008 and 2017–2021, based on snow tracking on transect routes (681.2 km in total), and (2) to describe the presence and activity of roe deer in relation to human disturbances in selected urban forests in its reproductive period (March–August), based on camera trap survey (2019–2020, 859 observations, 5317 trap-days in total). The number of tracks was higher in natural habitat during all three periods, with the highest value in 2017–2021 (9.85/km/24h). The peak of roe deer activity was recorded at dusk, and it changed with moon phases between spring and summer. Landscape connectivity and level of light pollution did not affect the activity pattern of roe deer. Our research showed that roe deer inhabiting urban areas avoided human presence by using well-covered habitats and being active in periods when the level of human disturbance was lower.

TI  - Expanding fundamental ecological knowledge by studying urban ecosystems
PY  - 2015
AB  - The expansion, densification and proliferation of urban areas around the world is currently occurring at a rate that is unprecedented in human history. It is predicted that global urban land cover will triple between 2000 and 2030, with some regions (including biodiversity hotspots) experiencing a ninefold increase in urban land cover over the same time period (Seto, G€ uneralp & Hutyra 2012). Accompanying the expansion of urban landscapes, it is anticipated that the human population living in cities and towns globally will increase from 3 5 to 5 billion people within the next 20 years (Fragkias et al. 2013). Thus, the demands of an expanding and urbanizing human population are one of the pressing ecological problems our world is facing (Sanderson et al. 2002), alongside, and in combination with, global climate change and changes to biodiversity at local and global scales (Pimm et al. 2014). Yet, urban environments also present a unique opportunity to expand our fundamental knowledge related to ecology and evolution due to the presence of intense and often novel selection pressures. In the inaugural issue of this journal, Calow (1987) defined functional ecology as the sum of three interactive processes: (i) those occurring between organisms and their environment, (ii) biotic interactions between organisms and (iii) adaptive processes driven by natural selection. The same three processes were highlighted 1 year earlier by Jared Diamond in Nature, when he called for biologists to pay more attention to the potential of using the unprecedented environmental conditions that exist within towns and cities to develop and test evolutionary and ecological theory (Diamond 1986). There is thus a natural synergy between functional ecology and urban ecology, as exemplified by some of the classic papers that have appeared in this journal, such as Rydell (1992) who demonstrated that the form of echolocation system determined the impact of light pollution on bat foraging behaviour. The potential of combining functional ecological research with urban ecology is, however, a long way from being fully realized. This is in part explained by the youth of urban ecology as a discipline. Scientific enquiry into the ecological consequences of urban environments has been underway for over half a century, although most of the momentum emerged after the mid 1990s (McDonnell 2011; Wu 2014). Thus, the focus of much urban research to date has involved describing patterns along environmental gradients (Gagn e 2013; McDonnell & Hahs 2013) rather than investigating the mechanistic processes that lie at the heart of functional ecology. To be effective in addressing the global challenges of urbanization, a much better understanding of how the urban environment affects the ecology and evolution of organisms needs to be developed (Grimm et al. 2008; Marzluff 2012; Gil & Brumm 2014; McDonnell & Hahs 2015). The purpose of this special feature is to draw attention to the plethora of opportunities that await researchers investigating the ecology and evolution of organisms in urban environments. The combination of environmental stressors and conditions within urban areas provides a novel opportunity to test and expand our theories related to ecology and evolution of organisms, and some intriguing insights are already beginning to emerge. For example, the detailed understanding of the molecular, genetic and developmental mechanisms of beak evolution that has arisen from studying Galapagos finches has been significantly advanced by studying beak evolution in the house finch Carpodacus mexicanus in response to novel urban food sources and its consequences for acoustic communication (Badyaev 2010, 2014). Thus, urban ecology has the potential to extend our understanding of extremely well-studied ecological and evolutionary problems.

TI  - Effects of greenway development on functional connectivity for bats
PY  - 2019
AB  - 1 Abstract Fragmentation of ecosystems is continuing worldwide, posing increasing pressures to and loss of biodiversity. Disused transport corridors such as old railways and tramways often return to semi-naturalness, and are increasingly upcycled into multi-use, non-motorised public Greenway infrastructure. This study examines bat activity within a proposed rural Greenway corridor in Ireland. Development scenarios are simulated to predict impacts to woodland ecosystem functional connectivity using Probability of Connectivity (PC) index. Generalised Linear Modelling predicts associations of species activity to Greenway corridor habitat and habitat structure. Spatially explicit connectivity models indicate significant impacts to ecosystem connectivity can arise from Greenway development scenarios, such as decreasing connectivity in half, or increasing connectivity four-fold. Species activity modelling identified habitat conditions along the Greenway route that suggest on-going corridor effects and associations to particular habitats and structure, emphasising the importance to consider a sensitive approach to developing disused infrastructure into Greenways. Conservation implications Potential significant increases in woodland ecosystem reachability for bats are achievable by conserving canopy cover over Greenway corridors. Species-specific habitat modelling results presented are directly applicable to guide woodland enhancement for the sensitive conservation of Greenway woodland habitat, maximising their multi-functional use and connectivity potential. Opportunities therefore exist for European Greenways to conserve and enhance ecosystem connectivity, providing landscape-scale solutions to the problem of increasing ecosystem fragmentation.

TI  - An integrated dietary assessment increases feeding event detection in an urban carnivore
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanisation radically changes habitats and alters available resources. Populations of large, highly mobile species are often extirpated at the urban-wildland interface, while species like mesocarnivores may thrive by capitalising on changes in prey abundance. We investigated the diet of the caracal (Caracal caracal), a medium-sized felid inhabiting patchy natural habitat isolated within the dense urban matrix of South Africa’s second largest city, Cape Town. We systematically integrated two classic dietary methods (scat and GPS clusters) by accounting for gut transit times. As part of a larger caracal ecology study, we GPS-collared 26 individuals over a two-year period (2014–2016) to generate coarse (3-hour) and fine-scale (20-minute) GPS movement data. Using the movement data, we investigated 677 GPS-clusters for prey remains. We collected 654 scats, half of which were found at GPS-clusters and were linked with the individual sampled. By systematically correcting for a range of gut transit times, we determined whether scat at cluster sites was from the same or an earlier feeding event, thereby increasing the overall detection of feeding events by > 50%. Avian prey dominated GPS cluster findings while micromammals were overwhelmingly represented in scat. Although > 40% of feeding events occurred within 200 meters of the urban edge, caracals largely preyed on native species. Our findings have implications for understanding the ability of some species to persist in the face of rapid environmental change, human-wildlife conflict, pathogen transmission, and bioaccumulation of pesticides. Further, this approach could be incorporated into studies that estimate foraging-explicit resource selection and habitat preference.

TI  - Ecological connectivity between land and sea: a review
PY  - 2017
AB  - Land–sea ecological connectivity refers to the interaction (convenience or hindrance) of certain physical, chemical and biological processes between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Research on land–sea ecological connectivity can provide important scientific bases for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems in terrestrial and coastal areas. On the basis of a literature summary of ecological connectivity, this paper focuses on the following: (1) summarizing basic concepts, representative phenomena on multiple spatiotemporal scales, and analysis methods of land–sea ecological connectivity; (2) discussion of the applications of land–sea ecological connectivity; (3) discussion of the relationship between human activities and land–sea ecological connectivity; (4) presentation of perspectives and recommendations on ecological restoration, protection, and biodiversity research, with emphasis on the principle of land–sea ecological connectivity. On the whole, we believe such connectivity in a region varies with changes in multiple physical and artificial factors, such as climate, land cover, biotic community and human activities. Human activities such as land use, engineering construction, urbanization and industrialization have continuously increased and cause irreversible disturbance and destruction of land–sea ecological connectivity, thereby threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services at various spatiotemporal scales. Hence, achievements of theoretical research and practical experience in ecological connectivity should be fully applied in coastal areas to maintain and restore land–sea ecological connectivity and remedy various problems that arise from the blockage and damage of ecosystem services.

TI  - Effects of urban greenspace configuration and native vegetation on bee and wasp reproduction.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pollinator welfare is a recognized research and policy target, and urban greenspaces have been identified as important habitats. Yet, landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and greenspace management practices may limit a city's conservation potential. We examined how landscape configuration, composition, and local patch quality influenced insect nesting success across inner-city Cleveland, Ohio (U.S.A.), a postindustrial legacy city containing a high abundance of vacant land (over 1600 ha). Here, 40 vacant lots were assigned 1 of 5 habitat treatments (T1, vacant lot; T2, grass lawn; T3, flowering lawn; T4, grass prairie; and T5, flowering prairie), and we evaluated how seeded vegetation, greenspace size, and landscape connectivity influenced cavity-nesting bee and wasp reproduction. Native bee and wasp larvae were more abundant in landscapes that contained a large patch (i.e., >6 ha) of contiguous greenspace, in habitats with low plant biomass, and in vacant lots seeded with a native wildflower seed mix or with fine-fescue grass, suggesting that fitness was influenced by urban landscape features and habitat management. Our results can guide urban planning by demonstrating that actions that maintain large contiguous greenspace in the landscape and establish native plants would support the conservation of bees and wasps. Moreover, our study highlights that the world's estimated 350 legacy cities are promising urban conservation targets due to their high abundance of vacant greenspace that could accommodate taxa's habitat needs in urban areas.

TI  - The promising combination of a remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a fine scale in urban planning
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Urban vegetation is often under-estimated. • Remote sensing at VHR is efficient to extract vegetation strata. • Landscape connectivity modelling is highly dependent on map quality. • The combination of remote sensing and landscape ecology is powerful. Urban landscapes are rapid changing ecosystems with diverse urban forms that impede the movement of organisms. Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape connectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and object-based image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations. Thus, the combination of this reproductible remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a very fine scale provides new insights into the characterisation of ecological networks for conservation planning.

TI  - Urban Landscape Genetics: Are Biologists Keeping Up with the Pace of Urbanization?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has the potential to jeopardize the sustainability of populations of organisms living within and dispersing across urban areas. Landscape genetics approaches offer a great promise for quantifying how urban features affect ecological and evolutionary processes for species living within and around cities. In this review, we assess the current state (2015–2020) of urban landscape genetics research, examining what types of urban features are quantified, what genetic measures are used, what species are studied, and in which geographic regions they are conducted. We then make recommendations for future research. We identified relatively few landscape genetic studies conducted within urban areas published in the last 5 years. We also found a publication bias towards certain taxa and geographic regions (mainly mammals studied in North America), based on results from relatively few molecular markers. These studies used varied measures of urbanization in their analysis, but the most common was urban land use/land cover measured at different resolutions, followed by buildings/development and transportation infrastructure (roads, railroads, and tramways). The results of these studies reflect previously conducted urban research findings that urban features may inhibit, facilitate, or have no correlation with gene flow, usually a product of which focal taxa is being studied, as well as what urban features are present/measured within variable cityscapes. We urge future research to directly measure urban features and stress the need for explicitly sampling within and around urban areas to gain full understanding of whether urbanization impedes, facilitates, or does not affect genetic differentiation between populations. To facilitate the development of robust theory, we urge the formation of a global network of urban landscape geneticists to collaborate and sample diverse taxa, in varied global landscapes and climates, and analyze genome-wide datasets for more robust conclusions about gene flow and genetic diversity. We advocate for analyzing urban features at multiple scales to allow broad conclusions about the effects of urbanization across studies, taxa, and regions. Finally, we recommend that study designs include social, cultural, and economic differences in human land use, which have the potential to affect how species disperse, survive, and reproduce in urban areas. Taking these factors into account, we can make novel advances in understanding how complex urban landscapes shape contemporary evolution.

TI  - Least‐cost path analysis for urban greenways planning: A test with moths and birds across two habitats and two cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - 1.One of the major planning tools to respond to urban landscape fragmentation is the development of ecological corridors, that is, interconnected networks of urban green and blue spaces. Least‐cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance‐based modelling method to respond to urban planners’ needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities.2.We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland‐dwelling moths and forest‐dwelling passerines, and to two medium‐sized cities.3.We used mark–release–recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch.4.Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP.5.Synthesis and applications. The convergence of the results for different biological models and across cities strengthens the relevance of LCP analysis for planning urban greenways and provides guidelines for landscape planners in the development of these corridors to favour the movement and survival of multiple urban species.

PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is a complex interplay of criminal groups’ control over land, illicit activities, and forest cover change in the Colombian Andes-Amazon region. This area is dealing with diverse forms of conflict and <jats:italic>peace,</jats:italic> directly impacting landscape connectivity. While many studies have documented rapid deforestation after the peace agreement in 2016, we know little about the effect of these socio-political changes on the state of landscape connectivity. We disentangle <jats:italic>habitat</jats:italic> from <jats:italic>connected habitat</jats:italic> in forest ecosystems using the Landsat archive and landscape connectivity indices. We find that in the Andes-Amazon region during 2000-2020, <jats:italic>connected habitat</jats:italic> loss reached 18%, while <jats:italic>habitat</jats:italic> loss was 13%. This result is worrisome, because it indicates that well-connected patches are more fragmented and isolated, affecting the natural connections between the Andes and Amazon biogeographical regions and the movement ability of species. The Colombian government should conduct a strategic <jats:italic>peacebuilding</jats:italic> process incorporating structural changes that prevent the increase of large-scale extractive activities that are often illegal in the region. While finding a balance between extractive activities and conservation remains a big challenge, legal land tenure, census/taxation, and specific agreements with local actors can initially prevent deforestation. We discourage localized military actions and the return of aerial fumigation of coca fields, which rather than stop deforestation might exacerbate land cover change deeper into pristine forests.</jats:p>

TI  - Usage of Urban Rivers by Gulls and Cormorants as Movement Pathways in Winter
PY  - 2020
AB  - For the long-term survival of bird populations in urban areas, it is necessary to protect both bird habitats fragmented by urbanization and potential pathways for movement between them. However, urban pathways for waterbirds have rarely been studied. Suspecting that certain waterbird species that visit inland waters would tend to move along rivers, as movement pathways, we surveyed waterbird movement along the Kanda River in Tokyo, Japan in the winter of 2017/2018. We defined those species that very frequently (more than 95% of all flights) flew along the river as “river travelers”. Three species, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus, and Herring Gull L. argentatus proved to be river-dependent movers that frequently used the Kanda River as a pathway. The gulls relied more heavily on the river as a movement pathway than the cormorant. In this sense, urban rivers may play a role for these species that is analogous to that of linear vegetated spaces for terrestrial birds. In addition, the distribution of river travelers (especially Black-headed Gull) may have been affected by the extent of riverside vegetation alongside, and highways covering, the river. To protect movement pathways for gulls and cormorants in urban areas, it is necessary to consider the differences among bird species in terms of their relative dependence on urban rivers as movement pathways and their comparative susceptibilities to the impact of manmade structures covering the rivers.

TI  - Functional connectivity in replicated urban landscapes in the land snail (Cornu aspersum).
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban areas are highly fragmented and thereby exert strong constraints on individual dispersal. Despite this, some species manage to persist in urban areas, such as the garden snail, Cornu aspersum, which is common in cityscapes despite its low mobility. Using landscape genetic approaches, we combined study area replication and multiscale analysis to determine how landscape composition, configuration and connectivity influence snail dispersal across urban areas. At the overall landscape scale, areas with a high percentage of roads decreased genetic differentiation between populations. At the population scale, genetic differentiation was positively linked with building surface, the proportion of borders where wooded patches and roads appeared side by side and the proportion of borders combining wooded patches and other impervious areas. Analyses based on pairwise genetic distances validated the isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance models for this land snail, with an equal fit to least-cost paths and circuit-theory-based models. Each of the 12 landscapes analysed separately yielded specific relations to environmental features, whereas analyses integrating all replicates highlighted general common effects. Our results suggest that urban transport infrastructures facilitate passive snail dispersal. At a local scale, corresponding to active dispersal, unfavourable habitats (wooded and impervious areas) isolate populations. This work upholds the use of replicated landscapes to increase the generalizability of landscape genetics results and shows how multiscale analyses provide insight into scale-dependent processes.

TI  - The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.

TI  - Determining Plant Diversity within Interconnected Natural Habitat Remnants (Ecological Network) in an Agricultural Landscape: A Matter of Sampling Design?
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>In intensively used and human-modified landscapes, biodiversity is often confined to remnants of natural habitats. Thus, identifying ecological networks (ENs) necessary to connect these patches and maintain high levels of biodiversity, not only for conservation but also for the effective management of the landscape, is required. However, ENs are often defined without a clear a-priori evaluation of their biodiversity and are seldom even monitored after their establishment. The objective of this study was to determine the adequate number of replicates to effectively characterize biodiversity content of natural habitats within the nodes of an EN in north-eastern Italy, based on vascular plant diversity. Plant communities within habitat types of the EN’s nodes were sampled through a hierarchical sampling design, evaluating both species richness and compositional dissimilarity. We developed an integrated method, consisting of multivariate measures of precision (MultSE), rarefaction curves and diversity partitioning approaches, which was applied to estimate the minimum number of replicates needed to characterize plant communities within the EN, evaluating also how the proposed optimization in sampling size affected the estimations of the characteristics of habitat types and nodes of the EN. We observed that reducing the total sampled replicates by 85.5% resulted to sufficiently characterize plant diversity of the whole EN, and by 72.5% to exhaustively distinguish plant communities among habitat types. This integrated method helped to fill the gap regarding the data collection to monitor biodiversity content within existing ENs, considering temporal and economic resources. We therefore suggest the use of this quantitative approach, based on probabilistic sampling, to conduct pilot studies in the context of ENs design and monitoring, and in general for habitat monitoring.</jats:p>

TI  - Gene flow and genetic drift in urban environments.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Evidence is growing that human modification of landscapes has dramatically altered evolutionary processes. In urban population genetic studies, urbanization is typically predicted to act as a barrier that isolates populations of species, leading to increased genetic drift within populations and reduced gene flow between populations. However, urbanization may also facilitate dispersal among populations, leading to higher genetic diversity within, and lower differentiation between, urban populations. We reviewed the literature on nonadaptive urban evolution to evaluate the support for each of these urban fragmentation and facilitation models. In a review of the literature with supporting quantitative analyses of 167 published urban population genetics studies, we found a weak signature of reduced within-population genetic diversity and no evidence of consistently increased between-population genetic differentiation associated with urbanization. In addition, we found that urban landscape features act as barriers or conduits to gene flow, depending on the species and city in question. Thus, we speculate that dispersal ability of species and environmental heterogeneity between cities contributes to the variation exhibited in our results. However, >90% of published studies reviewed here showed an association of urbanization with genetic drift or gene flow, highlighting the strong impact of urbanization on nonadaptive evolution. It is clear that species biology and city heterogeneity obscure patterns of genetic drift and gene flow in a quantitative analysis. Thus, we suggest that future research makes comparisons of multiple cities and nonurban habitats, and takes into consideration species' natural history, environmental variation, spatial modelling and marker selection.

TI  - Hydrological Connectivity Improves the Water-Related Environment in a Typical Arid Inland River Basin in Xinjiang, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Hydrological connectivity directly affects aquatic ecological processes, water environment and wetland ecological security, which is essential to the stability of arid ecosystems. However, the mechanism between hydrological connectivity and water-related environment has not been revealed completely. To address these issues, we use a landscape connectivity approach to assess the connectivity of water patches for analyzing the hydrological connectivity of the Bosten Lake Basin (BLB), as well as its response to human activities and climate change, based on the Joint Research Centre (JRC) global surface water dataset. It shows that the integral index of connectivity (IIC) of the BLB is low (ranging from 0 to 0.2) from 1990 to 2019, with an increasing interannual trend. The connectivity is higher in wet periods and in oases compared with dry periods and high-altitude mountain regions. Correlation and regression analyses indicate that hydrological connectivity has a strong correlation (r &gt; 0.5, p ≤ 0.05) with water area and water level. The interannual and seasonal trends of eight hydrochemical indices in the Bosten Lake have been investigated to systematically elaborate the complex relationships between hydrological connectivity and water quality in the BLB. Results indicated that better hydrological connectivity can improve water quality, and the minimum of pollutants were observed in high hydrological connectivity period, covering approximately 75% of the high-water quality period. These findings could provide scientific support for the water management in the BLB.</jats:p>

TI  - Evolution of life in urban environments.
PY  - 2017
AB  - BACKGROUND The extent of urban areas is increasing around the world, and most humans now live in cities. Urbanization results in dramatic environmental change, including increased temperatures, more impervious surface cover, altered hydrology, and elevated pollution. Urban areas also host more non-native species and reduced abundance and diversity of many native species. These environmental changes brought by global urbanization are creating novel ecosystems with unknown consequences for the evolution of life. Here, we consider how early human settlements led to the evolution of human commensals, including some of the most notorious pests and disease vectors. We also comprehensively review how contemporary urbanization affects the evolution of species that coinhabit cities. ADVANCES A recent surge of research shows that urbanization affects both nonadaptive and adaptive evolution. Some of the clearest results of urban evolution show that cities elevate the strength of random genetic drift (stochastic changes in allele frequencies) and restrict gene flow (the movement of alleles between populations due to dispersal and mating). Populations of native species in cities often represent either relicts that predate urbanization or populations that established after a city formed. Both scenarios frequently result in a loss of genetic diversity within populations and increased differentiation between populations. Fragmentation and urban infrastructure also create barriers to dispersal, and consequently, gene flow is often reduced among city populations, which further contributes to genetic differentiation between populations. The influence of urbanization on mutation and adaptive evolution are less clear. A small number of studies suggest that industrial pollution can elevate mutation rates, but the pervasiveness of this effect is unknown. A better studied phenomenon are the effects of urbanization on evolution by natural selection. A growing number of studies show that plant and animal populations experience divergent selection between urban and nonurban environments. This divergent selection has led to adaptive evolution in life history, morphology, physiology, behavior, and reproductive traits. These adaptations typically evolve in response to pesticide use, pollution, local climate, or the physical structure of cities. Despite these important results, the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is known from only a few cases. Most studies also examine only a few populations in one city, and experimental validation is rare. OUTLOOK The study of evolution in urban areas provides insights into both fundamental and applied problems in biology. The thousands of cities throughout the world share some features while differing in other aspects related to their age, historical context, governmental policies, and local climate. Thus, the phenomenon of global urbanization represents an unintended but highly replicated global study of experimental evolution. We can harness this global urban experiment to understand the repeatability and pace of evolution in response to human activity. Among the most important unresolved questions is, how often do native and exotic species adapt to the particular environmental challenges found in cities? Such adaptations could be the difference as to whether a species persists or vanishes from urban areas. In this way, the study of urban evolution can help us understand how evolution in populations may contribute to conservation of rare species, and how populations can be managed to facilitate the establishment of resilient and sustainable urban ecosystems. In a similar way, understanding evolution in urban areas can lead to improved human health. For example, human pests frequently adapt to pesticides and evade control efforts because of our limited understanding of the size of populations and movement of individuals. Applied evolutionary studies could lead to more effective mitigation of pests and disease agents. The study of urban evolution has rapidly become an important frontier in biology, with implications for healthy and sustainable human populations in urban ecosystems.

TI  - Urban Biodiversity and Landscape Ecology: Patterns, Processes and Planning
PY  - 2016
AB  - Effective planning for biodiversity in cities and towns is increasingly important as urban areas and their human populations grow, both to achieve conservation goals and because ecological communities support services on which humans depend. Landscape ecology provides important frameworks for understanding and conserving urban biodiversity both within cities and considering whole cities in their regional context, and has played an important role in the development of a substantial and expanding body of knowledge about urban landscapes and communities. Characteristics of the whole city including size, overall amount of green space, age and regional context are important considerations for understanding and planning for biotic assemblages at the scale of entire cities, but have received relatively little research attention. Studies of biodiversity within cities are more abundant and show that longstanding principles regarding how patch size, configuration and composition influence biodiversity apply to urban areas as they do in other habitats. However, the fine spatial scales at which urban areas are fragmented and the altered temporal dynamics compared to non-urban areas indicate a need to apply hierarchical multi-scalar landscape ecology models to urban environments. Transferring results from landscape-scale urban biodiversity research into planning remains challenging, not least because of the requirements for urban green space to provide multiple functions. An increasing array of tools is available to meet this challenge and increasingly requires ecologists to work with planners to address biodiversity challenges. Biodiversity conservation and enhancement is just one strand in urban planning, but is increasingly important in a rapidly urbanising world.

TI  - Using Bayesian Belief Networks to assess the influence of landscape connectivity on ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies in urban landscapes in the UK
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landscape connectivity is assumed to influence ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs and synergies. However, empirical studies of the effect of landscape connectivity on ES trade-offs and synergies are limited, especially in urban areas where the interactions between patterns and processes are complex. The objectives of this study were to use a Bayesian Belief Network approach to (1) assess whether functional connectivity drives ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas and (2) assess the influence of connectivity on the supply of ESs. We used circuit theory to model urban bird flow of P. major and C. caeruleus at a 2 m spatial resolution in Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes, UK, and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to assess the sensitivity of ES trade-offs and synergies model outputs to landscape and patch structural characteristics (patch area, connectivity and bird species abundance). We found that functional connectivity was the most influential variable in determining two of three ES trade-offs and synergies. Patch area and connectivity exerted a strong influence on ES trade-offs and synergies. Low patch area and low to moderately low connectivity were associated with high levels of ES trade-offs and synergies. This study demonstrates that landscape connectivity is an influential determinant of ES trade-offs and synergies and supports the conviction that larger and better-connected habitat patches increase ES provision. A BBN approach is proposed as a feasible method of ES trade-off and synergy prediction in complex landscapes. Our findings can prove to be informative for urban ES management.

TI  - Analysis of Ecological Blockage Pattern in Beijing Important Ecological Function Area, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>With the implementation of human activities, such as logging, reclamation, and construction, the increasing fragmentation of ecological space and the increasing blockage of biological migration corridors cause many threats to biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the Northwest Beijing Ecological Containment Area as the research area. Based on an integrated circuit theoretical model, we identified functional connectivity networks and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of ecological blockage patterns in the region from 1998–2018 in terms of the landscape connectivity, ecological breakpoints, pinch points, and barriers, respectively. The results show that the average remote sensing ecological index had a trend of decreasing and then increasing, and a total of 33, 34, and 63 habitat core areas and 70, 74, and 152 ecological corridors were identified in 1998, 2010, and 2018, respectively. The regions with high ecological blockage were mainly in the central part of Yanqing District, the southwest corner of the study area, and the eastern urban area. Although the number of potential ecological corridors gradually increases with the probability of migration in the study area, the blockage status and vulnerability of the ecological corridors continue to increase due to the conflict between land uses. The ecological status of the study area reflects the comprehensive effectiveness of the capital’s high-quality development under the strategic deployment of ecological civilization. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the effective protection and restoration of the ecological conditions in the ecological function areas is of great importance in guaranteeing the ecological quality and sustainable development of the country.</jats:p>

TI  - Canal structure influences watersnake assemblage structure in an urban environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The precise manner in which vertebrate species utilize urban environments remains to be explored in a variety of taxa, with snakes in particular being poorly studied. Watersnakes (Genus: <jats:italic>Nerodia</jats:italic>) are semiaquatic snakes found throughout the eastern United States and are known to occur in urban systems. Four species of watersnake are commonly found in freshwater environments in southeastern Louisiana: Mississippi Green Watersnake, Plain-bellied Watersnake, Southern Watersnake, and Diamond-backed Watersnake. Plain-bellied Watersnake and Southern Watersnake preferentially feed on anurans, while Mississippi Green Watersnake and Diamond-backed Watersnake tend to be more piscivorous in their feeding habits. Water depth is important in structuring anuran and fish community structure, with shallower water bodies typically supporting higher anuran abundance and richness, and deeper waters supporting more fishes. We examined watersnakes in canal transects of varying depth in Kenner, Louisiana to test the hypotheses that species that feed on anurans would be more abundant in shallower canals, while species that preferentially feed on fishes would be more abundant in deeper canals. We found significant correlation between watersnake assemblage and anuran/fish community structure, with the Plain-bellied Watersnake most abundant in the shallowest canal transects, Mississippi Green Watersnake most abundant in transects of intermediate depth, and Diamond-backed Watersnake most abundant in the shallow transects. The former two species largely followed the hypothesized trends, while the Diamond-backed Watersnake did not.</jats:p>

TI  - Linking ecosystem services, urban form and green space configuration using multivariate landscape metric analysis.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix. We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision. We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance. When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit. Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.

TI  - Actions, indicators, and outputs in urban biodiversity plans: A multinational analysis of city practice.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban biodiversity offers important benefits to residents and may be crucial to reaching global biodiversity conservation targets, but little research has been conducted on how cities actually plan for biodiversity. In this study, we conducted a mixed methods content analysis of biodiversity plans by 39 cities around the world to determine whether they measured their actions, how they did so (via quantitative indicators and qualitative outputs), and what topics these actions and measures covered. We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science. Indicators were the most common measures for native biodiversity and ecosystem service topics, while outputs were the most common measures for governance and management. Our results may inform the revision and development of urban biodiversity indicators in the post-2020 framework and of other initiatives that guide cities in contributing to local and global biodiversity goals.

TI  - Invasive alien plant species, fragmentation and scale effects on urban forest community composition in Durban, South Africa
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban forests are under increased pressure from invasion by exotic (alien) species. The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts. Fifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m2 plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales. Canopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests. Canopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs.

TI  - Planting gardens to support insect pollinators
PY  - 2019
AB  - Global insect pollinator declines have prompted habitat restoration efforts, including pollinator-friendly gardening. Gardens can provide nectar and pollen for adult insects and offer reproductive resources, such as nesting sites and caterpillar host plants. We conducted a review and meta-analysis to examine how decisions made by gardeners on plant selection and garden maintenance influence pollinator survival, abundance, and diversity. We also considered characteristics of surrounding landscapes and the impacts of pollinator natural enemies. Our results indicated that pollinators responded positively to high plant species diversity, woody vegetation, garden size, and sun exposure and negatively to the separation of garden habitats from natural sites. Within-garden features more strongly influenced pollinators than surrounding landscape factors. Growing interest in gardening for pollinators highlights the need to better understand how gardens contribute to pollinator conservation and how some garden characteristics can enhance the attractiveness and usefulness of gardens to pollinators. Further studies examining pollinator reproduction, resource acquisition, and natural enemies in gardens and comparing gardens with other restoration efforts and to natural habitats are needed to increase the value of human-made habitats for pollinators.

TI  - Network analysis of sea turtle movements and connectivity: A tool for conservation prioritization
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of animal movements is a critical element in conserving long-lived, highly mobile marine species. Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts. Location Global. Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections. Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links. Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.

TI  - Coupling Analysis of the Thermal Landscape and Environmental Carrying Capacity of Urban Expansion in Beijing (China) over the Past 35 Years
PY  - 2021
AB  - In this study, we aim to carry out a coupling analysis of the thermal landscape and environmental carrying capacity of urban expansion in Beijing over the past 35 years to provide scientific grounding for city planning. The paper proposes a conceptual framework and develops an integrated quantitative approach to the coupling analysis between urban expansion, the urban ecological environment, and the urban landscape, including the Urban Eco-Environment Carrying Capacity Index (ECI), Landscape Spatial Structure Index, Landscape Thermal Index (LTI), and Transitional Landscape Index (TLI, Markov Chain Model). Urban expansion has been essentially dominated by policy adjustments and has been further influenced by socioeconomic development, which has contributed to four outbreaks of urban sprawl in Beijing. Urban expansion is an essential factor affecting ecological environment change. The Olympic Games in 2008 was the turning point for the urban landscape. The rate of urban expansion and improvement of the ecological landscape all changed significantly around the year 2008. The urban thermal distribution pattern coincided well with the featured landscape patches, representing an obvious reflection of the difference between urban green spaces and construction, while high-temperature areas were abundant in the urban center. Urban expansion has a positive effect on the ecological environment and landscape pattern when it is fully matured and well planned. It is expected that, by 2025, the ecological environment of Beijing will be significantly improved, and the proportion of high-temperature areas will decrease.

TI  - Implementing the connectivity of natural areas in cities as an indicator in the City Biodiversity Index (CBI)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The City Biodiversity Index (CBI), or Singapore Index on Cities’ Biodiversity, serves as a tool to monitor biodiversity in cities and was endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2009. Indicator 2 of the CBI measures the connectivity of natural areas in cities. We propose an improved and straightforward method for measuring connectivity based on the effective mesh size metric to replace the previous method used in the CBI. The previous version did not account for intra-patch (within-patch) connectivity nor for major barriers. Our evaluation of the new version of Indicator 2 through its application to Montreal and Lisbon confirmed its reliability. In Montreal, natural areas have a total connectivity value of 581.7 ha, the majority of which exists between, rather than within, patches of natural area. Smaller patches (

TI  - Community heterogeneity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in urban ponds at a multi-city scale
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose: Urbanisation is a leading cause of biotic homogenisation in urban ecosystems. However, there has been little research examining the effect of urbanisation and biotic homogenisation on aquatic communities, and few studies have compared findings across different urban landscapes. We assessed the processes that structure aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity within five UK cities and characterise the heterogeneity of pond macroinvertebrate communities within and among urban areas. Methods: A total of 132 ponds were sampled for invertebrates to characterise biological communities of ponds across five UK cities. Variation among sites within cities, and variation among urban settlements, was partitioned into components of beta diversity relating to turnover and nestedness. Results: We recorded 337 macroinvertebrate taxa, and species turnover almost entirely accounted for the high beta-diversity recorded within each urban area and when all ponds were considered. A total of 40% of all macroinvertebrates recorded were unique to a particular urban settlement. In contrast to the homogenisation of terrestrial and lotic communities in urban landscapes reported in the literature, ponds support highly heterogeneous communities within and among urban settlements. Conclusions: The high species turnover (species replacement) recorded in this study demonstrates that urban pond biodiversity conservation would be most efficient at a landscape-scale, rather than at the individual ponds scale. Pond conservation practices need to consider the spatial organization of ecological communities (landscape-scale) to ensure that the maximum possible biodiversity can be protected.

TI  - Rapid loss in landscape connectivity after the peace agreement in the Andes-Amazon region
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is a complex interplay of criminal groups’ control over land, illicit activities, and forest cover change in the Colombian Andes-Amazon region. This area is dealing with diverse forms of conflict and peace, directly impacting landscape connectivity. While many studies have documented rapid deforestation after the peace agreement in 2016, we know little about the effect of these socio-political changes on the state of landscape connectivity. We disentangle habitat from connected habitat in forest ecosystems using the Landsat archive and landscape connectivity indices. We find that in the Andes-Amazon region during 2000–2020, connected habitat loss reached 18%, while habitat loss was 13%. This result is worrisome because it indicates that well-connected patches are more fragmented and isolated, affecting the natural connections between the Andes and Amazon biogeographical regions and the movement ability of species. The Colombian government should conduct a strategic peacebuilding process incorporating structural changes that prevent the increase of large-scale extractive activities that are often illegal in the region. While finding a balance between extractive activities and conservation remains a big challenge, legal land tenure, census/taxation, and specific agreements with local actors can initially prevent deforestation. We discourage localized military actions and the return of aerial fumigation of coca fields, which rather than stop deforestation might exacerbate land cover change deeper into pristine forests. • De-escalation of conflict coincides with intra-annual deforestation dynamics in Colombia. • Connected habitat loss (18%) is higher than habitat available (13%) during 2000–2020. • Rapid fragmentation of well-connected forest patches can affect the biological connection between the Andes-Amazon biomes. • Reachable habitat for species is now less than the habitat available. • Conservation strategies should focus on developing agreements with local communities.

TI  - Research on Ecological Infrastructure from 1990 to 2018: A Bibliometric Analysis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ecological infrastructure (EI), as the composite system on which the sustainable development of cities depends, has attracted worldwide attention. Considering refined methodologies and broad scope, researchers lacked overall understanding of research patterns and evolutionary processes on EI-related issues. In this study, we applied the bibliometric approach to describe the current situation of EI-related research, and reveal research trends. Based on the Web of Science Core Collection, the bibliometric analysis of EI-related publications from 1990 to 2018 was performed to discuss the history and present research situation of EI, and preview research prospect. The results showed that: (1) the number of EI-related publications has surged astonishingly worldwide over the last three decades; (2) countries in Europe and North America were the first to invest heavily in EI-related research, while China started later but subsequently developed rapidly; (3) the EI-related research focuses were EI-related management, methods for countering extreme meteorological phenomena, providing ecosystem services, and protecting biodiversity; and (4) the EI-related research frontiers included the design of EI, policy research on EI, role of EI in environmental governance, and research on the adaptability of EI.

TI  - Urban specialization reduces habitat connectivity by a highly mobile wading bird
PY  - 2020
AB  - Mobile animals transport nutrients and propagules across habitats, and are crucial for the functioning of food webs and for ecosystem services. Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes. Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type. We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity. Habitat specialization in urban-acclimated wildlife could reduce the exchange of propagules and nutrients between urban and natural areas, which has consequences both for beneficial effects of connectivity such as gene flow and for detrimental effects such as the spread of contaminants or pathogens.

TI  - Pollinator-Mediated Gene Flow Connects Green Roof Populations across the Urban Matrix: A Paternity Analysis of the Self-Compatible Forb Penstemon hirsutus
PY  - 2019
AB  - Gene flow between populations can help maintain genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding, which is especially important for small, fragmented habitats. Many plant species rely on pollinators to move pollen between populations. In urban areas, insufficient pollinator services may result in limited gene flow, which can have negative consequences such as genetic drift and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, restored populations that are established with few founders of low genetic diversity may have limited long-term population persistence. Here, we tested the hypotheses that populations of a self-compatible forb established on urban green roofs from nursery stock are genetically depauperate and that limited gene (pollen) flow between populations will result in increased inbreeding. We compared the neutral genetic diversity of Penstemon hirsutus, using nine microsatellite loci, between three green roof populations established from nursery stock and three natural populations. We also established ten experimental populations on green roofs and measured rates of outcrossing and inbreeding and identified the movement of pollen within and between roofs using a paternity analysis. We found that neutral genetic diversity of populations established from nursery stock was lower than that of natural populations, although the level of inbreeding was also lower on the green roofs. In our experimental populations, we found that the rates of outcrossing and inbreeding varied between the roof populations. Our results suggest that inbreeding may be correlated with cover of co-flowering species but not with any of the other measured site properties. The location of likely pollen donors suggested that on average, 75% of pollen was derived from plants within the population (including self) and 25% came from plants on different roofs. Our results document realized pollen movement within and between green roofs, demonstrating that these habitats provide important connectivity in a fragmented environment.

TI  - Effective conservation planning of Iberian amphibians based on a regionalization of climate-driven range shifts.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Amphibians are severely affected by climate change, particularly in regions where droughts prevail and water availability is scarce. The extirpation of amphibians triggers cascading effects that disrupt the trophic structure of food webs and ecosystems. Dedicated assessments of the spatial adaptive potential of amphibian species under climate change are, therefore, essential to provide guidelines for their effective conservation. I used predictions about the location of suitable climates for 27 amphibian species in the Iberian Peninsula from a baseline period to 2080 to typify shifting species' ranges. The time at which these range types are expected to be functionally important for the adaptation of a species was used to identify full or partial refugia; areas most likely to be the home of populations moving into new climatically suitable grounds; areas most likely to receive populations after climate adaptive dispersal; and climatically unsuitable areas near suitable areas. I implemented an area prioritization protocol for each species to obtain a cohesive set of areas that would provide maximum adaptability and where management interventions should be prioritized. A connectivity assessment pinpointed where facilitative strategies would be most effective. Each of the 27 species had distinct spatial requirements but, common to all species, a bottleneck effect was predicted by 2050 because source areas for subsequent dispersal were small in extent. Three species emerged as difficult to maintain up to 2080. The Iberian northwest was predicted to capture adaptive range for most species. My study offers analytical guidelines for managers and decision makers to undertake systematic assessments on where and when to intervene to maximize the persistence of amphibian species and the functionality of the ecosystems that depend on them.

TI  - Soil Mesofauna Community Changes in Response to the Environmental Gradients of Urbanization in Guangzhou City
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recently, there is an increasing interesting on how urbanization affects soil fauna community. However, previous studies primarily focused on some limited landuse types or line transect of urban-rural gradients. On family and higher taxonomic levels, we investigated the changes of soil mesofauna community with urbanization intensity along different disturbance features in 47 sites evenly located in Guangzhou downtown and the adjacent region. The 47 studied sites were classified into four ecosystem types with increasing urbanization intensity including rural forest, urban forest, urban woodland and urban park, mainly according to the location (rural/urban), vegetation cover, and management intensity. Firstly,the results showed that soil mesofauna abundance and diversity decreased with increasing soil pH, total nitrogen content (TN) and heavy metal comprehensive index (CPI). Soil Pb depressed soil mesofauna species richness and regulated soil mesofauna community structure.Secondly, we found impervious surface (IS) proportion did not predicate changes in soil mesofauna abundance, diversity or community structure. However, we found IS proportion were positively correlated with soil pH, soil TN and CPI. In contrast, site area was positively correlated with soil mesofauna abundance after excluding the sites belonged to rural forest and urban park. Site area was negatively correlated with soil pH and CPI. Thirdly, our results showed significant differences in soil property, landscape trait and soil mesofauna community among the four ecosystem types. Interestingly, urban forest, the one with light urbanization disturbance, had the highest soil mesofauna abundance. Our results also showed that urban woodland and urban park had distinct mesofauna community structures compared to those in rural forest and urban forest. In conclusion, the present study revealed that (1) soil property changes due to urbanization, such as increased pH and accumulated heavy metal in urban soil, depressed soil mesofauna abundance and diversity, changed community structure, and they mediated the effect of landscape change on soil mesofauna community; (2) however, soil and landscape changes could not explain the increase of abundance in urban forest, which supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

TI  - Habitat, geophysical, and eco-social connectivity: benefits of resilient socio–ecological landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Connections among ecosystems and their components are critical to maintaining ecological functions and benefits in human-modified landscapes, including urban areas. However, the literature on connectivity and ecosystem services has been limited by inconsistent terminology and methods, and largely omits human access to nature and its benefits as a form of connectivity. In this paper, we build upon previous research and theory to define distinct categories of connectivity, considering both ecological and social dimensions, and identify ecosystem services that are supported by them. We reviewed the literature to determine socio–ecological benefits that depend on the categories of connectivity. We identified four distinct but interrelated categories of connectivity: landscape, habitat, geophysical, and eco-social connectivity. Each connectivity category directly or indirectly supports many ecosystem services. There are overlaps, conflicts, and synergies among connectivity categories and their associated services and disservices. Identifying the services that arise from these four categories of connectivity, and how they interact, can help build a common understanding of the value of connectivity to maximize its benefits, improve understanding of complex socio–ecological systems across disciplines, and develop more holistic, socially equitable decision-making processes, especially in urban landscapes.

AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a ‘renaturing’ strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

TI  - Parrots and the city: modeling potential corridors in an urban environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide problem affecting wildlife negatively. Cities cause habitat suppression, fragmentation, among other disease spreading, suitable conditions for exotic species, and direct animal kills—consequently, local native species might be extinct. Still, urban areas can also provide biodiversity maintenance because some species can be adapted to the urban environment. Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix. By managing the spatial heterogeneity, it is possible to direct how the species use the space, promoting the displacement to desired areas, avoiding the more urbanized ones.

TI  - Fractal analysis of green roof spatial implementation in European cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract To face the consequences of climate change and unsustainable urbanization, green roofs are currently widely implemented in urban environments. Despite their benefits to restore ecosystem services are quite well established at the roof scale, green roofs need to be widely and appropriately distributed to perform efficiently at larger scales. However for now, this scale-factor is not considered to guide and conduct green roof implementation policies. Here we show that a multi-scale analysis based on fractal theory is helpful in providing information for green roof implementation and in assessing the relevance of these policies. Computed for 9 European cities, green roofs fractal dimensions are sparse, ranging 0.49 to 1.35, and illustrate some different degrees of progress in urban greening. These results demonstrate some significant inconsistencies between political ambition and their in situ realization, and the necessity to better take into account the spatial distribution of green roof implementations in order to optimize their performances.

TI  - Human activities and landscape features interact to closely define the distribution and dispersal of an urban commensal.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The rock pigeon, Columba livia, is a cosmopolitan human commensal, domesticated thousands of years ago. However, the human-mediated factors governing its distribution and dispersal are not well understood. In this study, we performed (a) hierarchical distance sampling on ~400 island-wide point transects, (b) a population genomic inquiry based on ~7,000 SNPs from almost 150 individuals, and (c) landscape genomic analyses on the basis of extensive ecological and socio-economic databases to characterize the distribution and dispersal patterns of rock pigeons across Singapore. Our distance sampling results indicated that the volume of intentional "mercy feeding" and availability of high-rise buildings are the most reliable predictors of high pigeon densities in Singapore. Genomic analyses demonstrated that rock pigeons in Singapore form a single population possibly derived from rapid expansion from a genetically homogenous group of founder individuals. In specific, rock pigeons in Singapore lack sex-biased dispersal and are clustered with a genetic patch size of ~3 km. Landscape genomic analyses of great precision pointed to the presence of dense trees as agents of resistance to dispersal, whereas a high road density reduces this resistance. By pinpointing a range of ecological and socio-economic variables determining the distribution and dispersal of pigeons, our study provides urban planners with the tools for optimal management of this human commensal, such as a curtailment of the practice of mercy feeding and modifications to the urban landscape to reduce pigeon density and to lower the likelihood of repopulation by dispersal.

TI  - Inconsistent Patterns of Soil Fauna Biodiversity and Soil Physicochemical Characteristic Along an Urbanization Gradient
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urbanization has induced substantial changes in soil physicochemical characteristic, which plays an important role in regulating soil fauna biodiversity in forests and grasslands. However, less is known about the urbanization effect on soil fauna biodiversity and how soil physicochemical changes mediate this effect. Along an urbanization gradient in the city of Guangzhou, we established four sites with different urbanization intensities, including an urban site, two suburban sites, and a rural site, and then studied their soil physicochemical characteristic and soil fauna biodiversity. The soil physicochemical characteristic dramatically changed along the urbanization gradient. In contrast, the soil fauna biodiversity exhibited a very different pattern. Soil fauna abundance was highest in the suburban sites. Moreover, there were significant changes of Pielou’s evenness and community structure in the suburban sites. Soil fauna biodiversity property in the urban site was similar to that in the rural site, except that the rural site was characterized by Enchytraeidae while the urban site was not characterized by any taxa. Our linear and canonical correspondence analysis models suggested that soil physicochemical characteristic only contributed a little to the variance of soil fauna abundance (19%), taxa number (27%), and community structure (12%). In contrast, soil physicochemical characteristic explained about half of the variance in Shannon’s diversity and Pielou’s evenness. However, with urbanization intensity increasing, soil physicochemical changes could both increase and decrease the diversity and evenness. Thus, our results revealed an inconsistent pattern between soil fauna biodiversity and soil physicochemical characteristic along an urbanization gradient. This study suggested that soil physicochemical change was less important as expected in regulating soil fauna biodiversity pattern under an urbanization context. To elucidate the effect of urbanization on soil fauna biodiversity, further studies should take other urbanization agents into account.</jats:p>

TI  - Garden Bird Feeding: Insights and Prospects from a North-South Comparison of This Global Urban Phenomenon
PY  - 2017
AB  - Intentional feeding of wild birds in gardens or backyards is one of the most popular forms of human-wildlife interactions in the developed world, especially in urban environments. Scale and intensity of bird feeding are enormous with mainly birdseed consumed daily by a range of species. This represents a subsidy to natural diets of birds attracted to the feeders and typically involves novel dietary components. Yet, relatively little is known about how it influences the behavior and ecology of the species visiting feeders. In part, research has been hampered by logistical difficulties of working in urban areas but studies have demonstrated powerful influences on behavior and phenology of avian breeding, the spread of disease, and the structure of avian communities. Here, we compare bird feeding between Northern and Southern Hemispheres as a means of exploring how similarities and differences in avian responses might inform knowledge of this global urban phenomenon. We start by tracing its origins to north-western Europe and how its expansion has occurred before considering how geographical differences in feeding practices and attitudes map onto bird feeding ‘on the ground’. We explore some of the major emerging themes of recent interest, including why citizens are motivated to feed birds, whether birds become fully dependent on food supplements, the role of feeding in avian disease transmission, and how feeding changes urban bird communities. By proposing that scientists work in collaboration with the public providing food to birds, we pose key research questions that need to be answered urgently and suggest accompanying experimental approaches to do so. These approaches are essential if we are to improve our understanding of how bird feeding shapes the behavior, ecology, movements, and community structure of urban birds. Our hope is that through such citizen science we will be able to provide advice as to location-relevant practices that should maximise benefits to both urban biodiversity and human wellbeing, and minimise potential adverse impacts. We demonstrate that bird feeding is important for urban biodiversity conservation, community engagement, and in establishing personal connections with nature and their associated benefits.

TI  - Permanencia de la cobertura natural en dos propuestas de conectividad entre áreas silvestres protegidas de Costa Rica
PY  - 2019
AB  - Introduction: Riparian zones are an alternative for connectivity in landscapes where natural cover has been fragmented. Objective: To analyze structural connectivity between two protected wildlife areas of Costa Rica, through riparian zones, and an officially established route. Methods: The two protected wildlife areas were Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve and Miravalles Protective Zone, Guanacaste province. Using supervised classification of Landsat images from years 1997 and 2017, land cover was obtained for riparian zones and the official route. Based on this information, forest permanence was analyzed and several fragmentation indicators calculated for the two connectivity proposals. Results: Forest was more extensive and permanent in the riparian zones; nevertheless, both connectivity proposals had interruptions in connectivity and isolated forest sectors. In the official route, interruption was caused mainly by urban areas; riparian zones were interrupted by agriculture. Conclusion: Riparian zones would also provide good structural connectivity, but they need to recover such connectivity too.

TI  - Blue-space availability, environmental quality and amenity use across contrasting socioeconomic contexts
PY  - 2022
AB  - Over 60% of the global population are expected to live in urban areas by 2050. Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution. • Access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients. • Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status. • Environmental quality may exacerbate unequal blue space distribution. • Healthy ecosystems are required to be resilient to increased future disturbances. • The implications for society of uneven blue space quality need to be researched.

TI  - Research progress on habitat connectivity in coastal waters: A review
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecological connectivity, as a research method related to spatial ecology and conservation biology, has attracted increasing attention from researchers at home and abroad in recent years. Habitat connectivity, as a key link in ecological connectivity, is of great significance to promote coastal ecological restoration and protection. However, there has been less systematic research about habitat connectivity due to lack of corresponding theories and practices. Therefore, this paper discusses habitat connectivity from three aspects: (1) the concept of habitat connectivity is introduced and clarified; (2) the application of connectivity in artificial habitat and adjacent waters and its relationship with biodiversity conservation are reviewed and illustrated with examples; and (3) the future development trends of this research direction are summarized and prospected in order to provide a scientific basis and useful reference for the related work of coastal restoration projects in China. Generally, this paper argues that an increase in human behaviour irreversibly destroys the connectivity between marine habitats and threatens the spatial and temporal scales of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Therefore, the theoretical research results and practical experience of ecological connectivity should be fully applied to marine ecosystems, and the restoration of degraded ecosystems should be encouraged and supported in ways that promote natural recovery.

TI  - The evolutionary consequences of human–wildlife conflict in cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Human-wildlife interactions, including human-wildlife conflict, are increasingly common as expanding urbanization worldwide creates more opportunities for people to encounter wildlife. Wildlife-vehicle collisions, zoonotic disease transmission, property damage, and physical attacks to people or their pets have negative consequences for both people and wildlife, underscoring the need for comprehensive strategies that mitigate and prevent conflict altogether. Management techniques often aim to deter, relocate, or remove individual organisms, all of which may present a significant selective force in both urban and nonurban systems. Management-induced selection may significantly affect the adaptive or nonadaptive evolutionary processes of urban populations, yet few studies explicate the links among conflict, wildlife management, and urban evolution. Moreover, the intensity of conflict management can vary considerably by taxon, public perception, policy, religious and cultural beliefs, and geographic region, which underscores the complexity of developing flexible tools to reduce conflict. Here, we present a cross-disciplinary perspective that integrates human-wildlife conflict, wildlife management, and urban evolution to address how social-ecological processes drive wildlife adaptation in cities. We emphasize that variance in implemented management actions shapes the strength and rate of phenotypic and evolutionary change. We also consider how specific management strategies either promote genetic or plastic changes, and how leveraging those biological inferences could help optimize management actions while minimizing conflict. Investigating human-wildlife conflict as an evolutionary phenomenon may provide insights into how conflict arises and how management plays a critical role in shaping urban wildlife phenotypes.

TI  - Towards an integrative approach to evaluate the environmental ecosystem services provided by urban forest
PY  - 2019
AB  - As a Nature-Based Solution, urban forests deliver a number of environmental ecosystem services (EESs). To quantify these EESs, well-defined, reliable, quantifiable and stable indicators are needed. With literature analysis and expert knowledge gathered within COST Action FP1204 GreenInUrbs, we proposed a classification of urban forest EESs into three categories: (A) regulation of air, water, soil and climate; (B) provisioning of habitat quality; and (C) provisioning of other goods and services. Each category is divided into EES types: (a) amelioration of air quality; restoration of soil and water; amelioration of the microclimate; removal of CO2 from the air; (b) provision of habitat for biodiversity; support for resilient urban ecosystems; provision of genetic diversity; and (c) provision of energy and nutrients; provision of grey infrastructure resilience. Each EES type provides one or more benefits. For each of these 12 benefits, we propose a set of indicators to be used when analyzing the impacts on the identified EESs. Around half of the 36 indicators are relevant to more than one single benefit, which highlights complex interrelationships. The indicators of wider applicability are tree and stand characteristics, followed by leaf physical traits and tree species composition. This knowledge is needed for the optimization of the EESs delivered by urban forests, now and in the future.

TI  - Reducing light pollution improves connectivity for bats in urban landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Light pollution can alter animal movements and landscape connectivity. This is particularly true in urban landscapes where a need to incorporate conservation issues in urban planning is urgent. We investigated how potential light-reduction scenarios at conurbation scale change landscape connectivity for bats. Through random stratified sampling and species distribution modelling, we assessed the relative importance of light pollution on bat presence probability and activity. We recorded bats during one entire night on each 305 sampling points in 2015. In 2016, we surveyed 94 supplementary points to evaluate models performance. We used our spatial predictions to characterize landscape resistance to bat movements. Then we applied a least-cost modelling approach to identify nocturnal corridors and estimated the impact of five light-reduction scenarios on landscape connectivity for two light non-tolerant bat species. We found that light pollution detected from satellite images was a good predictor of bat presence and activity up to 700 m radius. Our results exhibited contrasting responses to average radiance: M. daubentonii responded negatively, P. nathusii had a positive response for low values then a negative response after a threshold radiance value of 20 W.m−2.sr−1 and E. serotinus responded positively. Five and four light-reduction scenarios significantly improved landscape connectivity for M. daubentonii and P. nathusii respectively. Light-reduction measures should be included in urban planning to provide sustainable conditions for bats in cities. We advocate for the use of our methodological approach to further studies to find the best trade-off between conservation needs and social acceptability.

TI  - Ecological Connectivity in Agricultural Green Infrastructure: Suggested Criteria for Fine Scale Assessment and Planning
PY  - 2021
AB  - In promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service capacity, landscape connectivity is considered a critical feature to counteract the negative effects of fragmentation. Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Notwithstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requalification of transitional urban–rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions.

TI  - Citizen Science and the Urban Ecology of Birds and Butterflies - A Systematic Review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Citizen science has gained widespread currency as a tool for ecological research over the past decade. However, in the discipline of urban ecology, the existing contributions and future potential of citizen science engagement, specifically in terms of knowledge gain, have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here, we present a systematic review of published work on the urban ecology of birds and butterflies in relation to their use of citizen science data between 2005 and 2014. We compared the number of studies that used citizen science data to the number of studies that could potentially have employed data derived from citizen science. The take-up rates of citizen science data were 21% and 26% for birds and butterflies respectively. Most studies that employed citizen science used volunteer-derived data as primary data, and adopted Collegial, Collaborative and Contributional engagement modes to the exclusion of Contractual and Co-created arrangements. There was no evidence that citizen science studies investigated a different organismal scale (community vs. species) compared to the urban ecology literature. For both taxa, citizen science contributions were lower than expected compared to their representation in the urban ecology literature for studies on species-environment relationships at landscape and micro-environment scales, as well as behavioural ecology in general. Other research topics that could benefit from further citizen science involvement include breeding studies and guild analyses for birds, and multi-taxa studies for butterflies. Promising models of citizen science engagement for urban ecology are highlighted in relation to their thematic foci and methodological detail, and a number of research questions that could be productively addressed using citizen science are identified. The dynamics of contemporary engagement between citizen science and urban ecology described by this review could inform the design and refinement of urban ecology–citizen science programmes in order to optimise their scientific contributions.

TI  - The seven lamps of planning for biodiversity in the city
PY  - 2018
AB  - Cities tend to be built in areas of high biodiversity, and the accelerating pace of urbanization threatens the persistence of many species and ecological communities globally. However, urban environments also offer unique prospects for biological conservation, with multiple benefits for humans and other species. We present seven ecological principles to conserve and increase the biodiversity of cities, using metaphors to bridge the gap between the languages of built-environment and conservation professionals. We draw upon John Ruskin's famous essay on the seven lamps of architecture, but more generally on the thinking of built-environment pioneers such as Patrick Geddes (1854–1932) who proposed a synoptic view of the urban environment that included humans and non-humans alike. To explain each principle or ‘lamp’ of urban biodiversity, we use an understanding from the built-environment disciplines as a base and demonstrate through metaphor that planning for the more-than-human does not require a conceptual leap. We conclude our discussion with ten practical strategies for turning on these lamps in cities. Urban planners, architects, landscape architects, engineers and other built-environmental professionals have a key role to play in a paradigm shift to plan for the more-than-human, because of their direct influence on the evolving urban environment. This essay is intended to increase dialogue between ecologists and members of these professions, and thus increase the biodiversity of cities around the world.

This burgeoning field enables the improvement of population monitoring and conservation efforts, particularly for small, elusive animals where data collection is difficult. Device attachment usually requires species-specific solutions to ensure that data loggers exert minimal influence on the animal's behavior and physiology, and ensure high reliability of data capture. External features or peculiar body shapes often make securing devices difficult for long-term monitoring, as in the case with small spiny mammals. Here, we present a method that enables high-resolution, long-term investigations of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) via GPS and acceleration loggers. We collected data from 17 wild hedgehogs with devices attached between 9 and 42 days. Our results showed that hedgehogs behaved naturally; as individuals curled, moved through dense vegetation, slipped under fences and built regular day nests without any indication of impediment. Our novel method makes it possible to not only attach high-precision devices for substantially longer than previous efforts, but enables detachment and reattachment of devices to the same individual. This makes it possible to quickly respond to unforeseen events and exchange devices, and overcomes the issue of short battery life common to many lightweight loggers.

TI  - Cityscape genetics: structural vs. functional connectivity of an urban lizard population.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Functional connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of populations. However, many studies assess connectivity with a focus on structural connectivity only. Cityscapes, namely urban landscapes, are particularly dynamic and include numerous potential anthropogenic barriers to animal movements, such as roads, traffic or buildings. To assess and compare structural connectivity of habitats and functional connectivity of gene flow of an urban lizard, we here combined species distribution models (SDMs) with an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. The most important environmental factors of the SDMs are structural diversity and substrate type, with high and medium levels of structural diversity as well as open and rocky/gravel substrates contributing most to structural connectivity. By contrast, water cover was the best model of all environmental factors following landscape genetic optimization. The river is thus a major barrier to gene flow, while of the typical anthropogenic factors only buildings showed an effect. Nonetheless, using SDMs as a basis for landscape genetic optimization provided the highest ranked model for functional connectivity. Optimizing SDMs in this way can provide a sound basis for models of gene flow of the cityscape, and elsewhere, while presence-only and presence-absence modelling approaches showed differences in performance. Additionally, interpretation of results based on SDM factor importance can be misleading, dictating more thorough analyses following optimization of SDMs. Such approaches can be adopted for management strategies, for example aiming to connect native common wall lizard populations or disconnect them from non-native introduced populations, which are currently spreading in many cities in Central Europe.

TI  - Italian landscape macrosystem (ILM) from urban pressure to a National Wildway
PY  - 2020
AB  - Thirty years after the widespread establishment of the concepts of environmental continuity in Europe and Italy, linked to the EU Habitat Directive and the Natura 2000 project, these have almost completely lost their impetus. After having fostered a very intense scientific and political/administrative/managerial period, these concepts have produced only a few virtuous examples of implementation. The study presented in this paper shows that today national environmental quality is almost entirely based on land use categories that are scarcely protected and not subject to sufficiently binding planning. Moreover, their functional structure and extension/quality depend on how the local and global market impact spatially complementary categories mostly affected by anthropic action, which instead undergo efficiently planned changes. From the fundamental paradigm of "ecological networks" the interests of the scientific world and local authorities have shifted to other fronts, losing that physical and conceptual cohesion inherent in "environmental continuity" as a value in itself. The availability of recent, very advanced data helps take stock of this issue and verify critical points on the national territory that have been unresolved for several decades, but still rife with potential for the application of models of international value.

TI  - Advancing Urban Ecology in the Global South: Emerging Themes and Future Research Directions
PY  - 2021
AB  - The rapid growth in urban ecological research and application has been led by countries of the Global North, particularly Europe and the USA, albeit not restricted to them. However, this belies that most urban growth is currently in the Global South, with the differential set to increase in the future. Thus, there is an imbalance between where the bulk of urban ecological research and framings are developed and where the majority of urban citizens globally live, work and seek to meet their aspirations. This chapter illustrates how this book addressed the identified research gaps in the Global South. We also highlight dominant recurring themes in Global South research discourse and importantly, where future research efforts over the next decade should be focussed. Eight themes are considered, namely: inequality; informality; urban–rural links; small and medium-sized towns and cities; urban green infrastructure, biodiversity and ecosystem services; understanding and accommodating multiple worldviews of urban nature; human health and urban nature; and specific research approaches.

TI  - A framework to select strategies for conserving and restoring habitat connectivity in complex landscapes
PY  - 2022
AB  - Protecting or restoring habitat connectivity in landscapes undergoing rapid environmental change requires multiple conservation and restoration strategies. These strategies have different risk profiles, costs, and require various types of technical expertise to conduct. This diversity in landscape context and strategic approach requires more nuance and flexibility than traditional connectivity conservation plans have supported. We present a novel, spatially-explicit framework for developing connectivity conservation priorities and strategies based on Omniscape, an adaptation of Circuitscape, a common tool for mapping habitat connectivity. Using California (USA) as a case study, we mapped structural connectivity and developed a classification of connectivity conservation and restoration categories across the gradient of land use intensities, as well as by land ownership. The most constrained areas with highly concentrated flow (movement potential) make up 3% of the state and occur primarily on private lands. Conversely, intact areas with diffuse flow that indicate multiple connectivity options cover 55% of the state, including the majority of the desert and mountain ecoregions. This “strategy mapping” approach can be used to identify priority areas for conservation investment and suites of potential implementation mechanisms and partners, which in turn may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of connectivity conservation in this era of global change.

TI  - The evolutionary diversity of urban forests depends on their land-use history
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization leads to strong modifications of landscape structure and ecosystem functioning, and urban areas are spreading rapidly. The aim of this study was to investigate how phylogenetic diversity and composition of tree species are affected by urbanization itself and land-use history. We found that species richness, rarefied species richness and phylogenetic diversity are all affected by the land-use history of urban forests. Indeed, forests that regenerated from cropland, and particularly those regenerated from denuded landscapes, showed strong phylogenetic clustering, which was also related to their high perimeter-area ratio. Our analyses of phylogenetic composition show that urban forests without land-use history are compositionally indistinguishable from mature, non-urban forests. These two forest types house a diversity of evolutionary lineages and no specific lineage is a strong indicator of these forest types. In contrast, the two urban forest types with anthropogenic land-use history have a few, distinct lineages that are strongly associated with each of them, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that urban forests without previous land-use can house substantial amounts of angiosperm evolutionary diversity, which highlights the importance of preserving natural forest fragments as cities expand. This study highlights the substantial value of tropical urban forests and the importance of considering information on land-use history, even when studying urban environments.

TI  - Assessing landscape functional connectivity in a forest carnivore using path selection functions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Understanding connectivity patterns in relation to habitat fragmentation is essential to landscape management. However, connectivity is often judged from expert opinion or species occurrence patterns, with very few studies considering the actual movements of individuals. Path selection functions provide a promising tool to infer functional connectivity from animal movement data, but its practical application remains scanty. We aimed to describe functional connectivity patterns in a forest carnivore using path-level analysis, and to explore how connectivity is affected by land cover patterns and road networks. We radiotracked 22 common genets in a mixed forest-agricultural landscape of southern Portugal. We developed path selection functions discriminating between observed and random paths in relation to landscape variables. These functions were used together with land cover information to map conductance surfaces. Genets moved preferentially within forest patches and close to riparian habitats. Functional connectivity declined with increasing road density, but increased with the proximity of culverts, viaducts and bridges. Functional connectivity was favoured by large forest patches, and by the presence of riparian areas providing corridors within open agricultural land. Roads reduced connectivity by dissecting forest patches, but had less effect on riparian corridors due to the presence of crossing structures. Genet movements were jointly affected by the spatial distribution of suitable habitats, and the presence of a road network dissecting such habitats and creating obstacles in areas otherwise permeable to animal movement. Overall, the study showed the value of path-level analysis to assess functional connectivity patterns in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Does demolition improve biodiversity? Linking urban green space and socioeconomic characteristics to avian richness in a shrinking city
PY  - 2017
AB  - Anthropogenic change, specifically urbanization, has lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Past work has linked green space variables and socioeconomic characteristics with biodiversity in urban areas. Shrinking cities present an interesting case for studying biodiversity because many of these places have implemented demolition policies to remove vacant buildings from the landscape, which returns previously urbanized land back into a “natural” state. The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on “citizen science” data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds. We also found that areas that have undergone considerable demolition may be a potential deterrent to eBird participation, and eBird users may create bias by sampling areas with greater green space connectivity, and thus higher richness.

TI  - Unifying approaches to Functional Marine Connectivity for improved marine resource management: the European SEA-UNICORN COST Action
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Truly sustainable development in a human-altered, fragmented marine environment subject to unprecedented climate change, demands informed planning strategies in order to be successful. Beyond a simple understanding of the distribution of marine species, data describing how variations in spatio-temporal dynamics impact ecosystem functioning and the evolution of species are required. Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC) characterizes the flows of matter, genes and energy produced by organism movements and migrations across the seascape. As such, MFC determines the ecological and evolutionary interdependency of populations, and ultimately the fate of species and ecosystems. Gathering effective MFC knowledge can therefore improve predictions of the impacts of environmental change and help to refine management and conservation strategies for the seas and oceans. Gathering these data are challenging however, as access to, and survey of marine ecosystems still presents significant challenge. Over 50 European institutions currently investigate aspects of MFC using complementary methods across multiple research fields, to understand the ecology and evolution of marine species. The aim of SEA-UNICORN, a COST Action within the European Union Horizon 2020 framework programme, is to bring together this research effort, unite the multiple approaches to MFC, and to integrate these under a common conceptual and analytical framework. The consortium brings together a diverse group of scientists to collate existing MFC data, to identify knowledge gaps, to enhance complementarity among disciplines, and to devise common approaches to MFC. SEA-UNICORN will promote co-working between connectivity practitioners and ecosystem modelers to facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the predictive models used to identify marine conservation priorities. Ultimately, SEA-UNICORN will forge strong forward-working links between scientists, policy-makers and stakeholders to facilitate the integration of MFC knowledge into decision support tools for marine management and environmental policies.</jats:p>

TI  - Environmental differences explain subtle yet detectable genetic structure in a widespread pollinator.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The environment is a strong driver of genetic structure in many natural populations, yet often neglected in population genetic studies. This may be a particular problem in vagile species, where subtle structure cannot be explained by limitations to dispersal. Consequently, these species might falsely be considered quasi-panmictic and hence potentially mismanaged. A species this might apply to, is the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris), an economically important and widespread pollinator, which is considered to be quasi-panmictic at mainland continental scales. Here we aimed to (i) quantify genetic structure in 21+ populations of the buff-tailed bumble bee, sampled throughout two Eastern European countries, and (ii) analyse the degree to which structure is explained by environmental differences, habitat permeability and geographic distance. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we characterised populations of this species with Fst analyses, complemented by discriminant analysis of principal components and Bayesian clustering approaches. We then applied generalized dissimilarity modelling to simultaneously assess the informativeness of geographic distance, habitat permeability and environmental differences among populations in explaining divergence.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Genetic structure of the buff-tailed bumble bee quantified by means of Fst was subtle and not detected by Bayesian clustering. Discriminant analysis of principal components suggested insignificant but still noticeable structure that slightly exceeded estimates obtained through Fst analyses. As expected, geographic distance and habitat permeability were not informative in explaining the spatial pattern of genetic divergence. Yet, environmental variables related to temperature, vegetation and topography were highly informative, explaining between 33 and 39% of the genetic variation observed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">In contrast to previous studies reporting quasi-panmixia in continental populations of this species, we demonstrated the presence of subtle population structure related to environmental heterogeneity. Environmental data proved to be highly useful in unravelling the drivers of genetic structure in this vagile and opportunistic species. We highlight the potential of including these data to obtain a better understanding of population structure and the processes driving it in species considered to be quasi-panmictic.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

TI  - Social-Ecological Connectivity to Understand Ecosystem Service Provision across Networks in Urban Landscapes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landscape connectivity is a critical component of dynamic processes that link the structure and function of networks at the landscape scale. In the Anthropocene, connectivity across a landscape-scale network is influenced not only by biophysical land use features, but also by characteristics and patterns of the social landscape. This is particularly apparent in urban landscapes, which are highly dynamic in land use and often in social composition. Thus, landscape connectivity, especially in cities, must be thought of in a social-ecological framework. This is relevant when considering ecosystem services—the benefits that people derive from ecological processes and properties. As relevant actors move through a connected landscape-scale network, particular services may “flow” better across space and time. For this special issue on dynamic landscape connectivity, we discuss the concept of social-ecological networks using urban landscapes as a focal system to highlight the importance of social-ecological connectivity to understand dynamic urban landscapes, particularly in regards to the provision of urban ecosystem services.

TI  - Incorporating spatio-temporal connectivity for prioritized conservation of individual habitat patches in a dynamic landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Habitat fragmentation has largely reduced biodiversity in the urban fringe. The prioritization of individual habitat patches can provide spatially explicit guidance for ecological conservation and restoration. Numerous studies discussed the effectiveness of purely spatial connectivity metrics to rank the conservation priority of habitats, but hardly resolved this issue in a dynamic landscape context. Meanwhile, spatio-temporal connectivity metrics were usually applied at the landscape scale, but are rarely extended to determine habitat priority at the patch scale. As such, we extend a generalized betweenness centrality metric into spatio-temporal connectivity networks to evaluate conservation priorities of individual habitat patches from a dynamic landscape perspective. The contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are examined at varying dispersal distances of the target species. Caidian District, the fringe of Wuhan City in central China, is taken as a case study. The results illustrate that a net decrease in habitat amounts and quality from 2005 to 2015 was mainly caused by urban expansion and agricultural production. The positive contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are observed at distance thresholds exceeding 200 m at the landscape scale, which allows us to capture the response of habitat priority to landscape dynamics. Accordingly, we develop a balanced conservation strategy for multiple species and the targeted conservation measures based on the coupled analysis of quality and conservation priority of habitat patches. Our findings are expected to provide solid support for biodiversity conservation in urban growth.

TI  - Flowers and bees in the city: The impact of urbanisation on native plants and their insect pollinators
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most intensive and irreversible ecosystem changes facing the plants, animals, and people that live in the world’s cities. Where native vegetation is cleared, habitat loss and fragmentation have major impacts on the viability of animal and plant populations. Removal of vegetation reduces plant population size, which impacts the resources available to flower visitors. In turn, this can reduce plant pollination and subsequent reproductive success. Understanding how landscape alteration affects ecosystem services such as pollination is fundamental to the conservation of native plants and their pollinating insects. The aim of my research was to contribute knowledge of the interaction between native plants and pollinating insects in an urban environment. The study region included remnant native vegetation and native gardens in Perth, Western Australia that likely provide novel resources for some insects, while degrading resources for others. I aimed to establish the importance of insects to the reproductive success of native plants, to identify the site and landscape characteristics that influenced particular insect groups, and to determine pollen movement within a remnant bushland. After hours (50) of careful observations of insects visiting flowers of five common native plant species, and pollinator exclusion studies, I found that four plants were reliant on insects for pollination to varying extents, but predominantly outcrossing species such as Dianella revoluta and Jacksonia sericea may be more vulnerable to urbanisation. I passively sampled insects and found that remnants and gardens were complementary in providing resources and introduced and native bees were observed, but their richness was generally low. Using detailed genetic data, I found that Patersonia occidentalis showed moderate outcrossing, which was maintained by insects moving pollen up to 116 m between plants within a small remnant. My studies point towards the importance of connectivity between small remnants, gardens and larger remnants for maintaining plant–insect interactions in the world’s urban landscapes.

TI  - Spatial population genomics of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in New York City.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Human commensal species such as rodent pests are often widely distributed across cities and threaten both infrastructure and public health. Spatially explicit population genomic methods provide insights into movements for cryptic pests that drive evolutionary connectivity across multiple spatial scales. We examined spatial patterns of neutral genomewide variation in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) across Manhattan, New York City (NYC), using 262 samples and 61,401 SNPs to understand (i) relatedness among nearby individuals and the extent of spatial genetic structure in a discrete urban landscape; (ii) the geographic origin of NYC rats, using a large, previously published data set of global rat genotypes; and (iii) heterogeneity in gene flow across the city, particularly deviations from isolation by distance. We found that rats separated by ≤200 m exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation (r = .3, p = .001) and the effects of localized genetic drift extend to a range of 1,400 m. Across Manhattan, rats exhibited a homogeneous population origin from rats that likely invaded from Great Britain. While traditional approaches identified a single evolutionary cluster with clinal structure across Manhattan, recently developed methods (e.g., fineSTRUCTURE, sPCA, EEMS) provided evidence of reduced dispersal across the island's less residential Midtown region resulting in fine-scale genetic structuring (FST = 0.01) and two evolutionary clusters (Uptown and Downtown Manhattan). Thus, while some urban populations of human commensals may appear to be continuously distributed, landscape heterogeneity within cities can drive differences in habitat quality and dispersal, with implications for the spatial distribution of genomic variation, population management and the study of widely distributed pests.

TI  - Predictors of Mammalian Diversity in the New York Metropolitan Area
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urbanization can have profound consequences for mammalian biodiversity and is thought to contribute to patterns of species richness and community composition. Large cities can be particularly challenging environments for mammals because these habitats are often impacted by anthropogenic perturbations, including high human population density, fragmented habitats, and extensive human development. In this study, we investigated mammalian species richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity, and evenness in the most densely populated region in the United States: the New York metropolitan area. Specifically, we deployed camera traps from 2015 to 2019 to investigate six drivers of mammalian diversity across 31 greenspaces: (1) human population density, (2) patch size, (3) habitat type, (4) surrounding land cover, (5) geographical barriers to dispersal, and (6) habitat heterogeneity. We found that mammal community composition is largely influenced by a multitude of anthropogenic factors. Specifically, mammal species richness was higher in greenspaces with larger patch sizes and lower in greenspaces surrounded by more development. Moreover, Shannon–Wiener diversity and evenness were higher in urban natural landscapes than human-altered landscapes. In a subset of data that only included carnivores, we found that carnivore Shannon–Wiener diversity was higher in urban natural habitats and in sites with lower human population densities. Finally, we found that geographical barriers to dispersal contributed to both patterns of mammalian diversity and patterns of carnivore diversity: mammal taxa richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity, and evenness were all significantly higher on the continent (Bronx/Westchester) than on Long Island. These results suggest that preserving urban greenspaces is important for maintaining both mammalian and carnivore biodiversity and that management of mammals in cities should concentrate on maintaining large, connected, natural greenspaces.</jats:p>

TI  - Bringing nature back into cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Protecting nature is a fundamental aspect of local and Indigenous cultures that has more recently become an urban sustainability goal. The benefits provided by nature to people and other species have sparked an upsurge in research exploring how best to manage existing nature in urban environments. Here we expand this focus by drawing attention to an emerging pathway of research and practice that is engaged with the idea of bringing nature back into cities (BNB). We argue that BNB could be a vital force of the 21st century urban-sustainability agenda. However, the enthusiasm of practitioners and policymakers for incorporating BNB objectives into local and global strategies remains uneven. As interdisciplinary scholars involved with the theory and practice of caring for urban nature, we believe that the time is ripe to present a fresh perspective on seven key areas that can unlock the potential of actions to bring nature back into cities. Specifically, we: (a) argue that the sovereignty of local and Indigenous knowledge-systems be acknowledged and respected; (b) contend that the choice of bringing nature back actions should be driven by inclusive decision-making; (c) discuss advances in ecology that need to be addressed to facilitate the return of nature into cities; (d) outline how the diffusion of innovation theory may assist communication of BNB actions to stakeholders; (e) discuss how built-environment professionals can demonstrate the value of urban infrastructure for BNB; (f) call for longitudinal research to understand, quantify and qualify the benefits of BNB actions and (g) consider solutions needed to address concerns about potential risks and disservices associated with actions to bring nature back into urban environments. Taken together, these perspectives, and the transdisciplinary framework that emerges from them, embody theoretical innovation regarding how to bring nature back into cities and a holistic view of how to make this happen in practice. Bringing nature back into cities has the potential to become an environmentally just and culturally inclusive dimension of the 21st urban sustainability agenda upon which future generations of city-dwellers rely.

TI  - Toward cross-realm management of coastal urban ecosystems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization and its resulting environmental stressors are often managed within terrestrial, freshwater, or marine realms separately. This is problematic for the many cities situated at the intersection between these realms, because stressors and associated management actions can affect multiple realms simultaneously and impacts may be compounded at boundaries. Here, we describe management approaches operating within and across realms, and identify impediments to cross-realm urban management. We find that management that fails to consider connectivity either within or between realms at best delivers only small-scale benefits and at worst can produce large-scale unintended negative outcomes. In contrast, management that explicitly considers inter-realm connectivity can generate large benefits relative to the cost of interventions. Successful cross-realm management requires consideration of connectivity, scale (temporal and spatial), and ecological processes across more than two realms, and is underpinned by an integrated and collaborative approach that provides multiple benefits.

TI  - Status of road ecology research in Africa : do we understand the impacts of roads, and how to successfully mitigate them?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Across Africa, transport infrastructure, including roads, is being built in over 30 planned development corridors that are likely to have major impacts on remaining natural habitats and associated biodiversity. Linked to this is the projected increase in human population size, which is predicted to grow by 1.3 billion people by 2050. Road ecology is the study of the ecological effects of roads and traffic but is perceived to be under-researched in Africa. In this context, we undertook a systematic review of road ecology research in Africa to understand the geographic and taxonomic scope of work undertaken to date, as well as recommendations for reducing the impacts of roads. We discovered 210 road ecology publications from Africa (1954 and 2016), with most publications from the more affluent and politically stable regions (e.g., southern and East Africa). We found more publications than expected, with relevant research concealed within studies whose primary focus was on other topics. Most publications 1) focused on single species, and in particular on mammals (chimpanzees and forest elephants); 2) were from southern Africa; and 3) were conducted in the grassland and savannah biome and the tropical and subtropical forest biome. Most publications examined the direct impacts of roads, in particular wildlife-vehicle collisions. Only one-third of the publications provided some form of recommendation for intervention to reduce or mitigate the impacts of roads, based on evidence from the publication. Most recommended interventions related to ecosystem or natural process recreation, as well as site and area stewardship. Gaps and future directions for research include rigorous testing of measures to mitigate the impacts of roads, inclusion of traffic monitoring in studies, understanding the impacts of upgrading roads, and exploring livelihood, economic and moral incentives and education and training as potential interventions for reducing the impacts of roads. Our review has highlighted the need for accelerating the study of the impacts of roads on natural habitats and biodiversity, in light of planned large-scale infrastructure development, and especially the study of appropriate mitigation measures that can be rigorously assessed and implemented before and during construction and upgrading of roads in Africa.

TI  - Title: Ecological relevance of least cost path analysis: An easy implementation method for landscape urban planning.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners.

TI  - Engaging urban nature: improving our understanding of public perceptions of the role of biodiversity in cities
PY  - 2018
AB  - In recognition of the value of biodiversity for cities and citizens, a number of international programs have been designed to help municipal governments sustain, protect, and augment the biodiversity and ecosystem services within their jurisdictions. A key component of these programs is public engagement, where citizens assume a more active role in maintaining urban biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Yet, there are few studies which have as their focus public knowledge of the importance of nature, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in cities. To these ends, this study was conducted to develop a better understanding of how the public understands and interacts with urban biodiversity, particularly in comparison to subject matter experts. Using topics generated from expert interviews and the literature, an interview guide was developed for the general public, structured around the general themes of a definition of urban biodiversity, as well as the perceived benefits, costs, and threats related to urban biodiversity. While there were similarities in the responses of citizens and experts, some differences did emerge in terms of accounting for specific urban ecosystems, acceptable interventions to support and enhance biodiversity, and the character and extent of the cultural services derived from urban nature. Insights from this work can be used to inform education and information efforts for the public, as well as raise awareness among city planners and nature professionals of the array of urban ecosystem services recognized and made use of by the public.

TI  - Population genetic structure and gene flow of rare and endangered Tetraena mongolica Maxim. revealed by reduced representation sequencing.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background Studying population genetic structure and gene flow of plant populations and their influencing factors is of particular significance in the field of conservation biology, especially important for species such as rare and endangered plants. Tetraena mongolica Maxim. (TM), belongs to Zygophyllaceae family, a rare and endangered plant with narrow distribution. However, for the last decade, due to excessive logging, urban expansion, industrial and tourism development, habitat fragmentation and loss of natural habitats have become major threats to the population of endangered plants. Results In this study, genetic diversity, population genetic structure and gene flow of TM populations were evaluated by reduced representation sequencing technology, and a total of more than 133.45 GB high-quality clean reads and 38,097 high-quality SNPs were generated. Analysis based on multiple methods, we found that the existing TM populations have moderate levels of genetic diversity, and very low genetic differentiation as well as high levels of gene flow between populations. Population structure and principal coordinates analysis showed that 8 TM populations can be divided into two groups. The Mantel test detected no significant correlation between geographical distances and genetic distance for the whole sampling. Moreover, the migration model indicated that the gene flow is more of a north to south migration pattern in history. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the present genetic structure is mainly due to habitat fragmentation caused by urban sprawl, industrial development and coal mining. Our recommendation with respect to conservation management is that, all 8 populations should be preserved as a whole population, rather than just those in the core area of TM nature reserve. In particular, the populations near the edge of TM distribution in cities and industrial areas deserve our special protection.

TI  - Body size, sex and high philopatry influence the use of agricultural land by Galapagos giant tortoises
PY  - 2021
AB  - As agricultural areas expand, interactions between wild animals and farmland are increasing. Understanding the nature of such interactions is vital to inform the management of human-wildlife coexistence. We investigated patterns of space use of two Critically Endangered Galapagos tortoise species, Chelonoidis porteri and Chelonoidis donfaustoi, on privately owned and agricultural land (hereafter farms) on Santa Cruz Island, where a human-wildlife conflict is emerging. We used GPS data from 45 tortoises tracked for up to 9 years, and data on farm characteristics, to identify factors that influence tortoise movement and habitat use in the agricultural zone. Sixty-nine per cent of tagged tortoises used the agricultural zone, where they remained for a mean of 150 days before returning to the national park. Large male tortoises were more likely to use farms for longer periods than female and smaller individuals. Tortoises were philopatric (mean overlap of farmland visits = 88.7 ± SE 2.9%), on average visiting four farms and occupying a mean seasonal range of 2.9 ± SE 0.3 ha. We discuss the characteristics of farm use by tortoises, and its implications for tortoise conservation and coexistence with people.

TI  - Urban drivers of plant-pollinator interactions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary Plant–pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the impacts of many global change drivers on plant–pollinator interactions. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter plant–pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of plant–pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination outcomes. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments, where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many other environments. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent changes in pollinator phenology. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the same time, diversity among species’ phenological responses could buffer plant–pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better understanding the warming effects on plant–pollinator interactions. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal pollution have been examined with respect to plant–pollinator interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which environmental contaminants drive plant–pollinator interactions in actual urban landscapes is, however, currently unknown. Important knowledge gaps that require research attention include understanding the consequences of plant and pollinator trait filtering on plant–pollinator interactions, and expanding the literature to include underrepresented biomes and pollinator taxa.

TI  - Landscape spatial patterns in Mexico City and New York City: contrasting territories for biodiversity planning
PY  - 2021
AB  - Large cities contain different sizes and distributions of green spaces in a sea of buildings and roads. This urban landscape establishes habitats for different species that migrant through or persist in cities. To describe and analyze how green spaces patterns differ in large cities by using new mapping methods. This tool helps urban planning for land use decisions. Using Patch Analyst Metrics, we propose a new method to analyze the current spatial arrangement of green spaces in Mexico City and New York City, long-established urban areas, as case studies. The two cities differ in the number, size, and spatial distribution of green spaces. Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions. The results suggest mapping mechanisms can help to increase plant and animal movement patterns. However, these older cities have idiosyncratic starting points that must be the basis of future improvements.

TI  - Functional Connectivity of the World's Protected Areas
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Rapid environmental change threatens to isolate the world’s wildlife populations and intensify biodiversity loss. Global policies have called for expanding and connecting the world’s protected areas (PAs) to curtail the crisis, yet how well PA networks currently support wildlife movement, and where connectivity conservation or restoration is most critical, have never been mapped globally. Here, we map the functional connectivity (how animals move through landscapes) of the world’s terrestrial PAs for the first time. Also, going beyond existing global connectivity indices, we quantify national PA-connectedness using an approach that meaningfully represents animal movement through anthropogenic landscapes. We find that reducing the human footprint may improve national PA-connectivity more than adding new PAs; however, both strategies are critical for improving and preserving connectivity in places where the predicted flow of animal movement is highly concentrated. We show that the majority of critical connectivity areas (CCAs) (defined as globally important areas of concentrated animal movements) remain unprotected. Of these, 72% overlap with previously-identified global conservation priority areas, while 3% of CCAs occur within moderate to heavily modified lands. Conservation and restoration of CCAs could safeguard connectivity of the world’s PAs, and dovetail with previously identified global conservation priorities.

TI  - Highway(s) overhead: Strong differences in wetland connectivity and protected status challenge waterbird migration along the four Palearctic‐Afrotropical flyways
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aim Waterbirds that travel seasonally between Europe and Africa use wetlands along four major Palearctic-Afrotropical flyways. However, it is unknown to what extent the overall connectivity of these flyways may be threatened by ongoing habitat loss and degradation. Here, we contrasted the wetland connectivity along these four flyways, applying graph-theoretic connectivity metrics on an intercontinental scale. We also explored for which flyway connectivity is most at risk. We then identified the most important wetlands by their contribution to connectivity in each flyway. Location Western Palearctic, Afrotropics. Methods Based on high-resolution wetland maps, we calculated directional probabilistic connectivity metrics. Estimates of overall connectivity of each flyway were obtained, as well as the relative importance of wetlands, for birds with different migration strategies: short-distance hoppers and long-distance jumpers. Results The East-Atlantic flyway and Eastern Mediterranean flyway had higher overall functional connectivity than the two central routes, reflecting the larger barrier represented by the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert. Fewer than 5% of all wetlands supported more than 70% of the total connectivity of the network in each flyway, regardless of the considered migration strategy. These wetlands were either large, strategically positioned or both. Removing non-protected wetlands from the analysis showed that the connectivity of some flyways could be jeopardized and that the East-Atlantic and Eastern Mediterranean flyway may be most vulnerable to additional habitat loss. Main conclusions Our results illustrate (i) the major contribution of unprotected wetlands to flyway connectivity, (ii) the importance of integrating migration ecology into site-based connectivity analyses and (iii) the utility of graph-based connectivity metrics to inform conservation prioritization under present and future scenarios.

TI  - Applying Landscape Ecology in Local Planning, Some Experiences.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Landscape ecology is repeatedly described as an applied science that can help reduce the negative effects of land-use and land-use changes on biodiversity. However, the extent to which landscape ecology is in fact contributing to planning and design processes is questioned. The aim of this paper is to investigate if and how landscape ecology can be integrated in a planning and design process, and to uncover possible problems that, e.g., landscape architects and planners, may face in such processes. Our conclusion, based on a case study from Asker municipality, Norway, is that such a landscape ecological approach has a lot to offer. However, it is difficult to exploit the potential fully for different reasons, e.g., biodiversity information tends to be specialized, and not easily used by planners and designers, and landscape ecological principles need an adaptation process to be applicable in a real-world situation. We conclude that for the situation to improve, landscape ecologists need to ease this process. In addition, we recommend collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, preferably with a common design concept as a foundation.

TI  - Effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity: impacts and solutions
PY  - 2017
AB  - The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing “ocean sprawl”. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

TI  - Estimating Fragmentation and Connectivity Patterns of the Temperate Forest in an Avocado-Dominated Landscape to Propose Conservation Strategies
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>The rapid expansion of avocado cultivation in Michoacán, Mexico, is one of the drivers of deforestation. We assessed the degree of fragmentation and functional connectivity of the remaining temperate forest within the Avocado Belt and prioritized patches that contribute the most to connectivity using a network-based approach and modelling different seed and pollen dispersal scenarios, including two types of patch attributes (size and degree of conservation). As landscape transformation in the region is rapid and ongoing, we updated the land-use and land-cover maps through a supervised classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, improving the reliability of our analyses. Temperate forest is highly fragmented within the region: most patches are small (&lt;30 ha), have a reduced core-area (28%), and irregular shapes. The degree of connectivity is very low (0.06), dropping to 0.019 when the degree of conservation of patches was considered. The top 100 ranked patches of forest that support the connectivity of seeds and pollen have different characteristics (i.e., size and topology) that may be considered for implementing conservation and management strategies. Seed dispersal seems to be more threatened by fragmentation than pollen dispersal, and patches that are important for maintaining seed connectivity are embedded in the denser zone of avocado orchards.</jats:p>

TI  - Emergent conservation conflicts in the Galapagos Islands: Human-giant tortoise interactions in the rural area of Santa Cruz Island.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The conservation of biodiverse areas around the world has contributed to the protection and recovery of endangered species. This has been the case for 11 species of Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) that today are successfully maintained over six islands: Espanola, Santiago, Pinzon, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz. A favourable state of conservation will depend however on future development in the islands. In Santa Cruz Island the development of the agricultural areas has encroached on the migratory routes of the southwestern species C. porteri and may be an emergent conflict for tortoise conservation. We investigated the social and ecological inter-linkages using two methods framed under a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach: semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to study farmers’ perceptions and attitudinal factors regarding giant tortoises; as well as the associated socio-economic impacts of the conflict. Moreover, we coupled the PRA approach with an ecological assessment of giant tortoises’ population density by performing transect counts during the two yearly phases of giant tortoises’ migration to the lowlands (January to June) and back to the highlands (July to December). Our results indicate that farmers reporting damage and cultivating crops have higher odds of taking actions (fencing and physical actions) towards giant tortoises; regardless of having (or not) a negative perception towards the species. The economic losses for crops and fences averaged 2.8 USD/m2 and 13USD/m, respectively, and provide an initial step to further analyse and characterise the direct and indirect damage costs. Finally, we estimated a density of 76 and 185 individuals of giant tortoises per km2 in the rural area for the lowland and highland migratory phases, respectively. Our approach provides grounded scientific social and ecological information to effectively inform and aid managers, policy and decision makers in the selection of adequate social and ecological criteria to implement the best available options in the resolution of this emergent conservation conflict.

TI  - What makes urban greenspace unique – Relationships between citizens’ perceptions on unique urban nature, biodiversity and environmental factors
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Maintaining urban greenspace is important for stimulating diverse human-nature interactions. Yet, which greenspace to prioritize for conservation under threat of urban densification is a major planning challenge. Besides ecological knowledge and objective use, people’s subjective perception or opinion of urban greenspace has been emphasized in assessing the conservation value of urban greenspace and guiding present-day urban planning. Better understanding on people’s perception of urban greenspace and its influencing factors are, therefore, needed. Here we employ a Public Participatory Geographic Information System (PPGIS) survey on “unique urban nature” in the city of Helsinki to explore people’s perceived uniqueness (i.e., perceived conservation value) of urban forest patches. We use generalized linear modeling (GLM) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate the relationship between this perceived uniqueness and measurable conservation factors, specifically four biodiversity indicators (BDIs) and seven environmental factors characterizing vegetation structure, landscape features and urban context of the forest patch. Results show that biodiversity has a strong positive impact on perceived uniqueness (PU), while environmental factors have variable impacts on PU, either directly or indirectly through their impacts on biodiversity. While the size and surrounding population density of an urban forest are positively correlated with both biodiversity and PU, its connectivity, surrounding constructed land-use, and canopy cover exhibit negative correlations with PU. Our results highlight the importance of biodiversity in affecting PU both as a direct influencing factor and as a mediator of the impact of environmental factors. We detected distinct effects of environmental factors (e.g., connectivity, canopy cover) on biodiversity and PU, implying different responses of biodiversity and PU to these factors, and a potential trade-off between biodiversity (natural conservation value) and people’s conservation value when managing urban forests.

TI  - Rats About Town: A Systematic Review of Rat Movement in Urban Ecosystems
PY  - 2019
AB  - Norway and black rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) are ubiquitous urban pests, inhabiting cities worldwide. Despite their close association with people, urban rats remain difficult to control. This can be attributed to a general lack of information on basic rat ecology to inform management efforts. In this systematic review and narrative synthesis, we collate the published literature to provide a comprehensive description of what is known about urban rat movement, including information on home range, site fidelity, dispersal, movement patterns, barriers to, and factors impacting, movement. We also discuss the methodologies used to track and infer rat movement, as well as the advantages and limitations of employing these techniques. Our review suggests that the distances travelled by urban rats are location-specific, determined by local resource availability and barriers to movement such as roadways. Although roads may impede rat movement, genetic techniques suggest that rats traverse roadways more often than revealed by capture-based tools, while long-distance dispersal events can maintain connectivity among distant populations. Because rat movement patterns are related to the transmission of rat-associated pathogens and the success of rodent control programs, these results have implications for both public health and pest control efforts. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of understanding local rat movement patterns in order to devise and deploy efficient and effective rat mitigation initiatives in urban centers.

TI  - Biophysical modelling and graph theory identify key connectivity hubs in the Mediterranean marine reserve network
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Connectivity plays a key role in the effectiveness of MPA networks ensuring metapopulation resilience through gene flow and recruitment effect. Yet, despite its recognized importance for proper MPA network functioning, connectivity is not often assessed and is very seldomly used in marine spatial planning. Here, we combined biophysical modelling with graph theory to identify Mediterranean marine reserves that support connectivity between different ecoregions through stepping-stone processes, thus preventing network fragmentation, and those that have an important role as propagule source areas contributing to the recruitment and rescue effects. We identified 19 reserves that play a key role towards the functioning of the network, serving either as stepping-stones or as propagule sources, yet with distinct patterns between ecological groups with contrasting propagule duration (PD). The Côte D’Azur marine reserves are important both as stepping-stones and propagule sources for several ecological groups. Also, key is the Capo Rizzuto and Plemmirio marine reserves due to their role as stepping stones between different marine ecoregions, particularly for species with longer PD (Pisces, Crustacea and Echinodermata). These results provide stakeholders and managers with crucial information for the implementation and management of an efficient marine reserve network in the Mediterranean.</jats:p>

TI  - Body size, sex and high philopatry influence the use of agricultural land by Galapagos giant tortoises
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As agricultural areas expand, interactions between wild animals and farmland are increasing. Understanding the nature of such interactions is vital to inform the management of human–wildlife coexistence. We investigated patterns of space use of two Critically Endangered Galapagos tortoise species, <jats:italic>Chelonoidis porteri</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</jats:italic>, on privately owned and agricultural land (hereafter farms) on Santa Cruz Island, where a human–wildlife conflict is emerging. We used GPS data from 45 tortoises tracked for up to 9 years, and data on farm characteristics, to identify factors that influence tortoise movement and habitat use in the agricultural zone. Sixty-nine per cent of tagged tortoises used the agricultural zone, where they remained for a mean of 150 days before returning to the national park. Large male tortoises were more likely to use farms for longer periods than female and smaller individuals. Tortoises were philopatric (mean overlap of farmland visits = 88.7 ± SE 2.9%), on average visiting four farms and occupying a mean seasonal range of 2.9 ± SE 0.3 ha. We discuss the characteristics of farm use by tortoises, and its implications for tortoise conservation and coexistence with people.</jats:p>

TI  - Exploring structural habitat heterogeneity in sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) for urban biodiversity support
PY  - 2018
AB  - Implementation of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) as part of cities’ transition towards climate resilience encompasses unique opportunities to enhance urban nature qualities. SUDS include individual elements integrated in the urban landscape, e.g. rain gardens or wet basins, which are usually constructed with low structural heterogeneity. Structural heterogeneity of habitats is, however, associated with a high degree of biodiversity. This study explored potentials of habitat heterogeneity enhancement in SUDS using structural heterogeneity as a proxy for biodiversity potential. In an interdisciplinary workshop, landscape architects and urban ecologists designed individual SUDS elements with enhanced structural habitat heterogeneity, hereafter bio-SUDS. The redesigned SUDS elements were infiltration trench, curb extension, rain garden, swale, wet basin, and dry basin. To evaluate the bio-SUDS designs, we developed an index of habitat heterogeneity in SUDS based on registration of 45 structurally important components. The conversion from standard SUDS to bio-SUDS entailed substantial increases in structural heterogeneity ranging from 4 to 18 additional components within elements. Larger bio-SUDS elements returned higher index scores, but the relative score increases were substantial for all bio-SUDS and in the range of a factor of 2–5.5. Increased terrain differences, meandering edges, stones, gravel, boulders, deadwood, and brown roof-like vegetation were the components most often employed in the bio-SUDS designs. In conclusion, implementation of bio-SUDS has potential to increase structural habitat heterogeneity thereby providing habitat for biodiversity in urban green areas. The developed bio-SUDS index can assist in future assessments of ecological qualities in designs and real-world SUDS elements.

TI  - Urban birds and planting design: strategies for incorporating ecological goals into residential landscapes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Private residential property occupies a major part of the urban land base, yet considerable potential remains for improving the ecological performance of private gardens and landscapes. Ecologically-oriented approaches to design of residential properties, however, are only valuable if they are compatible with private landowner interests and needs–otherwise they may never be implemented. Landscape designers would benefit from more comprehensive guidance for ecologically-oriented planting design that best fits within residential settings. This paper identifies plant-based design strategies that may improve avian species richness, reviews scientific literature supporting these options, and describes three years of structured design research to evaluate how these strategies can be compatible with the programmatic and aesthetic goals of residential landowners. We worked with three New York State communities beginning with a community/neighborhood-scale visioning and goal setting process and ending with parcel-scale landscape designs. The project, in total, developed residential landscape designs for 50 private properties, each incorporating urban ecological benefits in combination with the interests and needs of the owner. We share here a set of planting design strategies for enhancing avian habitat on residential private property generated during this process. They include planting strategies that: a) contribute to landscape networks; b) build vegetative structure at sites; c) provide microrefugia; d) optimize forage resource availability; and e) enhance plant diversity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of design results for the strategies is discussed.

TI  - Borderless conservation: Integrating connectivity into high seas conservation efforts for the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Connectivity is essential to consider in area-based marine conservation measures because it greatly impacts vital ecological processes (e.g., recycling nutrients, regulating temperature, sequestering carbon, and supporting the life cycle of species). However, it is generally not well studied or integrated into conservation measures, particularly in the Southeast Pacific. This region is home to the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges, two adjacent seamount chains that stretch between the Peruvian coast and Rapa Nui (i.e., Easter Island). The area has been recognized for its exceptional natural and cultural significance as well as one of the most important global areas to protect. However, over 73% of the ridges are in areas beyond national jurisdiction, where they are unprotected and under threat. This study provides a synthesis of what we know about connectivity in the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges and provides practical recommendations for integrating this knowledge into conservation and management measures for the region. While data on connectivity is still limited, it should not constrain the development of conservation measures, which should be co-designed and co-developed, leveraging the expertise of international working groups throughout the region. Due to their high rates of endemism, as well as importance as migratory corridors, enacting large-scale conservation measures would address important conservation considerations for both connectivity and endemism. Enacting such large-scale conservation measures would not only elevate the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges as an exemplary case study, providing lessons for other marine regions seeking to implement similar measures, but could also help raise awareness on the severity of externally originating threats like climate change and plastic pollution to global audiences.</jats:p>

TI  - Landscape and connectivity metrics as a spatial tool to support invasive annual grass management decisions
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The spatial patterns and context of invasions are increasingly recognized as important for successful and efficient management actions. Beyond mapping occurrence or percent cover in pixels, spatial summary information that describes the size and arrangement of patches in the context of a larger landscape (e.g., infested regions, connected patch networks) can add a depth of information for managing invasive grasses that threaten native ecosystems. Few invasive annual grass analyses have explored the use of landscape and circuit-based connectivity metrics to characterize and compare spatial patterns of invasion. To assess the transferability and applicability of these landscape ecology analyses, we calculated landscape metrics (4 area-based, 3 configuration) and a connectivity metric (circuit-based centrality), using a weighted-average map of invasive annual grass cover in the Great Basin, USA. We calculated metrics at local and regional scales, allowing invasion statistics to be compared across the landscape and illustrating varying patterns of invasion extent and connectedness. We found the metrics provided additional, complementary information at the sampled local and regional scales beyond abundance measures alone. We also illustrated how key metrics could be used to categorize and map areas needing different management strategies, for example, where strategies could proactively protect uninvaded cores, disconnect fine fuel patches, or contain established invasions. The landscape and connectivity metric approach can be applied across scales to spatially target patches locally, provide broader context within a single region, as well as to compare metrics and spatial variation in patterns among different regions.</jats:p>

TI  - Hilltopping influences spatial dynamics in a patchy population of tiger moths.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Dispersal is a key driver of spatial population dynamics. Dispersal behaviour may be shaped by many factors, such as mate-finding, the spatial distribution of resources, or wind and currents, yet most models of spatial dynamics assume random dispersal. We examined the spatial dynamics of a day-flying moth species (<i>Arctia virginalis</i>) that forms mating aggregations on hilltops (hilltopping) based on long-term adult and larval population censuses. Using time-series models, we compared spatial population dynamics resulting from empirically founded hilltop-based connectivity indices and modelled the interactive effects of temperature, precipitation and density dependence. Model comparisons supported hilltop-based connectivity metrics including hilltop elevation over random connectivity, suggesting an effect of hilltopping behaviour on dynamics. We also found strong interactive effects of temperature and precipitation on dynamics. Simulations based on fitted time-series models showed lower patch occupancy and regional synchrony, and higher colonization and extinction rates when hilltopping was included, with potential implications for the probability of persistence of the patch network. Overall, our results show the potential for dispersal behaviour to have important effects on spatial population dynamics and persistence, and we advocate the inclusion of such non-random dispersal in metapopulation models.

TI  - Demystifying ecological connectivity for actionable spatial conservation planning.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Connectivity underpins the persistence of life; it needs to inform biodiversity conservation decisions. Yet, when prioritising conservation areas and developing actions, connectivity is not being operationalised in spatial planning. The challenge is the translation of flows associated with connectivity into conservation objectives that lead to actions. Connectivity is nebulous, it can be abstract and mean different things to different people, making it difficult to include in conservation problems. Here, we show how connectivity can be included in mathematically defining conservation planning objectives. We provide a path forward for linking connectivity to high-level conservation goals, such as increasing species' persistence. We propose ways to design spatial management areas that gain biodiversity benefit from connectivity.

TI  - Transformational changes for achieving the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework ecological connectivity goals
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> The first draft of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes an unprecedented call for states that have ratified the treaty (Parties) to implement measures to maintain and enhance ecological connectivity as urgent actions to abate further biodiversity loss and ecosystem decline. Considering the challenges that lie ahead for Parties to the CBD, we highlight the ways in which effective and equitable connectivity conservation can be achieved through four transformative changes, including: (1) mainstreaming connectivity retention and restoration within biodiversity conservation sector and influencing sectors (e.g., transportation, energy, agriculture, forestry); (2) mainstreaming financial resources and incentives to support effective implementation; (3) fostering collaboration with a focus on cross-sector collective action; and (4) investing in diverse forms of knowledge (co-)production and management in support of adaptive governance. We detail 15 key actions that can be used to support the implementation of these transformative changes. While ambitious, the transformative changes and associated key actions recommended in this perspective will need to be put in place with unprecedented urgency, coherency, and coordination if Parties to the CBD truly aspire to achieve the goals and targets of the forthcoming Post-2020 GBF in this new decade of biodiversity. </jats:p>

TI  - Can a golf course support biodiversity and ecosystem services? The landscape context matter
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the last 30 years, the number of golf courses has increased dramatically worldwide. Since no other sport occupies and manages such large areas of green space, landscape context is crucial for determining their impacts or benefits. (1) Examine how they affect the main landscape socio-environmental landscape components; (2) analyze the knowledge network structure characterizing the research focused on golf courses; (3) discuss the most common best management practices to mitigate their environmental impacts; and (4) suggest new research perspectives. This paper has reviewed 239 papers from academic library databases through a literature review and co-word network analysis. Golf courses have impacted negatively on water and soil components, while positively on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and tourism, mainly in urban contexts. The best management practices have focused on soil, biodiversity and ecosystem services, water quality and quantity, and have given specific indications for amphibians, birds, turtles, and bee species. Few articles have considered the landscape perspective, despite the potential impact on natural or semi-natural landscapes. New clusters of research and management issues, in order to link biodiversity conservation with landscape perspective, have emerged: the need to increase (1) studies focused on the effects of golf courses on the ecological processes behind the functioning of the landscape, taking into account its composition and spatial configuration; (2) the proportion of native vegetation in the landscape composition, and density and complexity of vegetation in the landscape configuration.

TI  - Predicting habitat suitability and connectivity for management and conservation of urban wildlife: A real‐time web application for grassland water voles
PY  - 2022
AB  - Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human–wildlife conflict in urban environments.

TI  - The importance of blue and green landscape connectivity for biodiversity in urban ponds
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity can be buffered by blue (e.g., rivers, ponds) and green (e.g., parks, forests) spaces. However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We determined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects metacommunities across multiple major cities.

TI  - Can patterns of urban biodiversity be predicted using simple measures of green infrastructure
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Urban species and habitats provide important ecosystem services such as summertime cooling, recreation, and pollination at a variety of scales. Many studies have assessed how biodiversity responds to urbanization, but little work has been done to try and create recommendations that can be easily applied to urban planning, design and management practice. Urban planning often operates at broad spatial scales, typically using relatively simplistic targets for land-cover mix to influence biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Would more complicated, but still easily created, prescriptions for urban vegetation be beneficial? Here we assess the importance of vegetation measures (percentage vegetation cover, tree canopy cover and variation in canopy height) across four taxonomic groups (bats, bees, hoverflies and birds) at multiple spatial scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 m) within a major urban area (Birmingham, the United Kingdom). We found that small-scale (100–250-m radius) measures of vegetation were important predictors for hoverflies and bees, and that bats were sensitive to vegetation at a medium spatial-scale (250–500 m). In contrast, birds responded to vegetation characteristics at both small (100 m) and large (1000 m) scales. Vegetation cover, tree cover and variation in canopy height were expected to decrease with built surface cover; however, only vegetation cover showed this expected trend. The results indicate the importance of relatively small patches of vegetationfor supporting urban biodiversity, and show that relatively simple measures of vegetation characteristics can be useful predictors of species richness (or activity density, in the case of bats). They also highlight the danger of relying upon percentage built surface cover as an indicator of urban biodiversity potential.

TI  - Potential Elements of Green Infrastructure (PeGI) Inside the Core of the Village (CoV): A Case Study of Wrocław Functional Area (WFA) in Poland
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>This article presents a study of the elements of green infrastructure in villages located in peri-urban areas. The research focuses on the built-up areas of villages, which together with public and private green areas, are defined as the Cores of the Village (CoV). The research was based on the Wroclaw Functional Area (WFA). The main objective of the study was to identify which sites in a CoV have the potential to increase Green Infrastructure (GI) network connectivity and how these have changed with the development of built-up areas. These sites have been defined as Potential Green Infrastructure Elements (PeGI). The study was conducted over three time periods: the early 20th century, the early 21st century and future plans. The research revealed that, within the historic CoV areas, there existed PeGIs that communicated with external GI elements, but that such connections between PeGIs and GI elements have not been taken into account in future development plans. Furthermore, increases in the area of built-up land have not been matched by an increase in PeGI area. However, through the creation of greenways, among other things, there is potential for shaping PeGI inside a CoV in a way which would strengthen GI structural connectivity.</jats:p>

TI  - GuidosToolbox Workbench: spatial analysis of raster maps for ecological applications
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecologists use a wide variety of metrics and software tools to quantify and map spatial patterns in ecological data. For analysis of categorical raster data, we introduce the GuidosToolbox Workbench (GWB), a series of Linux-based command-line modules, implementing popular algorithms from the interactive GuidosToolbox desktop application. We provide an overview of the workbench design, features of the individual modules, and an example implementation on the FAO SEPAL cloud computing environment.

TI  - Rethinking the focus on forest fires in federal wildland fire management: Landscape patterns and trends of non-forest and forest burned area.
PY  - 2022
AB  - For most of the 20th century and beyond, national wildland fire policies concerning fire suppression and fuels management have primarily focused on forested lands. Using summary statistics and landscape metrics, wildfire spatial patterns and trends for non-forest and forest burned area over the past two decades were examined across the U.S, and federal agency jurisdictions. This study found that wildfires burned more area of non-forest lands than forest lands at the scale of the conterminous and western U.S. and the Department of Interior (DOI). In an agency comparison, 74% of DOI burned area occurred on non-forest lands and 78% of U.S. Forest Service burned area occurred on forested lands. Landscape metrics revealed key differences between forest and non-forest fire patterns and trends in total burned area, burned patch size, distribution, and aggregation over time across the western U.S. Opposite fire patterns emerged between non-forest and forest burns when analyzed at the scale of federal agency jurisdictions. In addition, a fire regime departure analysis comparing current large fire probability with historic fire trends identified certain vegetation types and locations experiencing more fire than historically. These patterns were especially pronounced for cold desert shrublands, such as sagebrush where increases in annual area burned, and fire frequency, size, and juxtaposition have resulted in substantial losses over a twenty-year period. The emerging non-forest fire patterns are primarily due to the rapid expansion of non-native invasive grasses that increase fuel connectivity and fire spread. These invasions promote uncharacteristic frequent fire and loss of native ecosystems at large-scales, accelerating the need to place greater focus on managing invasive species in wildland fire management. Results can be used to inform wildfire management and policy aimed at reducing uncharacteristic wildfire processes and patterns for both non-forest and forest ecosystems as well as identify differing management strategies needed to address the unique wildfire issues each federal agency faces.

TI  - Data-integration of opportunistic species observations into hierarchical modeling frameworks improves spatial predictions for urban red squirrels
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The prevailing trend of increasing urbanization and habitat fragmentation makes knowledge of species’ habitat requirements and distribution a crucial factor in conservation and urban planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer powerful toolboxes for discriminating the underlying environmental factors driving habitat suitability. Nevertheless, challenges in SDMs emerge if multiple data sets - often sampled with different intention and therefore sampling scheme – can complement each other and increase predictive accuracy. Here, we investigate the potential of using recent data integration techniques to model potential habitat and movement corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (<jats:italic>Sciurus vulgaris</jats:italic>), in an urban area. We constructed hierarchical models integrating data sets of different quality stemming from unstructured on one side and semi-structured wildlife observation campaigns on the other side in a combined likelihood approach and compared the results to modeling techniques based on only one data source - wherein all models were fit with the same selection of environmental variables. Our study highlights the increasing importance of considering multiple data sets for SDMs to enhance their predictive performance. We finally used Circuitscape (version 4.0.5) on the most robust SDM to delineate suitable movement corridors for red squirrels as a basis for planning road mortality mitigation measures. Our results indicate that even though red squirrels are common, urban habitats are rather small and partially lack connectivity along natural connectivity corridors in Berlin. Thus, additional fragmentation could bring the species closer to its limit to persist in urban environments, where our results can act as a template for conservation and management implications.</jats:p>

TI  - Socio-ecological connectivity differs in magnitude and direction across urban landscapes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Connectivity of social-ecological systems promotes resilience across urban landscapes. Community gardens are social-ecological systems that support food production, social interactions, and biodiversity conservation. We investigate how these hubs of ecosystem services facilitate socio-ecological connectivity and service flows as a network across complex urban landscapes. In three US cities (Baltimore, Chicago, New York City), we use community garden networks as a model system to demonstrate how biophysical and social features of urban landscapes control the pattern and magnitude of ecosystem service flows through these systems. We show that community gardens within a city are connected through biological and social mechanisms, and connectivity levels and spatial arrangement differ across cities. We found that biophysical connectivity was higher than social connectivity in one case study, while they were nearly equal in the other two. This higher social connectivity can be attributed to clustered distributions of gardens within neighborhoods (network modularity), which promotes neighborhood-scale connectivity hotspots, but produces landscape-scale connectivity coldspots. The particular patterns illustrate how urban form and social amenities largely shape ecosystem service flows among garden networks. Such socio-ecological analyses can be applied to enhance and stabilize landscape connectedness to improve life and resilience in cities.

TI  - Identification and extraction of a current urban ecological network in Minhang District of Shanghai based on an optimization method
PY  - 2022
AB  - • The evaluation methods of source patches and resistance values were optimized. • Multidimensional factors were analyzed, and multiple methods were used. • Ecological source patches were unevenly distributed in the Minhang District. • Resistance value per unit distance was related to the land type(s) passed through. • Resistance of the least-cost path was related to its length and land use types. The urban ecological network has gained substantial interest in the context of urban sustainable development research in recent years. It guides the optimization of the urban ecological spatial layout, which is an important means for inventory development and ecological construction. However, traditional construction methods may not be suitable for urban environments with complex matrices. This can result in the inaccurate extraction of urban ecological networks. This study aimed to improve understanding of the current distribution and composition of key elements in urban ecological networks. In the present study, an optimized evaluation method involving ecological source patches and resistance surfaces was used to identify and extract an urban ecological network. The Minhang District (MhD) of Shanghai formed the study area. The results showed that: (1) There was spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality and the location importance of cores in the MhD. These two factors were inconsistent with the area size. (2) The habitat quality for the same land use types were significantly different. This was because of both vegetation quality and the external environment. (3) The urban ecological network for the MhD had 82 source patches. These were unevenly distributed and mainly concentrated in Pudong. (4) A total of 133 least-cost paths were extracted from between the source patches. However, the cost of least-cost paths were generally high in Puxi. This was not conducive to forming functional connections between patches. This study provided an optimization method for identifying and extracting ecological networks in urban areas by combining Geographical Information System software (GIS), Guidos, Graphab, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Ecological indicators such as NDVI, the percentage variation of the probability of connectivity ( dPC ), and habitat quality were applied to improve accuracy. The study findings lay the foundation for further layout optimization and supporting ecological planning.

TI  - A framework for transparent quantification of urban landscape gradients
PY  - 2019
AB  - The urban gradient concept has been applied widely to test biological responses to urbanization. However, a general understanding of the effects of urbanization has remained elusive, largely due to inconsistencies in the definition of ‘urban’. Moreover, ambiguities about how to measure urban gradients exist, despite well-established best practices in landscape ecology of landscape gradient definition. To describe current practices of urban gradient definition and characterize how existing approaches compare to established best practices. In particular, we seek to evaluate the extent to which a single decision framework exists across gradient definitions. We reviewed 250 urban ecology focused research articles that invoke the urban gradient concept. For each, we recorded metrics related to the methodological process of urban landscape quantification. Our review revealed striking methodological consistency aligning with the best practices of gradient definition: (1) the selection of features representative of the urban landscape, (2) identifying associated data to characterize features, and (3) selection of an appropriate spatial scale. Apparent inconsistencies in urban gradient definition, thus, reflect ecological context of the study (i.e. species, location). This decision framework can be synthesized into a standardized landscape gradient framework that promotes candid reporting and justification for, decisions made regarding landscape features, data selection and processing, and spatial scale. As the global human population grows, it is imperative to understand ecological processes in urban regions to create socially and ecologically sustainable cities. Practicing the transparent decision framework described herein will help to standardize methods, and improve consistency in urban ecology research, and better understand the process underlying ecological patterns in human dominated landscapes.

TI  - UK landscape ecology: trends and perspectives from the first 25 years of ialeUK
PY  - 2019
AB  - The 25th anniversary of the founding of the UK chapter of the International Association for Landscape Ecology (ialeUK) was marked in 2017. To assess trends in UK landscape ecology research over ialeUK’s first 25 years, to compare these trends to changes elsewhere in the world, and to consider how ialeUK can continue to support landscape ecology research and practice. A database of conference abstracts was compiled and examined in combination with a questionnaire that surveyed existing and former active members of ialeUK. Across 1992–2017 we observe noticeable trends including the declining roles of statutory bodies, the development of the ecosystem services concept, and a decrease in use of empirical methods. Analysis of questionnaire results highlighted four key areas: Developing new researchers; Facilitating conferences for networking, learning and discussion; Linking policy with practice; and Driving the continued growth of landscape ecology as a discipline. Challenges were also noted, especially regarding the adoption of a wider understanding of landscape ecological principles in management. Increases in qualitative research, decreases in studies explicitly examining connectivity/fragmentation and an absence of landscape genetics studies in the UK are seemingly distinct from US landscape ecology and elsewhere around the world, based on published accounts. ialeUK has had success in increasing the role of landscape ecology in policy and practice, but needs to continue to aim for improved collaboration with other landscape-related professional bodies and contributions to wider sustainability agendas.

TI  - Unifying approaches to Functional Marine Connectivity for improved marine resource management: the European SEA-UNICORN COST Action
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Truly sustainable development in a human-altered, fragmented marine environment subject to unprecedented climate change, demands informed planning strategies in order to be successful. Beyond a simple understanding of the distribution of marine species, data describing how variations in spatio-temporal dynamics impact ecosystem functioning and the evolution of species are required. Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC) characterizes the flows of matter, genes and energy produced by organism movements and migrations across the seascape. As such, MFC determines the ecological and evolutionary interdependency of populations, and ultimately the fate of species and ecosystems. Gathering effective MFC knowledge can therefore improve predictions of the impacts of environmental change and help to refine management and conservation strategies for the seas and oceans. Gathering these data are challenging however, as access to, and survey of marine ecosystems still presents significant challenge. Over 50 European institutions currently investigate aspects of MFC using complementary methods across multiple research fields, to understand the ecology and evolution of marine species. The aim of SEA-UNICORN, a COST Action supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology), is to bring together this research effort, unite the multiple approaches to MFC, and to integrate these under a common conceptual and analytical framework. The consortium brings together a diverse group of scientists to collate existing MFC data, to identify knowledge gaps, to enhance complementarity among disciplines, and to devise common approaches to MFC. SEA-UNICORN will promote co-working between connectivity practitioners and ecosystem modelers to facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the predictive models used to identify marine conservation priorities. Ultimately, SEA-UNICORN will forge strong forward-working links between scientists, policy-makers and stakeholders to facilitate the integration of MFC knowledge into decision support tools for marine management and environmental policies.</jats:p>

TI  - A simple and practical measure of the connectivity of protected area networks: The
            <scp>ProNet</scp>
            metric
PY  - 2022
AB  - Measuring connectivity is key to track progress toward broad conservation goals, such as the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's proposed Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The framework includes an area-based target for the protection of 30% of lands and seas globally—through well-connected systems of protected areas. Although the field of connectivity science has grown rapidly, limited progress has been made in tracking conservation connectivity in practice. This is in part due to the lack of a standardizing framework to clarify different purposes, approaches, and datasets—particularly in differentiating a metric from its application within a broader connectivity framework—as well as a benchmark to quantitatively compare alternative approaches. To address this science-practice gap, we developed a novel metric of connectivity called the Protected Network metric (ProNet). ProNet is designed to assess the structural connectivity of a protected area network in a way that can be easily described, clearly communicated, and rapidly computed at high resolution. We evaluated how ProNet adheres to fundamental conservation science principles using a library of hypothetical landscapes, compared it to two commonly used existing connectivity metrics, and demonstrated its performance in assessing connectivity for a set of real-world landscapes selected across the gradient of human modification. More broadly, ProNet is a powerful tool to galvanize emerging connectivity conservation as a countermeasure to increasing fragmentation of global ecosystems.

TI  - Molecular ecology meets systematic conservation planning.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Integrative and proactive conservation approaches are critical to the long-term persistence of biodiversity. Molecular data can provide important information on evolutionary processes necessary for conserving multiple levels of biodiversity (genes, populations, species, and ecosystems). However, molecular data are rarely used to guide spatial conservation decision-making. Here, we bridge the fields of molecular ecology (ME) and systematic conservation planning (SCP) (the 'why') to build a foundation for the inclusion of molecular data into spatial conservation planning tools (the 'how'), and provide a practical guide for implementing this integrative approach for both conservation planners and molecular ecologists. The proposed framework enhances interdisciplinary capacity, which is crucial to achieving the ambitious global conservation goals envisioned for the next decade.

TI  - Environmental Factors and Zoonotic Pathogen Ecology in Urban Exploiter Species.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Knowledge of pathogen ecology, including the impacts of environmental factors on pathogen and host dynamics, is essential for determining the risk that zoonotic pathogens pose to people. This review synthesizes the scientific literature on environmental factors that influence the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic microparasites (bacteria, viruses and protozoa) in globally invasive urban exploiter wildlife species (i.e., rock doves [Columba livia domestica], European starlings [Sturnus vulgaris], house sparrows [Passer domesticus], Norway rats [Rattus norvegicus], black rats [R. rattus] and house mice [Mus musculus]). Pathogen ecology, including prevalence and pathogen characteristics, is influenced by geographical location, habitat, season and weather. The prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in mice and rats varies markedly over short geographical distances, but tends to be highest in ports, disadvantaged (e.g., low income) and residential areas. Future research should use epidemiological approaches, including random sampling and robust statistical analyses, to evaluate a range of biotic and abiotic environmental factors at spatial scales suitable for host home range sizes. Moving beyond descriptive studies to uncover the causal factors contributing to uneven pathogen distribution among wildlife hosts in urban environments may lead to targeted surveillance and intervention strategies. Application of this knowledge to urban maintenance and planning may reduce the potential impacts of urban wildlife-associated zoonotic diseases on people.

TI  - Greenspace spatial characteristics and human health in an urban environment : an epidemiological study using landscape metrics in Sheffield, UK
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cross-sectional research linking exposure to greenspace with human health rarely describes greenspace characteristics in detail, but a few studies do find that some types of greenspace have greater health benefits than others. We review literature linking landscape metrics to multiple mechanisms by which greenspace exposure is posited to benefit health. Using metrics identified in this process to describe the composition and configuration of urban greenspace, we conduct a small-area epidemiological analysis of self-reported general health for the city of Sheffield, UK. A relatively high proportion of water cover and a high diversity of tree planting are associated with lower levels of poor health; while a high proportion of grass cover, which may be indicative of low quality greenspaces, is associated with higher levels. The presence of large greenspace patches that are well interspersed with the built environment is also associated with lower levels of poor health. We demonstrate a successful methodology for identifying useful landscape metrics even where effect sizes are small, and explore the challenges of translating results of landscape metric studies into policy guidance.

TI  - Could Purposefully Engineered Native Grassland Gardens Enhance Urban Insect Biodiversity?
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.</jats:p>

TI  - Applying predictive models to study the ecological properties of urban ecosystems: A case study in Zürich, Switzerland
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Cities are human dominated ecosystems providing novel conditions for organisms. Research on urban biodiversity is rapidly increasing, yet it is still hampered by the partial spatial coverage of cities and because of existing taxonomic biases. Predictive models have proved to be a key tool to solve this shortfall. However, predictive models have rarely been used in urban ecosystems due to either the lack of sufficient species records or high-quality predictors (e.g. meaningful ecological maps). Here, we assemble a large cross-taxa inventory of 1446 species from 12 taxonomic groups, including several understudied invertebrate groups, sampled in 251 sites in Zurich, Switzerland. We investigate the species diversity distributions and the structure of species assemblages along artificial urban ecological gradients by applying predictive models. We find that the general species diversity distribution law, where assemblages are dominated by a few very abundant and frequent species, applied consistently across all taxonomic groups (3% of the species accounting for approximately 50% of abundance). Furthermore, only species of intermediate abundance and frequency are spatially structured along urban intensity gradients, with rare species numbers keeping constant even in the most urbanised parts of the city. In addition, we show that green areas with low mowing regimes are associated with higher species diversity in the majority of taxonomic groups. Hence, this suggests management relaxation as a low-cost solution to promote species richness. Our study demonstrates the potential of predictive modelling for addressing ecological questions in urban environments and to inform management and planning.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Interest in urban ecosystem services has grown steadily over recent years (Haase et al. 2014), with politics promoting the enhancement of ecosystem service provision in urban areas (e.g. DG Environment 2012). Indeed, the increasing share of humans living in urban areas worldwide and environmental threats such as climate change urge us to consider ways to maintain and improve the well-being of urban dwellers. In this context, ecosystem services, which are the benefits humans receive from ecosystems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005b), are a promising supplement to technical solutions.

TI  - Superfrogs in the city: 150 year impact of urbanization and agriculture on the European Common Frog.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite growing pressure on biodiversity deriving from increasing anthropogenic disturbances, some species successfully persist in altered ecosystems. However, these species' characteristics and thresholds, as well as the environmental frame behind that process are usually unknown. We collected data on body size, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), as well as nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15 N) from museum specimens of the European Common Frog, Rana temporaria, all originating from the Berlin-Brandenburg area, Germany, in order to test: (a) if specimens have changed over the last 150 years (1868-2018); and (b) if changes could be attributed to increasing urbanization and agricultural intensity. We detected that after the Second World War, frogs were larger than in pre-war Berlin. In rural Brandenburg, we observed no such size change. FA analysis revealed a similar tendency with lower levels in Berlin after the war and higher levels in Brandenburg. Enrichment of δ15 N decreased over time in both regions but was generally higher and less variable in sites with agricultural land use. Frogs thus seem to encounter favorable habitat conditions after pollution in postwar Berlin improved, but no such tendencies were observable in the predominantly agricultural landscape of Brandenburg. Urbanization, characterized by the proportion of built-up area, was not the main associated factor for the observed trait changes. However, we detected a relationship with the amount of urban greenspace. Our study exemplifies that increasing urbanization must not necessarily worsen conditions for species living in urban habitats. The Berlin example demonstrates that public parks and other urban greenspaces have the potential to serve as suitable refuges for some species. These findings underline the urgency of establishing, maintaining, and connecting such habitats, and generally consider their importance for future urban planning.

TI  - Feather, But Not Plasma, Glucocorticoid Response to Artificial Light at Night Differs between Urban and Forest Blue Tit Nestlings.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization drives phenotypic variation in many animal species. This includes behavioral and physiological traits such as activity patterns, aggression, and hormone levels. A current challenge of urban evolutionary ecology is to understand the environmental drivers of phenotypic variation in cities. Moreover, do individuals develop tolerance to urban environmental factors, which underlie adaptative responses and contribute to the evolution of urban populations? Most available evidence comes from correlative studies and rare experiments where a single urban-related environmental factor has been manipulated in the field. Here we present the results of an experiment in which we tested for differences in the glucocorticoid (CORT) response of urban and rural blue tits nestlings (Cyanistes caeruleus) to artificial light at night (ALAN). ALAN has been suggested to alter CORT response in several animal species, but to date no study has investigated whether this effect of ALAN differs between urban and rural populations. Immediately after hatching, urban and forest broods were either exposed to 2 lux of ALAN (using an LED source mounted inside the nestbox) or received no treatment (dark control). The experiment lasted until the chicks fledged. When the chicks were 13 days old plasma samples were collected to measure baseline CORT concentrations, and feather samples to provide an integrative measure of CORT during growth. Forest birds had higher plasma CORT (pCORT) concentrations than their urban counterparts, irrespective of whether they were exposed to ALAN or not. Conversely, we found population-specific responses of feather CORT to ALAN. Specifically, urban birds that received ALAN had increased feather CORT compared with the urban dark controls, while the opposite was true for the forest birds. pCORT concentrations were negatively associated to fledging success, irrespective of population and treatment, while feather CORT was positively associated to fledging success in broods exposed to ALAN, but negatively in the dark control ones. Our results demonstrate that ALAN can play a role in determination of the glucocorticoid phenotype of wild animals, and may thus contribute to phenotypic differences between urban and rural animals.

TI  - Using SPOT Data and FRAGSTAS to Analyze the Relationship between Plant Diversity and Green Space Landscape Patterns in the Tropical Coastal City of Zhanjiang, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban green spaces provide a host of ecosystem services, the quantity and structure of which play an important role in human well-being. Rapid urbanization may modify urban green spaces, having various effects on plant diversity. Tropical coastal cities have urbanized rapidly in recent decades, but few studies have been conducted with a focus on their green spaces. We studied the responses of cultivated and spontaneous plants, both key components of urban flora, to the landscape structure of urban green spaces and possible social drivers. We analyzed existing relationships between plant diversity indices, urban green space landscape metrics (using Systeme Probatoire d’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) data,), and social factors, including the type, population density, construction age, and GPS coordinates of each Urban Functional Unit, or UFU. We found that UFUs with more green space patches had higher cultivated and spontaneous species richness than those with fewer green space patches. Spontaneous species richness decreased when green space patches became fragmented, and it increased when green space patches were more connected (e.g., via land bridges). Conversely, cultivated species richness increased with green space patch fragmentation. The phylogenetic diversity of both cultivated and spontaneous plants were weakly associated with green space structure, which was strongly driven by land use. Old UFUs and those with larger populations had more green space patches overall, although they tended to be small and fragmented. Green space patch density was found to increase as the UFU age increased. From the viewpoint of knowledge transfer, understanding the effects and drivers of landscape patterns of urban green spaces could inform the development of improved policies and management of urban green space areas.

TI  - Global changes in urban vegetation cover
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban vegetation provides many ecosystem services that make cities more liveable for people. As the world continues to urbanise, the vegetation cover in urban areas is changing rapidly. Here we use Google Earth Engine to map vegetation cover in all urban areas larger than 15 km2 in 2000 and 2015, which covered 390,000 km2 and 490,000 km2 respectively. In 2015, urban vegetation covered a substantial area, equivalent to the size of Belarus. Proportional vegetation cover was highly variable, and declined in most urban areas between 2000 and 2015. Declines in proportional vegetated cover were particularly common in the Global South. Conversely, proportional vegetation cover increased in some urban areas in eastern North America and parts of Europe. Most urban areas that increased in vegetation cover also increased in size, suggesting that the observed net increases were driven by the capture of rural ecosystems through low-density suburban sprawl. Far fewer urban areas achieved increases in vegetation cover while remaining similar in size, although this trend occurred in some regions with shrinking populations or economies. Maintaining and expanding urban vegetation cover alongside future urbanisation will be critical for the well-being of the five billion people expected to live in urban areas by 2030.

TI  - Scalable Green Infrastructure: The Case of Domestic Private Gardens in Vuores, Finland
PY  - 2018
AB  - The planning, implementation, and everyday use of the built environment interweave the green and grey components of urban fabric tightly together. Runoff from grey and impermeable surfaces causes stormwater that is managed in permeable surfaces that simultaneously act as habitats for vegetation. Green infrastructure (GI) is one of the concepts that is used to perceive, manage, and guide the components of urban green spaces. Furthermore, GI pays special attention to stormwater management and urban vegetation at several scales at the same time. This study concentrated on scalable GI in domestic private gardens. A set of garden designs in Vuores, Finland were analyzed and developed by Research by Design. The aim was to study how garden scale choices and designs can enhance GI at the block and neighbourhood scales to rethink design practices to better integrate water and vegetation throughout the scales. As a result, we propose a checklist for designers and urban planners that ensures vegetation-integrated stormwater management to enhance habitat diversity in block scale and possibility to use blocks of private plots for ecological networks. The prerequisite for garden designers is to be capable to balance between water, vegetation, and soil, and their processes and flows in detail the scale.

TI  - Urban Green Space Distribution Related to Land Values in Fast-Growing Megacities, Mumbai and Jakarta–Unexploited Opportunities to Increase Access to Greenery for the Poor
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many studies on disparities in the distribution of urban green space (UGS) focus on the quantity and accessibility of designated open spaces. However, when all types of UGS, including unmanaged green areas, are accounted for, claims of green space distributive injustice become more complicated. We conducted a preliminary investigation questioning the common Global North assumption that the poor have less access to the benefits of green space, using the cities of Mumbai and Jakarta as case studies as, in their respective countries, wealth inequality has grown at a higher rate than in other Asian countries. We employed four sets of geospatial data to analyze green space distribution patterns and probe the relationship with UGS inequity in different land value districts. We found that the lower land value districts had more vegetation coverage with a higher vegetation density, mainly due to a large quantity of unmanaged greenery. The relationship between the status of urban development and the land values in a district is not necessarily reflective of the UGS distribution once unmanaged vegetation is considered. We conclude by discussing ways to optimize the use of unmanaged UGS as a socioecological asset for poorer districts, and we point to the practical consequences of incorporating the study’s findings into policy and planning towards the creation of ecologically inclusive cities.

TI  - Advancing urban green infrastructure through participatory integrated planning: A case from Slovakia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Cities provide a locus for sustainability: they will soon accommodate most of the world’s population, just as increasing environmental and climate emergencies and socio-economic inequalities constitute major challenges. The concept of urban green infrastructure (UGI) offers a greenspace planning approach based on a grounded set of principles to improve the environmental health and liveability of cities. A wide variety of greenspace planning and implementation approaches is already being applied within and across countries. This paper employs UGI as a research lens to critically evaluate planning trends in Slovakia on national, regional and local levels. To this end we have analysed planning documents, interviewed greenspace agents and evaluated local good practice. Our results indicate weak instrumental support for UGI planning, as well as other systemic and procedural barriers to green infrastructure. Moreover, a comparison with observations from other European planning systems reveals notable commonalities and differences. The paper then discusses a local greening programme and bottom-up actions as potential ways to foster green infrastructure development. Local practitioners can initiate important planning processes by employing nature-based practices, engaging with stakeholders and promoting functional approaches. We propose a participatory integrated model that utilises the opportunities embedded in bottom-up actions. Our model can be adopted in higher-level planning and policymaking if appropriate operational and mediating interventions take place.

TI  - Unexpected Gene-Flow in Urban Environments: The Example of the European Hedgehog.
PY  - 2020
AB  - We use the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a mammal with limited mobility, as a model species to study whether the structural matrix of the urban environment has an influence on population genetic structure of such species in the city of Berlin (Germany). Using ten established microsatellite loci we genotyped 143 hedgehogs from numerous sites throughout Berlin. Inclusion of all individuals in the cluster analysis yielded three genetic clusters, likely reflecting spatial associations of kin (larger family groups, known as gamodemes). To examine the potential bias in the cluster analysis caused by closely related individuals, we determined all pairwise relationships and excluded close relatives before repeating the cluster analysis. For this data subset (N = 65) both clustering algorithms applied (Structure, Baps) indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. These results suggest that the high proportion of green patches in the city of Berlin provides numerous steppingstone habitats potentially linking local subpopulations. Alternatively, translocation of individuals across the city by hedgehog rescue facilities may also explain the existence of only a single cluster. We therefore propose that information about management activities such as releases by animal rescue centres should include location data (as exactly as possible) regarding both the collection and the release site, which can then be used in population genetic studies.

TI  - Landscape -scale predictors of persistence of an urban stock dove Columba oenas population
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>While a few species may thrive in urban areas, urban expansion is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Columbids such as feral Rock Doves (<jats:italic>Columba livia domestica</jats:italic>) and Common Woodpigeon (<jats:italic>Columba palumbus</jats:italic>) have adapted extremely well to the urban environment in Europe and beyond, but the Stock Dove (<jats:italic>Columba oenas</jats:italic>), a bird of farmland and woodland edge in the UK and of national conservation concern, is encountered infrequently in urban areas. Here we explore the multi-scale landscape associations of the little-studied Stock Dove within the urban matrix of Greater Manchester, UK, in order to identify its habitat requirements. We built a pilot model from historical citizen science records to identify potentially occupied sites within the city, and then surveyed these sites for Stock Dove during Spring 2019. We combined the survey results with citizen science records from the same period and described the habitat and landscape characteristics of sites occupied by Stock Dove using four variables at different scales plus twelve unscaled variables. We used a three-stage random forest approach to identify a subset of these variables for interpretation and a subset for prediction for the presence of Stock Dove within these sites. Key variables for predicting Stock Dove presence were their relative abundance in the landscape immediately beyond the core urban area, the greenness (NDVI) of the environment around sites, and the canopy cover of individual trees over 20 m high within sites. Stock Doves tended to be associated with habitats with more surface water during the non-breeding season than the breeding season. Our results highlight the importance of large trees within urban greenspace for this cavity-nesting species, softer boundaries around urban sites for Stock Doves and stock dove presence in nearby areas. While Stock Dove share many traits with species that are successful in the urban environment, they remain relatively poor urban adapters.</jats:p>

TI  - The interaction of land-use history and tree species diversity in driving variation in the aboveground biomass of urban versus non-urban tropical forests
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Understanding the drivers of aboveground biomass (AGB) variation in present-day tropical forests can contribute to management strategies that help mitigate against CO2-driven climate change and provide other services related to high AGB. Higher tree diversity can lead to higher woody productivity and carbon storage, but how diversity interacts with land-use history is less certain. We assessed variation in AGB across forests with different land-use histories and surrounding landscapes in southeastern Brazil and how AGB relates to tree diversity per se, while controlling for important factors such as mean functional trait values, stem density and soil fertility. Our findings indicate that aboveground biomass of forests is dependent on land-use history and the landscape matrix in which they occur (urban or non-urban). We found that tree diversity, measured as the average evolutionary divergence among close relatives, shows a strong positive relationship to AGB, but only in old-growth, non-urban forests. This suggests that higher niche complementarity leads to higher AGB in certain ecological contexts. Forests in an urban matrix, and those that regenerated from cropland (in an urban or non-urban matrix), showed weak or insignificant relationships between AGB and diversity, and forests that regenerated from completely denuded landscapes, including soil removal, actually showed a negative relationship between diversity and AGB. Meanwhile, across all forest classes, the abundance-weighted mean wood density of tree species present showed a consistent positive correlation with AGB, indicating the ubiquity of mass-ratio effects on AGB. Overall, our study suggests that strategies for conservation and restoration should account for past land-use and the matrix where forests are inserted, as the distribution of carbon stocks and biodiversity may need to be considered separately.

TI  - Seasonal variation in home range size of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) in an urban environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Despite the negative impacts of urbanization on bats, green spaces in urban environments, such as parks, cemeteries, and golf courses, have the potential to provide resources necessary for these animals. Water resources in these areas include natural or semi-natural ponds, streams, and drainage ditches. Such water resources, however, are frequently ephemeral when subject to prolonged periods of high temperatures and low precipitation. We hypothesized that home ranges of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) would increase in size or shift from urban green spaces into surrounding neighborhoods to access alternative resources, such as residential swimming pools, when water resources in green spaces are scarce. To explore whether seasonal variations in bat home ranges occurred, we radio-tracked resident evening bats in a local park system during their summer activity period 2017–2019 in Fort Worth, Texas, USA. We used Local Convex Hulls created by associating point locations with their nearest neighbor to estimate home range size, location, and the percentage area that fell within the surrounding neighborhood. We compared these variables to temperature and precipitation using various regression models. We successfully tracked 30 bats over the 3-year period and found a positive correlation between home range size and temperature. Home range sizes increased 6-fold when temperatures exceeded 30°C. Our study indicates the importance of urban neighborhoods surrounding green spaces in providing alternative resources, such as water, for bats. If managed appropriately, these urban areas have the potential to act as oases for bat populations.</jats:p>

TI  - Synergies or trade-offs?: Optimizing a virtual urban region to foster plant species richness, climate regulation, and compactness under varying landscape composition
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ongoing urbanization forces us to reflect on how we can cater for multiple targets when building cities. In this study, we investigate whether compactness as a common urban development strategy, climate regulation as an example for an ecosystem service, and vascular plant species richness as a measure of biodiversity form a synergistic relationship or whether trade-offs exist. We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the spatial allocation of three types of land cover blocks in a stylized urban region. These blocks are categorized as high-density, low-density, or park blocks, depending on the proportion of green and built-up cells within each block. We systematically vary landscape composition at the block level, but keep city size constant. Our most important finding is that the relationships of target functions can shift between trade-off and synergy, and this is shaped by landscape composition. For example, we found a trade-off between species richness and urban compactness in landscapes with large proportions of high-density areas and parks, while they have a synergistic relationship in low-density landscapes. Such dependencies of trade-offs and synergies on landscape composition need to be explored further, which may help address the wickedness of urban planning problems.

TI  - Clean and Green Urban Water Bodies Benefit Nocturnal Flying Insects and Their Predators, Insectivorous Bats
PY  - 2020
AB  - Nocturnal arthropods form the prey base for many predators and are an integral part of complex food webs. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms influencing invertebrates at urban water bodies and the potential flow-on effects to their predators. This study aims to: (i) understand the importance of standing water bodies for nocturnal flying insect orders, including the landscape- and local-scale factors driving these patterns; and (ii) quantify the relationship between insects and insectivorous bats. We investigated nocturnal flying insects and insectivorous bats simultaneously at water bodies (n = 58) and non-water body sites (n = 35) using light traps and acoustic recorders in Melbourne, Australia. At the landscape scale, we found that the presence of water and high levels of surrounding greenness were important predictors for some insect orders. At the water body scale, low levels of sediment pollutants, increased riparian tree cover and water body size supported higher insect order richness and a greater abundance of Coleopterans and Trichopterans, respectively. Most bat species had a positive response to a high abundance of Lepidopterans, confirming the importance of this order in the diet of insectivorous bats. Fostering communities of nocturnal insects in urban environments can provide opportunities for enhancing the prey base of urban nocturnal insectivores.

TI  - Research Note: Garden-owner reported habitat heterogeneity predicts plant species richness in urban gardens
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Amidst ongoing urbanization and increased research on urban greenspaces, the biodiversity level of these spaces is an important variable. Attaining biodiversity estimates by asking non-expert greenspace users to assess aspects of a greenspace has a number of advantages over expert assessments (costs, sample size etc.). This article discusses an approach to such a citizen-science assessment of plant species richness using reported garden habitat heterogeneity and visually assisted reported plant species richness. We compare expert-assessed plant species richness with garden owner-generated estimates in a sample of 83 gardens. We show it is possible to predict approx. 50% of variation in plant species richness in gardens using just two visual survey questions regarding habitat heterogeneity and plant species richness.

TI  - Salutogenic Affordances and Sustainability: Multiple Benefits With Edible Forest Gardens in Urban Green Spaces
PY  - 2018
AB  - With increased urbanization, ecological challenges such as climate change and loss of biodiversity, and stress-related disorders globally posing a major threat to public health and wellbeing, the development of efficient multiple-use strategies for urban green spaces and infrastructures is of great importance. In addition to benefits such as climate and water regulation, food production, and biodiversity conservation, green spaces and features have been associated with various health and wellbeing outcomes from a psychological perspective. Research suggests links between exposure to green environmental qualities and restoration from psycho-physiological stress and attention fatigue, promotion of physical activity, increased neighborhood satisfaction and even reduced mortality. Especially strong associations have been observed in urban and socio-economically challenged areas. Usually such salutogenic, i.e., health-promoting, effects are explained through theories related to the notion of biophilia, i.e., the idea that humans share innate tendencies to attend to natural environments and features that have been beneficial during evolution. This paper assumes an ecological approach to perception and behavior to be fruitful in order to analyze the salutogenic potential of environments such as urban green spaces and to step beyond the "green vs. gray" dichotomy that has been prevalent through much of the research on health-promoting environments. Through an analysis of environmental affordances for certain perceived qualities such an approach is explored through a proposed concept for urban green space use and management, the edible forest garden. Such gardens, based on agroecological principles, have emerged as one of the most promising models regarding ecologically sustainable food production. In addition to potential contributions of importance for urban sustainability and biodiversity, we argue that the inclusion of edible forest gardens in urban green spaces - today globally dominated by lawns - also potentially could reinforce several affordances of salutogenic importance, both in terms of, e.g., social cohesion but also in regard to restoration from psycho-physiological stress and attention fatigue. Increased opportunities for contact with nature and processes of food production may also reinforce pro-environmental behaviors in the population and thus also affect long-term sustainability.

TI  - Mediating Sustainability and Liveability—Turning Points of Green Space Supply in European Cities
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban growth in and around European cities affects multiple aspects of the environment including green spaces. On the one hand, many cities struggle with environmental problems, overcrowding and overuse resulting from high population densities. On the other hand, high densities result in better access to public green spaces, effective public transport, or less demand for resources. Consequently, finding a balance between density and high liveability in a green and sustainable urban environment is a major challenge for urban planning. Although many studies effectively report and discuss the provision of green spaces in European cities, they lack a systematic answer to what extent the provision of green spaces meets the potential population demand, and to what extent the differences can be detected between types of green. Against this background, this paper develops a systematic understanding of green space supply and its relation to the residential density of cities. In so doing, it detects turning points of green space supply in 905 European cities. The results show that green space supply is sensitive to the type of green space, population size and location of cities. While the supply for total green spaces is constantly decreasing with increasing residential density, the relation between residential density and the supply of urban green indicates turning points. At a certain residential density cities have a high potential to optimise the balance between sustainability and liveability. However, there is no single optimal residential density. Rather, with increasing residential density the green space supply is decreasing and cities need to define different qualities for differently dense neighbourhoods accounting for their specific character and their location within the urban continuum. As for most of the European cities a decrease of urban population or built-up area in the future cannot be expected. By systematically understanding the linkages between green spaces in cities and residential densities, this paper uncovers densities that indicate a turning point of green space supply, which can be used as a comparative instrument in order to respond to the growing need for better green space management planning in areas of high residential density.

TI  - Saproxylic insects and fungi in deciduous forests along a rural-urban gradient.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is increasing worldwide and is regarded a major threat to biodiversity in forests. As consequences of intensive human use, the vegetation structure of naturally growing urban forests and their amount of deadwood can be reduced. Deadwood is an essential resource for various saproxylic insects and fungi. We assessed the effects of urbanization and forest characteristics on saproxylic insects and fungi. We exposed standardized bundles consisting of each three freshly cut beech and oak branches in 25 forests along a rural-urban gradient in Basel (Switzerland). After an exposure of 8 months, we extracted the saproxylic insects for 10 months using an emergence trap for each bundle. We used drilling chips from each branch to determine fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). In all, 193,534 insect individuals emerged from the experimental bundles. Our study showed that the abundance of total saproxylic insects, bark beetles, longhorn beetles, total flies, moths, and ichneumonid wasps decreased with increasing degree of urbanization, but not their species richness. However, the taxonomic composition of all insect groups combined was altered by wood moisture of branches and that of saproxylic beetles was influenced by the degree of urbanization. Unexpectedly, forest size and local forest characteristics had a minor effect on saproxylic insects. ITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA) analysis with fungal specific primers revealed a total of 97 fungal OTUs on the bundles. The number of total fungal OTUs decreased with increasing degree of urbanization and was affected by the volume of naturally occurring fine woody debris. The composition of fungal OTUs was altered by the degree of urbanization and pH of the branch wood. As a consequence of the altered compositions of saproxylics, the association between total saproxylic insects and fungi changed along the rural-urban gradient. Our study shows that urbanization can negatively impact saproxylic insects and fungi.

TI  - The effects of local filtering processes on the structure and functioning of native plant communities in experimental urban habitats.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Despite a growing literature-base devoted to document biodiversity patterns in cities, little is known about the processes that influence these patterns, and whether they are consistent over time. In particular, numerous studies have identified the capacity of cities to host a rich diversity of plant species. This trend, however, is driven primarily by introduced species, which comprise a large proportion of the urban species pool relative to natives. Using an experimental common garden study, we assessed the relative influence of local assembly processes (i.e., soil environmental filtering and competition from spontaneous urban species) on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native plant communities sampled over four seasons in 2016-2018. Taxonomic and functional diversity exhibited different responses to local processes, supporting the general conclusion that species- and trait-based measures of biodiversity offer distinct insights into community assembly dynamics. Additionally, we found that neither soil nor competition from spontaneous urban species influenced taxonomic or functional composition of native species. Functional composition, however, did shift strongly over time and was driven by community-weighted mean differences in both measured traits (maximum height, Hmax; specific leaf area, SLA; leaf chlorophyll a fluorescence, Chl <i>a</i>) and the relative proportions of different functional groups (legumes, annual and biennial-perennial species, C4 grasses, and forbs). By contrast, taxonomic composition only diverged between early and late seasons. Overall, our results indicate that native species are not only capable of establishing and persisting in vacant urban habitats, they can functionally respond to local filtering pressures over time. This suggests that regional dispersal limitation may be a primary factor limiting native species in urban environments. Thus, future regreening and management plans should focus on enhancing the dispersal potential of native plant species in urban environments, in order to achieve set goals for increasing native species diversity and associated ecosystem services in cities.

TI  - Urbanization drives cross-taxon declines in abundance and diversity at multiple spatial scales.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The increasing urbanization process is hypothesized to drastically alter (semi-)natural environments with a concomitant major decline in species abundance and diversity. Yet, studies on this effect of urbanization, and the spatial scale at which it acts, are at present inconclusive due to the large heterogeneity in taxonomic groups and spatial scales at which this relationship has been investigated among studies. Comprehensive studies analysing this relationship across multiple animal groups and at multiple spatial scales are rare, hampering the assessment of how biodiversity generally responds to urbanization. We studied aquatic (cladocerans), limno-terrestrial (bdelloid rotifers) and terrestrial (butterflies, ground beetles, ground- and web spiders, macro-moths, orthopterans and snails) invertebrate groups using a hierarchical spatial design, wherein three local-scale (200 m × 200 m) urbanization levels were repeatedly sampled across three landscape-scale (3 km × 3 km) urbanization levels. We tested for local and landscape urbanization effects on abundance and species richness of each group, whereby total richness was partitioned into the average richness of local communities and the richness due to variation among local communities. Abundances of the terrestrial active dispersers declined in response to local urbanization, with reductions up to 85% for butterflies, while passive dispersers did not show any clear trend. Species richness also declined with increasing levels of urbanization, but responses were highly heterogeneous among the different groups with respect to the richness component and the spatial scale at which urbanization impacts richness. Depending on the group, species richness declined due to biotic homogenization and/or local species loss. This resulted in an overall decrease in total richness across groups in urban areas. These results provide strong support to the general negative impact of urbanization on abundance and species richness within habitat patches and highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales and taxa to assess the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity.

TI  - CityNet - Deep Learning Tools for Urban Ecoacoustic Assessment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Cities support unique and valuable ecological communities, but understanding urban wildlife is limited due to the difficulties of assessing biodiversity. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for biodiversity. However, existing algorithms for measuring biotic sound have been shown to be biased by non-biotic sounds in recordings, typical of urban environments. We develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four acoustic indices (AIs): Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient. CityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, while the AIs performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data. Using CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings. If embedded within an autonomous sensing system, CityNet could produce environmental data for cites at large-scales and facilitate investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife. The algorithms, code and pre-trained models are made freely available in combination with two expert-annotated urban audio datasets to facilitate automated environmental surveillance in cities.

TI  - Soil Bacterial Diversity Is Associated with Human Population Density in Urban Greenspaces
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban greenspaces provide extensive ecosystem services, including pollutant remediation, water management, carbon maintenance, and nutrient cycling. However, while the urban soil microbiota underpin these services, we still have limited understanding of the factors that influence their distribution. We characterized soil bacterial communities from turf-grasses associated with urban parks, streets, and residential sites across a major urban environment, including a gradient of human population density. Bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with the population density; and species diversity was greater in park and street soils, compared to residential soils. Population density and greenspace type also led to significant differences in the microbial community composition that was also significantly correlated with soil pH, moisture, and texture. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils were well correlated. Abundant soil microbes in high density popul...

TI  - Bloom evenness modulates the influence of bloom abundance on insect community structure in suburban gardens.
PY  - 2021
AB  - As land use change drives global insect declines, the value of enhancing habitat in urban and suburban landscapes has become increasingly important for flower-visiting insects. In order to help identify best landscaping practices, we conducted plant surveys and insect bowl-trap surveys in 34 suburban yards for 21 months in Gainesville, FL, USA, which resulted in 274 paired days of plant and insect survey data. We assessed the impact of nearest greenspace size, distance to greenspace, yard area, plant richness, plant type, bloom abundance, bloom richness and bloom evenness on insect abundance and richness. Our samples include 34,972 insects captured, 485,827 blooms counted and 774 species of plants recorded. We found that bloom evenness had a modulating effect on bloom abundance-a more even sample of the same number of blooms would have a disproportionately greater positive impact on flower visitor richness, insect richness and insect abundance. Bloom abundance was also highly significant and positively associated with flower visitor abundance, but nearest greenspace size, distance to greenspace, plant type (native vs. non-native vs. Florida Friendly), and yard area were not found to be important factors. Plant richness was a highly significant factor, but its effect size was very small.

TI  - Reframing urban “wildlife” to promote inclusive conservation science and practice
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cities are home to both a majority of the world’s human population, and to a diversity of wildlife. Urban wildlife conservation research and policy has importantly furthered ecological understanding and species protection in cities, while also leveraging wildlife conservation to connect people to urban nature. Thus, urban wildlife conservation intersects conservation research, conservation policy, and the general public in cities worldwide. Yet, species that are often framed as “urban wildlife” are often of higher trophic levels, including birds and mammals that serve as “flagship” species for public support. Other forms of urban life including plants and invertebrates are often largely ignored, producing a normative urban wildlife concept that may bias urban wildlife conservation research and policy, and sentiment in the general public. To develop new strategies in urban wildlife conservation for the urban era, we need to move towards a more inclusive and holistic framing of urban wildlife for both research and the public. In this article, we discuss the normative framing of urban wildlife and how this framing may bias urban conservation efforts, and argue for a holistic approach to urban wildlife inclusive of all life forms for future research, publicity and policy interventions.

TI  - Urban conservation hotspots: predation release allows the grassland-specialist burrowing owl to perform better in the city
PY  - 2017
AB  - Although habitat transformation is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss, there are many examples of species successfully occupying and even proliferating in highly human-modified habitats such are the cities. Thus, there is an increasing interest in understanding the drivers favoring urban life for some species. Here, we show how the low richness and abundance of predators in urban areas may explain changes in the habitat selection pattern of a grassland specialist species, the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia, toward urban habitats. Predation release improves the demographic parameters of urban individuals, thus favoring an increment in the breeding density of the species in urban areas that accounts for the apparent positive selection of this habitat in detriment of the more natural ones that are avoided. These results suggest that traditional habitat selection analyses do not necessarily describe habitat choice decisions actively taken by individuals but differences in their demographic prospects. Moreover, they also highlight that cites, as predator-free refuges, can become key conservation hotspots for some species dependent on threatened habitats such as the temperate grasslands of South America.

TI  - Effects of Spatial Pattern of Forest Vegetation on Urban Cooling in a Compact Megacity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban forests can be an effective contributor to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Understanding the factors that influence the cooling intensity of forest vegetation is essential for creating a more effective urban greenspace network to better counteract the urban warming. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of spatial patterns of forest vegetation on urban cooling, in the Shanghai metropolitan area of China, using correlation analyses and regression models. Cooling intensity values were calculated based on the land surface temperature (LST) derived from remote sensing imagery and spatial patterns of forest vegetation were quantified by eight landscape metrics, using standard and moving-window approaches. The results suggested that 90 m × 90 m was the optimal spatial scale for studying the cooling effect of forest vegetation in Shanghai’s urban area. It also indicated that woodland performed better than grassland in urban cooling and the size, shape, and spatial distribution of woodland patches had significant impacts on the urban thermal environment. Specifically, the increase of size and the degree of compactness of the patch shape can effectively reduce the LST within the woodland. Areas with a higher percentage of vegetation coverage experienced a greater cooling effect. Moreover, when given a fixed amount of vegetation covers, aggregated distribution provided a stronger cooling effect than fragmented distribution and increasing overall shape complexity of woodlands can enhance the cooling effect on surrounding urban areas. This study provides insights for urban planners and landscape designers to create forest adaptive planning strategies to effectively alleviate the UHI effect.

TI  - Indigenous plants promote insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces
PY  - 2021
AB  - The contribution of urban greenspaces to support biodiversity and provide benefits for people is increasingly recognized. However, ongoing management practices favor vegetation oversimplification, often limiting greenspaces to lawns and tree canopy rather than multi-layered vegetation that includes under- and midstorey, and the use of nonnative species. These practices hinder the potential of greenspaces to sustain indigenous biodiversity, particularly for taxa like insects that rely on plants for food and habitat. Yet, little is known about which plant species may maximize positive outcomes for taxonomically and functionally diverse insect communities in greenspaces. Additionally, while cities are expected to experience high rates of introductions, quantitative assessments of the relative occupancy of indigenous vs. introduced insect species in greenspace are rare, hindering understanding of how management may promote indigenous biodiversity while limiting the establishment of introduced insects. Using a hierarchically replicated study design across 15 public parks, we recorded occurrence data from 552 insect species on 133 plant species, differing in planting design element (lawn, midstorey, and tree canopy), midstorey growth form (forbs, lilioids, graminoids, and shrubs) and origin (nonnative, native, and indigenous), to assess (1) the relative contributions of indigenous and introduced insect species and (2) which plant species sustained the highest number of indigenous insects. We found that the insect community was overwhelmingly composed of indigenous rather than introduced species. Our findings further highlight the core role of multi-layered vegetation in sustaining high insect biodiversity in urban areas, with indigenous midstorey and canopy representing key elements to maintain rich and functionally diverse indigenous insect communities. Intriguingly, graminoids supported the highest indigenous insect richness across all studied growth forms by plant origin groups. Our work highlights the opportunity presented by indigenous understory and midstorey plants, particularly indigenous graminoids, in our study area to promote indigenous insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces. Our study provides a blueprint and stimulus for architects, engineers, developers, designers, and planners to incorporate into their practice plant species palettes that foster a larger presence of indigenous over regionally native or nonnative plant species, while incorporating a broader mixture of midstorey growth forms.

TI  - Discovering and Applying the Urban Rules of Life to Design Sustainable and Healthy Cities
PY  - 2021
AB  - The city and its urban biome provides an extreme laboratory for studying fundamental biological questions and developing best practices for sustaining biodiverse and well-functioning ecological communities within anthropogenic built environments. We propose by studying urban organisms, urban biotic communities, the urban biome, and the interactions between the urban biome and peri-urban built and natural environments, we can (1) discover new "rules of life" for the structure, function, interaction, and evolution of organisms; (2) use these discoveries to understand how novel emerging biotic communities affect and are affected by anthropogenic environmental changes in climate and other environmental factors; and (3) apply what we have learned to engage residents of the urban biome, and design cities that are more biologically diverse, are provided with more and better ecosystem services, and are more equitable and healthier places to live. The built environment of the urban biome is a place that reflects history, economics, technology, governance, culture, and values of the human residents; research on and applications of the rules of life in the urban biome can be used by all residents in making choices about the design of the cities where they live. Because inhabitants are directly invested in the environmental quality of their neighborhoods, research conducted in and about the urban environment provides a great opportunity to engage wide and diverse communities of people. Given the opportunity to engage a broad constituency-from basic researchers to teachers, civil engineers, landscape planners, and concerned citizens-studying the translation of the rules of life onto the urban environment will result in an integrative and cross-cutting set of questions and hypotheses, and will foster a dialog among citizens about the focus of urban biome research and its application toward making more equitable, healthy, livable, sustainable, and biodiverse cities.

TI  - Combining the Conservation of Biodiversity with the Provision of Ecosystem Services in Urban Green Infrastructure Planning: Critical Features Arising from a Case Study in the Metropolitan Area of Rome
PY  - 2016
AB  - A large number of green infrastructure (GI) projects have recently been proposed, planned and implemented in European cities following the adoption of the GI strategy by the EU Commission in 2013. Although this policy tool is closely related to biodiversity conservation targets, some doubts have arisen as regards the ability of current urban GI to provide beneficial effects not only for human societies but also for the ecological systems that host them. The aim of this work is to review the features that should be considered critical when searching for solutions that simultaneously support biodiversity and guarantee the provision of ecosystem services (ES) in urban areas. Starting from a case study in the metropolitan area of Rome, we highlight the role of urban trees and forests as proxies for overall biodiversity and as main ecosystem service providers. We look beyond the individual functional features of plant species and vegetation communities to promote the biogeographic representativity, ecological coherence and landscape connectivity of new or restored GI elements.

TI  - Facilitating Multifunctional Green Infrastructure Planning in Washington, DC through a Tableau Interface
PY  - 2021
AB  - Multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) can regulate stormwater, mitigate heat islands, conserve biodiversity and biocultural diversity, and produce food, among other functions. Equitable governance of UGI requires new tools for sharing pertinent information. Our goal was to develop a public-access geographic information system (GIS) that can be used for comprehensive UGI planning in Washington, DC (the District) and to create an e-tool for UGI in the form of Tableau dashboards. The dashboards allow stakeholders to identify (1) existing UGI and (2) potential areas for new UGI including urban agriculture (UA). They also allow users to manipulate the data and identify priority locations for equitable UGI development by applying population vulnerability indices and other filters. We demonstrate use of the dashboards through scenarios focusing on UA in the District, which currently has 150 ha of existing UGI in the form of documented projects and an additional 2734 ha potentially suitable for UGI development. A total of 2575 ha is potentially suitable for UA, with 56% of that area in Wards 5, 7, and 8, which are largely food deserts and whose residents are primarily Black and experience the greatest inequities. Our work can serve as a model for similar digital tools in other locales using Tableau and other platforms.

TI  - Designing (for) Urban Food Webs
PY  - 2021
AB  - Interest is growing in designing resilient and ecologically rich urban environments that provide social and ecological benefits. Regenerative and biocentric designs fostering urban ecological habitats including food webs that provide ecosystem services for people and wildlife increasingly are being sought. However, the intentional design of urban landscapes for food webs remains in an early stage with few precedents and many challenges. In this paper, we explore the potential to design (for) urban food webs through collaborations between designers and ecologists. We start by examining the ecology and management of Jamaica Bay in New York City as a case study of an anthropogenic landscape where ecosystems are degraded and the integrity of extant food webs are intertwined with human agency. A subsequent design competition focusing on ecological design and management of this large-scale landscape for animal habitat and ecosystem services for people illustrates how designers approach this anthropogenic landscape. This case study reveals that both designing urban landscapes for food webs and directly designing and manipulating urban food webs are complicated and challenging to achieve and maintain, but they have the potential to increase ecological health of, and enhance ecosystem services in, urban environments. We identify opportunities to capitalize on species interactions across trophic structures and to introduce managed niches in biologically engineered urban systems. The design competition reveals an opportunity to approach urban landscapes and ecological systems creatively through a proactive design process that includes a carefully crafted collaborative approach to constructing ecologically functioning landscapes that can integrate societal demands. As designers increasingly seek to build, adapt, and manage urban environments effectively, it will be critical to resolve the contradictions and challenges associated with human needs, ecosystem dynamics, and interacting assemblages of species. Ecologists and designers are still discovering and experimenting with designing (for) urban food webs and fostering species interactions within them. We recommend generating prototypes of urban food webs through a learning-by-doing approach in urban development projects. Design and implementation of urban food webs also can lead to research opportunities involving monitoring and experiments that identify and solve challenges of food-web construction while supporting and encouraging ongoing management.

TI  - Comparison of bird diversity between temperate floodplain forests and urban parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract Biodiversity in urban green areas has been widely explored in several bird studies because birds are known to be important bio-indicators. Many studies have investigated the different responses of bird communities to urbanization and land use changes in urban environments. However, there are still important knowledge gaps related to the impacts of the heterogeneity, spatial structure, and connectivity of green areas on avian diversity. Such information is needed for sustainable urban planning. In this study, we focused on the comparison of bird communities between urban parks in the heritage city of Olomouc and hardwood floodplain forests in the vicinity of the city. The results of the study indicate the high importance of urban parks for the maintenance of bird diversity even though urban parks are man-made habitats. The results highlight the importance of some native vegetation structures in urban parks (old trees, bush ecotones) for maintaining urban bird biodiversity. Some implications of the results can be widely used as a decision support tool for the management of urban green areas and for the planning of ecological networks in urban landscapes.

TI  - Natividade da flora usada na arborização de cidades brasileiras
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban problems may be solved or mitigated by afforestation because trees provide environmental services and create situations of social interaction. When native species are used in urban environments, afforestation can also contribute to biological conservation and generate ecological functions. However, Brazilian cities have traditionally been afforested with exotic species. In order to evaluate the origin of floristic compositions used in Brazilian urban areas, tree species from 55 cities located in 26 states and in Brazil Federal District were surveyed. Results showed that the number of exotic species outnumbered native species in 43 out the 55 surveyed cities. Cities located in Caatinga biome presented more exotic than native species in their urban areas, and cities located in the Amazon and Cerrado regions presented the opposite scenario, where native tree species prevailed over exotic species.

TI  - A systematic map of research exploring the effect of greenspace on mental health
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The past 35 years has seen an accumulation of empirical evidence suggesting a positive association between greenspace and mental health. Existing reviews of evidence are narrow in scope, and do not adequately represent the broad range of disciplines working in this field. This study is the first systematic map of studies investigating greenspace effects on mental health. A total of 6059 papers were screened for their relevance, 276 of which met inclusion criteria for the systematic map. The map revealed several methodological limitations hindering the practical applications of research findings to public health. Critically, the majority of studies used cross-sectional mental health data which makes causal inference about greenspace effects challenging. There are also few studies on the micro-features that make up greenspaces (i.e., their “quality”), with most focussing only on “quantity” effects on mental health. Moreover, few studies adopted a multi-scale approach, meaning there is little evidence about at which spatial scale(s) the relationship exists. A geographic gap in study location was also identified, with the majority of studies clustered in European countries and the USA. Future research should account for both human and ecological perspectives of “quality” using objective and repeatable measures, and consider the potential of scale-dependent greenspace effects to ensure that management of greenspace is compatible with wider scale biodiversity targets. To establish the greenspace and metal health relationship across a life course, studies should make better use of longitudinal data, as this enables stronger inferences to be made than more commonly used cross-sectional data.

TI  - Biodiversity in the city: key challenges for urban green space management
PY  - 2017
AB  - Cities play important roles in the conservation of global biodiversity, particularly through the planning and management of urban green spaces (UGS). However, UGS management is subject to a complex assortment of interacting social, cultural, and economic factors, including governance, economics, social networks, multiple stakeholders, individual preferences, and social constraints. To help deliver more effective conservation outcomes in cities, we identify major challenges to managing biodiversity in UGS and important topics warranting further investigation. Biodiversity within UGS must be managed at multiple scales while accounting for various socioeconomic and cultural influences. Although the environmental consequences of management activities to enhance urban biodiversity are now beginning to be addressed, additional research and practical management strategies must be developed to balance human needs and perceptions while maintaining ecological processes.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation in Bird Assemblages in a Subtropical Urban Ecosystem
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Background: Being an excellent indicator of habitat quality, birds are more and more popular in urban studies. Selective impacts of urban environments on avian communities have been repeatedly demonstrated, however, limited information is available under a spatial-temporal perspective, especially for subtropical young cities. Methods: Bird communities were surveyed and environmental data were collected in different types of urban green spaces surrounded by urban matrix during 2018 and 2019. Various statistical analyses were used to describe avian communities residing in different habitats and evaluate bird–environment relationships. Results: Avian community structure differed between major habitat types. At intensely urbanized roadside green spaces sites, omnivores dominated over insectivores, which were regional dominators. Woodland area was key in all urban habitat types, however, the importance decreased with increasing woodland size. Bird species richness in residential parks and individual abundance in roadside green spaces were negatively influenced by environmental noise and visitor density, respectively. Resident bird species and individuals dominated over migrants, and municipal parks presented higher species richness and abundance than other habitat types during winter. Conclusions: Highly simplified habitats in urban areas represent poor wintering habitats, whereas municipal parks served as key refugia. Continued urbanization will place further pressure on habitats which are more natural; thus, municipal parks and other natural habitats must be protected to construct sustainable human-coupled ecosystems.</jats:p>

TI  - Ecological lands for conservation of vascular plant diversity in the urban environment
PY  - 2016
AB  - Conservation of biodiversity in urban areas has become crucial to urban green area management. There are several legislative solutions for preservation of species and habitats in cities. One of them is ‘ecological lands’ – a low-restrictive form of protected areas in Poland. We aimed to assess their efficiency in vascular flora biodiversity conservation in the urban environment in Poznan (W Poland; 550,000 inhabitants). We hypothesized that ecological lands which cover <2% of the city area comprise over 50% of taxonomic diversity and over 90% of functional trait-level range of the vascular flora. Analysis of five ecological lands, which covered 1.8% of the whole city area confirmed our hypothesis. In ecological lands studied, we found 564 species of vascular plants, which is 52.9% of the whole city flora. These species belonged to 23 of 29 phytosociological classes represented in the whole city (73.9%). Functional trait distributions in ecological lands studied comprised from 95.8 to 100% of trait distributions in the flora of the whole city. Ecological lands seem to be a good way for conservation of biodiversity in urban areas. The legislative simplicity and low restrictiveness for both land management and recreational utility make ecological lands a much easier form of nature conservation which may be adapted to other cities for more efficient biodiversity management.

TI  - Ground beetles in city forests: does urbanization predict a personality trait?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background. Urbanization leads to substantial changes in natural habitats with profound effects on wildlife. Understanding behavioural responses to such environmental change is essential for identifying which organisms may adapt, as behaviour is often the first response to altered conditions. Individuals in more urbanized habitats may be expected to be more exploratory and bolder than their conspecifics in less urbanized habitats as they may be better able to cope with novel challenges. Methods. In a two-year field study we tested ground beetles from differently urbanized forests for their exploratory behaviour (in a novel environment) and their risk-taking (death-feigning). In total, we tested ca. 3,000 individuals of four forest-dwelling ground beetle species from eight within-city forest patches. In the second year, we also transferred ca. 800 tested individuals of two species to the laboratory to test for consistent behavioural differences (i.e. personality differences) under standardised conditions. Results. Individuals were generally more exploratory in more urbanized than in less urbanized areas but only in one year of the study. Exploratory behaviour was not predicted by population density but increased with temperature or showed a temperature optimum. Exploration was consistent over time and individuals that were more exploratory also took higher risks. Discussion. We demonstrated that species which are generally less directly exposed to human activities (e.g., most invertebrates) show behavioural responses to urbanization. Effects of urbanization were year-dependent, suggesting that other environmental conditions interacted with effects of urbanization on beetle behaviour. Furthermore, our results indicate that different personality compositions might cause behavioural differences among populations living in differently urbanized habitats.

TI  - Patterns of Bat Distribution and Foraging Activity in a Highly Urbanized Temperate Environment
PY  - 2016
AB  - Understanding how to manage biodiversity in urban areas will become increasingly important as density of humans residing in urban centers increases and urban areas expand. While considerable research has documented the shifts in biodiversity along urbanization gradients, much less work has focused on how characteristics of dense urban centers, effectively novel environments, influence behavior and biodiversity. Urban bats in San Francisco provide an opportunity to document changes in behavior and biodiversity to very high-density development. We studied (1) the distribution and abundance of bat foraging activity in natural areas; and (2) characteristics of natural areas that influence the observed patterns of distribution and foraging activity. We conducted acoustic surveys of twenty-two parks during 2008–2009. We confirmed the presence of four species of bats (Tadarida brasiliensis, Myotis yumanensis, Lasiurus blossevillii, and M. lucifugus). T. brasiliensis were found in all parks, while M. yumanensis occurred in 36% of parks. Results indicate that proximity to water, park size, and amount of forest edge best explained overall foraging activity. Proximity to water best explained species richness. M. yumanensis activity was best explained by reduced proportion of native vegetation as well as proximity to water. Activity was year round but diminished in December. We show that although bats are present even in very densely populated urban centers, there is a large reduction in species richness compared to that of outlying areas, and that most habitat factors explaining their community composition and activity patterns are similar to those documented in less urbanized environments.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Plant Diversity within and between Neighborhoods and Its Implications for a Plant Diversity Survey in Urban Areas
PY  - 2021
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of plant diversity at the neighborhood scale has less been understood, although it is very important for the planning and management of neighborhood landscape. In this case study of Beijing, we conducted intensive investigations of the plant diversity in different neighborhoods along a rural–urban gradient. The results showed that the mean numbers of plant species per neighborhood were 30.5 for trees, 18.8 for shrubs, and 31.9 for herbs, respectively. There were significant logarithmic relationships between the numbers of species and patch area, indicating that larger patches within neighborhoods could harbor more plant species. Hierarchical linear modeling showed that the variations in plant diversity within neighborhoods were higher than those between neighborhoods. The number of species increased logistically with both the number of patches within neighborhoods and the number of neighborhoods, suggesting that it is important to sample a sufficient number of patches within neighborhoods, as well as a sufficient number of neighborhoods in order to sample 90% of the plant species during the investigation of plant diversity in urban neighborhoods. So the hierarchical design of sampling should be recommended for investigating plant diversity in urban areas.

TI  - A core on the Atlantic margin of Europe: an urban bird assemblage in Cork City, Ireland
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization threatens bird populations globally, however many urban habitats present important refugia for wildlife in this rapidly changing landscape. Additionally, birds at the periphery of their global range are more prone to landscape changes and thus these distributions are good indicators of the effects of urbanization on diversity; e.g., bird populations and communities of Cork City, Ireland. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects from urbanization on bird densities (birds/ha), species richness, and species composition throughout Cork City. I surveyed 32 points selected with a stratified random sample within commercial areas, residential habitats, and green spaces throughout Cork City during four breeding seasons between 2016-2019. Species richness was highest in green spaces with 18-34 species; whereas residential habitats had 14-27 species and commercial areas had 9-20 species. The most densely populated species citywide were rock pigeons (5.4-9.1 birds/ha), Eurasian jackdaws (2.9-3.8 birds/ha), rooks (4.5-6.4 birds/ha), European starlings (3.4-5.3 birds/ha), Eurasian blackbirds (2.4-3.6 birds/ha), and house sparrows (2.7-4.5 birds/ha). Overall a lack in urban green space surrounding survey points was most strongly associated with reduced species richness and population estimates. Also, both species richness and population densities tended to be higher in regions with less noise pollution and farther from the urban core. Ultimately these results corroborate other studies stressing the importance of urban green spaces for conserving biodiversity in cities. This is particularly important for the birds of Cork City given that these urban habitats are at the western edge of these species’ distributions.

TI  - Domestic gardens as favorable pollinator habitats in impervious landscapes.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50 m to 1000 m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners' coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.

TI  - Biodiversity and the built environment: Implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Recent major global environmental initiatives toward a more sustainable society are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the New Urban Agenda (NUA) and the Paris Agreement. The built environment has been recognised as a major contributor to loss of biodiversity and should therefore play a major role in a sustainable world where ecological values are enhanced. There should be a smooth interaction between the built environment and the natural environment because humanity and nature are the usual victims of loss of biodiversity. The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between the Built Environment, Biodiversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper explores the role of a sustainable built environment towards biodiversity conservation which is central to the realisation of the SDGs in general and SDG 15 in particular. The paper adopts a qualitative research methodology using knowledge generation workshop involving 16 experts from both academia and industry. The results show that, even though the built environment has a negative impact on biodiversity, it also has the greatest opportunity to integrate biodiversity into all development projects. Reducing the impact of the built environment on biodiversity should be an integral part of policies and strategies towards a sustainable built environment. All key built environment stakeholders need to engage in raising awareness of the effects of biodiversity loss as a result of construction activities, on the health and wellbeing of mankind. The value of this paper is to help decision-makers such as government agencies, industry-players and non-governmental organisations to understand the contributions of the built environment towards biodiversity conservation in achieving the SDGs.

TI  - A small-scale response of urban bat activity to tree cover
PY  - 2019
AB  - Bats in urban areas depend on trees, and bat activity increases with tree cover. To effectively manage bat habitat in cities, it is important to know the distance to which tree cover most strongly influences bats (i.e., the ‘scale of effect’). The aim of this study was to estimate the scale of effect of tree cover on bats in Toronto, Canada. To achieve this, we measured bat activity at 52 sampling sites across the city. We then examined the relationships between bat activity and percent tree cover measured within each of 19 scales, 0.025 to 3.5 km in radius, surrounding each sampling site. We found that the scale of effect of percent tree cover on total bat and individual species activity ranged from 0.025 to 0.25 km among species. Our results suggest that adding or removing urban trees influences bats up to 0.25 km away. Urban tree management decisions should consider the impacts to bats beyond the site of management and within the surrounding landscape of a 250 m-radius scale.

TI  - Increasing biodiversity in urban green spaces through simple vegetation interventions
PY  - 2017
AB  - Cities are rapidly expanding world-wide and there is an increasing urgency to protect urban biodiversity, principally through the provision of suitable habitat, most of which is in urban green spaces. Despite this, clear guidelines of how to reverse biodiversity loss or increase it within a given urban green space is lacking. We examined the taxa- and species-specific responses of five taxonomically and functionally diverse animal groups to three key attributes of urban green space vegetation that drive habitat quality and can be manipulated over time: the density of large native trees, volume of understorey vegetation and percentage of native vegetation. Using multi-species occupancy-detection models, we found marked differences in the effect of these vegetation attributes on bats, birds, bees, beetles and bugs. At the taxa-level, increasing the volume of understorey vegetation and percentage of native vegetation had uniformly positive effects. We found 30-120% higher occupancy for bats, native birds, beetles and bugs with an increase in understorey volume from 10% to 30%, and 10-140% higher occupancy across all native taxa with an increase in the proportion of native vegetation from 10% to 30%. However, increasing the density of large native trees had a mostly neutral effect. At the species-specific level, the majority of native species responded strongly and positively to increasing understorey volume and native vegetation, whereas exotic bird species had a neutral response. Synthesis and applications. We found the probability of occupancy of most species examined was substantially reduced in urban green spaces with sparse understorey vegetation and few native plants. Our findings provide evidence that increasing understorey cover and native plantings in urban green spaces can improve biodiversity outcomes.

TI  - Defining dual-axis landscape gradients of human influence for studying ecological processes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecological processes are strongly shaped by human landscape modification, and understanding the reciprocal relationship between ecosystems and modified landscapes is critical for informed conservation. Single axis measures of spatial heterogeneity proliferate in the contemporary gradient ecology literature, though they are unlikely to capture the complexity of ecological responses. Here, we develop a standardized approach for defining multi-dimensional gradients of human influence in heterogeneous landscapes and demonstrate this approach to analyze landscape characteristics of ten ecologically distinct US cities. Using occupancy data of a common human-adaptive songbird collected in each of the cities, we then use our dual-axis gradients to evaluate the utility of our approach. Spatial analysis of landscapes surrounding ten US cities revealed two important axes of variation that are intuitively consistent with the characteristics of multi-use landscapes, but are often confounded in single axis gradients. These were, a hard-to-soft gradient, representing transition from developed areas to non-structural soft areas; and brown-to-green, differentiating between two dominant types of soft landscapes: agriculture (brown) and natural areas (green). Analysis of American robin occurrence data demonstrated that occupancy responds to both hard-to-soft (decreasing with development intensity) and brown-to-green gradient (increasing with more natural area). Overall, our results reveal striking consistency in the dominant sources of variation across ten geographically distinct cities and suggests that our approach advances how we relate variation in ecological responses to human influence. Our case study demonstrates this: robins show a remarkably consistent response to a gradient differentiating agricultural and natural areas, but city-specific responses to the more traditional gradient of development intensity, which would be overlooked with a single gradient approach. Managing ecological communities in human dominated landscapes is extremely challenging due to a lack of standardized approaches and a general understanding of how socio-ecological systems function, and our approach offers promising solutions.

TI  - Asset or Liability? Ecological and Sociological Tradeoffs of Urban Spontaneous Vegetation on Vacant Land in Shrinking Cities
PY  - 2018
AB  - The increase of minimally managed vacant land resulting from population loss and the subsequent removal of infrastructure is a reoccurring feature in shrinking cities around the globe. Due to the low frequency and intensity of management, these spaces create a unique environment for plant colonization, establishment, and succession. Herein we refer to these plants and the habitats they form as urban spontaneous vegetation (USV). As a form of urban green space, USV has the potential to provide a number of ecological and sociological benefits to shrinking cities, such as supporting urban wildlife, enhancing the provision of regulating ecosystem functions and services, connecting residents with nature, and improving human health and well-being. Conversely, USV can also support undesirable animals such as vectors of disease, and due to its wild and disorderly appearance, can evoke negative emotions in residents while signaling community neglect. This review aims to explore the potential ecological and sociological tradeoffs of USV within the context of shrinking cities. Through this evaluation, we aim to inform future planning and management to exploit the benefits offered by this resource while minimizing negative outcomes, thereby leading to the enhanced sustainability of shrinking cities worldwide.

TI  - Green Roofs and Green Walls for Biodiversity Conservation: A Contribution to Urban Connectivity?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Green roofs and walls have recently emerged as conservation tools, and they offer promising additional opportunities to enhance biodiversity in cities. However, their ecological conditions remain poorly considered when planning wildlife corridors. To discuss the role of vegetated buildings in landscape connectivity, we reviewed the ecological and technical specificities of green walls and green roofs in light of the key factors concerning urban wildlife (patch size, quality, abundance, and isolation). Green roofs and walls show limited patch sizes, distinct habitat quality at the building scale, and limited redundancy of patch quality within the landscape. We also highlight that the abundance of roof and wall patches is often low. Future research is needed to establish if walls can be vertical corridors for wildlife, thereby reducing the isolation of green roofs. We argue that creating 3D ecological connectivity within the city requires substantial modifications of the design and maintenance of existing green building systems. We suggest that research is needed to integrate the biotic and abiotic characteristics of green buildings to make them more closely resemble those of open green spaces.

TI  - Drivers of spontaneous plant richness patterns in urban green space within a biodiversity hotspot
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Urban green space provides refuges for species that are unintentionally introduced by humans and which do not belong to the remnants of natural habitats in urban areas. However, the quantitative relationships between urban green space properties and these spontaneous species are unclear. To address this, we surveyed plant species occurring in urban green patches in Kunming city, which is located in a biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We classified spontaneous plants into native, non-native and invasive plant species. A total of 386 spontaneous species belonging to 278 genera and 92 families were recorded in 190 patches. Most of the recorded species were herbaceous plants (76.2 %). While invasive species constituted a relatively small proportion of the total species pool (17.9 %), six out of ten of the most frequently occurring species were invasive. Regression models inspired by the theory of Island Biogeography show that total, native, non-native and invasive spontaneous species richness in urban green patches were best explained by the size of the ‘island’ (patch area), dispersal limitations (as expressed by ‘distance to city boundary’) and edge effects (as shown by the landscape shape index). While the set of drivers of spontaneous plants is similar for the different groups of species, the relative importance of each driver varies among them. Our study provides quantification of drivers of biodiversity patterns in urban green space. Based on this understanding, planning and management of urban green space can be adapted to maximize spontaneous plant conservation in rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot regions.

TI  - Habitat provision is a major driver of native bird communities in restored urban forests.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization, and the drastic loss of habitat it entails, poses a major threat to global avian biodiversity. Ecological restoration of urban forests is therefore increasingly vital for native bird conservation, but control of invasive predators may also be needed to sustain native bird populations in cities where species invasions have been particularly severe. We evaluated restoration success by investigating changes in native bird communities along a restoration chronosequence of 25 restored urban forests representing 72 years of forest development, which we compared to two target reference systems and a control system. We hypothesized that total species richness and relative abundance of native forest birds would increase with the age of restoration planting. We further hypothesized that relative abundance of rats, possums and cats would negatively impact native birds, while amount of native forest in the surrounding landscape would have a positive effect. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the relative influence of forest structure (complexity index, tree height, canopy openness, basal area, species richness and density), landscape attributes (patch area, perimeter length, landscape composition within three buffer zones, distance to the nearest road and water source) and invasive mammalian predator indices of relative abundance on total species richness and relative abundance of native forest birds. Species richness increased with age of restoration planting, with community composition progressing towards that found in target reference systems. SEM revealed that years restored was a direct driver of bird species richness but an indirect driver of abundance, which was directly driven by canopy openness. Contrary to our predictions, invasive mammals had no significant effect on native bird species richness or abundance. Our results demonstrate that provision and improvement of habitat quantity and quality through restoration is the vital first step to re-establishing native forest bird communities in cities.

TI  - Small-Scale Habitat Conditions Are More Important Than Site Context for Influencing Pollinator Visitation
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant-insect interactions by: 1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, 2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics; and 3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant-insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of 5 functionally distinct flowering plant species (‘phytometres’), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, hoverflies and other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

TI  - A Critical Review of Bioaccumulation and Biotransformation of Organic Chemicals in Birds
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A literature review of bioaccumulation and biotransformation of organic chemicals in birds was undertaken, aiming to support scoping and prioritization of future research. The objectives were to characterize available bioaccumulation/biotransformation data, identify knowledge gaps, determine how extant data can be used, and explore the strategy and steps forward. An intermediate approach balanced between expediency and rigor was taken given the vastness of the literature. Following a critical review of &gt; 500 peer-reviewed studies, &gt; 25,000 data entries and 2 million information bytes were compiled on &gt; 700 organic compounds for ~ 320 wild species and 60 domestic breeds of birds. These data were organized into themed databases on <jats:italic>bioaccumulation and biotransformation</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>field survey</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>microsomal enzyme activity</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>metabolic pathway</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>bird taxonomy and diet</jats:italic>. Significant data gaps were identified in all databases at multiple levels. Biotransformation characterization was largely fragmented over metabolite/pathway identification and characterization of enzyme activity or biotransformation kinetics. Limited biotransformation kinetic data constrained development of an avian biotransformation model. A substantial shortage of in vivo biotransformation kinetics has been observed as most reported rate constants were derived in vitro. No metric comprehensively captured all key contaminant classes or chemical groups to support broad-scope modeling of bioaccumulation or biotransformation. However, metrics such as biota-feed accumulation factor, maximum transfer factor, and total elimination rate constant were more readily usable for modeling or benchmarking than other reviewed parameters. Analysis demonstrated the lack of bioaccumulation/biotransformation characterization of shorebirds, seabirds, and raptors. In the study of bioaccumulation and biotransformation of organic chemicals in birds, this review revealed the need for greater chemical and avian species diversity, chemical measurements in environmental media, basic biometrics and exposure conditions, multiple tissues/matrices sampling, and further exploration on biotransformation. Limitations of classical bioaccumulation metrics and current research strategies used in bird studies were also discussed. Forward-looking research strategies were proposed: adopting a chemical roadmap for future investigations, integrating existing biomonitoring data, gap-filling with non-testing approaches, improving data reporting practices, expanding field sampling scopes, bridging existing models and theories, exploring biotransformation via avian genomics, and establishing an online data repository.</jats:p>

TI  - Temperature accounts for the biodiversity of a hyperdiverse group of insects in urban Los Angeles.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The urban heat island effect is a worldwide phenomenon that has been linked to species distributions and abundances in cities. However, effects of urban heat on biotic communities are nearly impossible to disentangle from effects of land cover in most cases because hotter urban sites also have less vegetation and more impervious surfaces than cooler sites within cities. We sampled phorid flies, one of the largest, most biologically diverse families of true flies (Insecta: Diptera: Phoridae), at 30 sites distributed within the central Los Angeles Basin, where we found that temperature and the density of urban land cover are decoupled. Abundance, richness, and community composition of phorids inside urban Los Angeles were most parsimoniously accounted for by mean air temperature in the week preceding sampling. Sites with intermediate mean temperatures had more phorid fly individuals and higher richness. Communities were more even at urban sites with lower minimum temperatures and sites located further away from natural areas, suggesting that communities separated from natural source populations may be more homogenized. Species composition was best explained by minimum temperature. Inasmuch as warmer areas within cities can predict future effects of climate change, phorid fly communities are likely to shift nonlinearly under future climates in more natural areas. Exhaustive surveys of biotic communities within cities, such as the one we describe here, can provide baselines for determining the effects of urban and global climate warming as they intensify.

TI  - Decreased losses of woody plant foliage to insects in large urban areas are explained by bird predation
PY  - 2017
AB  - Despite the increasing rate of urbanization, the consequences of this process on biotic interactions remain insufficiently studied. Our aims were to identify the general pattern of urbanization impact on background insect herbivory, to explore variations in this impact related to characteristics of both urban areas and insect-plant systems, and to uncover the factors governing urbanization impacts on insect herbivory. We compared the foliar damage inflicted on the most common trees by defoliating, leafmining and gall-forming insects in rural and urban habitats associated with 16 European cities. In two of these cities, we explored quality of birch foliage for herbivorous insects, mortality of leafmining insects due to predators and parasitoids and bird predation on artificial plasticine larvae. On average, the foliage losses to insects were 16.5% lower in urban than in rural habitats. The magnitude of the overall adverse effect of urbanization on herbivory was independent of the latitude of the locality and was similar in all 11 studied tree species, but increased with an increase in the size of the urban area: it was significant in large cities (city population 1-5 million) but not significant in medium-sized and small towns. Quality of birch foliage for herbivorous insects was slightly higher in urban habitats than in rural habitats. At the same time, leafminer mortality due to ants and birds and the bird attack intensity on dummy larvae were higher in large cities than in rural habitats, which at least partially explained the decline in insect herbivory observed in response to urbanization. Our findings underscore the importance of top-down forces in mediating impacts of urbanization on plant-feeding insects: factors favouring predators may override the positive effects of temperature elevation on insects and thus reduce plant damage.

TI  - Sustainable Management Practices for Urban Green Spaces to Support Green Infrastructure: An Italian Case Study
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Traditional land-use planning models have proven inadequate to address contemporary issues in sustainable development and protection governance. In recent years, new ‘performance based’ approaches that integrate ecosystem services (ES) provided via green infrastructure (GI) into traditional spatial planning models have been proven to reach a higher level of environmental performance, necessary to improve quality of life for all people. In Italy, there are no mandatory planning instruments to design and manage GI, which still remains a component of the traditional land-use plan. Here, the development of urban green spaces (UGS) based on ‘quantitative assessment’ is not suitable for guaranteeing the supply of ES. In addition, the scarcity of financial resources to develop ‘green standards’, as prescribed in the land-use plan to strategically design the GI, is an issue for most Italian public administrations. The paper provides the results of a test case conducted in a public green area of the city of Ancona, where the experimentation of a diversified maintenance strategy of an urban lawn significantly reduced the management cost and improved the environmental performance of green spaces. The identification of a unified management strategy to be applied to all the public UGS can help to achieve better results in support of sustainability, to redesign the continuity of GI and to develop strategies for future urban green master plans.</jats:p>

TI  - Residential yard management and landscape cover affect urban bird community diversity across the continental USA.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has a homogenizing effect on biodiversity and leads to communities with fewer native species and lower conservation value. However, few studies have explored whether or how land management by urban residents can ameliorate the deleterious effects of this homogenization on species composition. We tested the effects of local (land management) and neighborhood-scale (impervious surface and tree canopy cover) features on breeding bird diversity in six US metropolitan areas that differ in regional species pools and climate. We used a Bayesian multiregion community model to assess differences in species richness, functional guild richness, community turnover, population vulnerability, and public interest in each bird community in six land management types: two natural area park types (separate and adjacent to residential areas), two yard types with conservation features (wildlife-certified and water conservation) and two lawn-dominated yard types (high- and low-fertilizer application), and surrounding neighborhood-scale features. Species richness was higher in yards compared with parks; however, parks supported communities with high conservation scores while yards supported species of high public interest. Bird communities in all land management types were composed of primarily native species. Within yard types, species richness was strongly and positively associated with neighborhood-scale tree canopy cover and negatively associated with impervious surface. At a continental scale, community turnover between cities was lowest in yards and highest in parks. Within cities, however, turnover was lowest in high-fertilizer yards and highest in wildlife-certified yards and parks. Our results demonstrate that, across regions, preserving natural areas, minimizing impervious surfaces and increasing tree canopy are essential strategies to conserve regionally important species. However, yards, especially those managed for wildlife support diverse, heterogeneous bird communities with high public interest and potential to support species of conservation concern. Management approaches that include the preservation of protected parks, encourage wildlife-friendly yards and acknowledge how public interest in local birds can advance successful conservation in American residential landscapes.

TI  - Connectivity assessment and prioritization of urban grasslands as a helpful tool for effective management of urban ecosystem services.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wroclaw city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2–20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on direct and indirect interactions in a tri-trophic system.
PY  - 2016
AB  - While effects of urbanization on species assemblages are receiving increasing attention, effects on ecological interactions remain largely unexplored. We investigated how urbanization influences the strength of direct and indirect trophic interactions in a tri- trophic system. In a field experiment including five cities and nearby farmed areas, we used potted Vicia faba plants and manipulated the presence of Megoura viciae aphids and that of naturally occurring aphid predators. When predators could access aphids, they reduced their abundance less in the urban than in the agricultural ecosystem. Compared to aphid abundance on plants without predator access, abundance on plants with predator access was 2.58 times lower in urban and 5.27 times lower in agricultural areas. This indicates that urbanization limited top-down control of aphids by predators. In both ecosystems, plant biomass was negatively affected by herbivores and positively affected by predators, but the positive indirect predator effect was weaker in cities. Compared to aphid-infested plants without predator access, plants with predator access were 1.89 times heavier in urban and 2.12 times heavier in agricultural areas. Surprisingly, differences between ecosystems regarding the indirect predator effect on plants were not explained by the differentially strong herbivore suppression. Instead, the urban environment limited plant biomass per se, thereby mitigating the scope of a positive predator effect. Our results show that urbanization can influence direct and indirect trophic interactions through effects on biotic top-down forces and on plant growth. In order to understand how urbanization affects biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, it is fundamental to not only consider species assemblages, but also species interactions.

TI  - Green balance in urban areas as an indicator for policy support: a multi-level application
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Green spaces are increasingly recognised as key elements in enhancing urban resilience as they provide several ecosystem services. Therefore, their implementation and monitoring in cities are crucial to meet sustainability targets.</jats:p> <jats:p>In this paper, we provide a methodology to compute an indicator that assesses changes in vegetation cover within Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI). Such an indicator is adopted as one of the indicators for reporting on the key area “nature and biodiversity” in the Green City Accord (GCA).</jats:p> <jats:p>In the first section, the key steps to derive the indicator are described and a script, which computes the trends in vegetation cover using Google Earth Engine (GEE), is provided.</jats:p> <jats:p>The second section describes the application of the indicator in a multi-scale, policy-orientated perspective. The analysis has been carried out in 696 European Functional Urban Areas (FUAs), considering changes in vegetation cover inside UGI between 1996 and 2018. Results were analysed for the EU and the United Kingdom. The Municipality of Padua (Italy) is used as a case study to illustrate the results at the local level.</jats:p> <jats:p>Over the last 22 years, a slight upward trend characterised the vegetation growth within UGI in European FUAs. Within core cities and densily built-upcommuting zones, the trend was stable; in non-densely built-up areas, an upward trend was recorded. Vegetation cover in UGI has been relatively stable in European cities. However, a negative balance between abrupt changes in greening and browning has been recorded, affecting most parts of European cities (75% of core cities and 77% of commuting zones in densely built-up areas). This still indicates ongoing land take with no compensation of green spaces that are lost to artificial areas.</jats:p> <jats:p>Focusing on the FUA of Padua, a downward trend was observed in 33.3% and 12.9% of UGI in densely built-up and not-densely built-up areas, respectively. Within the FUA of Padua, most municipalities are characterised by a negative balance between abrupt greening and browning, both in non-densely built-up and densely built-up areas.</jats:p> <jats:p>This approach complements traditional metrics, such as the extent of UGI or tree canopy cover, by providing a valuable measure of condition of urban ecosystems and an instrument to monitor the impact of land take.</jats:p>

TI  - Urbanization Around an Airfield Alters Bird Community Composition, but not the Hazard of Bird–Aircraft Collision
PY  - 2018
AB  - Bird strikes are a considerable hazard to the aviation industry, which has led airports to develop detailed management strategies to identify and reduce the risk of them. These strategies include plans to modify bird habitats in and around airports to limit the establishment of high-risk species. Although airports are generally located on the outskirts of towns and cities, they may be encroached on by urban sprawl. In this study, we examined how an urbanization gradient affects the bird community around an air force base in Cape Town (South Africa) and quantified how this could modify the hazard of bird–aircraft collision. We surveyed the bird community in and around the Air Force Base Ysterplaat across four seasons and categorized species based on their response to increased urbanization (urban avoiders, adapters and exploiters). By combining this with species-specific information on body size, flock size, flight behaviour and abundance, we showed that although urbanization affects bird composition, the overall hazard of bird–aircraft collision is consistent regardless of urban response. However, urbanization complicates mitigation in the matrix surrounding the airport and creates novel challenges for the management of bird hazards. Therefore, new bird hazard management strategies should be integrated within community-driven land-use planning to minimize the negative effects of bird–aircraft collisions.

TI  - The interaction of imperviousness and habitat heterogeneity drives bird richness patterns in south Asian cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Bird species richness has often been used as an indicator of urbanisation effects on biodiversity in North America and Europe, but similar studies are rare in rapidly urbanising regions in the tropics. Here we assess the effect of different urban environmental factors on local resident bird species richness at different spatial extents in South Asian cities. Bird data at 57 urban locations distributed across 11 cities were retrieved from the available literature. Different variables assessing the degree of urbanisation and urban habitat factors were measured, at 1000 m and 5000 m radius scale extent, for each urban location. We investigated how resident bird species richness was affected by urban environmental predictors by fitting linear regression models in a Bayesian framework. Our model suggested strong positive influence of the interaction between habitat Shannon metric (a proxy of habitat heterogeneity) and proportion of impervious surface (a proxy of human built-up and settlement extent) on local resident bird richness at both spatial scales. Increasing values of habitat Shannon metric positively related to increasing bird richness, but only when the proportion of impervious surface was very high. Our results suggest that areas with a high degree of urbanisation necessitate an increase of habitat heterogeneity to maintain high local bird diversity. Increasing the quality and the compositional variability of remaining bird habitat patches in highly built-up areas should be a major conservation concern within cities of South Asia.

TI  - Global patterns and drivers of urban bird diversity
PY  - 2017
AB  - The rapid urbanization of the world has profound effects on global biodiversity, and urbanization has been counted among the processes contributing to the homogenization of the world’s biota. However, there are few generalities of the patterns and drivers of urban birds and even fewer global comparative studies. Comparable methodologies and datasets are needed to understand, preserve, and monitor biodiversity in cities. We explore the current state of the science in terms of basic patterns of urban birds in the world’s cities and lay out a research agenda to improve basic understanding of patterns and processes and to better inform conservation efforts. Urban avifaunas are often portrayed as being species poor and dominated by omnivorous and granivorous species that tend to be nonnative. Common families in cities include Accipitridae, Anatidae, and Scolopacidae, all of which have more species than expected in cities compared to the global distribution of species in these families. Recent research shows that cities support an avifauna dominated by native species and that cities are not homogenized at the global level. However, cities have lost substantial biodiversity compared to predicted peri-urban diversity, and 31 of the world’s most invasive bird species are found in cities. Future research is needed to better characterize the anthropogenic, environmental, and ecological drivers of birds in cities. Such mechanistic understanding is the underpinning of effective conservation strategies in a human dominated world.

TI  - Diversity patterns of alien and native plant species in Trieste port area: exploring the role of urban habitats in biodiversity conservation
PY  - 2017
AB  - Nowadays, urban areas play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation and habitat protection despite the constant pressures on which these habitats are subjected. They may even host relatively new plant communities due to the peculiar ecosystem where they vegetate. The port of Trieste (NE Italy) is characterized by a mixed mosaic of intensely human impacted areas (where commercial activities are still ongoing) flanked by abandoned areas where vegetation persists or has spontaneously recovered. In this study, we sampled the whole port area through a stratified random sampling by placing multiscalar nested plots in four different habitats (strata) previously identified by photo-interpretation. Plant species richness and abundance were assessed in each plot. Each species was then classified as native or alien and patterns of species richness and complementarity were compared among habitats. Results show that there is a significant difference in species richness patterns among habitats, while observed patterns are likely to vary at different spatial scales. As expected, urban plots account for most of the alien species in the sampling, while wooded plots cope better with invasion, accounting for a lower alien/native ratio. These results highlight how habitat diversity enhances biodiversity in urban areas and how it could provide an effective filtering effect able to reduce the spread of alien species. In addition, we provide further evidence for the use of multi-scale approaches in order to study the complex relationships between spatial heterogeneity and plant species richness.

TI  - Spontaneous plant colonization and bird visits of tropical extensive green roof
PY  - 2016
AB  - Green roofs can contribute to enrichment and conservation of urban ecology. An experimental green roof was established in humid-tropical Hong Kong to monitor over two years its spontaneous colonization by plants and bird visits. Some 94 voluntary vascular plant species from 26 families and 76 genera were established, with propagules brought mainly by birds and wind and secondarily inherited from soil seed bank. Plant species composition changed dynamically during the study period. They fall into three groups, namely dominant ruderal (herbaceous and sub-shrub) as surrogate of early-stage local grassland ecosystem succession, arboreal (trees and shrubs), and hygrophilous herb. Progressive increase in vegetation cover was accompanied by changes in species diversity and evenness. In addition, 16 bird species from 8 families and 14 genera were recorded. Ten species were residents and the six migrant species were winter visitors. Their food preference was mainly omnivore and insectivore. Winter and the second year encountered higher species richness, diversity, and evenness. Most vegetation parameters correlated positively with avian community indexes, signifying provision of sustenance by green-roof ecosystem to birds. Vegetation coverage correlated negatively with avian abundance, due to shunning by the abundant ground-foraging Tree Sparrow. Both local common ruderal plant species and common urban bird species can successfully establish and reproduce on the extensive green roof, confirming potentials for urban ecology and biodiversity enhancement and conservation even in densely-developed urban areas. The successful nurturing of naturalistic green roof offers new opportunities for green roof design that deviates from the predominant cultivated-horticultural approach.

TI  - Spontaneous Plant Diversity in Urban Contexts: A Review of Its Impact and Importance
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>To promote sustainability in urban green spaces, it is necessary to know the diversity of spontaneous species in these spaces. Based on the investigation and analysis of the relevant scientific literature, the diversity of spontaneous species and their importance was contextually discussed, along with the assessment of local biodiversity impact in green spaces. Studies on green spaces, spontaneous flora, biodiversity or ecosystem services, and studies on exotic species and adaptability were summarized. Finally, the existing issues regarding biodiversity and urbanization, and the role of spontaneous plants in restoring industrial areas were discussed. Based on the research carried out, it is considered that green spaces contain unique and useful biodiversity resulting from their management. Spontaneous flora can be a generator of plants with aesthetic character, which can be grown in an ecologically sound way in private gardens and natural spaces in town and village zones, with certain remarkable farming-biological characteristics (ecological plasticity, high hardiness, etc.). Biodiversity is a relevant feature of urban landscapes, offering multiple gains, and the conservation of this biodiversity in urban green spaces is fundamental and requires an integrated approach. However, urbanisation usually has a detrimental influence on local species’ diversity.</jats:p>

TI  - Conserving herbivorous and predatory insects in urban green spaces.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Insects are key components of urban ecological networks and are greatly impacted by anthropogenic activities. Yet, few studies have examined how insect functional groups respond to changes to urban vegetation associated with different management actions. We investigated the response of herbivorous and predatory heteropteran bugs to differences in vegetation structure and diversity in golf courses, gardens and parks. We assessed how the species richness of these groups varied amongst green space types, and the effect of vegetation volume and plant diversity on trophic- and species-specific occupancy. We found that golf courses sustain higher species richness of herbivores and predators than parks and gardens. At the trophic- and species-specific levels, herbivores and predators show strong positive responses to vegetation volume. The effect of plant diversity, however, is distinctly species-specific, with species showing both positive and negative responses. Our findings further suggest that high occupancy of bugs is obtained in green spaces with specific combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. The challenge for managers is to boost green space conservation value through actions promoting synergistic combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. Tackling this conservation challenge could provide enormous benefits for other elements of urban ecological networks and people that live in cities.

TI  - Response time in the emergency services. Systematic review
PY  - 2018
AB  - The growth of the urban population raises concern about municipal public managers in the sense of providing emergency medical services (EMS) that are aligned with the needs of prehospital emergency medical care demanded by the population. The literature review aims at presenting the response time of emergency medical services in several parts of the world and discussing some factors that interfere in the result of this indicator such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product) percentage spent on health and life expectancy of countries. The study will also show that in some of the consulted articles, authors suggest to EMS recommendations for decreasing the response time using simulations, heuristics and metaheuristics. Response time is a basic indicator of emergency medical services, in such a way that researchers use the descriptive statistics to evaluate this parameter. Europe and the USA outstand in the publication of studies that present this information. Some articles use stochastic and mathematical methods to suggest models that simulate scenarios of response time reduction and suggest such proposals to the local EMS. Countries in which the response time was identified have a high index of human development and life expectancy between 74.7 and 83.7 years.

TI  - Butterfly species’ responses to urbanization: differing effects of human population density and built-up area
PY  - 2020
AB  - Good knowledge on how increasing urbanization affects biodiversity is essential in order to preserve biodiversity in urban green spaces. We examined how urban development affects species richness and total abundance of butterflies as well as the occurrence and abundance of individual species within the Helsinki metropolitan area in Northern Europe. Repeated butterfly counts in 167 separate 1-km-long transects within Helsinki covered the entire urbanization gradient, quantified by human population density and the proportion of built-up area (within a 50-m buffer surrounding each butterfly transect). We found consistently negative effects of both human population density and built-up area on all studied butterfly variables, though butterflies responded markedly more negatively to increasing human population density than to built-up area. Responses in butterfly species richness and total abundance showed higher variability in relation to proportion of built-up area than to human density, especially in areas of high human density. Increasing human density negatively affected both the abundance and the occurrence of 47% of the 19 most abundant species, whereas, for the proportion of built-up area, the corresponding percentages were 32% and 32%, respectively. Species with high habitat specificity and low mobility showed higher sensitivity to urbanization (especially high human population density) than habitat generalists and mobile species that dominated the urban butterfly communities. Our results suggest that human population density provides a better indicator of urbanization effects on butterflies compared to the proportion of built-up area. The generality of this finding should be verified in other contexts and taxonomic groups.

TI  - Predation risk shaped by habitat and landscape complexity in urban environments
PY  - 2018
AB  - 1. Habitat loss and modification are hallmarks of anthropogenic ecosystems, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and service provisioning often remain unclear. Understanding these links in cities is complicated by strong but fine‐scale differences in habitat structure among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across urban landscapes. 2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods. 3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales, cross‐scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where habitat amount was low to intermediate (10%–20%) at large spatial scales (250–500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low (<10%) at small (50–100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was intermediate (20%) at large spatial scales. 4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on cross‐scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In birds, predation activity can increase when high patch‐scale habitat heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount, suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure. 5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small‐scale interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.

TI  - CityNet—Deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Cities support unique and valuable ecological communities, but understanding urban wildlife is limited due to the difficulties of assessing biodiversity. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for population abundance and/or activity. However, existing algorithms systematically over and underestimate measures of biotic activity in the presence of typical urban non-biotic sounds in recordings. We develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four Acoustic Indices: Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient. CityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, whereas the Acoustic Indices performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data. Using CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings. If embedded within an autonomous sensing system, CityNet could produce environmental data for cites at large-scales and facilitate investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife. The algorithms, code and pretrained models are made freely available in combination with two expert-annotated urban audio datasets to facilitate automated environmental surveillance in cities.

TI  - Small farmlands can serve as open habitat for birds in subtropical cities of southern China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Greenspace or green cover is one of the major factors affecting urban avian diversity. In China, small farmlands producing vegetables are relatively common in cities. Although these farmlands could be a part of greenspaces, their habitat value for birds is rarely known. I investigated how these farmlands influenced winter bird community in two cities of southern China, using the multivariate latent variable model. I considered three green cover types: crop (mostly vegetables), weed (pioneer spontaneous vegetation), and wood (tree/shrub). I calculated the percentage of each green cover at local (50 m radius circular area) and landscape (500 m radius circular area) scales. Of 30 bird species, the abundance of 13 species decreased as crop cover decreased with increasing woody cover at the local scale, whereas the abundance of only two bird species increased with decreasing crop cover. Habitat preference of species mediated these responses, leading to a strong association between the open habit trait and the negative responses. Open habitat bird species richness was also negatively affected by decreasing local crop cover. Tree/shrub bird species richness showed a positive response to decreasing crop cover but the explanatory power of the local scale model was low. Variables at the landscape scale were rarely associated with species abundance or richness. These results suggest that small vegetable-dominant farmlands can serve as open habitat for birds in urban areas where greenspace largely consists of tree/shrub vegetation. The results also indicate that urban bird diversity is more influenced by local habitat features than landscape-scale features.

TI  - What shapes plant and animal diversity on urban golf courses
PY  - 2018
AB  - Recent concern over increasing loss of biodiversity has prompted considerable interest in the role of urban green spaces as reservoirs of local biodiversity. This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats.

TI  - Trait-dependent tolerance of bats to urbanization: a global meta-analysis.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization is a severe threat to global biodiversity, often leading to taxonomic and functional homogenization. However, current urban ecology research has focused mostly on urban birds and plants, limiting our ability to make generalizations about the drivers of urban biodiversity globally. To address this gap, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 87 studies, including 180 bat species (Chiroptera) from urban areas in Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. We aimed to (i) understand the importance of functional traits and phylogeny in driving changes in urban bat assemblages, and (ii) assess the capacity of traits for predicting which types of species are most sensitive to urbanization. Our results indicate that species-specific functional traits explain differences in the intensity of urban habitat use. Urban tolerance mainly occurred within the open and edge space foraging and trawling species as well as in bats with flexible roosting strategies. In addition, across bioregions and independent of phylogeny, urban tolerance correlated with higher aspect ratio, a trait enabling fast flight but less agile manoeuvres during aerial food acquisition. Predictive success varied between bioregions, between 43 and 83%. Our analysis demonstrates that the local extinction of bat species in urban areas is non-random, trait-based and predictable, allowing urban landscape managers to tailor local conservation actions to particular types of species.

TI  - The role of ‘nativeness’ in urban greening to support animal biodiversity
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The classification of plant species as native or exotic has ramifications for how they are treated within urban green space policy and practice. Green spaces are built or managed to fulfil a range of ecological and social functions, and decisions must be made about which plants to include to achieve these functions. There is growing literary and policy emphasis on native-only planting strategies, under the assumption that native species will deliver a greater range of biodiversity benefits. Yet, there remains a disconnection between theoretical debates on the definition or value of nativeness, and urban design practice. Using a systematic review, we examine the relationship between plant nativeness and animal biodiversity in urban areas. We argue that both the use and definition of native species involve value-laden decisions. The social roots of ‘native’ definitions have led to ambiguity in its use within the literature. Despite this ambiguity, we find that most studies show a positive influence of native plants on at least one measure of biodiversity, justifying their priority in urban plantings to support native animals. We conclude with considerations for the selection of plants for urban greening to promote native biodiversity: 1) the resources a plant provides are more important than its origin, but 2) when in doubt, ‘nativeness’ is a good surrogate of whether a plant will provide for local animals, and allows for the conservation of plants themselves; and 3) flexibility in scale of provenance allows for strategic responses to changing climates or competing objectives of urban design.

TI  - Phyllosphere bacterial communities in urban green areas throughout Europe relate to urban intensity.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The phyllosphere harbours a diverse and specific bacterial community, which influences plant health and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated the impact of urban green areas connectivity and size on the composition and diversity of phyllosphere bacterial communities. Hereto, we evaluated the diversity and composition of phyllosphere bacterial communities of 233 Platanus x acerifolia and Acer pseudoplatanus trees in 77 urban green areas throughout 6 European cities. The community composition and diversity significantly differed between cities but only to a limited extent between tree species. We could show that urban intensity correlated significantly with the community composition of phyllosphere bacteria. In particular, a significant correlation was found between the relative abundances for 29 out of the 50 most abundant families and the urban intensity: the abundances of classic phyllosphere families, such as Acetobacteraceae, Planctomycetes, and Beijerinkiaceae, decreased with urban intensity (i.e. more abundant in areas with more green, lower air pollution, and lower temperature), while those related to human activities, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, increased with urban intensity. The results of this study suggest that phyllosphere bacterial communities in European cities are associated with urban intensity and that effect is mediated by several combined stress factors.

TI  - Understanding avian assemblage change within anthropogenic environments using citizen science data.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Anthropogenic land use is a major driver of biodiversity loss, with different land use activities having a range of impacts on native communities. These myriad impacts make it difficult to identify the key drivers of species declines, especially across heterogenous anthropogenic environments. Our study aims to identify whether the species and traits being lost in disturbed environments differ across a land-use intensity gradient, in order to prioritise management effort in Greater Brisbane, Australia. We applied List Length Analysis (LLA) to standardise citizen-collected avian records, and model the change in prevalence for 182 bird species within urban, rural and forested environments. We then tested whether understorey-nesting, ground-nesting, insectivorous or small-bodied functional groups were significantly declining in prevalence within the entire avian assemblage. We found a greater probability of decline for small-bodied and understorey-nesting species in urban environments, lending support to established findings that, in urban environments of Greater Brisbane, competition with larger territorial birds and understorey loss are impacting communities. Our study also highlighted that the species declining and increasing in prevalence differed across the land use intensity gradient. Management approaches should therefore be targeted to mitigate the distinct impacts associated with particular land uses. In Greater Brisbane, managers should focus on maintaining urban understories and monitoring overabundant avian competitors. Where funds are limited, LLA represents a useful tool to harness non-standardised data, to guide early management and monitoring effort. Such tools equip managers to conserve biodiversity in anthropogenic environments.

TI  - Effect of Urbanization on Vegetation in Riparian Area: Plant Communities in Artificial and Semi-Natural Habitats
PY  - 2019
AB  - Riparian areas are local hot spots of biodiversity that are vulnerable and easily degraded. Comparing plant communities in habitats with different degrees of urbanization may provide valuable information for the management and restoration of these vulnerable habitats. In this study, we explored the impact of urbanization on vegetation communities between artificial and semi-natural habitats within two rivers with different levels of development. We compared species richness, types of vegetation, and composition patterns of the plants in our study. In artificial habitats, the sites with relatively high levels of urbanization had the highest species richness, while in semi-natural habitats, the highest species richness was recorded in the less urbanized sites. Furthermore, every component of urbanization that contributed to the variation of species richness was examined in the current study. In artificial habitats, the proportion of impervious surface was the strongest predictor of the variation in species richness and was associated with the richness of alien, native, and riparian species. In semi-natural habitats, most of the richness of alien and native species were associated with the distance to the city center, and the number of riparian and ruderal species was significantly related to the proportion of impervious surface. Moreover, we found that a high level of urbanization was always associated with a large abundance of alien and ruderal species in both artificial and in semi-natural habitats. We recommend the methods of pair comparison of multiple rivers to analyze the impact of urbanization on plant species in riparian areas and have suggested various management actions for maintaining biodiversity and sustainability in riparian ecosystems.

TI  - Biophilia beyond the Building: Applying the Tools of Urban Biodiversity Planning to Create Biophilic Cities
PY  - 2021
AB  - In response to the widely recognized negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity, many cities are reimagining urban design to provide better biodiversity support. Some cities have developed urban biodiversity plans, primarily focused on improving biodiversity support and ecosystem function within the built environment through habitat restoration and other types of urban greening projects. The biophilic cities movement seeks to reframe nature as essential infrastructure for cities, seamlessly integrating city and nature to provide abundant, accessible nature for all residents and corresponding health and well-being outcomes. Urban biodiversity planning and biophilic cities have significant synergies in their goals and the means necessary to achieve them. In this paper, we identify three key ways by which the urban biodiversity planning process can support biophilic cities objectives: engaging the local community; identifying science-based, quantitative goals; and setting priorities for action. Urban biodiversity planning provides evidence-based guidance, tools, and techniques needed to design locally appropriate, pragmatic habitat enhancements that support biodiversity, ecological health, and human health and well-being. Developing these multi-functional, multi-benefit strategies that increase the abundance of biodiverse nature in cities has the potential at the same time to deepen and enrich our biophilic experience in daily life.

TI  - Seeds of the Future in the Present: Exploring Pathways for Navigating Towards “Good” Anthropocenes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Chapter Highlights 1. The rapid urbanization associated with the Anthropocene provides an imperative for humans to think differently about the future. 2. The “seeds” approach describes how niche experiments can, over time, coalesce to shift the dominant regime onto a more sustainable trajectory. 3. To achieve positive urban futures, it is vital to ensure that more positive narratives inform our lived experience so that, as humans, we are able to act differently in the face of seemingly overwhelming challenges. 4. Novel scenarios can be developed by imagining futures in which seemingly disparate ideas must coexist; fostering this creativity is important if we are to create positive visions of futures that we would like to achieve. 5. Urban transformations are complex phenomena; the seeds approach is a tool that can help us understand how transformations occur and how to nudge them towards more sustainable trajectories.

TI  - MAMÍFEROS URBANOS COLOMBIANOS: UNA REVISIÓN DE LO QUE SABEMOS Y LO QUE NOS FALTA
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban ecosystems are amongst the fastest growing environments on the planet due to the increase in human population. Hence, it is necessary to obtain information about biodiversity in such environments for their management and conservation. I reviewed the publications about Colombian urban mammals and analyzed four aspects: 1) the relationship between the number of publications and the year, 2) the contribution of publications from natural regions and departments, 3) the relationship between the number of publications and the human population per department, and 4) the contribution of publications about different subjects and mammal orders in different natural regions. The number of publications about urban mammals has increased exponentially with time, but the number of publications is not uniformly distributed among natural regions or departments. There was a positive relationship between the human population size per department and the number of publications. Nevertheless, in some departments, there was a higher than expected number of publications, whereas in others it was below the expectations. There is limited information about the ecological responses of mammals to urbanization, their possibility to transfer diseases, the species composition in most urban areas, and the effect of urbanizations on mammal diversity. I suggest that places such as university campuses and low-cost behavioral indicators based on activity or foraging should be used for experiments to develop strategies to allow the coexistence between humans and wild mammals in and around the cities.

TI  - A review of drivers of tree diversity in suburban areas: Research needs for North American cities
PY  - 2016
AB  - Tree diversity is crucial to urban forest management. More diverse urban forests provide habitat for a wider range of organisms, increase resilience to pests and disease and, in cases where native tree species are well represented, contribute to local biodiversity protection. Studies have shown that tree diversity can peak in the low- to mid-density neighbourhoods found in suburban and peri-urban areas, emphasizing the potential for biodiversity enhancement during and after subdivision development. Most studies quantifying tree species composition in suburban areas focus on one or two major drivers of tree diversity, such as land use, socioeconomics and demographics, or the presence of natural features like parks or greenways. Furthermore, relatively little attention has been paid to the drivers of diversity for the variety of land types that make up the entire urban forest, which represent differences in tree planting and establishment practices, ownership, and maintenance. This paper presents an overvie...

TI  - Does economic development improve urban greening? Evidence from 289 cities in China using spatial regression models
PY  - 2018
AB  - Significant differences in urban greening have occurred in Chinese cities, accompanied by China’s rapid urbanization. However, there are relatively few studies on the spatial differentiation of urban greening in China at the city level. In addition, there is no unanimous conclusion on the main factors influencing the spatial differentiation of urban greening. Based on 2014 emission inventory data from 289 cities, the spatial differentiation pattern and spatial correlation characteristics of the urban green space ratio, urban green coverage rate, and public green area per capita were calculated and analyzed using global and local Moran’s I. We then used ordinary least squares, spatial error model, spatial autoregression, and geographically weighted regression to quantify the impact and spatial variations of China’s economy on urban greening. The results showed (1) a significant spatial dependence and heterogeneity existed in urban greening values, and the patterns showed influences of both the stage of economic development and spatial agglomeration; (2) regression models revealed per capita GDP had a positive effect on the urban green space ratio and public green area per capita while the urbanization rate, secondary industry, urban land, and population density had opposite effects on these two greening indexes; and (3) geographically weighted regression revealed per capita GDP had a greater influence on urban greening in the northwestern region than in the southeastern region. The study could constitute a valuable reference for mid-to-long-term green space planning policy in diverse parts of China and could further assist in coordinating the development of urban greening and economic growth.

TI  - Detecting patterns of vertebrate biodiversity across the multidimensional urban landscape.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Explicit characterisation of the complexity of urban landscapes is critical for understanding patterns of biodiversity and for detecting the underlying social and ecological processes that shape them. Urban environments exhibit variable heterogeneity and connectivity, influenced by different historical contingencies, that affect community assembly across scales. The multidimensional nature of urban disturbance and co-occurrence of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effects leading to nonlinear responses in populations and communities. Yet, current research design of urban ecology and evolutionary studies typically relies on simple representation of the parameter space that can be observed. Sampling approaches apply simple urban gradients such as linear transects in space or comparisons of urban sites across the urban mosaic accounting for a few variables. This rarely considers multiple dimensions and scales of biodiversity, and proves to be inadequate to explain observed patterns. We apply a multidimensional approach that integrates distinctive social, ecological and built characteristics of urban landscapes, representing variations along dimensions of heterogeneity, connectivity and historical contingency. Measuring species richness and beta diversity across 100 US metropolitan areas at the city and 1-km scales, we show that distinctive signatures of urban biodiversity can result from interactions between socioecological heterogeneity and connectivity, mediated by historical contingency.

TI  - The effects of residential greenspace on avian Biodiversity in Beijing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Residential communities are the primary living spaces for people in China. Their associated greenspaces are important elements of the urban ecosystem, providing neighborhood ecosystem services and hosting bird populations of differing community structures compared with other urban green areas. This study analyzes avian community characteristics within residential communities and their differences compared with urban parks in Beijing. Furthermore, we assess the key environmental factors determining species composition and population sizes and the spatial scales at which these factors are most significant. We randomly selected 27 residential communities to assess the habitat structure and landscape characteristics that underpin residential avian assemblages across multiple spatial scales. Independent sample t-test and model selection methods based on AICc were used for data analysis. Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) (hereafter ETS) alone accounted for 91.0% of total individuals. Compared with urban parks, more migrants and omnivores were found in residential communities. Within-site forest patch connectivity simultaneously decided resident species diversity and individual abundance, with the exception of ETS. Tree species richness and coverage are key predictors for resident species richness and ETS numbers, respectively. Even in the most urbanized species, ETS retained ecological attributes found in “wilder” settings. Residential communities skewed toward avian communities with dominant numbers of ETS. In these low-quality habitats, our results suggest that landscape configuration is more important than local habitat structure. Within-site habitat connectivity and the number of surrounding forest patches with shorter between-patch distances deserve more attention in future landscape design for residential communities.

TI  - Non-native species dominate herpetofaunal community patterns in both native and non-native habitat patches in urban Miami-Dade County
PY  - 2019
AB  - Land use change and invasive species are two of the leading causes of native biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of how these interact in urban centers is limited. In South Florida (USA), urbanization and increased anthropogenic pressure has led to massive land conversion and species introductions. South Florida has the largest number of established non-native reptile and amphibian species in the world, while detection of many native species has decreased. Native species may be adapted to the unique and rare habitats of South Florida such as the pine rocklands, which have been reduced to 2% of their original extent. We conducted surveys for reptiles and amphibians in 15 pairs of native/non-native parks to examine the interaction between habitat modification and herpetofaunal invasion. Less than 10% of the individuals recorded were native, and we found no difference in the relative abundance or richness of native species between native and non-native parks. Community analyses indicate that only 9% of the total variance in herpetofaunal community composition is between native and non-native parks, and that even this difference is driven by non-native species. The brahminy blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus), the most widely introduced snake species in the world, is the best indicator of native habitat patches, and two invasive lizards from the Caribbean (Anolis sagrei and A. equestris) are the best indicators of non-native habitat. These results demonstrate that non-native reptiles and amphibians dominate both non-native and native habitat patches in Miami-Dade County.

TI  - Green infrastructure and atmospheric pollution shape diversity and composition of phyllosphere bacterial communities in an urban landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - The microbial habitat on leaf surfaces, also called the phyllosphere, is a selective environment for bacteria, harbouring specific phyllosphere bacterial communities (PBCs). These communities influence plant health, plant-community diversity, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services. Host plants in an urban environment accommodate different PBCs than those in non-urban environments, but previous studies did not address individual urban factors. In this study, the PBC composition and diversity of 55 London plane (Platanus x acerifolia) trees throughout an urban landscape (Antwerp, Belgium) were determined using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. An increasing proportion of green infrastructure in the surrounding of the trees, and subsequently decreasing proportion of anthropogenic land use, was linked with taxa loss, expressed in lower phyllosphere alpha diversity and higher abundances of typical phyllosphere bacteria such as Hymenobacter, Pseudomonas and Beijerinckia. Although air pollution exposure, as assessed by leaf magnetic analysis, did not link with alpha diversity, it correlated with shifts in PBC composition in form of turnover, an equilibrium of taxa gain and taxa loss. We found that both urban landscape composition and air pollution exposure - each in their own unique way - influence bacterial communities in the urban tree phyllosphere.

TI  - Drivers of Central European urban land snail faunas: the role of climate and local species pool in the representation of native and non-native species
PY  - 2016
AB  - The importance of macroclimate and dispersal limitation in the broad-scale variation of European urban land snail assemblages is likely to differ between native and non-native species because of the southern origin of many non-native snails, often spread by humans. We sampled land snails in each of 32 European cities and compiled from the literature a list of land snail species reported from the surroundings of each city. To quantify the predictive power of climate and local species pools, beta-sim dissimilarity matrices of both native and non-native species were explored using MDS and RDA ordination methods, Mantel tests with bootstrapping of each dataset, and multivariate homogeneity analysis of group variances. We observed no significant relation between the numbers of non-native species found in the cities and their surroundings (p > 0.133), while the percentage of native species in the cities derived from their local species pools decreased significantly with the increasing species richness of local faunas (rS = −0.75, p < 0.001). Assemblage variation of urban native species was explained mostly by the difference between mean January and July temperatures (21.3 %), with the major role of July temperature (18.0 %). In contrast, variation of non-native species assemblages was mainly explained by January temperature (19.9 %). The congruence in faunal similarities between the cities and the surrounding areas was higher in native (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) than in non-native species (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). Overall native faunas were significantly more homogeneous than the non-native faunas. Our results suggest that recent climate warming may foster geographical expansions of many non-native land snail species as their distributions are controlled mainly by January temperature.

TI  - The relationship between urban forests and race: A meta-analysis
PY  - 2018
AB  - There is ample evidence that urban trees benefit the physical, mental, and social health of urban residents. The environmental justice hypothesis posits that environmental amenities are inequitably low in poor and minority communities, and predicts these communities experience fewer urban environmental benefits. Some previous research has found that urban forest cover is inequitably distributed by race, though other studies have found no relationship or negative inequity. These conflicting results and the single-city nature of the current literature suggest a need for a research synthesis. Using a systematic literature search and meta-analytic techniques, we examined the relationship between urban forest cover and race. First, we estimated the average (unconditional) relationship between urban forest cover and race across studies (studies = 40; effect sizes = 388). We find evidence of significant race-based inequity in urban forest cover. Second, we included characteristics of the original studies and study sites in meta-regressions to illuminate drivers of variation of urban forest cover between studies. Our meta-regressions reveal that the relationship varies across racial groups and by study methodology. Models reveal significant inequity on public land and that environmental and social characteristics of cities help explain variation across studies. As tree planting and other urban forestry programs proliferate, urban forestry professionals are encouraged to consider the equity consequences of urban forestry activities, particularly on public land.

TI  - Insights for the Enhancement of Urban Biodiversity Using Nature-Based Solutions: The Role of Urban Spaces in Green Infrastructures Design
PY  - 2022
AB  - AbstractNature-Based Solutions (NBS) increase their efficacy if included in an overall framework such as Green Infrastructures (GI), maximising ecosystem benefits and avoiding possible negative externalities and trade-offs. Urban green spaces and NBS are components of GI that increase the quality of urban settings, enhancing territorial resilience, and improving the health and well-being of citizens. The research proposes a methodology, tested in the municipality of Settimo Torinese (North-west of Italy), for selecting urban green spaces with high performance in terms of biodiversity conservation, which can involve a GI strategy as a multifunctional structure that combines different Ecosystem Services (ES). The enhancement of natural capital and ES provision is reached identifying suitable NBS to protect and improve biodiversity based on the Habitat Quality (HQ) assessment, considered a key supporting service. HQ was derived testing two different sensitivity data: the first based on Land Use/Land Cover, while the second uses the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. The latter was functional to overcome limits in representing the ecologic integrity of urban areas highlighting an important variety of green spaces and related ES, especially in compact cities. The results are useful for defining effective environmental policies and strategies in urban areas and addressing the decision-making process towards sustainable development goals.KeywordsHabitat QualityNormalised Difference Vegetation IndexEcosystem services mappingUrban PlanningPerformance-based planning

TI  - Landscape-scale differences among cities alter common species' responses to urbanization.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Understanding how biodiversity responds to urbanization is challenging, due in part to the single-city focus of most urban ecological research. Here, we delineate continent-scale patterns in urban species assemblages by leveraging data from a multi-city camera trap survey and quantify how differences in greenspace availability and average housing density among 10 North American cities relate to the distribution of eight widespread North American mammals. To do so, we deployed camera traps at 569 sites across these ten cities between 18 June and 14 August. Most data came from 2017, though some cities contributed 2016 or 2018 data if it was available. We found that the magnitude and direction of most species' responses to urbanization within a city were associated with landscape-scale differences among cities. For example, eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) responses to urbanization changed from negative to positive once the proportion of green space within a city was >~20%. Likewise, raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) responses to urbanization changed from positive to negative once the average housing density of a city exceeded about 700 housing units/km2 . We also found that local species richness within cities consistently declined with urbanization in only the more densely developed cities (>~700 housing units/km2 ). Given our results, it may therefore be possible to design cities to better support biodiversity and reduce the negative influence of urbanization on wildlife by, for example, increasing the amount of green space within a city. Additionally, it may be most important for densely populated cities to find innovative solutions to bolster wildlife resilience because they were the most likely to observe diversity losses of common urban species.

TI  - Urbanization, environmental stabilization and temporal persistence of bird species: a view from Latin America.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background A scarcely studied consequence of urbanization is the effect of temporal stabilization of the environment on bird communities. This alteration is thought to dampen environmental variations between day and night, seasons and years, promoting a temporal persistence of bird composition in urban areas. The aim of this study was to review current evidence of temporal stabilization of biotic and abiotic factors in urban environments and the potential effects of such stabilization on temporal variation of bird species presence at different temporal scales. Methods I selected the literature by searching published articles and book chapters using Scopus and Google scholar. I only included articles that compared the temporal variation of bird composition or resources between different levels of urbanization. Results In general, there is evidence of temporal stabilization of abiotic and biotic factors at the three time scales considered. At the diurnal scale, the main factor considered was artificial light in the context of light pollution. At the seasonal and interannual scales, several case studies found a smaller temporal variation of primary productivity in urban than in natural and rural areas. Bird species composition showed more stabilization in urban environments at the three temporal scales: (1) several case studies reported bird activity at night, associated with artificial light; (2) studies in urban parks and along urbanization gradients showed smaller seasonal variation of bird composition in the more urbanized areas; and (3) in general, case studies along urbanization gradients showed smaller interannual variation of bird composition in the more urbanized areas, although some studies showed no relationships or opposite trends than expected. Discussion The published evidence suggests that urban areas dampen the natural cycles at several temporal scales. The stabilization of biotic and abiotic factors, such as light, temperature, food and habitat structure, is desynchronized from natural diurnal, seasonal and interannual cycles. However, there is a dearth of long-term comparisons of bird composition and studies that simultaneously analyze the relationship between resources and bird composition stabilization at the seasonal and interannual scales. More research is needed in the Southern hemisphere, where there is a lack of studies dealing with the seasonal and interannual variations of primary productivity along urbanization gradients and nocturnal activity of bird species. A future research agenda should include differentiation of spatial and temporal homogenization of avifaunas.

TI  - Endangered Plants in Novel Urban Ecosystems Are Filtered by Strategy Type and Dispersal Syndrome, Not by Spatial Dependence on Natural Remnants
PY  - 2020
AB  - Understanding the contribution of cities to nature conservation is gaining increasing importance with a globally accelerating urbanization and requires insights into the mechanisms that underlie urban distribution patterns. While a considerable number of endangered plant species have been reported for cities, the spatial dependence of populations of these species on natural remnants versus anthropogenic ecosystems is critically understudied due to deficiencies in population distribution data. To which extent endangered species in anthropogenic ecosystems spatially rely on natural remnants is thus an open question. We used a unique dataset of 1,742 precisely mapped populations of 213 endangered plant species in the city of Berlin and related these point data to habitat patches that had been assigned to natural remnants, hybrid ecosystems and novel ecosystems according to the novel ecosystem approach. By applying recent techniques in point pattern analysis (Ripley's K function, cross K function, cross pair correlation function) we unraveled the spatial dependence of the populations towards the different ecosystem types. Moreover, we tested how plant traits related to plant strategy and dispersal filter for species assemblages across ecosystems. Differentiating populations on anthropogenic sites revealed that populations in hybrid ecosystems spatially depended on natural remnants, but populations in novel ecosystems (i.e. more than a third of all populations) surprisingly didn’t. A conditional inference tree showed that endangered plant species in novel ecosystems are filtered for ruderal strategy type and wind dispersal syndrome, while competitive and stress-tolerant species were assigned to natural remnants. Our results highlight the importance of conserving natural remnants as habitats and seed sources of endangered plants. Yet novel urban ecosystems can support many populations of endangered plant species beyond the adjacency to natural remnants, with hybrid ecosystems likely acting as stepping stones. This indicates a specific contribution of urban ecosystems to biodiversity conservation. Since different filters modulate the species assemblages of different ecosystem types, novel urban ecosystems are not supposed to substitute fully the habitat functions of natural remnants. Our study thus highlights promising opportunities for involving the total range of urban ecosystem types into urban conservation approaches.

TI  - Dealing with the promise of metabarcoding in mega-event biomonitoring: EXPO2015 unedited data
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As human activities on our planet persist, causing widespread and irreversible environmental degradation, the need to biomonitor ecosystems has never been more pressing. These circumstances have required a renewal in monitoring techniques, encouraged by necessity to develop more rapid and accurate tools which will support timely observations of ecosystem structure and function. The World Exposition (from now ‘EXPO2015’) hosted in Milan from May to October 2015 was a global event that could be categorized as a mega-event, which can be defined as an acute environmental stressor, possibly generating biodiversity alteration and disturbance.</jats:p><jats:p>During the six months of EXPO2015, exhibitors from more than 135 countries and 22 million visitors insisted on a 1.1 million square meters area. Faced with such a massive event, we explore the potential of DNA metabarcoding using three molecular markers to improve the understanding of anthropogenic impacts in the area, both considering air and water monitoring. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the taxonomy assignment phase considering different taxonomic levels of analysis and the use of data mining approaches to predict sample origin. Unless the degree of taxa identification still remains open, our results showed that DNA metabarcoding is a powerful genomic-based tool to monitor biodiversity at the microscale, allowing us to capture exact fingerprints of specific event sites and to explore in a comprehensive manner the eukaryotic community alteration. With this work, we aim to disentangle and overcome the crucial issues related to the generalization of DNA metabarcoding in order to support future applications.</jats:p>

TI  - Intensive management reduces butterfly diversity over time in urban green spaces
PY  - 2018
AB  - Loss and fragmentation of semi-natural grasslands have had negative consequences for grassland biodiversity, such as butterflies. Urban parks and other urban green spaces have so far largely been overlooked as suitable butterfly habitats, although they could potentially sustain diverse butterfly populations over time. We analysed the temporal change in butterfly species assemblages in urban green spaces in the city of Malmo, Southern Sweden. We studied changes in species richness and abundance of butterflies between 2006 and 2015 in 20 public urban green spaces, characterized by different management regimes. We sampled butterflies in traditional parks with intense grass cutting regimes, in semi-natural grasslands mowed only a few times per year, and in un-managed or irregularly managed ruderal sites. We found a slight increase in the total number of butterfly species in the study area, but a general decline in local species numbers in urban green spaces. Traditional urban parks had the greatest loss of species over time, and altogether the lowest number of species. In contrast, semi-natural parks and ruderal sites had higher numbers of butterfly species and also lost fewer species over time. Our study shows that intensive management strategies in urban green spaces have a negative impact on butterfly assemblages over time. We suggest that less intensive management strategies can be used to create high-quality areas for flower-visiting insects in urban green spaces, possibly in combination with planting larval host plant species, depending on the park type and design.

TI  - Impacts of roads on bird species richness: A meta-analysis considering road types, habitats and feeding guilds.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Roadsides can harbour remarkable biodiversity; thus, they are increasingly considered as habitats with potential for conservation value. To improve construction and management of roadside habitats with positive effects on biodiversity, we require a quantitative understanding of important influential factors that drive both positive and negative effects of roads. We conducted meta-analyses to assess road effects on bird communities. We specifically tested how the relationship between roads and bird richness varies when considering road type, habitat characteristics and feeding guild association. Overall, bird richness was similar in road habitats compared to non-road habitats, however, the two apparently differ in species composition. Bird richness was lowered by road presence in areas with denser tree cover but did not differ according to road type. Richness differences between habitats with and without roads further depended on primary diet of species, and richness of omnivores was positively affected by road presence. We conclude that impacts of roads on bird richness are highly context-dependent, and planners should carefully evaluate road habitats on a case by case basis. This emphasizes the need for further studies that explicitly test for differences in species composition and abundance, to disentangle contexts where a road will negatively affect bird communities, and where it will not.

TI  - Temperature accounts for the biodiversity of a hyperdiverse group of insects in urban Los Angeles
PY  - 2019
AB  - The urban heat island effect is a worldwide phenomenon that has been linked to species distributions and abundances in cities. However, effects of urban heat on biotic communities are nearly impossible to disentangle from effects of land cover in most cases because hotter urban sites also have less vegetation and more impervious surfaces than cooler sites within cities. We sampled phorid flies, one of the largest, most biologically diverse families of true flies (Insecta: Diptera: Phoridae), at 30 sites distributed across the central Los Angeles Basin, where we found that temperature and the density of urban land cover are decoupled. Abundance, richness, and community composition of phorids were most parsimoniously accounted for by mean air temperature in the week preceding sampling. Sites with intermediate mean temperatures had more phorid fly individuals and higher richness. Communities became more even with lower minimum temperatures and further away from natural areas, suggesting that communities further away from natural source populations may be more homogenized. Species composition was best explained by minimum temperature. Inasmuch as warmer areas within cities can predict future effects of climate change, phorid fly communities are likely to shift non-linearly under future climates in more natural areas. Exhaustive surveys of biotic communities, such as the one we describe here, can provide baselines for determining the effects of urban and global climate warming as they intensify.

TI  - Cemeteries and biodiversity conservation in cities: how do landscape and patch-level attributes influence bird diversity in urban park cemeteries?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cemeteries can help conserve biodiversity in urban landscapes, but their capacity to support native species is likely to be influenced by variables at different spatial scales. There is growing evidence on how landscape and patch-level attributes influence biodiversity in urban parks. However, there is limited evidence about cemeteries. Park cemeteries are dominated by vegetation because they are managed to simulate traditional parks, and thus, could contribute to the conservation of native fauna in cities. We present the first study on how patch variables (cemetery size and vegetation density) and landscape variables (vegetation cover and road density within 1 km) influence the richness and abundance of native birds in urban park cemeteries. During summer and autumn, we surveyed birds in park cemeteries in the Mediterranean city of Santiago, Chile – a large Latin American city located in a biodiversity hotspot. We recorded 42 bird species (38 native and 4 exotic). We found that cemeteries surrounded by high vegetation cover supported more native birds, whereas cemeteries surrounded by high road density supported low native bird abundance. We also found a seasonal effect: cemeteries supported more individuals of native birds in autumn than in summer, probably due to birds migrating to our study area from higher latitude, altitude, and surrounding environments, in their search for milder weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that park cemeteries host a variety of native birds, which contributes to maintain biodiversity in urban landscapes. However, the surrounding landscape influences their capacity to support native birds and to conserve biodiversity in cities.

TI  - Linking Urbanization and the Environment: Conceptual and Empirical Advances
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urbanization is one of the biggest social transformations of modern time, driving and driven by multiple social, economic, and environmental processes. The impacts of urbanization on the environment are profound, multifaceted and are manifested at the local, regional, and global scale. This article reviews recent advances in conceptual and empirical knowledge linking urbanization and the environment, focusing on six core aspects: air pollution, ecosystems, land use, biogeochemical cycles and water pollution, solid waste management, and the climate. We identify several emerging trends and remaining questions in urban environmental research, including (a) increasing evidence on the amplified or accelerated environmental impacts of urbanization; (b) varying distribution patterns of impacts along geographical and other socio-economic gradients; (c) shifting focus from understanding and quantifying the impacts of urbanization toward understanding the processes and underlying mechanisms; (d) increasing focus on...

TI  - A Framework for Fairness Evaluation and Improvement of Urban Green Space: A Case of Wuhan Metropolitan Area in China
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) provides a wide range of ecosystem services for human beings. The fairness of UGS distribution has important implications for sustainable urban development and human well-being. However, many current studies on green space fairness are limited to within specific cities, and UGS fairness in rapidly developing metropolitan areas is still largely neglected. This study quantifies the change in green space fairness in the Wuhan metropolitan area from 2000 to 2020 based on a long time series of land cover and population spatial distribution products. We incorporated green space types and population distribution into the fairness evaluation framework, quantified the value of green space ecosystem services available to people through nested buffers, and analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of green space fairness in the study area based on the Gini coefficient of each city. The results show that the supply of green space services in most cities has shown a trend of “decreasing and then increasing” in the past 20 years. The fairness of green space in three cities has shown an improving trend, and the Gini coefficient in four cities is still above 0.50 in 2020. Based on the current green space and related indicators in each city, we propose future greening policies for each city. The methodology and conclusions of this study will help improve future green space planning recommendations in metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations, thus promoting regional public infrastructure coproduction and sharing.

TI  - Biodiversity of collembola on green roofs: A case study of three cities in Belgium
PY  - 2022
AB  - Green roofs are often promoted as a mean to counter the negative environmental effects of urbanization on nature and to increase the amount of green space in cities. Green roofs often enhance aboveground biodiversity, especially herbivores and pollinators. However, if and in what way they support belowground biodiversity, and more specifically soil fauna, is rarely studied. Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island-biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics. However, we suggest that future studies are needed to investigate whether our findings are applicable to other groups of soil-living arthropods. • Mean numbers of collembolan individuals differed between different months. • Age of the roof positively influenced the abundance of Collembola. • Other roof characteristics did not influence abundance or diversity significantly. • Collembola found on green roofs were those with a wide geographical distribution.

TI  - The Anthropocene: Conservation in a Human-Dominated Nature
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many scientists today argue for designating the present age as a new geologic epoch – the Anthropocene –characterized by unprecedented current effects of humans on climate, land use, and geologic processes. Today less than 25% of the Earth’s ice-free surface is uninhabited (“wild”) landscape. The rest is either densely occupied or highly modified by humans. Such anthropogenic biomes or “anthromes” may themselves be home to “novel ecosystems” containing species assemblages never previously observed. Urban areas represent the most novel anthromes of all, yet may be sites where the future of biodiversity conservation is determined. Today conservationists must help create a “responsible Anthropocene” where human influence is more beneficent toward nature, not only to prevent extinction of species but the extinction of experience between humans and nature.

TI  - Effects of landscape attribute towards bird assemblages in urban areas of Peninsular Malaysia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation is the transformation of a natural ecosystem into more artificial habitat to give way for development and is occurring at an unprecedented rate globally. The urban expansion involves alterations of urban landscapes, resulting in habitat loss and threatening biodiversity. Landscape attributes of urban areas are known to influence urban bird composition, but to what extent is still poorly understood. Thus, several urban areas in west Peninsular Malaysia with varying intensity of urbanisation were chosen to determine the effect of landscape attributes on bird communities. A total of 4936 individual birds from 20 species representing 14 families, were recorded throughout the observations, dominated by Corvidae (crows). Based on the functional groups, only garden birds and omnivory feeding guild showed a significant difference in their abundance among different urban sites. Omnivory was the most abundant feeding guild (80%), dominated by House crow (Corvus splendens). This study shows that species composition is not influenced by level of urban intensity, but by the landscape attributes of each urban area. Multiple Regression analysis indicated that water bodies and roads significantly predicted species richness of birds, whereas high vegetation cover, road, and open area significantly predicted bird abundance. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination indicated that urban birds are not selective of landscape attributes, unlike other bird groups. This study revealed that heterogeneity of landscape attributes is essential to enhance bird composition and ultimately biodiversity in urban areas, thus key factors in designing ecocentric cities.

TI  - Mammal diversity and metacommunity dynamics in urban green spaces: implications for urban wildlife conservation
PY  - 2017
AB  - As urban growth expands and natural environments fragment, it is essential to understand the ecological roles fulfilled by urban green spaces. To evaluate how urban green spaces function as wildlife habitat, we estimated mammal diversity and metacommunity dynamics in city parks, cemeteries, golf courses, and natural areas throughout the greater Chicago, Illinois, USA region. We found similar α-diversity (with the exception of city parks), but remarkably dissimilar communities in different urban green spaces. Additionally, the type of urban green space greatly influenced species colonization and persistence rates. For example, coyotes (Canis latrans) had the highest, but white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) the lowest probability of persistence in golf courses compared to other green space types. Further, most species had a difficult time colonizing city parks even when sites were seemingly available. Our results indicate that urban green spaces contribute different, but collectively important, habitats for maintaining and conserving biodiversity in cities.

TI  - Immigration and establishment of Trypanosoma cruzi in Arequipa, Peru.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Changing environmental conditions, including those caused by human activities, reshape biological communities through both loss of native species and establishment of non-native species in the altered habitats. Dynamic interactions with the abiotic environment impact both immigration and initial establishment of non-native species into these altered habitats. The repeated emergence of disease systems in urban areas worldwide highlights the importance of understanding how dynamic migratory processes affect the current and future distribution and abundance of pathogens in urban environments. In this study, we examine the pattern of invasion of Trypanosoma cruzi-the causative agent of human Chagas disease-in the city of Arequipa, Peru. Phylogenetic analyses of 136 T. cruzi isolates from Arequipa and other South American locations suggest that only one T. cruzi lineage established a population in Arequipa as all T. cruzi isolated from vectors in Arequipa form a recent monophyletic group within the broader South American phylogeny. We discuss several hypotheses that may explain the limited number of established T. cruzi lineages despite multiple introductions of the parasite.

TI  - What evidence exists on the possible effects of urban forms on terrestrial biodiversity in western cities? A systematic map protocol
PY  - 2021
AB  - As urban areas expand, scientists now agree that the city is an important space for biodiversity conservation. Yet, still relatively little is known about how urban forms could have a differential impact on terrestrial species and ecosystems. If some reviews have been conducted to examine the link between biodiversity and urban characteristics at an infra-city scale, none have explored the relationship between urban organization and biodiversity and tried to assess the capacity of various urban forms to maintain and possibly favour flora and fauna in the city. The resulting map will present the state of knowledge regarding possible relationships between urban forms and its features on the establishment and settlement of terrestrial and temperate biodiversity at infra-city scale in western cities. The systematic map will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) Guidelines. We will collect the relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature in French and English language. The scientific literature will be retrieved with the use of a search string in two publication databases, one environmental and one social science database (Web Of Science Core Collection, and Cairn.info). We will also perform supplementary searches (search engines, call for literature, search for relevant reviews). All references will be screened for relevance using a three-stage process, according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. Our study will concentrate on urban areas at the infra-city scale in cities of the temperate biogeographical zone. The subject population will include terrestrial species and ecosystems, except for archaea and bacteria. The exposure will consider all types of urban forms described by any urban descriptors or measures including heterogeneity, fragmentation, housing density, organisation of urban matrix, urban fabric) and all types of urban features (e.g. size, age of the buildings, materials, urban artefacts). All relevant outcomes will be considered (e.g. species richness, abundance, behaviour). We will provide an open-access database of the studies included in the map. Our results will also be presented narratively, together with tables and graphs summarising the key information coded from the retained articles (e.g. study characteristics, types and areas of research that has been undertaken, types of exposure, population concerned, etc.).

TI  - Heterogeneity in the land cover composition and configuration of US cities: implications for ecosystem services.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cities are comprised of complex matrices of differing development intensities, as well as interstitial natural and agricultural lands. While changes in development intensity along an urban-to-rural gradient within a city are well established, variation among cities is largely unexplored but has important in understanding heterogeneity of urban ecosystems and their services. The objectives were to: (1) characterize the variation in population density and land cover composition of cities of different population sizes and city ages, (2) determine differences among cities and the relationship with political and physiographic boundaries, and (3) determine if environmental characteristics differed by with composition and the implications for ecosystem services. We quantified the land cover composition, configuration, population density, and environmental characteristics of all urban areas with populations greater than 1000 people in the conterminous United States. Six types of cities emerged with differing dominant developed and interstitial land covers and configurations. Larger cities tend to be more similar and less representative of the typical US city, while urban age had little influence on characteristics. City types were clustered in different regions that were better accounted for by ecoregion than by state boundary. City types accounded for differences in environmental characteristics. The land cover composition and configuration varies among US cities of different sizes and physiographic regions likely contributing to variability in ecosystem services. Urban ecologists and planners should consider inter-city heterogeneity in developing experimental design and management of ecosystem services.

TI  - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Urbanization: Response of a Bird Community in the Neotropical Andes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urbanization constitutes one of the most aggressive drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss worldwide. However, studies focused on determining the response of local biodiversity to urbanization are still scarce, especially in tropical ecosystems. Urban ecosystems are characterized by low biological productivity which in turn leads to a reduction in biodiversity. However, the responses to urbanization should be species dependent. For instance, changes in the availability of resources can favor certain species with specific characteristics. We assessed the effects of the urbanization process on a bird community in a city located in the Tropical Andes of southern Ecuador, a region widely recognized for its diversity and endemism of birds. We selected three independent localities in each of the four levels of the urbanization gradient in the study area (forest, forest-pasture, pasture, and urban). In each locality, we sampled the bird community by visual and auditory surveys along 1 km transects between 2016 and 2017. We recorded a total of 1,257 individuals belonging to 74 bird species. We evaluated if the responses of richness and abundance of birds are dependent on trophic guild and foraging strata. We found a significant decrease in bird species richness and abundance from forest to urban sites. However, the response of birds was dependent on the trophic guild and foraging strata. Granivorous birds showed a positive response associated with the urbanization gradient while insectivorous birds showed a negative response. Insectivorous birds were more abundant in forest sites and decreased in abundance across the urbanization gradient. We found that the proportion of birds using different foraging strata drastically changed along urban gradient. Forest sites exhibited a bird community using a variety of habitats, but the bird community became simpler toward the most urbanized sites. Our findings showed different effects of urbanization on bird communities. The ugly: urbanization leads to a dramatic reduction in the diversity of birds, which is consistent in cities with different characteristics and ecological contexts. On the other hand, the responses of bird guilds to urbanization are species dependent. Some guilds are positively impacted by urbanization and show increases in species richness and abundance while other guilds are negatively impacted.</jats:p>

TI  - Contrasting effects of tree origin and urbanization on invertebrate abundance and tree phenology.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ongoing wide-scale introduction of non-native plants across the world may negatively influence native invertebrate fauna, due to a lack of co-evolved traits related to the novel plants, e.g. unique phytochemicals or shifted phenology. Non-native plants, specifically trees, are common in urban environments, areas that already pose novel habitats to plants and wildlife through a wide array of anthropogenic factors. For example, impervious surfaces contribute to increased ambient temperatures, the so-called urban heat island effect (UHI), which can affect local plant phenology. Yet, few studies have simultaneously studied the effects of urbanization and tree species origin on urban invertebrate communities. We measured the city-level UHI and phenology of nine native and seven non-native tree species in five city-centre parks in southern Sweden, as well as four common native species in a rural control forest. We quantified the abundance of invertebrates on a subset of native and non-native tree species through shake-sampling, sticky-traps and frass collection. In the urban environment, non-native trees hosted significantly fewer invertebrates compared to native trees. Furthermore, the non-native trees had a delayed phenology compared to native species, while the peak of caterpillars associated with the subset of trees surveyed for this measure was significantly earlier compared to that of the native species studied. The effect of tree species origin on urban invertebrate abundance was of a greater magnitude (effect size) than the effect of urbanization on invertebrate abundance in native tree hosts. Hence, the results indicate that the impact of non-native vegetation may be a stronger driver of invertebrate declines in urban areas than other factors. As the effect of species origin on tree phenology was at a level comparable to the urban effect, increasing prevalence of non-native vegetation can potentially obscure effects of urbanization on phenology in large-scale studies, as well as induce mis-matches to invertebrate populations. Since parks harbour a large proportion of urban biodiversity, native trees play a crucial role in such habitats and should not be considered replaceable by non-native species in terms of conservation value.

TI  - Reducing management intensity and isolation as promising tools to enhance ground-dwelling arthropod diversity in urban grasslands
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitat parameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within residential areas – even if not targeted for conservation plans – can provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered in urban planning.

TI  - Components of landscape pattern and urban biodiversity in an era of climate change: a global survey of expert knowledge
PY  - 2018
AB  - There is sufficient evidence to show that both humans and fauna are profoundly affected by landscape pattern composition and configuration in relation to adaptation to climate change impacts in urban landscapes. Despite this, global-scale research that ranks which components of landscape pattern play the most pivotal roles in this process is absent. Also lacking is in-depth examination of the potential areas of conflict between biodiversity conservation targets and those that pertain to human dimensions of climate change adaptation goals in relation to landscape patterns. The research aim was to determine how to identify, rank, and weight the most important components of landscape pattern affecting urban biodiversity in the changing climate and how to address areas of conflict between biodiversity conservation and human dimensions of climate change adaptation goals in terms of the spatial patterning of land cover classes distributed across urban landscapes. To do this, a global survey of 87 participants from 69 academic centres involved in at least 325 research projects between 2000 and 2017 was conducted. Of the eight components of landscape pattern identified and ranked by participants worldwide, the three most important components are respectively patch size, connectivity and proximity, and land cover heterogeneity. This research reveals that opinions of participants with experience in conducting research in the Southern Hemisphere in general and Oceania in particular influence this ranking. While a range of recommendations from specialists have been gathered and weighted, there is still much more research required to address areas of conflict between what fauna and humans need in the face of climate change.

TI  - Urbanization reduces gene flow but not genetic diversity of stream salamander populations in the New York City metropolitan area.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Natural landscape heterogeneity and barriers resulting from urbanization can reduce genetic connectivity between populations. The evolutionary, demographic, and ecological effects of reduced connectivity may lead to population isolation and ultimately extinction. Alteration to the terrestrial and aquatic environment caused by urban influence can affect gene flow, specifically for stream salamanders who depend on both landscapes for survival and reproduction. To examine how urbanization affects a relatively common stream salamander species, we compared genetic connectivity of Eurycea bislineata (northern two-lined salamander) populations within and between streams in an urban, suburban, and rural habitat around the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. We report reduced genetic connectivity between streams within the urban landscape found to correspond with potential barriers to gene flow, that is, areas with more dense urbanization (roadways, industrial buildings, and residential housing). The suburban populations also exhibited areas of reduced connectivity correlated with areas of greater human land use and greater connectivity within a preserve protected from development. Connectivity was relatively high among neighboring rural streams, but a major roadway corresponded with genetic breaks even though the habitat contained more connected green space overall. Despite greater human disturbance across the landscape, urban and suburban salamander populations maintained comparable levels of genetic diversity to their rural counterparts. Yet small effective population size in the urban habitats yielded a high probability of loss of heterozygosity due to genetic drift in the future. In conclusion, urbanization impacted connectivity among stream salamander populations where its continual influence may eventually hinder population persistence for this native species in urban habitats.

TI  - The role of dispersal and local environment in urban land snail assemblages: an example of three cities in Central Italy
PY  - 2017
AB  - Ecologists increasingly appreciate the central role that urban biodiversity plays in ecosystems, however much urban biodiversity is neglected, especially some very diverse groups of invertebrates. For the first time in southern Europe, land snail communities are analysed in four urban habitats along a geographical gradient of three cities, using quantitative methods and assessing the relative roles of local environmental conditions (“distance from sea”, “distance from city centre”, “vegetation cover”) and spatial effects by principal coordinate analysis of neighbour matrices, redundancy analysis and variation partitioning. A total of 53 species was recorded, a richness similar to that of natural areas. At habitat level, species richness did not show a clear increasing trend from more to less urbanized habitats, but rather a homogeneous pattern. At city level, study areas hosted rather heterogeneous species assemblages and biotic homogenization did not seem to have any impact; indeed, only three species could be considered alien. Variation partitioning showed that land snail communities were mostly structured by environmental factors, even when spatial structures independent of measured environmental variables were included: “vegetation cover” and “distance from city centre” were the environmental variables that explained most of the variation in species composition. The lack of strong spatial structure also unexpectedly suggested that transport by humans aids dispersal of organisms with low mobility, which are usually limited by spatial constraints in natural environments. These results provide ecological and conservation implications for other invertebrate groups, suggesting to set priorities in management strategies that include habitat conservation at local scale.

TI  - Relationship of insect biomass and richness with land use along a climate gradient.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recently reported insect declines have raised both political and social concern. Although the declines have been attributed to land use and climate change, supporting evidence suffers from low taxonomic resolution, short time series, a focus on local scales, and the collinearity of the identified drivers. In this study, we conducted a systematic assessment of insect populations in southern Germany, which showed that differences in insect biomass and richness are highly context dependent. We found the largest difference in biomass between semi-natural and urban environments (−42%), whereas differences in total richness (−29%) and the richness of threatened species (−56%) were largest from semi-natural to agricultural environments. These results point to urbanization and agriculture as major drivers of decline. We also found that richness and biomass increase monotonously with increasing temperature, independent of habitat. The contrasting patterns of insect biomass and richness question the use of these indicators as mutual surrogates. Our study provides support for the implementation of more comprehensive measures aimed at habitat restoration in order to halt insect declines. Land use is a key control of insect communities. Here the authors investigate relationships of insect biomass and richness with land use along a climate gradient, finding evidence of urbanisation and agriculture as drivers of decline, and of biomass and species richness not being suitable as mutual surrogates.

TI  - Classes of protection in urban forest fragments are effectiveless in structuring butterfly assemblages: landscape and forest structure are far better predictors
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a major cause of biodiversity loss and disconnection between people and nature. For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness. These results reinforce the importance of implementing public policies that prioritize the conservation of the quality of forest fragments in every class of protection, as well as the conservation of forest fragments throughout the urban landscape.

TI  - Aquatic urban ecology at the scale of a capital: community structure and interactions in street gutters
PY  - 2017
AB  - In most cities, streets are designed for collecting and transporting dirt, litter, debris, storm water and other wastes as a municipal sanitation system. Microbial mats can develop on street surfaces and form microbial communities that have never been described. Here, we performed the first molecular inventory of the street gutter-associated eukaryotes across the entire French capital of Paris and the non-potable waters sources. We found that the 5782 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) present in the street gutters which are dominated by diatoms (photoautotrophs), fungi (heterotrophs), Alveolata and Rhizaria, includes parasites, consumers of phototrophs and epibionts that may regulate the dynamics of gutter mat microbial communities. Network analyses demonstrated that street microbiome present many species restricted to gutters, and an overlapping composition between the water sources used for street cleaning (for example, intra-urban aquatic networks and the associated rivers) and the gutters. We propose that street gutters, which can cover a significant surface area of cities worldwide, potentially have important ecological roles in the remediation of pollutants or downstream wastewater treatments, might also be a niche for growth and dissemination of putative parasite and pathogens.

TI  - Dynamic Cooling Effects of Permanent Urban Green Spaces in Beijing, China
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a critical role in human thermal comfort, energy consumption and urban ecology. Although the heat mitigation capability of UGSs has been frequently reported, many of the current understandings are based on short-term observations, and the long-term temporal dynamics of UGS cooling effects are still lacking. This gap may cause over- or underestimation and largely ignores how the cooling effects change with climate change and urban growth. Accordingly, we used Landsat-based time series data to analyze the changes in permanent UGS greenness, surface-cooling effects and their biophysical responses in Beijing in the past 40 years (1984–2020). The results demonstrate segmented changes in UGS surface cooling that were mainly linked to the responses of canopy transpiration and albedo to vegetation conditions. During a rapid greening of UGSs in the recent two decades, transpiration cooling dominated albedo-induced warming to provide a discernable cooling enhancement. In addition, such enhancement showed seasonal differences ranging from less than 1 °C to more than 2 °C, and the most evident enhancement occurred on summer days (~2.4 °C) when vegetation is most needed to provide cooling. The highlighted dynamics of UGSs help urban planners better balance the maintenance costs and the environmental gains for UGS management.

TI  - The importance of species diversity for human well-being in Europe
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Nature affects human well-being in multiple ways. However, the association between species diversity and human well-being at larger spatial scales remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the relationship between species diversity and human well-being at the continental scale, while controlling for other known drivers of well-being. We related socio-economic data from more than 26,000 European citizens across 26 countries with macroecological data on species diversity and nature characteristics for Europe. Human well-being was measured as self-reported life-satisfaction and species diversity as the species richness of several taxonomic groups (e.g. birds, mammals and trees). Our results show that bird species richness is positively associated with life-satisfaction across Europe. We found a relatively strong relationship, indicating that the effect of bird species richness on life-satisfaction may be of similar magnitude to that of income. We discuss two, non-exclusive pathways for this relationship: the direct multisensory experience of birds, and beneficial landscape properties which promote both bird diversity and people's well-being. Based on these results, this study argues that management actions for the protection of birds and the landscapes that support them would benefit humans. We suggest that political and societal decision-making should consider the critical role of species diversity for human well-being.

TI  - Nature‐based solutions: The need to increase the knowledge on their potentialities and limits
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper analyses the concept of nature-based solutions as instruments to turn anthromes more nature-compatible, efficient, causing less degradation and developing new biodiversity hotspots. It is mainly focused in solutions using living organisms (in particular plants and microorganisms) to perform functions such as those of soil- and water-bioengineering interventions in order to ensure the safety of human infrastructures and constructions in contexts of conflict between natural processes and human needs. Further it handles the problematic of reintroducing natural processes and functions in the built environment (urban, industrial, infrastructures etc.) in order to recover, recreate or reinvent nature in humanized landscapes and developing a more creative relation between humans and natural elements, processes and functions. It presents, furthermore, the contribution of natural solutions to a wide variety of decontamination processes and prevention and recovery of degraded land and natural resources. Finally, it discusses the way these solutions can be implemented and the cultural, organizational, administrative and governance paradigmatic and practice changes it implies. Examples are given on the different issues presented as well on the possible implementation solutions

TI  - The effect of human population size on the breeding bird diversity of urban regions
PY  - 2016
AB  - Most studies of the effects of urbanization on avian diversity are carried out in a single urban area. However, urban areas vary in characteristics, such as human population size and biophysical context, that likely influence within-urban area ecological structure and functioning. In this paper, we describe the first direct test of the effect of urban area human population size on bird diversity. We applied simultaneous autoregressive modeling and multi-model inference to North American Breeding Bird Survey and US Census data from 48 urban areas in the conterminous United States to determine the effect of urban area human population size on total breeding bird species richness and abundance in surrounding urban regions, controlling for variation in elevation, air temperature, precipitation, urban area age, human population density, and original habitat type. We hypothesized that increasing urban area human population size is a driver of increasing regional habitat loss and fragmentation and disturbance and therefore would have a negative effect on breeding bird species richness and abundance in regions. We found strong evidence for a negative effect of urban area human population size on species richness and show that urban area human population size is positively correlated with impervious surface cover and air pollutant emissions in urban regions, lending provisional support to our hypothesis. Our results imply that we prioritize urban regions surrounding urban areas with large human population sizes for conservation activities that will benefit birds, such as preserving green spaces. In future, greater emphasis should be placed on the acquisition of high-quality ecological data in multiple urban areas in order to increase our understanding of the structure and functioning of complex urban systems, a frontier in urban ecology.

In both the process of planning and designing highly urbanized areas, the implementation of BGI is important for the improvement of living conditions and counteracting the negative effects of climate change. Based on the literature review, 19 BGI solutions were identified and then valorized in relation to the following three key aspects: spatial and functional, environmental, and social. The results of the assessment were derived using the scoring method and allowed for the identification of BGI solutions with a high, medium or low value for shaping sustainable urban public spaces. Using the potential of analyzed BGI solutions to improve the functioning and attractiveness of urban areas requires a comprehensive approach. Conscious planning and designing should use the knowledge presented to make the implementation of BGI solutions as effective as possible in relation to the above-mentioned aspects of shaping urban public spaces.

TI  - Urbanization alters predator-avoidance behaviours
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization is considered the fastest growing form of global land-use change and can dramatically modify habitat structure and ecosystem functioning. While ecological processes continue to operate within cities, urban ecosystems are profoundly different from their more natural counterparts. Thus, ecological predictions derived from more natural ecosystems are rarely generalizable to urban environments. In this study, we used data from a large-scale and long-term camera trap project in Chicago IL, USA, to determine whether urbanization alters predator-avoidance behaviour of urban prey species. We studied three behavioural mechanisms often induced by the fear of predation (spatial distribution, daily activity patterns and vigilance) of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) when coyote (Canis latrans)-an urban apex predator-was present. We found no evidence of spatial segregation between coyote and either prey species. Furthermore, neither white-tailed deer nor eastern cottontail changed their daily activity or increased vigilance in urban areas when coyotes were present. Eastern cottontail, however, had their uppermost level of vigilance in highly urban sites when coyotes were absent. Our study demonstrates that predator-prey dynamics might be modified in urban ecosystems-moving from what is traditionally thought of as a two-player system (predator and prey) to a three-player system (predator, prey and people).

TI  - How small cities affect the biodiversity of ground-dwelling mammals and the relevance of this knowledge in planning urban land expansion in terms of urban wildlife
PY  - 2017
AB  - Fundamental principles regarding urban biodiversity are based on studies conducted in large cities. However we cannot know whether the same phenomena occur in smaller cities or how small cities affect biodiversity. Small cities are an inherent element of urbanization and in the future, most global urban growth is expected to take place in small and medium-sized cities. Understanding the effects of small cities on biodiversity will be an important aspect in planning urban land expansion. Our study examined the effects of a small city on communities of small ground-dwelling mammals on 41 sites arranged in a four step gradient of urbanization. In 6700 trap-days, we caught 2333 individuals comprising 15 species. In the downtown area the same phenomena as those described for large cities were observed: a reduction in species richness and diversity, a decline in the abundance of urban sensitive species and an increase in synurbic species. However, in contrast to large city studies, green areas outside the downtown area did not differ from rural sites in small mammal population parameters. This phenomenon of relatively unchanged fauna outside the downtown area shows that small cities have the potential to maintain a high level of diversity of small ground-dwelling mammals if appropriate planning of further building expansion is implemented. More studies of small cities are needed to better assess their impact on biodiversity. This knowledge can then be applied in better planning for urban wildlife. Generalizations based solely on large city studies are inadequate and may lead to incomplete or inappropriate conservation strategies for small cities.

TI  - Environmental determinants of avian species richness in forests in a highly urbanized subtropical city: The effects of spatial scale and open space feature
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Numerous avian studies have emphasized the importance of natural/semi-natural elements, especially green spaces to conserve avian diversity in a city. However, little is known about environmental factors associated with avian diversity in a densely populated and highly urbanized subtropical city where large scale of conservation management is not feasible. Using Macao as a case city, we investigated the relationship between environmental features and species richness of urban birds in forests at multiple scales. We analyzed point count data of birds collected at eight transects in five forests in Macao during 2007–2009. We divided survey periods into three seasons and considered them as temporal replicates. We calculated percent cover of each of two environmental features, i.e., open water (waterbody) and open green vegetation at three scales: 50 m, 250 m, and 500 m buffer areas surrounding transect. Rarefaction was used to estimate total richness (richness of all species) and richness of each guild (open habitat, shrub, and forest species). Total richness, open habitat species richness and forest species richness were affected by environmental features within the 250 m buffer area, whereas shrub species richness was not related with any scale. Percent cover of open water influenced positively open habitat and forest species richness and consequently total richness. Percent cover of open green vegetation had a positive effect on open habitat species richness but negative on forest species richness. These patterns were somewhat associated with vegetation features of forests. Our study indicates that even in highly developed small city, the relationship between environmental features and avian species richness can be influenced by spatial scale(s) at which these features are measured as well as species’ habitat preference. It also suggests that open features, especially open water could be an important factor affecting bird diversity in forests in urban areas.

TI  - The phylogenetic and functional diversity of regional breeding bird assemblages is reduced and constricted through urbanization
PY  - 2018
AB  - Aim: Urbanization broadly affects the phylogenetic and functional diversity of natural communities through a variety of processes including habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. Due to the challenge of acquiring direct measurements, these effects have been studied primarily using “space-for-time” substitution where spatial urbanization gradients are used to infer the consequences of urbanization occurring across time. The ability of alternative sampling designs to replicate the findings derived using space-for-time substitution has not been tested. Location: Global. Methods: We contrasted the phylogenetic and functional diversity of breeding bird assemblages in 58 cities worldwide with the corresponding regional breeding bird assemblages estimated using geographic range maps. Results: Compared to regional assemblages, urban assemblages contained lower phylogenetic diversity, lower phylogenetic beta diversity, a reduction in the least evolutionary distinct species and the loss of the most evolutionarily distinct species. We found no evidence that these effects were related to the presence of non-native species. Urban assemblages contained fewer aquatic species and fewer aquatic foraging species. The distribution of body size and range size narrowed for urban assemblages with the loss of species at both tails of the distribution, especially large bodied and broadly distributed species. Urban assemblages contained a greater proportion of species classified as passerines, doves or pigeons; species identified as granivores; species that forage within vegetation or in the air; and species with more generalized associations with foraging strata. Main conclusions: Urbanization is associated with the overall reduction and constriction of phylogenetic and functional diversity, results that largely replicate those generated using space-for-time substitution, increasing our confidence in the quality of the combined inferences. When direct measurements are unavailable, our findings emphasize the value of developing independent sampling methods that broaden and reinforce our understanding of the ecological implications of urbanization.

TI  - Moth assemblages within urban domestic gardens respond positively to habitat complexity, but only at a scale that extends beyond the garden boundary
PY  - 2020
AB  - ‘Wildlife-friendly’ gardening is a dominant theme in the media that readily engages public attention. However, there is little empirical evidence of the ecological benefits of increased habitat quality of individual domestic gardens. This study uses light-trapping to examine the response of moth assemblages to domestic gardens that are assessed in terms of their habitat complexity (simple and complex) both within the garden and extending out to a 30 m radius that includes surrounding habitats. The results clearly show that moth assemblages were influenced by complex habitats (particularly increasing levels of the variable shrubs and decreasing levels of artificial surfaces), but only at a scale that extended beyond the garden boundary to include the surrounding area. In other words, neither the complexity of the habitat within the garden or the size of the garden had any influence on the abundance or diversity of the moth assemblage. These results have implications for both garden management and landscape planning – if domestic gardens are to be a useful component of strategies to reduce biodiversity loss within the urban environment then they should provide good habitat quality and be managed as a network of interconnected patches rather than as individual units.

TI  - Wealth and Education Influences on Spatial Pattern of Tree Planting in a Tropical Metropolis in Brazil.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Green infrastructure, and specifically urban afforestation, is one of the most important activities of city management today, because of the multitude of ecosystem services it provides. The pattern of tree planting in urban areas is related to age, ethnicity, education, and household income. Unfortunately, this issue has not been evaluated, nor has it received significant subsidized governmental actions, funding, study, or public policies in large tropical cities in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to investigate if there was a pattern of urban afforestation related by socio-territorial inequalities, in the city of Sao Paulo, or if there was a relationship between the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years and zoning, socioeconomic, health, and environment variables in the neighborhoods of Sao Paulo, as well as to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by the planted species. Our results showed that tree planting was not oriented to increase cover of less-vegetated areas of the city and where more respiratory diseases have been registered. In fact, the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years was very influenced by socioeconomic status of inhabitants. In this sense, wealth and education proved to be a better predictor than zoning, health, and environmental variables for the tree planting. Finally, our results reveal that supporting, provision, and cultural functions and services are being provided to Sao Paulo city by the selected woody species. In Sao Paulo, urban afforestation must extend to the neighborhoods that need the services the most.

TI  - Reptile and Amphibian Diversity and Abundance in an Urban Landscape: Impacts of Fragmentation and the Conservation Value of Small Patches
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to habitat loss and fragmentation and is considered a global threat to biodiversity. We studied reptile and amphibian species diversity and abundance in a highly fragmented landscape adjacent to the second largest metropolitan area in the United States. Habitat patches in our study area were made up of remnant native vegetation surrounded by roads, housing, and other urban development. Species richness and diversity were positively associated with patch size, but patch age was not significantly associated with community characteristics. Four relatively common species were not detected in the small patches, indicating the possibility they had been extirpated by the time monitoring began, and six rarer species were not detected or detected only once in these patches. Although the patch size effect on species diversity was strong, we found that several of the small habitat patches had similar diversity to large patches, indicating potential value of these small habitat patches in protecting species as “microreserves.” In addition, one lizard species was found to be significantly more abundant in the smaller patches. To determine if abundance changed over time, we compared capture rates for four common lizards at the same sites ten years later. For three of the four species, abundance decreased over that period, specifically in the small patches. Although our long-term monitoring has confirmed that the full suite of herpetofauna is currently preserved in the study area overall, declines even in the common species over time hint at the potential severity of the threat of urbanization to rare species.

TI  - Low-intensity monitoring of small-mammal habitat associations and species interactions in an urban forest-preserve network
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Context Anthropogenic landscape modification and fragmentation result in loss of species and can alter ecosystem function. Assessment of the ecological value of urban reserve networks requires baseline and continued monitoring. However, depending on the desired indicators and parameters, effective monitoring can involve extensive sampling that is often financially or logistically infeasible. Aims We employed a low-intensity, mixed-detector survey design to monitor the small-mammal community across a network of 53 fragmented forest preserves (225 sites) in a highly urbanised landscape in the Chicago metropolitan area from August to October, 2009–2012. Methods We used a sequential process to fit single-season occupancy and pairwise co-occurrence models for six common small mammal species to evaluate habitat associations and interspecific interactions. Key results Shrew species and meadow voles occurred more often in open canopy-associated habitats, whereas occupancy was greater for eastern chipmunks, grey squirrels and white-footed mice in closed-canopy habitats. Habitat associations were complicated by negative pairwise interactions, resulting in reduced occurrence of meadow voles when predatory short-tailed shrews were present and lower occupancy rates of white-footed mouse when chipmunk competitors where present. White-footed mice co-occurred with short-tailed shrews, but detection of white-footed mice was lower when either eastern chipmunks or short-tailed shrews were present, suggesting that densities of these species could be inversely related. Conclusions We found evidence for both habitat segregation and interspecific interactions among small mammal species, by using low-intensity sampling across the reserve network. Thus, our sampling and analysis approach allowed for adequate assessment of the habitat associations and species interactions within a small-mammal community. Implications Our findings demonstrated the utility of this monitoring strategy and community as bioindicators for urban-reserve networks. The approach described holds promise for efficient monitoring of reserve networks in fragmented landscapes, critical as human population densities and urbanisation increase, and we discuss how adaptive sampling methods could be incorporated to further benefit conservation efforts.

TI  - Differences in Response of Butterfly Diversity and Species Composition in Urban Parks to Land Cover and Local Habitat Variables
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background and Objectives: As urbanisation is a significant global trend, there is a profound need for biodiversity protection in urban ecosystems. Moreover, the potential of urban green space to support urban biodiversity should be appreciated. Butterflies are environmental indicators that are sensitive to urbanisation. Therefore, it is important to identify butterfly distribution patterns and the factors influencing butterfly diversity and species composition in urban parks within cities. Research Highlights: To our knowledge, ours is the first study evaluating the effects of both land cover and local habitat features on butterfly species composition in urban parks of Beijing, China. Materials and Methods: In this study, we surveyed butterfly richness and abundance in 28 urban parks in Beijing, China. The parks differed in age and location in the urban area. Meanwhile, we investigated the green space in the surroundings of the parks at multi-spatial scales at the landscape level. We also investigated local park characteristics including the age of the park (Age), perimeter/area ratio of the park (SQPRA), area of the park (ha) (Area), green space cover within the park (Greenp), nectar plant species richness (Necpl), abundance of flowering nectar plants (Necabu) and overall plant species richness (Pl). Generalised linear models (GLMs) and redundancy discriminant analysis (RDA) were applied to relate butterfly diversity and butterfly species composition to environmental variables, respectively. Results: We recorded 3617 individuals belonging to 26 species from July to September in 2019. Parks on the city fringe had significantly higher butterfly diversity. Butterfly species richness was mostly related to total plant richness. The abundance of flowering nectar plants was closely linked to butterfly abundance. Land cover had little impact on butterfly diversity and community structure in urban parks. Conclusions: Once a park has sufficient plants and nectar resources, it becomes a useful haven for urban butterflies, regardless of the surrounding land cover. Well-planned urban parks focused on local habitat quality support butterfly conservation.

TI  - Temporal variation of ecological factors affecting bird species richness in urban and peri-urban forests in a changing environment: A case study from Milan (Northern Italy)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urban and peri-urban forests determine different habitat services for biodiversity according to their characteristics. In this study, we relate ecological characteristics of urban and peri-urban forests to forest bird species richness and we assess whether their effect changed over time due to the urban sprawl within the urban region of Milan, Italy. We analyse two periods (1998–2002 and 2010–2014) using weighted generalized linear models that considered urban and peri-urban forests collectively and urban and peri-urban forests separately. Patch area, proximity to source areas and number of surrounding urban and peri-urban forests were the main factors predicting species richness within urban and peri-urban forests in both periods. While there were no differences in factors affecting bird richness in peri-urban forests between the two periods, the negative effect of urban matrix density was statistically significant for birds inhabiting urban forests in the second period. Moreover, protected areas within urban and peri-urban forests and urban forests in the second period were important determinants in providing suitable habitat for birds at the regional scale. This study offered important insights regarding urban and peri-urban forests characteristics that should be maintained to ensure biodiversity conservation across changing urban landscapes.

TI  - Bird communities across varying landcover types in a Neotropical city
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization poses a serious threat to local biodiversity, yet towns and cities with abundant natural features may harbor important species populations and communities. While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia (Georgetown, Guyana) varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded >10% (98) of Guyana’s bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas. Both species and landcover information should be integrated into urban land-use planning in the rapidly urbanizing Neotropics to maximize the conservation value of cities. This is imperative in the tropics, where anthropogenic pressures on species are growing significantly, and action needs to be taken to prevent biodiversity collapse.

TI  - Improving nature experience in cities: What are people's preferences for vegetated streets?
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the current context of strong urban sprawl, it becomes urgent to find urban approaches that simultaneously promote ecological functions and relationships between people and nature in cities. Streets are omnipresent urban elements that can deliver ecosystem services and facilitate people daily interactions with nature. Promoting vegetation in streets can take different forms which have to be combined with people's preferences. Based on photomontages, we assessed people's perceptions and valuations for herbaceous vegetation types associated to various managements and designs of pavements. Using a combination of a local field survey and a French national online survey, we collected a total of 3609 responses representing a large diversity of socio-demographic characteristics. The results of the field survey confirmed those of the online survey. Although there was variability among people valuations, we found that lowly managed pavements with spontaneous vegetation were in average higher valued than highly managed pavements without vegetation. Pavements with spontaneous vegetation were perceived as less kept than pavements without vegetation, but more beautiful and less boring. We found a consensus of high valuations towards pavements containing vegetation integrated in small design interventions (flowers seeded in foot of wall, design of a meadow strip along the pavement), suggesting that people generally accept vegetation with visible signs of human actions or managements. Socio-demographic characteristics partly explained variabilities in photo valuations. As expected, people frequently connected with nature had the highest preferences for vegetated pavements, spontaneous or integrated in designs. These results show that vegetated streets can become daily biodiversity-friendly urban greenspaces appreciated by urban dwellers. We provide recommendations for promoting vegetation in streets that will be useful for politics, urban designers and managers.

TI  - Threatened plant species in the river ports of Central Europe: a potential for nature conservation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Industrialized areas represent a special group of urbanized areas, but sufficient attention has not been given to them concerning plant species richness and its importance for biodiversity conservation. These sites are considered the main drivers of biological invasions and biotic homogenization on a global scale, but the question of how and to what degree they contribute to biodiversity has yet to be raised. Data for 62 river ports (16 German, 26 Czech, 7 Hungarian, 4 Slovak, and 9 Austrian) on two important Central European waterways (the Elbe-Vltava and Danube waterways) were gathered for 40 years. In total, 1 240 plant species were found. Of these, 371 were classified as threatened and protected, nearly one third of the total number of species found in all of the studied Elbe, Vltava, and Danube ports. Significant differences in the proportion of threatened species in ports and cities were not found. More threatened species were found in the Danube ports than in the other ports, but their numbers fluctuated depending on the size of the port and the region (country). The results showed that the ports must be regarded as special types of species-rich industrial areas; thus, they should not be considered to be only sources of spreading invasive alien species. When planning port development, uniformity and vegetation management that is too intensive should be avoided. Extensively managed open areas and habitat diversity should be maintained.

TI  - Temporal persistence of taxonomic and functional composition in bird communities of urban areas: an evaluation after a 6-year gap in data collection
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban areas tend to stabilize interannual variations of habitat structure and food resources for birds, thus inducing a temporal homogenization of bird composition. However, a comparison of long-term changes of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition along urbanization gradients is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare interannual dissimilarities in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition of bird communities along urban-rural gradients of three cities in central Argentina. Bird surveys were made in urban, suburban and rural habitats during December 2011 and December 2017. Dissimilarity indices were compared against null models. These models took into account differences in species richness between years. Differences in sample completeness between sampling units were taken into account. The interannual taxonomic dissimilarity was lower in urban habitats than in suburban and rural habitats. The abundance and frequency of the Rock Dove (Columba livia) and the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) in urban areas was stable between years, whereas the abundance and frequency of the Grassland Yellow-finch (Sicalis luteola) changed between years in rural areas. The interannual functional dissimilarity was lower in urban habitats than in rural habitats. Bird body mass and the abundance of granivorous species were stable in urban habitats, whereas most of the traits in rural areas changed their abundances between years. The interannual phylogenetic dissimilarity was comparable between habitats. Urban areas had a higher long-term persistence of taxonomic composition and functional traits than rural areas, supporting the idea that urban areas induce a temporal homogenization of bird communities.

TI  - Supporting Bees in Cities: How Bees Are Influenced by Local and Landscape Features
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a major anthropogenic driver of decline for ecologically and economically important taxa including bees. Despite their generally negative impact on pollinators, cities can display a surprising degree of biodiversity compared to other landscapes. The pollinating communities found within these environments, however, tend to be filtered by interacting local and landscape features that comprise the urban matrix. Landscape and local features exert variable influence on pollinators within and across taxa, which ultimately affects community composition in such a way that contributes to functional trait homogenization and reduced phylogenetic diversity. Although previous results are not easily generalizable, bees and pollinators displaying functional trait characteristics such as polylectic diet, cavity-nesting behavior, and later emergence appear most abundant across different examined cities. To preserve particularly vulnerable species, most notably specialists that have become underrepresented within city communities, green spaces like parks and urban gardens have been examined as potential refuges. Such spaces are scattered across the urban matrix and vary in pollinator resource availability. Therefore, ensuring such spaces are optimized for pollinators is imperative. This review examines how urban features affect pollinators in addition to ways these green spaces can be manipulated to promote greater pollinator abundance and diversity.

TI  - ANIMAL-AIDED DESIGN – using a species’ life-cycle to improve open space planning and conservation in cities and elsewhere
PY  - 2017
AB  - Biodiversity underlies many of the ecosystem services demanded by humans. For cities, the design of ‘green infrastructures’ or ‘nature-based solutions’ has been proposed to maintain the provisioning of these services and the preservation of biodiversity. It is unclear, however, how such green infrastructure can be implemented given existing planning practices that generally ignore biodiversity. Urban open spaces are normally designed by landscape architects with a primary focus on plants, aesthetic design and functionality for human users. As a consequence, conservation of species only plays a minor role, in fact, protected animals are often considered detrimental to the design, e.g. when the need to conserve a protected species demand modifications of a building project. Conversely, conservationists are often in favor of protected areas, also in cities, with little access of humans and no human design. We propose ‘Animal-Aided Design’ (AAD) as a methodology for the design of urban open spaces, to integrate conservation into open space planning. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set boundary conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site, or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation. We illustrate our approach with designs for urban spaces in Munich.

TI  - How much heat can we grow in our cities? Modelling UK urban biofuel production potential
PY  - 2019
AB  - Biofuel provides a globally significant opportunity to reduce fossil fuel dependence; however its sustainability can only be meaningfully explored for individual cases. It depends on multiple considerations including: life‐cycle GHG emissions, air quality impacts, food versus fuel trade‐offs, biodiversity impacts of land use change, and socio‐economic impacts of energy transitions. One solution that may address many of these issues is local production of biofuel on non‐agricultural land. Urban areas drive global change, for example they are responsible for 70% of global energy use, but are largely ignored in their resource production potential; however under‐used urban greenspaces could be utilised for biofuel production near the point of consumption. This could avoid food versus fuel land conflicts in agricultural land and long‐distance transport costs, provide ecosystem service benefits to urban dwellers, and increase the sustainability and resilience of cities and towns. Here, we use a GIS to identify urban greenspaces suitable for biofuel production, using exclusion criteria, in ten UK cities. We then model production potential of three different biofuels: Miscanthus grass, short rotation coppice willow and short rotation coppice poplar, within the greenspaces identified and extrapolate up to a UK‐scale. We demonstrate that approximately 10% of urban greenspace (3% of built‐up land) is potentially suitable for biofuel production. We estimate the potential of this to meet energy demand through heat generation, electricity, and combined heat and power (CHP) operations. Our findings show that, if fully utilised, urban biofuel production could meet nearly a fifth of demand for biomass in CHP systems in the UK’s climate‐compatible energy scenarios by 2030, with potentially similar implications for other comparable countries and regions.

TI  - Diet of dingoes and other wild dogs in peri-urban areas of north-eastern Australia
PY  - 2016
AB  - Knowledge of the resource requirements of urban predators can improve our understanding of their ecology and assist town planners and wildlife management agencies in developing management approaches that alleviate human-wildlife conflicts. Here we examine food and dietary items identified in scats of dingoes in peri-urban areas of north-eastern Australia to better understand their resource requirements and the potential for dingoes to threaten locally fragmented populations of native fauna. Our primary aim was to determine what peri-urban dingoes eat, and whether or not this differs between regions. We identified over 40 different food items in dingo scats, almost all of which were mammals. Individual species commonly observed in dingo scats included agile wallabies, northern brown bandicoots and swamp wallabies. Birds were relatively common in some areas but not others, as were invertebrates. Dingoes were identified as a significant potential threat to fragmented populations of koalas. Dietary overlap was typically very high or near-identical between regions, indicating that peri-urban dingoes ate the same types or sizes of prey in different areas. Future studies should seek to quantify actual and perceived impacts of, and human attitudes towards, peri-urban dingoes, and to develop management strategies with a greater chance of reducing human-wildlife conflicts.

TI  - Perspectives on Greening of Cities Through an Ecological Lens
PY  - 2017
AB  - The increasing focus on urban green spaces (UGS) leads to them becoming an important component of the physical makeup of cities. However, it is useful to be mindful that UGS implementation competes for precious land resources in cities, incur carbon and energy footprint, and can have long payback periods for net benefits to be achieved. The net benefits provided by UGS are thus not assured by its mere presence; functional benefits need to be achieved through deliberate design. In particular, it is suggested here that combining design with an understanding of urban ecological knowledge is a useful approach to increase the ecological functions of UGS. A conceptual model using coupled human-ecological function is described to explain how increasing ecological functions of UGS to reduce resource consumption, restore ecological processes and functions, and reduce waste generation can shift the coupled human-ecological function for both humans and the environment. Four principles distilled from conceptual advances in urban ecology and landscape ecology are proposed as a means to bridge scientific knowledge and UGS implementation through design: (1) spatial patterns of UGS across different scales influence the ecological functions of UGS; (2) heterogeneity of UGS determines its resilience to disturbances; (3) urban ecosystems are dynamic; and (4) ecological processes remain important in cities. More application-focused strategies are in turn, derived from these principles, and how these can be applied to UGS are highlighted. It is also suggested that while current scientific knowledge still limits the application of ecological principles in many aspects of UGS design and management, the increasing emphasis on UGS in cities provides good learning opportunities for scientists, practitioners and policy makers to work in concert to enhance the ecological functions of UGS.

TI  - Building biodiversity: drivers of bird and butterfly diversity on tropical urban roof gardens
PY  - 2017
AB  - Conservation of faunal diversity in highly urbanized landscapes is facilitated through the integration of anthropogenic and natural elements in urban green spaces. Roof gardens have the potential to provide resources for urban wildlife populations, yet they typically offer marginal ecological conditions relative to ground-level habitat so it is necessary to identify the factors associated with focal taxa diversity and abundance to better inform their planning, design, and management. We conducted 20 monthly surveys of diurnal bird and butterfly visitors to 30 urban roof gardens in the tropical city-state of Singapore. Sixty-five site variables were evaluated for their relative importance to four community diversity metrics (species richness, Simpson's diversity, abundance, and functional dispersion) using a conceptual framework relevant to key stakeholders involved in roof garden planning, design, and management. Surveys from a total of 80 observation hours per site recorded more than 23,000 independent bird and butterfly encounters, comprising 53 bird and 57 butterfly species, which represents 13% and 18% of the avifauna and butterfly fauna in Singapore, respectively. Twenty-four species (12 birds, 12 butterflies) were considered uncommon or rare. Reproductive behaviors (courtship, mating, or nesting) were noted in 35 species (20 birds, 15 butterflies). Understory birds were under-represented, whereas understory butterflies were over-represented compared to the overall Singapore fauna. Early morning noise showed strong negative linear correlations with diversity of both taxa, but this variable was also negatively associated with planted area, perhaps indicating proxy effects. Faunal diversity decreased asymptotically with height. Both managed and spontaneous floral diversity had clear positive effects on bird and butterfly diversity. Our results provide clear indication that tropical urban roof gardens can support a diverse subset of the bird and butterfly species assemblages. Site height, site area, and plant selection are suggested to play dominant roles in determining the attractiveness of roof gardens for wildlife. To a first approximation, roof gardens should be built lower than 50 m in height and contain planted areas larger than 1100 m2, as well as shrubs for birds and both managed and spontaneous nectar plant species for butterflies.

TI  - Urban forests sustain diverse carrion beetle assemblages in the New York City metropolitan area
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urbanization is an increasingly pervasive form of land transformation that reduces biodiversity of many taxonomic groups. Beetles exhibit a broad range of responses to urbanization, likely due to the high functional diversity in this order. Carrion beetles (Order: Coleoptera, Family: Silphidae) provide an important ecosystem service by promoting decomposition of small-bodied carcasses, and have previously been found to decline due to forest fragmentation caused by urbanization. However, New York City (NYC) and many other cities have fairly large continuous forest patches that support dense populations of small mammals, and thus may harbor relatively robust carrion beetle communities in city parks. In this study, we investigated carrion beetle community composition, abundance and diversity in forest patches along an urban-to-rural gradient spanning the urban core (Central Park, NYC) to outlying rural areas. We conducted an additional study comparing the current carrion beetle community at a single suburban site in Westchester County, NY that was intensively surveyed in the early 1970's. We collected a total of 2,170 carrion beetles from eight species at 13 sites along this gradient. We report little to no effect of urbanization on carrion beetle diversity, although two species were not detected in any urban parks. Nicrophorus tomentosus was the most abundant species at all sites and seemed to dominate the urban communities, potentially due to its generalist habits and shallower burying depth compared to the other beetles surveyed. Variation between species body size, habitat specialization, and % forest area surrounding the surveyed sites also did not influence carrion beetle communities. Lastly, we found few significant differences in relative abundance of 10 different carrion beetle species between 1974 and 2015 at a single site in Westchester County, NY, although two of the rare species in the early 1970's were not detected in 2015. These results indicate that NYC's forested parks have the potential to sustain carrion beetle communities and the ecosystem services they provide.

TI  - Importance of Urban Parks in Conserving Biodiversity of Flower Chafer Beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea: Cetoniinae) in Brazilian Cerrado.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado, a hotspot and the largest savannah in the world, has been undergoing intense changes in land use for urbanization. The creation and maintenance of urban parks and public squares is one efficient biodiversity conservation strategy in urbanized landscapes. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the potential of urban parks with native vegetation for conservation of flower chafer beetles (Coleoptera: Cetoniinae), a beetle group usually used as a bioindicator in African landscapes, in Brazilian Cerrado. We sampled Cetoniinae beetles using aerial fruit-baited traps, every 2 wk from January to December 2014 in 10 areas of Cerrado in Aquidauana, MS, Brazil. We compared the species richness, abundance, biomass, and species composition between six 'natural reserve' areas (outside the urban matrix) and four 'urban park' areas (within the urban matrix), and identified specialist species of each habitat type. A total 508 individuals of nine species were captured. The abundance, species richness, and biomass were similar between natural reserve and urban park. However, species composition differed among the habitats. Gymnetis flava (Weber) was classified as an urban park specialist, while Euphoria lurida (Fabricius), and Hoplopyga liturata (Olivier) were classified as natural reserve specialists. Our results demonstrate that urban parks conserve the abundance, biomass and species richness of flower chafer beetles in the Brazilian Cerrado. In this context, our results suggest that the maintenance of the urban park with native vegetation can be an efficient strategy for the conservation of Cetoniinae beetles in the urban matrix in the Brazilian Cerrado.

TI  - Climate differentiates forest structure across a residential macrosystem.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The extent of urban ecological homogenization depends on how humans build, inhabit, and manage cities. Morphological and socio-economic facets of neighborhoods can drive the homogenization of urban forest cover, thus affecting ecological and hydrological processes, and ecosystem services. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the same biophysical drivers differentiating composition and structure of natural forests can further counteract the homogenization of urban forests. We hypothesize that climate can differentiate forest structure across residential macrosystems at regional-to-continental spatial scales. To test this hypothesis, forest structure (tree and shrub cover and volume) was measured using LiDAR data and multispectral imagery across a residential macrosystem composed 1.4 million residential parcels contained in 9 cities and 1503 neighborhoods. Cities were selected along an evapotranspiration (ET) gradient in the conterminous United States, ranging from the colder continental climate of Fargo, North Dakota (ET = 464.43 mm) to the hotter subtropical climate of Tallahassee, Florida (ET = 1000.47 mm). The relative effects of climate, urban morphology, and socio-economic variables on residential forest structure were assessed by using generalized linear models. Climate differentiated forest structure of the residential macrosystem as hypothesized. Average forest cover doubled along the ET gradient (0.39–0.78 m2 m−2), whereas average forest volume had a threefold increase (2.50–8.12 m3 m−2). Forest volume across neighborhoods increased exponentially with forest cover. Urban morphology had a greater effect in homogenizing forest structure on residential parcels compared to socio-economics. Climate and urban morphology variables best predicted residential forest structure, whereas socio-economic variables had the lowest predictive power. Results indicate that climate can differentiate forest structure across residential macrosystems and may counteract the homogenizing effects of urban morphology and socio-economic drivers at city-wide scales. This resonates with recent empirical work suggesting the existence of complex multi-scalar mechanisms that regulate ecological homogenization and ecosystem convergence among cities. The study initiates high-resolution assessments of forest structure across entire urban macrosystems and breaks new ground for research on the ecological and hydrological significance of urban vegetation at subcontinental scale.

TI  - Yards increase forest connectivity in urban landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens often comprise a large portion of urban forests. We quantify structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston’s neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some birds and arboreal mammals. The urban landscape was classified by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Back yard tree canopy cover was 65.23%. The majority of canopy links were on residential land (60.95% total), and particularly in backyards. Back yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65% total). Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at ~ 23% of total canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy. The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities. Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and increased.

TI  - Testing the Likeable, Therefore Abundant Hypothesis: Bird Species Likeability by Urban Residents Varies Significantly with Species Traits
PY  - 2021
AB  - The urbanization of landscapes filters bird communities to favor particular species traits, driven in part by the changes that homeowners make to the amount and quality of habitat in yards. We suggest that an ultimate driver of these proximate mechanisms underlying bird community change with respect to urbanization is the likeability of species traits by urban residents. We hypothesize that bird species likeability, modulated by species traits, influences the degree to which homeowners alter the availability and quality of habitat on their properties and thereby affects species population sizes in urbanized landscapes. We refer to this new hypothesis as the Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis. The Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis predicts that (1) bird species likeability varies with species morphological and behavioral traits, (2) homeowners use trait-based likeability as a motivator to modify habitat availability and quality on their properties, and (3) residential habitat availability and quality influences species populations at landscape scales. We tested the first prediction of the Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis using a survey of 298 undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who were asked to rank their preferences for 85 forest generalist and edge/open country songbird species grouped according to 10 morphological and behavioral traits. Survey respondents preferred very small, primarily blue or black species that are insectivorous, aerial or bark foragers, residents, and culturally unimportant. On the other hand, respondents disliked large or very large, primarily yellow or orange species that forage on the ground and/or forage by flycatching, are migratory, and are culturally important. If the Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis is true, natural resource managers and planners could capitalize on the high likeability of species that are nevertheless negatively affected by urbanization to convince homeowners and residents to actively manage their properties for species conservation.

TI  - Preservation of historical heritage increases bird biodiversity in urban centers
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban expansion negatively influences biodiversity by eliminating habitats and homogenizing the biotic component, to which many species are unable to respond. However, historical cities, with their protected heritage sites, maintain many fragments of vegetation (gardens, squares, etc.). Such fragments permit the existence of biodiversity, especially of birds, because they provide areas for shelter and food and function as stepping stones that increases the permeability of the urban matrix. We hypothesized that the presence of green areas, such as gardens and parks, would favor greater richness and abundance of bird species, especially omnivores and granivores, during the dry season and in the Historic Center of the city of Ouro Preto. Birds were sampled by point counts at 35 points distributed throughout the urban matrix of Ouro Preto, where richness and abundance were recorded and correlated with land use. Both the presence of green areas and the maintenance of the Historic Center influenced the bird community present in the urban center, with higher richness in areas with more shrubs and trees and closer to larger forested fragments. Bird abundance was greater in the Historic Center and during the rainy season. These findings demonstrate that maintaining heritage sites in urban centers can mitigate the expected negative impacts of urbanization by allowing small patches of vegetation to serve as favorable habitats for bird species.

TI  - Public Engagement Provides First Insights on Po Plain Ant Communities and Reveals the Ubiquity of the Cryptic Species Tetramorium immigrans (Hymenoptera, Formicidae).
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ants are considered a useful model for biodiversity monitoring and several of their characteristics make them promising for citizen science (CS) projects. Involving a wide range of public figures into collecting valuable data on the effect of human impact on ant biodiversity, the School of Ants (SoA) project represents one of the very few attempts to explore the potential of these insects in CS. Through the collaboration with the “BioBlitz Lombardia” project, we tested the SoA protocol on 12 Northern Italy parks, ranging from urban green to subalpine protected sites. As a result, we obtained some of the very first quantitative data characterizing the ants of this region, recording 30 species and highlighting some interesting ecological patterns. These data revealed the ubiquitous presence of the recently taxonomically defined cryptic species Tetramorium immigrans, which appears to be probably introduced in the region. We also discuss advantages and criticisms encountered applying the SoA protocol, originally intended for schools, to new categories of volunteers, from BioBlitz participants to park operators, suggesting best practices based on our experience.

TI  - Landscape Structures Affect Risk of Canine Distemper in Urban Wildlife
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization rapidly changes landscape structure worldwide, thereby enlarging the human-wildlife interface. The emerging urban structures should have a key influence on the spread and distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper, by shaping density, distribution and movements of wildlife. However, little is known about the role of urban structures as proxies for disease prevalence. To guide management, especially in densely populated cities, assessing the role of landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and 2013, two epidemic waves of canine distemper hit the urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population of Berlin, Germany. The directly transmitted canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a virulent disease infecting a range of mammals with high host mortality, particularly in juveniles. We extracted information about CDV serological state (seropositive or seronegative), sex and age for 778 urban fox carcasses collected by the state laboratory Berlin Brandenburg. To assess the impact of urban landscape structure heterogeneity (e.g. richness) and shares of green and grey infrastructures at different spatial resolutions (areal of 28 ha, 78 ha, 314 ha) on seroprevalence we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with binomial distributions. Our results indicated that predictors derived at a 28 ha resolution were most informative for describing landscape structures effects (AUC = 0.92). The probability to be seropositive decreased by 66% (0.6 to 0.2) with an increasing share of grey infrastructure (40 % to 80 %), suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g. less foxes or raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife interactions should focus on such areas. The possible underlying mechanisms may be increased isolation, the absence of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing the ability of CDV to persist without a host.

TI  - Diversity snapshot of green–gray space ants in two Mexican cities
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study evaluates changes in the diversity and composition of ants that inhabit contrasting environmental conditions (green and gray spaces) in two cities of different size and degree of urbanization: Xalapa and Coatepec (Veracruz, Mexico), both of which are surrounded by cloud forest remnants, croplands and pastures. In each city, a green space and a gray space of similar area were selected (~ 31 ha) and ten sampling sites were randomly placed within each environment. Tuna in oil and honey were used as baits to collect soil ants, entomological nets to capture vegetation ants and Winkler sacks for leaf-litter ants. Ant species richness (0D) and diversity (1D) was greater in Coatepec (the smaller and less urbanized city) than in Xalapa. However, the pattern observed when comparing green and gray spaces differed between the cities: the greatest diversity (0D and 1D) was observed in the gray space of Coatepec and the lowest diversity in the green space of Xalapa. In both cities, the similarity of species composition between habitat conditions was close to 50% and the comparison of green spaces between the cities showed that these are more different to each other than is the case with the gray spaces. These results suggest that the characteristics of each city influence the ant diversity contained in green and gray spaces differently and can promote differentiation in species composition within the same city.

TI  - Amphibians in an urban environment: a case study from a central European city (Wrocław, Poland)
PY  - 2019
AB  - In 2016, we studied the occurrence of amphibians in 231 selected ponds in the city of Wroclaw (Lower Silesia, Poland) and confirmed the occurrence of 10 species: Bombina bombina, Bufo bufo, Bufotes viridis, Hyla arborea, Pelobates fuscus, Pelophylax esculentus complex, Rana arvalis, Rana temporaria, Lissotriton vulgaris and Triturus cristatus. Among all studied sites, the most common were P. esculentus complex (146 occupied sites, 63.2%) and B. bufo (119, 51.5%), while the rarest was P. fuscus (8, 3.5%). The number of species at a single site varied from 0 (28 sites, 12.1%) to 9 (1 site, 0.4%). Frequency and mean amphibian species richness reached 87.9% and 2.7 ± 1.9, respectively. The composition of amphibian species did not change in comparison to previous studies conducted in the years 1997–2009, but declining trends in five species (B. bombina, B. viridis, H. arborea, P. esculentus complex, P. fuscus) were observed (28 compared sites). The results revealed that the permanency of ponds, their occurrence in the vicinity of river valleys, and a high ratio of watercourse length and green area around ponds are positively correlated and have a significant influence on amphibian species richness within the city. Thus, these identified factors should be considered in the course of sustainable urban planning in order to avoid potential conflicts between nature conservation and urban development.

TI  - The Cooling Effect of Urban Green Spaces in Metacities: A Case Study of Beijing, China’s Capital
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban green spaces have many vital ecosystem services such as air cleaning, noise reduction, and carbon sequestration. Amid these great benefits from urban green spaces, the cooling effects via shading and evapotranspiration can mitigate the urban heat island effect. The impact of urban green spaces (UGSs) on the urban thermal environment in Beijing was quantified as a case study of metacities using four metrics: Land surface temperature (LST), cooling intensity, cooling extent, and cooling lapse. Three hundred and sixteen urban green spaces were extracted within the 4th ring road of Beijing from SPOT 6 satellite imagery and retrieved LST from Landsat 8 remote sensing data. The results showed that the cooling intensity of green spaces was generally more prominent in the areas with denser human activities and higher LST in this metacity. Vegetation density is always the dominant driver for the cooling effect indicated by all of the metrics. Furthermore, the results showed that those dispersive green spaces smaller than 9 ha, which are closely linked to the health and well-being of citizens, can possess about 6 °C of cooling effect variability, suggesting a great potential of managing the layout of small UGSs. In addition, the water nearby could be introduced to couple with the green and blue space for the promotion of cooling and enhancement of thermal comfort for tourists and residents. As the severe urban heating threatens human health and well-being in metacities, our findings may provide solutions for the mitigation of both the urban heat island and global climate warming of the UGS area customized cooling service.

TI  - How to preserve a butterfly species within an urbanising settlement and its surroundings: a study of the scarce copper ( Lycaena virgaureae L.) in southern Sweden
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly ongoing process worldwide with profound consequences for wildlife in urban and peri-urban areas. Species are affected by habitat loss, habitat alternation and degradation, fragmentation and increased human population and activity. Habitat loss can occur due to construction of housing and infrastructure in peri-urban areas and within urban areas due to compaction. Undeveloped areas can also be changed from ruderal land, wilderness areas or leftover green space to more formal and more intensively used urban green space. This study investigated a butterfly species, the scarce copper (Lycaena virgaureae L.), in an urbanising and expanding settlement in a rural location in southern Sweden. The scarce copper is still relatively common in Sweden, but has experienced severe decline in certain areas and in other parts of Europe. Patch occupancy and abundance of the species were investigated in 44 patches ranging from urban and peri-urban to rural locations. Habitats investigated were parks, urban grasslands managed for biodiversity by the local authority, unmanaged abandoned arable sites, road verges, meadows and pastures. In total, 624 sightings of scarce coppers were recorded. The highest abundances were observed in larger unmanaged patches and in meadows in peri-urban areas, while pastures had low abundances. In urban parks, no coppers were found. The smaller sites managed for biodiversity by the local authority within the settlement were often occupied by the scarce copper, although abundances were low (mean number of individuals 3 ± 1.2). In patches which were cut, copper numbers dropped in almost all cases to zero after cutting. Patch occupancy was affected by habitat characteristics such vegetation height, tree succession, abundance of Rumex acetosella (sheep’s sorrel), as well as landscape features such as length of forest edge. Factors identified as influencing abundance were the same, but additionally also flower abundance. The current high abundances of the scarce copper in the area will not be ensured in the longer term when all building plans are implemented and no other measures are taken. Recommendations are made on management and planning to preserve the species in the study area.

TI  - Litter decomposition driven by soil fauna, plant diversity and soil management in urban gardens
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the face of growing urban densification, green spaces in cities, such as gardens, are increasingly important for biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the influences of urban green space management on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between soil fauna and litter decomposition in 170 urban garden sites along a gradient of urbanisation intensity in the city of Zurich, CH.

TI  - Birds biodiversity in urban and periurban forests: environmental determinants at local and landscape scales
PY  - 2018
AB  - A significant decline in biodiversity is associated with the current and upcoming degree of urbanization. A challenging strategy to address this conflict is to make urban growth compatible with biodiversity protection and in this context urban parks can play a crucial role. Urban systems are highly dynamic and complex human-shaped ecosystems, where the relationship between species and environment may be altered and make the preservation of biodiversity within them a challenging goal. In this study, we analysed how different environmental features affect bird biodiversity in one of the most urbanized areas of Italy (the metropolitan area of Milan) at different spatial scales. Bird surveys were conducted in fifteen urban and peri-urban parks and environmental variables at landscape and local scale recorded. Results showed that a mixture of land covers and the presence of water bodies inside urban parks favoured species occurrence and abundance at landscape scale, but a surrounding dense urban matrix deflated biodiversity. At local scale, woodland cover and presence of water bodies were key determinants in ensuring overall high biodiversity but local-specific vegetation management produced an unusual pattern for forests species. In particular, the maintenance of large trees may not result in biodiversity support for forest bird species if large trees are not located in woodland areas with a significant tree density. To understand biodiversity patterns and provide useful information for urban planning and design, we need to provide insights into species/environment relationships at multiple scales in the urban environment.

TI  - Tree architecture models, canopy maintenance, and associated root problems of angsana (Pterocarpus indicus Willd.) in the urban trees of Yogyakarta
PY  - 2018
AB  - Troll's architecture model of angsana (Pterocarpus indicus Willd.) serves as a shading tree in most of the main roads in Yogyakarta. However, its lateral roots potentially damage sidewalks and cause accidents to people. This research was aimed to understand the damage types associated with the root problem, the relationship between stem diameter and root development, and angsana maintenance. Data were collected during January-July 2015 by inventory, tree identification, and interview. We categorized the types of damage into three scales, respectively: scale 1. Cracks in pots if the trees grow in pots, slight cracks on the road surface; scale 2. Roots start to slightly appear on the road surface and cause cracks in the road or damage the pots; scale 3. Roots appear on the road surface and cause a bend that harms road users or pots raised by roots. There is a relation between the size of stem diameter and its damage. Angsana starts to cause damage with a diameter of 20–29 cm on the divider and 30–39 cm on the sidewalk. We suggest that i) angsana should be planted in areas where the roots could grow freely, ii) applying alternate planting between the young and the old angsana, iii) root cutting.

TI  - Urban stress is associated with variation in microbial species composition-but not richness-in Manhattan.
PY  - 2015
AB  - The biological diversity and composition of microorganisms influences both human health outcomes and ecological processes; therefore, understanding the factors that influence microbial biodiversity is key to creating healthy, functional landscapes in which to live. In general, biological diversity is predicted to be limited by habitat size, which for green areas is often reduced in cities, and by chronic disturbance (stress). These hypotheses have not previously been tested in microbial systems in direct comparison to macroorganisms. Here we analyzed bacterial, fungal and ant communities in small road medians (average area 0.0008 km(2)) and larger parks (average area 0.64 km(2)) across Manhattan (NYC). Bacterial species richness was not significantly different between medians and parks, but community composition was significantly distinct. In contrast, ant communities differed both in composition and richness with fewer ant species in medians than parks. Fungi showed no significant variation in composition or richness but had few shared taxa between habitats or sites. The diversity and composition of microbes appears less sensitive to habitat patchiness or urban stress than those of macroorganisms. Microbes and their associated ecosystem services and functions may be more resilient to the negative effects of urbanization than has been previously appreciated.

TI  - Five New Records of Introduced Terrestrial Gastropods in Southern California Discovered by Citizen Science
PY  - 2018
AB  - Terrestrial gastropod inventories can be improved, both in scope and thoroughness, by including species observations made by citizen scientists. Few citizen science projects, however, focus on terrestrial gastropods and perhaps none has mobilized members of the public to survey the malacofauna of a major North American metropolitan area. Here we report first occurrence records of five introduced terrestrial gastropod species in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties in California, discovered by citizen science: Arion hortensis Ferussac, 1819, Cochlicella barbara (Linnaeus, 1758), Lauria cylindracea (Da Costa, 1778), Pupoides albilabris (C.B. Adams, 1841), and Xerotricha conspurcata (Draparnaud, 1801). Four of these taxa are known elsewhere in California and one, L. cylindracea, is a first occurrence record for the U.S.A. All were contributed to SLIME, a citizen science project and malacofaunal inventory of southern California initiated by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and hosted online by iNaturalist. Species identifications were made based on snail or slug morphology and collected specimens' COI barcoding sequences, which were compared to those in GenBank and BOLD databases. These discoveries demonstrate the efficacy of SLIME and the potential for molluscan-focused citizen science to detect and document land snail and slug taxa in a major metropolis.

TI  - Sprawling and diverse: The changing U.S. population and implications for public lands in the 21st Century.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Public lands are typically established in recognition of their unique ecological value, yet both ecological and social values of public lands change over time, along with human distribution and land use. These transformations are evident even in developed countries with long histories of public land management, such as the United States. The 20th Century saw dramatic changes in the American population, in distribution and in racial and ethnic diversity, leading to new challenges and new roles for public lands. Our goal with this paper is to review changing demographics and implications for terrestrial protected areas in the U.S. We overview the fundamentals of population change and data, review past trends in population change and housing growth and their impacts on public lands, and then analyze the most recent decade of demographic change (2000-2010) relative to public lands. Discussions of demographic change and public lands commonly focus on the rural West, but we show that the South is also experiencing substantial change in rural areas with public lands, including Hispanic population growth. We identify those places, rural and urban, where demographic change (2000-2010), including diversification and housing growth, coincide with public lands. Understanding the current trends and long-term demographic context for recent changes in populations can help land managers and conservation scientists mitigate the effects of residential development near public lands, serve a more diverse population, and anticipate future population changes.

TI  - The local climate impact of an African city during clear-sky conditions—Implications of the recent urbanization in Kampala (Uganda)
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study is set up in collaboration with the REACT5 project (Remote sensing for Epidemiology in sub-saharan African CiTies) led by ULB. The work aims at assessing and understanding the impact of recent urbanization on the urban heat island (UHI) under clear-sky conditions in a tropical African city using different sources of remotely sensed data sets together with an urban climate model (UCM). The observed UHI during clear sky conditions is found to be about 4⁰C on average over the capital city of Kampala, Uganda. The UCM, consisting of TERRA_URB embedded in COSMO-CLM, represents the UHI well during night but overestimates it by about 3⁰C in the mean during day. Moreover, a systematic warm land surface temperature bias of about 4⁰C is identified by night. Improved urban input parameters - derived from Local Climate Zones following the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) framework - lead to a more realistic representation of spatial land surface temperatures patterns. In addition, this parameterization of the UCM can properly represent atmospheric variables such as air temperature, specific and relative humidity, as observed by the automated weather stations. A model sensitivity study furthermore demonstrates that the stronger urban heat island induced by the recent urbanization of Kampala over the past 15 years strongly interacts with the lake-land breeze circulation. Stronger daytime convection over the hotter city leads to areas of convergence that amplify the afternoon lake breeze in the southern parts of the metropolis. Overall, this study demonstrates that the city of Kampala has a tangible effect on the regional climate that needs to be considered when studying present and future climate impacts.status: publishe

TI  - Myxomycetes associated with three different types of Neotropical urban landscapes
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban ecology is a research field gaining momentum due to contextual pressures to study macroecological effects on biodiversity. Herein, we evaluated the occurrence of myxomycetes in three urban Neotropical environments representing different levels of conurbation within different life zones. We used the moist chamber technique set up with ground litter collected by public roads for such evaluation. Results showed that 79% of the 420 moist chambers yielded myxomycetes and the same number of samples generated 570 records. The highest number of records and species were found in the cornurbated widespread city of the premontane moist forest life zone; and fewer records and species were recorded in the two non-conurbated compact cities. The lowest number of records was associated with the lowland dry forest life zone, whereas the lowest number of species was recorded in the desertic context. In general, more records and more species were observed in the outer zones relative to the urban centre but no significant differences were observed in either case. It is unlikely that the life zone characteristics could have primarily determined the results and highly likely played a secondary role. Also, previous geographical analyses in cities have reported no differences in myxomycete abundance or species richness in relation to the central parts of the urban landscape. The results presented herein support the latter idea, but also suggest that the presence of inter-conurbated green spaces and availability of substrates might play a role in the occurrence of sporocarps of myxomycetes in urban environments.

TI  - Untangling the role of urban ecosystems as habitats for endangered plant species
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract As urbanization accelerates globally, a better understanding of how cities contribute to biodiversity conservation is increasingly pressing. Previous studies reveal that cities can harbor a considerable biological richness, including endangered plant species. Yet, a key question on the urban contribution to plant conservation remains critically open, as little information is available on how populations of endangered plant species occur across different biotope types within cities and to what extent anthropogenically shaped vs. natural ecosystems provide habitats for endangered plants. We analyzed a unique dataset on the exact geographical position of 1742 populations of 213 endangered plant species in the city of Berlin. We first assessed the relative importance of Berlin’s nine major biotope classes as habitats of these species. Second, we applied the novel ecosystem concept to quantify endangered plant populations for natural remnants vs. hybrid vs. novel ecosystems within Berlin. Populations of endangered plant species were generally, although unevenly, associated with specific biotope classes, with forest, grassland, and ruderal biotopes as the most important habitats. Surprisingly, novel ecosystems harbored the highest numbers of total populations, of total species, and of species that were exclusively confined to one type of ecosystem novelty. Quantifying the relative importance of biotope classes and novel vs. (near-)natural ecosystems as habitats of endangered species demonstrates that the urban contribution to biodiversity conservation is best ensured by providing a range of ecosystems. Rather than prioritizing only natural remnants, we thus argue for broad approaches to urban biodiversity conservation that include novel ecosystems.

TI  - An expanding cityscape and its multi-scale effects on lizard distribution
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urbanization results in complex and variable changes to environmental conditions, which translate to shifts in selection pressures for organisms. Size of a city as well as the intensity and extent of urbanization can synergistically influence how organisms are impacted. However, less is known about how landscape heterogeneity, rate of land-use change, and scale of urbanization affect species persistence. We evaluate the ways in which urbanization changes the environment and examine how some of these environmental factors influence the presence of the lizard <jats:italic>Psammophilus dorsalis</jats:italic> (Peninsular rock agama), in Bengaluru, India. Variability in environmental factors across the study area was characterised by measures of habitat composition and diversity, habitat connectivity, rate of habitat change, predation pressure, land surface temperature (LST) and artificial light at night (ALAN), that were derived from remotely sensed and citizen science data. Most of these factors showed high variance across two measures of urbanization: distance from city center and proportion of built-up area. Habitat diversity and ALAN were the only two factors that changed predictably and in a non-linear way, with distance from the city center and proportion of built-up area. We then used a multi-scale approach to examine the relative importance of some these environmental factors at the landscape scale, as well as additional factors at the microhabitat-scale, in predicting the presence and relative abundance of <jats:italic>P. dorsalis</jats:italic> respectively. At the landscape scale, LST, which is positively correlated with proportion of cropland, predicted lizard presence; whereas at the microhabitat scale, <jats:italic>P. dorsalis</jats:italic> was more likely to be found in sites with higher proportions of rocks. Overall, we demonstrate that urbanization can result in environmental predictors that do not vary linearly across the urbanization gradient. For the iconic rock agama, many of these environmental factors do not seem to be strong selection pressures that influence their distribution in the expanding cityscape. Whether this urban utilizer can continue to persist with increasing anthropogenic development is uncertain. To better understand drivers of species persistence, we emphasize the importance of quantifying urbanization across multiple axes, considering environmental factors that are relevant to species at different spatial and temporal scales.</jats:p>

TI  - Taxonomic and functional trait diversity of wild bees in different urban settings
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urbanization is one of the major anthropogenic processes contributing to local habitat loss and extirpation of numerous species, including wild bees, the most widespread pollinators. Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones. Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services.

TI  - Sports and urban biodiversity: framework for achieving mutual benefits for nature and sports in cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>Investing in nature and nature-based solutions is an important pathway to address the current ecological crisis. The loss of biodiversity, with around one million animal and plant species threatened with extinction, is putting at risk our economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life worldwide. Diverse and innovative measures are needed to reverse this decline and to restore healthy ecosystems. The magnitude of the challenge calls for the collaboration and contribution of all actors, including non-state actors, such as businesses, local authorities, civil society organisations, and individual citizens. Sports and urban biodiversity identifies the opportunities for sports federations and sport venue owners and operators to develop the seven elements essential for supporting nature in cities. Case studies from Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa capture the biodiversity actions taken by a variety of sports, from Olympic city planning to local projects at stadiums and practice facilities. These examples also reveal ways in which improvements to urban biodiversity elements can offer a better sporting experience for event participants and spectators.</jats:p>

TI  - Landscape urbanization threatens plant phylogenetic diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization causes species loss around the world, but its effects on phylogenetic diversity are poorly known in tropical forests. Using a patch-landscape approach in an urbanizing region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we tested whether the increase in landscape urbanization reduces plant species density, phylogenetic richness and divergence, and increases the relatedness among co-occurring individuals and species. We assessed plant responses to urbanization in adult (diameter at breast height > 10 cm) and sapling communities (2.5–10 cm diameter) separately, as saplings are proxies of the future flora. We sampled 2860 woody plants belonging to 155 species in nine circular landscapes with urbanization level varying from 0% to 45%, and estimated the relatedness among the species that have increased and decreased in relative abundance in more urbanized landscapes (winner and losers, respectively). As expected, species density and phylogenetic richness decreased with the increase in urbanization. These responses were consistent for adult and sapling communities, suggesting a persistent loss of species and lineages in more urbanized landscapes. Contrary to our expectations, phylogenetic divergence and structure did not respond to urbanization, indicating that the more urbanized landscapes still retain much evolutionary history. However, because the relatedness among winners was greater than among losers, it is likely that the phylogenetic divergence gradually reduces and the relatedness increases, resulting in impoverished forests with uncertain ability to provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and pest control. This environmental cost should be taken into account to align urban sprawl with biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Human activity and climate change as determinants of spatial prioritization for the conservation of globally threatened birds in the southern Neotropic (Santa Fe, Argentina)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Conservation area networks (CAN) must overlap spatial patterns of conservation priorities in order to ensure their persistence. Threatened species are among the least controversial biodiversity features taken into account to guide conservation policies. Due to growing human pressure and climate change worldwide, chances of planning an effective CAN may be reduced. Santa Fe province is located in the center-east of Argentina and encompasses four bioregions highly threatened of the subtropical temperate South America. Intensive agriculture, livestock and hunting have led to the loss and degradation of its natural habitats and the current CAN fails on the coverage of bioregions. Our aim was to find out areas that enhance the persistence of threatened bird species in the Santa Fe province. We defined spatial conservation priorities that overlap environmentally suitable areas of species over time and overcome the likely impacts of human activity. Conservation priorities (top 20%) belonged mainly to Dry Chaco and Atlantic bioregions and will remain the same in the province. The current CAN mismatches spatial patterns of environmental suitability of threatened species. Sporophila hypochroma, Asthenes hudsoni and Spartonoica maluroides may lose more than half of their current environmentally suitable area in the future. Human activity will lead to a CAN which will require a great number of patches and a large perimeter. Searching for the most environmentally suitable areas of species over time while minimizing conflicts with human activities is a useful conservation strategy regardless the biogeographical context considered.

TI  - Bird responses to housing development in intensively managed agricultural landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Housing a growing human population is a global issue and designing environmentally friendly developments requires identifying the species likely to be negatively impacted and finding mitigation solutions. Existing studies that consider fragmentation of natural habitats have limited application in countries such as Britain where a prime target for development is agricultural land where decades of intensive management have already diminished biodiversity. Here I used citizen science data on the abundance of 146 breeding and wintering birds to develop models linking abundance to human population density and habitat features. I used these as a proxy for the urbanisation process, finding that impacts of urbanisation were species-specific and context dependent. Low-density developments benefited a high proportion of birds, with wetland birds benefitting most and farmland birds least, but as human densities increased further, up to 75% of species were negatively impacted. Almost half of species currently occurring at 14 flagship residential development sites were predicted to decline based on projected human population density increases, with a third predicted to increase. Presence of wetlands, canopy cover and patches of trees all benefited certain species but efforts to identify more detailed habitat associations were hampered by collinearity among variables. I conclude that even in heavily degraded agricultural landscapes, a high proportion of species will be negatively impacted by residential development and that some will require spared land to persist in the wider landscape. As no single habitat benefited the entire bird community, urban planners wishing to design bird-friendly developments will need to make difficult decisions over which aspects of the bird community to prioritise.

TI  - Top ten birds indicators of high environmental quality in European cities
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Urban and suburban areas are among the fastest-growing land-use types globally, reducing and fragmenting natural habitats for many animal species and making human-wildlife interactions more common. However, cities also create habitat for several species considered urban tolerant or urban exploiter species. Additionally, the environmental characteristics of urban areas can strongly affect the life quality of citizens. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of common bird species as indicators of urban areas with high environmental quality within cities. Our study recorded 128 bird species in 1441 point counts distributed in fifteen different European cities. We classified urban areas as “high environmental quality” – HEQ when they were simultaneously characterized by a high vegetation cover and heterogeneity, low level of light pollution, and avian communities with high potential resilience to face ecological stress. Species indicators of HEQ urban areas were identified using the species-level indicator value (IndVal) analysis. Such species can be used as ecological indicators of HEQ in different European cities. The list of top ten birds indicators of HEQ in European cities is led by the Eurasian blackcap, selected as an indicator in more than half of the survey cities. Other birds indicators of HEQ in multiple cities are Blackbird (47%), Great tit (40%), Blue tit, Tree sparrow and Magpie (all 33%). The mean specificity of the top-ranked bird indicator of HEQ urban areas (Eurasian blackcap) was 0.778. Most of the HEQ-indicators are resident or resident/short migratory species characterized by territorial behaviour. Our findings support using multiple species as bioindicators of urban changes by using specific groups with few common species as surrogates of HEQ urban areas. The approach proposed in this study can be applied in different European cities to monitor biodiversity status periodically, even involving citizen science initiatives.

TI  - Urban habitat use and home ranges of fishing cats in Colombo, Sri Lanka
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation and habitat loss are major threats to wildlife populations globally. Understanding how species respond to anthropogenic changes is therefore crucial to mitigating threats and developing conservation management strategies. We examined the habitat use of five fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) in Sri Lanka’s capital city, Colombo, a densely urbanised landscape with a mosaic of wetland habitats, cultivated areas, and altered open spaces. We investigated: (1) to what extent all five cats used human-impacted versus natural wetland habitat; (2) whether there were behavioural shifts to avoid human activity throughout the diel cycle; (3) the home range sizes of two resident females and one resident male, and the extent of the area used by the two translocated males; (4) whether the two translocated males would survive introduction to a new urban environment. We monitored the fishing cats for 637 days (mean = 127) and collected a total of 2278 GPS (5-h interval) collar locations. We found that all five individuals used highly urbanised areas more than we expected. Home range sizes of the three residents were smaller than fishing cat home ranges in less disturbed landscapes. Though our sample size was small, our findings suggest that fishing cats use urbanised areas in Colombo, particularly at night, likely to avoid daytime human activity. Further comprehensive ecological study is needed to explore the aspects of fishing cat ecology that facilitate their persistence, and aid in their conservation across increasingly urbanised areas.

TI  - Long-term species richness-abundance dynamics in relation to species departures and arrivals in wintering urban bird assemblages
PY  - 2019
AB  - Temporal dynamics of local assemblages depend on the species richness and the total abundance of individuals as well as local departure and arrival rates of species. We used urban bird survey data collected from the same 31 study plots and methods during three winters (1991–1992; 1999–2000 and 2009–2010) to analyze the temporal relationship between bird species richness and total number of individuals (abundance). We also evaluated local departures and arrivals of species in each assemblage. In total, 13,812 individuals of 35 species were detected. The temporal variation in bird species richness followed the variation in the total number of individuals. The numbers of local departure and arrival events were similar. Also, the mean number of individuals of the recently arrived species (8.6) was almost the same as the mean number of individuals of the departed species (8.2). Risk of species departure was inversely related to number of individuals. Local species richness increased by one species when the total abundance of individuals increased by around 125 individuals and vice versa. Our results highlight the important role of local population departures and arrivals in determining the local species richness-abundance dynamics in human-dominated landscapes. Local species richness patterns depend on the total number of individuals as well as both the departure-arrival dynamics of individual species as well as the dynamics of all the species together. Our results support the more individuals hypothesis, which suggests that individual-rich assemblages have more species.

TI  - Unexpectedly, Creation of Temporary Water Bodies Has Increased the Availability of Food and Nesting Sites for Bees (Apiformes)
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Earthworks, such as embankments or excavations, because of their transient nature, usually do not play any important role in biodiversity protection and promotion in urban areas. However, the results of this study show that pits playing the role of infiltration basins, which are filled with water only in some periods, can provide bees with food resources and nesting sites. They are particularly important in habitats with simplified vegetation structures, e.g., in monoculture habitats. The attractiveness of infiltration basins and ditches as habitats for bees was assessed by comparing species richness and abundance of bee communities found there with those of coniferous forests—pine monocultures (where the reservoirs were created) and clearings. The species richness and abundance of bees in clearings, infiltration ditches, and basins were higher than in forests. Simultaneously, we found that an increase in woody vegetation coverage and the level of shading in the daytime had a negative effect on bee abundance. In contrast, it was positively affected by increasing the mean radius of a belt of predominantly open habitats around sampling sites (herbaceous plants and seedlings of woody plants &lt;60%). In this case, food resources were not a limiting factor of bee occurrence in the study area.</jats:p>

TI  - Urbanization homogenizes the interactions of plant-frugivore bird networks
PY  - 2020
AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.

TI  - COVID-19 Pandemic Turns Life-Science Students into “Citizen Scientists”: Data Indicate Multiple Negative Effects of Urbanization on Biota
PY  - 2021
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions strongly affect the higher education community and require diverse teaching strategies. We designed a course where we combined online teaching with independently conducted ecological data collections by students using a “citizen science” approach. The aim was to analyze the impact of urbanization on biota by comparing urban and rural grasslands. Seventy-five students successfully conducted the data collections and the results provide evidence for prevailing negative effects of urbanization. Individual numbers of ground-dwelling invertebrates (−25%) and pollinating insects (−33%) were generally lower in urban sites. Moreover, animal and seed predation were reduced in urban grasslands, indicating the potential of urbanization to alter ecosystem functions. Despite the general limitations of online teaching and citizen science approaches, outcomes of this course showed this combination can be a useful teaching strategy, which is why this approach could be used to more actively involve students in scientific research.

TI  - Seeds and the city : the interdependence of zoochory and ecosystem dynamics in urban environments
PY  - 2019
AB  - The increasing urban sprawl has contributed to the extensive fragmentation and reduction of natural habitat worldwide. Urbanization has a range of adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, including the disruption of plant dispersal processes across the landscape. Urban fragmentation can alter the distance and directionality of dispersal, leading to disrupted gene flow among populations. The dispersal processes of plants that rely on animal-mediated dispersal (zoochory) may be disproportionately affected by urbanization, as many animals avoid urban areas or restrict their movements within urban habitats. This could alter the efficiency of animal dispersal vectors and modify seed movements across urban habitats. While recent studies suggest that seed dispersal networks can be complex and dynamic even in highly managed green areas with relatively low biodiversity, zoochory in urban environments remains understudied. We synthesize the existing literature on zoochory in urban environments and place the findings in the context of ecosystem dynamics. We assess the ecological and evolutionary consequences for seed dispersal following urbanization by considering how zoochory is affected by specific features of urban environments. These include the complexity of habitats with varying continuity; high disturbance and intense management; a high proportion of alien species combined with low natural biodiversity; animal behavioral adjustments in different urban settings; and rapid evolutionary change due to urbanization. We conclude that 1) urbanization can disrupt and alter zoochory processes; and 2) successful zoochory can, in turn, alleviate or worsen the challenges to ecosystem dynamics originating from increased urbanization. The dynamic urban seed dispersal networks are emerging as useful models for the adaptability of seed dispersal communities. Their study can also shed light on eco-evolutionary processes under anthropogenic selective pressures, including species interactions. Finally, urban zoochory processes are critical to the functioning of urban ecosystems and as such, constitute an important ecosystem service with management implications. We propose directions for further research into urban zoochory processes to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics as urbanization continues.

TI  - Winter Bird Diversity and Abundance in Small Farmlands in a Megacity of Southern China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urban expansion often accompanies a loss of natural habitats and arable lands but an increase in urban population. In China, vegetable-dominant small farmlands are common in urban/peri-urban areas. Some farmlands are also associated with government policy that aims to enhance local farmers’ livelihoods as well as increase food availability for city citizens. While small urban farmlands create open greenery cover that may provide birds with resources such as food and shelter, little attention has been given to understanding bird diversity in urban farmlands. Using two hierarchical models (multi-species occupancy model and N-mixture model), we examined how species richness and abundance of birds were associated with environmental characteristics within and surrounding urban farmlands in Guangzhou, one of the largest cities in China. We conducted crop and bird surveys at urban farmlands during two winter seasons between December 2019 and January 2021. Species richness increased with non-woody (herbaceous) vegetation cover within a farmland. Abundance of three species was also positively associated with the local non-woody vegetation variable. Two species were more abundant at farmlands with higher crop diversity. Compositional features of matrix surrounding a farmland (a 500-m circular area) did not affect species richness. However, species richness and abundance of one species tended to decrease with increasing farmland fragmentation (patch density of farmlands) within a 1-km circular area. These findings suggest that (1) birds could be more influenced by environmental features within farmlands than matrix features surrounding farmlands, (2) local uncultivated herbaceous vegetation is an important environmental feature, and (3) diverse crops in farmlands may benefit some birds. They also indicate that the landscape pattern of farmlands, such as degree of fragmentation, could affect bird diversity in urban farmlands.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In an increasingly urbanized world, there is a need to study urban areas as their own class of ecosystems as well as assess the impacts of anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.

By selecting species with the most accurate SDMs, and then summarizing these by class, we were able to produce two species richness models (SRMs) to predict biodiversity patterns for species in the class Aves and Magnoliopsida and how they respond to a variety of natural and anthropogenic environmental gradients.</jats:p><jats:p>We found that species considered native to Los Angeles tend to have significantly more accurate SDMs than their non-native counterparts. For all species considered in this study we found environmental variables describing anthropogenic activities, such as housing density and alterations to land cover, tend to be more influential than natural factors, such as terrain and proximity to freshwater, in shaping SDMs. Using a random forest model we found our SRMs could account for approximately 54% and 62% of the predicted variation in species richness for species in the classes Aves and Magnoliopsida respectively. Using community science-based species occurrences, SRMs can be used to model patterns of urban biodiversity and assess the roles of environmental factors in shaping them.</jats:p>

TI  - CityScapeLab Berlin: A research platform for untangling urbanization effects on biodiversity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of how urbanization modulates biodiversity patterns and the associated ecosystem services. While important advances have been made in the conceptual development of urban biodiversity research over the last decades, challenges remain in understanding the interactions between different groups of taxa and the spatiotemporal complexity of urbanization processes. The CityScapeLab Berlin is a novel experimental research platform that allows the testing of theories on how urbanization affects biodiversity patterns and biotic interactions in general and the responses of species of conservation interest in particular. We chose dry grassland patches as the backbone of the research platform because dry grasslands are common in many urban regions, extend over a wide urbanization gradient, and usually harbor diverse and self-assembled communities. Focusing on a standardized type of model ecosystem allowed the urbanization effects on biodiversity to be unraveled from effects that would otherwise be masked by habitat- and land-use effects. The CityScapeLab combines different types of spatiotemporal data on (i) various groups of taxa from different trophic levels, (ii) environmental parameters on different spatial scales, and (iii) on land-use history. This allows for the unraveling of the effects of current and historical urban conditions on urban biodiversity patterns and the related ecological functions.

TI  - Predation and Scavenging in the City: A Review of Spatio-Temporal Trends in Research
PY  - 2021
AB  - Many researchers highlight the role of urban ecology in a rapidly urbanizing world. Despite the ecological and conservation implications relating to carnivores in cities, our general understanding of their potential role in urban food webs lacks synthesis. In this paper, we reviewed the scientific literature on urban carnivores with the aim of identifying major biases in this topic of research. In particular, we explored the number of articles dealing with predation and scavenging, and assessed the geographical distribution, biomes and habitats represented in the scientific literature, together with the richness of species reported and their traits. Our results confirmed that scavenging is largely overlooked compared to predation in urban carnivore research. Moreover, research was biased towards cities located in temperate biomes, while tropical regions were less well-represented, a pattern that was more evident in the case of articles on scavenging. The species reported in both predation and scavenging articles were mainly wild and domestic mammals with high meat-based diets and nocturnal habits, and the majority of the studies were conducted in the interior zone of cities compared to peri-urban areas. Understanding the trophic role of carnivores in urban environments and its ecological consequences will require full recognition of both their predation and scavenging facets, which is especially desirable given the urban sprawl that has been predicted in the coming decades.

TI  - Secrets of Success in a Landscape of Fear: Urban Wild Boar Adjust Risk Perception and Tolerate Disturbance
PY  - 2017
AB  - 1 Introduction The landscape of fear describes an animal’s trade-off between access to food and predator avoidance on a spatial scale (Brown et al., 1999;Laundre J. W. et al., 2010;Laundre et al., 2014). The concept includes that the landscape of fear represents relative levels of predation risk as peaks and valleys that reflect the level of fear in different parts of its area of use (Laundre J. W. et al., 2010). Disturbance of wildlife by people is particularly frequent in urban environments and can exceed disturbance by natural predators. It therefore has the potential to shape prey behavior and should incite avoidance of such environments (Frid and Dill, 2002;Ciuti et al., 2012;Rosner et al., 2014;Stoen et al., 2015). The number of mammals living in urban environments increases (Bateman and Fleming, 2012;Magle et al., 2012). Hence, urban environments can support wildlife and provide various food sources: natural food (Stillfried et al., 2017b) or anthropogenic, easily accessible food (Cahill et al., 2012;Murray et al., 2015;Theimer et al., 2015;Tryjanowski et al., 2015), both of which can contain a high amount of energy (Ottoni et al., 2009;Maibeche et al., 2015). The urban landscape of fear should be worse than the rural one because the threat increases with human proximity per se, a high traffic volume and additional predators such as domestic dogs and other companion animals (Frid and Dill, 2002;Baker et alKinney, 2002;Lowry et al., 2013). Urban wildlife needs to perceive spatio-temporal variation in risk (Valeix et al., 2012). The urban landscape of fear should correspond to landscape features such as roads, because of vehicle and pedestrian traffic (Dowding et al., 2010;Bonnot et al., 2013;Lowry et al., 2013;Morelle et al., 2013;Murray and St Clair, 2015;Thurfjell et al., 2015;Gray et al., 2016), sealed built-up areas (= areas with a high density of housing (Bonnot et al., 2013;Magle et al., 2014;Beninde et al., 2015;Gray et al., 2016) and

TI  - Urban freshwaters, biodiversity, and human health and well‐being: Setting an interdisciplinary research agenda
PY  - 2019
AB  - The findings of a national workshop that explored the social and environmental impacts, challenges, and research opportunities associated with the role of urban freshwaters for improved public health are discussed. Bringing together the collective expertise of academics, practitioners, policy, and user‐groups from urban aquatic ecology and human health backgrounds, this commentary develops a progressive agenda for future research by synthesizing current understandings and knowledge of urban aquatic biodiversity relative to health‐related ecosystem service outcomes, from a cross‐sectoral and cross‐disciplinary perspective. Key areas include (a) a need for greater interaction between sectors to maximize opportunities for collaboration and to promote the cobenefits (both environmental and health) associated with urban freshwater ecosystems; and (b) the need for a unified understanding and operationalization of the definition of aquatic biodiversity across sectors and disciplines, to improve our understanding of whether actual freshwater biodiversity or the perception of biodiversity is important for maximizing gains in health. Methods of valuation relating to ecosystem services and resource allocation and investment in urban freshwaters are critical in ensuring that research addresses the pathways and contexts within which health and environmental benefits from blue space can be maximized.

TI  - The Civil City Framework for the Implementation of Nature-Based Smart Innovations: Right to a Healthy City Perspective
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>This paper aims to expand the current debate concerning the implementation of health-related innovations by employing the rights-based approach. Specifically, we address the challenges related to the implementation of technological and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) from the right to the city perspective. As a result, we present a comprehensive Civil City Framework that involves the synergic use of ICT tools and participation models to mobilize grassroots potential for building healthier cities, while ensuring equity and respect for diverse needs. We explain the participatory and technological aspects of implementing and monitoring innovative NBS, involving data gathering through environmental sensors, personal wristbands, and smartphone apps. Finally, we highlight opportunities and challenges stemming from the use of health- and environment-monitoring technologies. To build such a vision one needs to reconceive the city as commons, enabling collective action of city residents and cooperation between different local stakeholders. This can be achieved by embedding a pentahelix approach of multi-governance in urban planning, based on a close interaction between five key stakeholders, including public authorities, industry and business sector, academia, civil society organizations, and individual citizens.</jats:p>

TI  - Promoting Partnership between Urban Design and Urban Ecology through Social-Ecological Resilience Building
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>A closer partnership between urban design and urban ecology can yield new knowledge with the predictive advancement of both fields. However, achieving such partnership is not always a straight-forward process due to different epistemological departures. This chapter provides a rudimentary background of the fields of urban design and urban ecology and familiarizes readers with some epistemological characteristics that are useful to consider in all forms of partnership activities between designers and ecologists. Social-ecological resilience offers a useful framework for inquiry of particular relevance for urban transition at a time when global societal challenges of massive biodiversity loss and climate change require urgent attention and where wicked environmental problems require creative urban tinkering. Such a framework could open up for more dynamic research approaches with a greater potential to bridge the gap between design and ecology that has tended to be dominated by relatively static design approaches in the past, ignoring a more non-linear understanding of the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. The chapter ends by focusing on some important determinants for cooperation and dealing with ‘Research Through Design(ing)’ as a viable methodology for transition to urban sustainability.</jats:p>

TI  - Response of bats and nocturnal insects to urban green areas in Europe
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Animal biodiversity in cities is generally expected to be uniformly reduced, but recent studies show that this is modulated by the composition and configuration of Urban Green Areas (UGAs). UGAs represent a heterogeneous network of vegetated spaces in urban settings that have repeatedly shown to support a significant part of native diurnal animal biodiversity. However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the specific spatial topology of UGAs in each city.

TI  - Quantification of the environmental effectiveness of nature-based solutions for increasing the resilience of cities under climate change
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract Nature-based solutions (NBSs) enhance the potential for mitigation and adaptation to climate change in cities. Among the environmental benefits offered by these measures, enhanced biodiversity, increased carbon storage, reduction of extreme temperatures, and pluvial flood control are crucial. The purpose of this study was to establish an integrated methodology for quantifying the benefits of NBSs and complementary measures and to apply it in a neighbourhood of Donostia-San Sebastian (Spain), where two alternative designs that incorporated NBSs and complementary measures were designed. Then, the individual effectiveness of the four variables was measured using both in-situ measurements and modelling approaches. For the integrated effectiveness, a multi-criteria decision analysis was employed. Both the ‘feasible’ design and the ‘ideal’ one led to an increase in biodiversity (46 and 108%, respectively) and carbon storage (50 and 130%, respectively). When considering each measure independently, putting soil provided the highest benefits for carbon capture and biodiversity; meanwhile, planting woody species and installing light-coloured permeable pavements and water fountains reduced the mean radiant temperature by 26.5 K and the air temperature by 0.5 and 2.5 K, respectively, in specific places. Finally, the importance of quantifying the multiple environmental benefits of NBSs for the selection of climate-smart options in urban planning has been highlighted.

TI  - Landscape Context Influences the Abundance and Richness of Native Lady Beetles Occupying Urban Vacant Land
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development.

TI  - Rapid evolution of ant thermal tolerance across an urban-rural temperature cline
PY  - 2017
AB  - Rates of urbanization are accelerating worldwide. The increases in temperature associated with ‘urban heat island’ effects provide both an ecological imperative and a unique opportunity to explore the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie organismal responses to rapid environmental change. We used the acorn ant, Temnothorax curvispinosus (Mayr 1866), to compare shifts in thermal tolerance of ants from rural and urban habitats throughout Cleveland, USA. Urban warming in the region has been ongoing for the past century which translates to 20 or fewer acorn ant generations. Using a common garden experiment, we found gains in the ability to withstand high temperatures and losses in the ability to withstand cool temperatures among ants in urban habitats. Owing to the greater magnitude of phenotypic change in lower compared with upper tolerances, tolerance breadth decreased in urban habitats. Mechanistically, these shifts in thermal tolerance under urbanization reflected both evolutionary change and phenotypic plasticity, as ants from urban areas exhibited higher thermal tolerances compared with ants from rural areas regardless of rearing temperature, and ants reared in the warmer temperature treatment exhibited higher tolerances than ants reared in the cooler temperature treatment. We also found evidence of evolved plasticity as the slope of the response to warmer and colder rearing environments differed significantly among rural and urban populations. While much of the ecological forecasting literature focuses on plastic responses to environmental change, our study provides evidence of rapid evolution of thermal tolerances, and suggests the importance of including evolutionary responses in forecasts of organismal responses to climatic change

TI  - An urban cast of characters: Landscape use and cover influencing mammal occupancy in an American midwestern city
PY  - 2023
AB  - • Land cover influences occupancy of eight urban dwelling mammal species. • More species negatively associated with anthropogenic land cover. • Four species negatively associated with residential yards. • Residential yards may be an unnecessary or unsuitable subsidizing resource. • Green space and residential yards with vegetation heterogeneity may offset urbanization. With future human population growth concentrating in urban areas, cities are working to counterbalance ecological disturbances resulting from development by incorporating green space that supports greater biodiversity. An initial line of inquiry into designing wildlife-inclusive green space involves evaluating landscapes that are associated with the habitat use of urban species. In this study, we utilized occupancy modeling to estimate select terrestrial mammal presence in a fast-growing mid-sized midwestern city to determine possible taxa-specific associations with multiple land use and cover variables, specifically those associated with higher degrees of human activity. Using motion-triggered infrared trail cameras over eight seasons from winter 2017 to fall 2018, we applied a single-species, single-season stacked design to estimate occupancy for eight urban dwelling mammals. Taxa-specific models contained one of three possible detection variables (null, percent green space, or percent impervious surface) and combinations of three species-specific variables, natural and anthropogenic. We hypothesized that large species, coyote ( Canis latrans ) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), would exhibit the most positive association to natural land cover and the most negative association to anthropogenic land cover. We also hypothesized that small and medium sized species, eastern cottontail ( Sylvilagus floridanus ), gray squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ), opossum ( Didelphis virginiana) , raccoon ( Procyon lotor ), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ), and striped skunk ( Mephitis mephitis ), would demonstrate a neutral association to land cover type, anthropogenic or natural. Our results indicated that the presence of anthropogenic features rather than any particular natural land cover may be driving wildlife distribution in our study area, as none of our species demonstrated a positive association to natural land cover (percent recreation, residential yards, vacant land, or woodland). Species with a wide range of body sizes, showed a negative association with residential yards, indicating that this type of green space may be an unnecessary or unsuitable subsidizing resource in our study area. With our results in mind, we recommend increasing the amount of natural or less manicured green space to offset the intensity of impervious surface as well as encouraging the establishment of native vegetation in existing and newly constructed residential development to better connect urban green space and residential yards to larger adjoining tracts of natural landscapes. For our study area and other cities in similar phases of development, these suggestions may be essential first steps to reduce biodiversity loss and strengthen community ecology as urban areas continue to grow.

PY  - 2022
AB  - AbstractThis chapter focuses on the urban green spaces by offering a critical review of urban green space development in in SENA countries and case cities. Using the related data and literature together with the author’s own research, the chapter analyzes patterns and development trends of urban green spaces in case cities of SENA compared with cities globally. Section 6.1 provides a global overview of urban green space. Patterns and development of urban green spaces in North Asia, East Asia, and Southeast area are elucidated in Sects. 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4. In addition, the relationship between urbanization and green are explored through analyzing the interrelatedness of urbanization, economic development, and urban green spaces. It is found that while SENA cities differ in green space provision, cities in North Asia and Mongolia suffered low level of urban green space provision. Two environmental impacts of urban green space on SENA cities, urban heat islands and air pollution mitigation, are explored in Sect. 6.5. The chapter highlights the influence of market forces, institutions, and citizen movements on urban green landscape in SENA.KeywordsUrban green spaceGreen space per capitaEvolutionNeedsEconomic developmentPLANNINGgreen space standardUrban heat islandPM2.5 mitigationGreen space accessibility

TI  - Odonate assemblages of urban stormwater ponds: the conservation value depends on pond type
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanisation is among the most severe drivers of the recent biodiversity crisis. It has been shown that stormwater ponds have a high value for the conservation of dragon- and damselflies in urban areas. However, information on the relevance of different types of stormwater ponds is lacking so far. The aim of this study was to compare the Odonata assemblages of three types of urban stormwater ponds (n per type = 10): (i) ponds only containing temporary water bodies (TEMP), (ii) ponds with temporary and small perennial water bodies (TEMP/PERE) and (iii) ponds with one large perennial water body (PERE). We observed distinct differences in environmental conditions and Odonata assemblages among the three types of stormwater ponds. In particular, vegetation structure and the partly interrelated microclimate differed considerably between TEMP on the one hand, and TEMP/PERE and PERE on the other hand. Odonate species richness and exuviae density of threatened species differed, too. Due to their early successional stages with low cover of riparian woodland and shallow water bodies, TEMP were characterised by a warmer microclimate than TEMP/PERE and PERE. Odonate species richness and exuviae density of threatened species were highest in TEMP and lowest in PERE. Moreover, indicator species were only identified for TEMP. Our study showed that stormwater ponds with a temporary hydroperiod play an important role for the conservation of odonates in urban areas. This is especially the case for specialised threatened species, such as Libellula depressa and Ischnura pumilio.

TI  - Urbanisation modulates the attractiveness of plant communities to pollinators by filtering for floral traits
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanisation is known to change biodiversity patterns and plant–animal interactions such as pollination – a key ecological process. Floral traits like colour, size or UV-patterns are essential attractors for many pollinators. It is largely unknown, though, how the distribution of such floral traits within plant communities changes along an urbanisation gradient. This study aims to understand to which extent floral traits known to attract pollinators are filtered by urban environments. We used dry grassland, spanning a broad urbanisation gradient in the Berlin metropolitan area, Germany, as a model ecosystem and identified the distribution of plant traits related to bee-perceived flower colours, UV reflection and flower size in 47 grassland patches. We analysed how these traits were related to abiotic and biotic factors at different spatial scales. The most influent predictor was an abiotic factor measured at the landscape scale: the proportion of impervious surface, found to be positively related to UV-reflectance strength and floral UV patterns, but negatively to floral size diversity. At the local scale, abiotic factors showed an intermediary number of relationships. Temperature was negatively associated with the bee-colour ‘green + UV-green' and with flower size. The light environment was negatively related to the same bee-colour and to floral size diversity. Biotic factors related to local pollinator communities were less important: species richness was negatively related to flower size, while proportion of bees to floral sizes diversity. This study shows that floral traits known to attract pollinators are mostly filtered by abiotic factors related to urbanisation (share of impervious surface) or the urban heat island (local temperature). Biotic factors related to local pollinator communities were less important. These results increase our functional understanding of plant–animal interactions in cities by illustrating how urban environments modulate the attractiveness of plant communities to pollinators by filtering for floral plant traits.

TI  - From town to town: Predicting the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds using NDVI
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Biodiversity mapping in urban areas is imperative for their conservation. Remote sensors produce environmental information, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation cover in urban areas. NDVI can be used to predict the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic bird diversity in urban areas. Moreover, a predictive model constructed in one city can be used to predict the bird diversity in other cities. The objectives of this study were: 1) to construct and evaluate predictive models between NDVI and taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds in Mar del Plata city, Argentina; and 2) to extrapolate these models to two other cities in the region: Balcarce and Miramar. Generalized additive models were applied to relate bird diversity variations to NDVI. In Mar del Plata, the taxonomic and functional diversity increased with increasing NDVI values, and the predictive models explained 64–81% of the taxonomic and functional diversity variation. The models correctly predicted taxonomic and functional diversity values in additional transects not included in the models, although they had a low predictive power of phylogenetic diversity. The models constructed in Mar del Plata adequately predicted the spatial variation of species diversity (Shannon index) in Balcarce and Miramar, the spatial variation of species richness in Balcarce, and the variation of functional diversity in Miramar. Our analysis revealed that a predictive model of bird diversity based on NDVI patterns created in one city can also depict the expected species diversity in other cities, being a time-saving and cost-effective method to create a tool for urban biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Flower power in the city: Replacing roadside shrubs by wildflower meadows increases insect numbers and reduces maintenance costs.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Massive declines in insect biodiversity and biomass are reported from many regions and habitats. In urban areas, creation of native wildflower meadows is one option to support insects and reduce maintenance costs of urban green spaces. However, benefits for insect conservation may depend on previous land use, and the size and location of new wildflower meadows. We show effects of conversion of roadside plantings-from exotic shrubs into wildflower meadows-on (1) the abundance of 13 arthropod taxa-Opiliones, Araneae, Isopoda, Collembola, Orthoptera, Aphidoidea, Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Nematocera, Brachycera, Apocrita, Formicidae-and (2) changes in maintenance costs. We assessed the influence of vegetation type (meadow vs. woody), meadow age, size, location (distance to city boundary), and mowing regime. We found many, but not all, arthropod taxa profiting from meadows in terms of arthropod activity abundance in pitfall traps and arthropod density in standardized suction samples. Arthropod number in meadows was 212% higher in pitfall traps and 260% higher in suction samples compared to woody vegetation. The increased arthropod number in meadows was independent of the size and isolation of green spaces for most taxa. However, mowing regime strongly affected several arthropod taxa, with an increase of 63% of total arthropod density in unmown compared to mown meadow spots. Costs of green space maintenance were fivefold lower for meadows than for woody vegetation. Our study shows that (1) many different arthropod taxa occur in roadside vegetation in urban areas, (2) replacement of exotic woody vegetation by native wildflower meadows can significantly increase arthropod abundance, especially if meadow management permits temporarily unmown areas, and (3) maintenance costs can be considerably reduced by converting woody plantings into wildflower meadows. Considering many groups of arthropods, our study provides new insights into possible measures to support arthropods in urban environments.

TI  - Butterfly biodiversity in the city is driven by the interaction of the urban landscape and species traits: a call for contextualised management
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation is an environmental filter for many species that leads to community homogenisation, with a few species inhabiting isolated patches (e.g. public and private gardens and parks) embedded within the urban landscape. Promoting biodiversity in urban areas requires understanding which species traits allow species to survive the urban landscape. The objective of this study was to assess how species traits and landscape factors combine to allow species functional groups to live in the city. We used butterfly count data collected by volunteers in 24 gardens of Barcelona city, during 2018 and 2019. Species were clustered in functional groups according to their traits. We applied a multinomial choice model to test for the effect of the landscape on the different functional groups. Three functional groups became prevalent in the city while a fourth, containing most sedentary specialist species, was filtered out. Although the observed groups had similar species richness, abundances varied depending on urban landscape characteristics. Specialist sedentary specialists and medium mobile species were all favoured by patch connectivity; while the presence of mobile generalist species was only enhanced by habitat quality. Our results indicate that butterfly communities are more diverse in highly connected gardens. Our study highlights the need of contextualised management with actions accounting for the species functional groups, rather than a management focused on general species richness. It demonstrates that urban landscape planning must focus on improving connectivity inside the city in order to diversify the community composition.

TI  - Evaluating the potential for prezygotic isolation and hybridization between landlocked and anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) following secondary contact.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The recent increase in river restoration projects is altering habitat connectivity for many aquatic species, increasing the chance that previously isolated populations will come into secondary contact. Anadromous and landlocked alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) are currently undergoing secondary contact as a result of a fishway installation at Rogers Lake in Old Lyme, Connecticut. To determine the degree of prezygotic isolation and potential for hybridization between alewife life history forms, we constructed spawning time distributions for two anadromous and three landlocked alewife populations using otolith-derived age estimates. In addition, we analyzed long-term data from anadromous alewife migratory spawning runs to look for trends in arrival date and spawning time. Our results indicated that anadromous alewife spawned earlier and over a shorter duration than landlocked alewife, but 3%-13% of landlocked alewife spawning overlapped with the anadromous alewife spawning period. The degree of spawning time overlap was primarily driven by annual and population-level variation in the timing of spawning by landlocked alewife, whereas the timing and duration of spawning for anadromous alewife were found to be relatively invariant among years in our study system. For alewife and many other anadromous fish species, the increase in fish passage river restoration projects in the coming decades will re-establish habitat connectivity and may bring isolated populations into contact. Hybridization between life history forms may occur when prezygotic isolating mechanisms are minimal, leading to potentially rapid ecological and evolutionary changes in restored habitats.

TI  - Connectivity of public urban grasslands: implications for grassland conservation and restoration in cities.
PY  - 2016
AB  - An important limitation of studies on the ecological value of urban habitats is the question of habitat connectivity. While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Munster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement. The graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to analyse urban habitat connectivity but also to illustrate results obtained.

TI  - Time Is Not Money: Income Is More Important Than Lifestage for Explaining Patterns of Residential Yard Plant Community Structure and Diversity in Baltimore
PY  - 2020
AB  - Plant biodiversity is affected by limiting resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight. In urban settings, such as residential yards, however, limiting resources may also include the social factors of time and money spent on yard care. To examine the role that these precious human resources play in determining plant community structure and diversity, we surveyed homeowners and their yards in 12 neighborhoods across Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland, visiting a total of 96 residential properties. We chose neighborhoods based on residents’ median income (a proxy for money) and lifestage (a proxy for time) as determined by ESRI's Tapestry dataset [older (>65 and most likely retired with more free time) versus younger (<65 and most likely working with less free time)]. At each residential yard, we studied four major plant types: lawn species, flowering herbaceous plants (excluding grasses), trees, and invasive species. For the flowering plants, we documented the number, size, and color of flowers, and calculated total floral area. We found that residential yards harbored high plant diversity with 89 tree species, 82 lawn species, and 80 flowering plant genera. Lawn richness was not related to the neighborhood-level lifestage of the residents or their income,; rather, all lawns were equally weedy. Consistently, we found that yards in higher income neighborhoods and larger yards had greater abundance of plants and greater diversity of flowering herbaceous plants, trees, and invasive species, whereas lifestage was rarely associated with plant diversity. Additionally, we found front yards had greater floral area than back yards, while back yards had greater tree abundance and tree diversity than front yards. Finally, we found that residents who spent more time doing yard work had more flowering plants, flower colors, and floral genera. Overall, yards in highincome neighborhood, and large yards had the greatest plant biodiversity, indicating that money is the more precious human resource for creating and maintaining biodiverse residential yards.

TI  - Predicting the assembly of novel communities in urban ecosystems
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ecological communities in urban ecosystems are assembled through ecological processes, such as species interactions, dispersal, and environmental filtering, but also through human factors that create and modify the landscape. These complex interactions make it difficult to untangle the relationships between social–ecological dynamics and urban biodiversity. As a result, there has been a call for research to address how human activities influence the processes by which ecological communities are structured in urban ecosystems. We address this research challenge using core concepts from landscape ecology to develop a framework that links social-ecological dynamics to ecological communities using the metacommunity perspective. The metacommunity perspective is a useful framework to explore the assembly of novel communities because it distinguishes between the effects of local environmental heterogeneity and regional spatial processes in structuring ecological communities. Both are shaped by social–ecological dynamics in urban ecosystems. In this paper, we define social, environmental, and spatial processes that structure metacommunities, and ultimately biodiversity, in cities. We then address how our framework could be applied in urban ecosystem research to understand multi-scalar biodiversity patterns. Our framework provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for transdisciplinary research to examine how social-ecological dynamics mediate the assembly of novel communities in urban ecosystems.

TI  - The effects of shoreline armouring on estuarine fish are contingent upon the broader urbanisation context
PY  - 2018
AB  - ABSTRACT: Natural ecosystems in estuaries are modified by the effects of runoff from disturbed watersheds and are frequently replaced by armoured estuarine shorelines. Whilst the effects of these 2 stressors are widely recognised, they are typically studied in isolation, and it is not clear how these contrasting types of urbanisation interact to shape faunal assemblages. In this study, fish assemblages were surveyed with underwater videos arranged in a 200 m grid throughout the lower reaches of 3 estuaries in eastern Australia (resulting in ≥63 sites per estuary and 277 sites in total) which differed in their extent of shoreline and watershed urbanisation. Overall, the least urbanised estuary supported more than twice the number of fish species and a significantly greater abundance of fish. The spatial patterns of fish diversity and abundance within estuaries were related to the proximity of urbanised shorelines, with most fish groups aggregating near armoured shorelines. These effects of distance from urbanised shorelines were, however, modified by the degree to which the entire estuary had been modified. We show that the ecological effects of urbanisation can extend across estuaries and suggest that coastal landscapes should therefore be managed as interlinked mosaics of both natural and artificial habitats

TI  - Diversity and drivers of plant species on Turkish university campuses
PY  - 2019
AB  - The biodiversity of urban areas is strongly affected by anthropogenic impacts, with implications for ecosystem functions and human well-being. Plant diversity can be variable and exceptionally high across urban areas. This study aimed to determine the drivers of variation in plant species richness across university campuses in Turkey. I compiled published and unpublished floristic data from 33 Turkish university campuses. Explanatory data for each campus was collected, including campus area, campus age, climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) and topography. I investigated drivers of richness patterns for total species, cultured (planted) and endemic species, analysing the data using multiple linear regression. Relative variation importance analysis (RVI) was conducted to test the importance of each variable for all significant regression models. I found that Turkish universities had remarkable plant diversity. Total species richness was driven by campus area while planted species richness was driven by campus age, and endemic species richness was driven by elevation and area. Turkish universities house valuable plant reserves that can be used for educational purposes as well as biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Corporately Owned Plants need Space: An Analysis on Plant Biodiversity in Toronto's Privately-owned Publicly Accessible Spaces
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Urban plant biodiversity is a growing ecological concern for city planners and ecologists. While parks are serviced by the public sector, and yards are pruned by the private citizen, a growing proportion of urban green space is managed by corporations. Despite biodiversity targets set by city councils and public committees, actual plant surveys have not been performed. Employing coordinate data of Privately-Owned Publicly-accessible Spaces (POPS) from the City of Toronto, we sampled plant species richness in nine corporately-managed green spaces. Using linear mixed-effect models, we compared richness with various green space characteristics and found that site area is an important predictor. Our results concur with prior studies showing that habitat area may cause significant impacts to urbanized plant biodiversity.</jats:p>

TI  - Challenging assumptions about burial ground biodiversity using flying beetles as indicators in urban areas
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Biodiversity is fundamental to the provision of ecosystem services that benefit urban communities, yet one type of green space is largely overlooked in ecological research and local governance: urban burial grounds. Their longevity, profound importance to society, and ubiquitous nature, provide unique opportunities for urban biodiversity. However, there has been little scientific exploration of their potentials. To quantify biodiversity in urban burial grounds, a low impact methodology for the capture of flying beetles was developed and deployed at 20 sites in southern England. To the authors’ knowledge this work represents the largest sampling of burial grounds in a single study. We used Generalized linear Mixed Models to examine the influence of weather, local demographic variables, urban landscape and burial ground vegetation management on the abundance of flying beetles. We found significant variability in beetle assemblages over time and between burial grounds. Burial ground age was not significantly associated with flying beetle abundance, challenging long-standing assumptions about older burial grounds being more valuable for biodiversity. Increasing area of domestic gardens and hedgerows in the surrounding urban landscape was positively associated with beetle abundance, whereas the most significant negative association was with burial ground size. Additionally, management of burial grounds significantly influenced beetle abundance: more stringent regimes typically resulted in lower abundance, but sites with horticultural landscaping or biodiversity-focused regimes exhibited higher abundances.</jats:p>

TI  - Urbanisation supplements ecosystem functioning in disturbed estuaries
PY  - 2018
AB  - Humans have urbanised and fragmented landscapes across the globe, with detrimental impacts to biodiversity, habitats and food webs in most biomes. Urbanisation might also modify the provision of ecological functions, but these putative effects of landscape transformation are rarely measured. Coastal cities are typically located near estuaries, and we tested for potential impacts of these on ecological functions. Our study used 22 estuaries in eastern Australia as model systems to examine how urbanisation shapes the consumption of carrion by fish, a pivotal ecological function in estuaries. Fish assemblages varied among estuaries according to the extent of shoreline hardening, and this was correlated with changes in the rate of carrion consumption. In estuaries with low levels of shoreline hardening and abundant remnant mangroves, most carrion was consumed by toadfishes (Tetraodontidae). By contrast, in moderately urban estuaries (i.e. where 20‐60% of shorelines had been hardened with artificial structures) yellowfin bream (Sparidae) replaced toadfish and performed the bulk of the scavenging function. Bream are particularly effective scavengers that utilize artificial structures as habitat for both foraging and sheltering. We show that by augmenting habitat for an important species of scavenger, the moderate addition of urban structures to estuarine shorelines also helped to supplement a key ecological function in estuaries. Urbanisation impacts diversity in all ecosystems, but many opportunistic species flourish in urban habitats. Identifying and conserving taxa that perform important roles in urban environments is now a critical conservation challenge for maintaining ecological functions across disturbed landscapes.; Related dataset: http://dx.doi.org/10.4227/39/5af10f130304a

TI  - Urban aliens and threatened near-naturals: Land-cover affects the species richness of alien- and threatened species in an urban-rural setting.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanisation has strong effects on biodiversity patterns, but impacts vary among species groups and across spatial scales. From a local biodiversity management perspective, a more general understanding of species richness across taxonomic groups is required. This study aims to investigate how fine-scale land-cover variables influence species richness patterns of locally threatened and alien species. The study was performed in Trondheim, Norway, covering a steep urbanisation gradient. Spatially correlated Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Models predicting the number of all-, threatened-and alien species by taxon, habitat, habitat heterogeneity and mean aspect within 500 m×500 m grid cells were constructed. The habitat categories were based on detailed land-cover maps. The highest number of threatened species was found in habitats relatively less affected by humans, whereas the number of alien species were only dependent on taxonomic group and spatial correlation. It is shown that land-cover variables within an administrative border can be used to make predictions on species richness within overarching species groups. Recommendations to biodiversity management agencies are to ensure protection of natural habitats to favour locally threatened species, and closely monitor urban areas to mitigate the introduction and spread of alien species.

TI  - Improving Research Towards Conservation Objectives
PY  - 2017
AB  - In the last three decades urban bird ecology has experienced a remarkable advance as demonstrated by the rich variety of chapters included in this volume. Nevertheless, there are some research gaps which we try to identify in this chapter, including some issues in current research that to us seem especially pressing. We conclude that a critical examination of bird census techniques in urban areas, an integration of patterns and processes across different spatial scales, the incorporation of temporal dynamics, a more widespread use of experimental or pseudo-experimental design and a deeper insight on sociological and cultural issues are key issues to refine our understanding of the causal connection between urbanisation and bird fauna parameters. Such improvement could help us to shape urban design and management strategies for bird fauna conservation in cities and in the surrounding landscape.

TI  - SuDS and amphibians - are constructed wetlands really benefitting nature and people?
PY  - 2018
AB  - While urbanisation is a major threat to global biodiversity, it also brings opportunities for some species. Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) have been installed in all Scottish cities to reduce flood and pollution risk and they can also offer new habitats for wildlife. We studied SuDS in Inverness and the Scottish Central Belt to assess their value as amphibian breeding sites, habitats, and as places where urban people can experience nature. The nine-year study revealed that many SuDS were of similar ecological quality to wider countryside ponds but that the quality of ponds is not equitably distributed between neighbourhoods inhabited by different socio-economic classes. However, the findings suggest ways to improve the design and management of SuDS for people and nature, making access to high quality ponds available to all social groups.

TI  - Life in the fast lane: roadkill risk along an urban–rural gradient
PY  - 2021
AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions are a major cause of mortality in animal populations and can cause significant population-level effects. Urban areas are typically associated with higher road densities and unique wildlife communities in comparison to rural areas, and therefore have the potential to be associated with high numbers of collisions, and roadkill risk. Here, we use a citizen science database of wildlife roadkill and species distribution models to assess how roadkill risk (probability of roadkill observation per km2) varied along an urban–rural gradient for British wildlife. Roadkill risk was positively associated with road density, until around 5000 m/km2, a value representing villages or the outskirts of towns and cities. Beyond 5000 m/km2, risk remained high for some species (hedgehog, fox, pigeons and gulls) but reduced for other species (badger, rabbit, pheasant). Roadkill risk was a function of live species distribution for badger, hedgehog and rabbit, with significant overlap between spatial patterns of roadkill risk and the species’ live distribution. This was not the case for fox, pheasant, pigeons and gulls. Fox roadkill risk was underrepresented in rural areas, possibly due to low road density, while pheasant risk was overrepresented. For pigeons and gulls—well-known urban exploiters—roadkill risk was overrepresented in urban areas given their live distributions, possibly due to risks associated with foraging, particularly roadkill scavenging by gulls. Our results highlight the dangers of the UK’s dense road networks to wildlife, even to species considered adapted to urban environments and human disturbance.

TI  - Biodiversity in the City: Fundamental Questions for Understanding the Ecology of Urban Green Spaces for Biodiversity Conservation
PY  - 2017
AB  - As urban areas expand, understanding how ecological processes function in cities has become increasingly important for conserving biodiversity. Urban green spaces are critical habitats to support biodiversity, but we still have a limited understanding of their ecology and how they function to conserve biodiversity at local and landscape scales across multiple taxa. Given this limited view, we discuss five key questions that need to be addressed to advance the ecology of urban green spaces for biodiversity conservation and restoration. Specifically, we discuss the need for research to understand how green space size, connectedness, and type influence the community, population, and life-history dynamics of multiple taxa in cities. A research framework based in landscape and metapopulation ecology will allow for a greater understanding of the ecological function of green spaces and thus allow for planning and management of green spaces to conserve biodiversity and aid in restoration activities.

TI  - Development of spontaneous vegetation on reclaimed land in Singapore measured by NDVI.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Population and economic growth in Asia has led to increased urbanisation. Urbanisation has many detrimental impacts on ecosystems, especially when expansion is unplanned. Singapore is a city-state that has grown rapidly since independence, both in population and land area. However, Singapore aims to develop as a 'City in Nature', and urban greenery is integral to the landscape. While clearing some areas of forest for urban sprawl, Singapore has also reclaimed land from the sea to expand its coastline. Reclaimed land is usually designated for future urban development, but must first be left for many years to stabilise. During the period of stabilisation, pioneer plant species establish, growing into novel forest communities. The rate of this spontaneous vegetation development has not been quantified. This study tracks the temporal trends of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as a proxy of vegetation maturity, on reclaimed land sensed using LANDSAT images. Google Earth Engine was used to mosaic cloud-free annual LANDSAT images of Singapore from 1988 to 2015. Singapore's median NDVI increased by 0.15 from 0.47 to 0.62 over the study period, while its land area grew by 71 km2. Five reclaimed sites with spontaneous vegetation development showed variable vegetation covers, ranging from 6% to 43% vegetated cover in 2015. On average, spontaneous vegetation takes 16.9 years to develop to a maturity of 0.7 NDVI, but this development is not linear and follows a quadratic trajectory. Patches of spontaneous vegetation on isolated reclaimed lands are unlikely to remain forever since they are in areas slated for future development. In the years that these patches exist, they have potential to increase urban greenery, support biodiversity, and provide a host of ecosystem services. With this knowledge on spontaneous vegetation development trajectories, urban planners can harness the resource when planning future developments.

TI  - Intentional disruption of path-dependencies in the Anthropocene: Gray versus green water infrastructure regimes in Mexico City, Mexico
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Cities are urged to promote green infrastructures to reduce their global environmental impacts, while simultaneously adapting to the global climatic variability that such impacts generate. Human Niche Construction theory, however, predicts evolutionary pressures acting over social groups that, this paper contends, tend to favor gray over green infrastructure. This conflict is due to competitive advantages of gray infrastructure, such as their higher capacity to concentrate and intensively use natural resources. Cities need to intentionally override these evolutionary pressures to allow emergence of regimes where green solutions are the normal way of responding to infrastructure-related challenges and development. The override calls for understanding how infrastructure regime dynamics are historically constructed, and cultivating collective intentions capable of harnessing such dynamics. After conceptualizing the roles of evolution versus collective intentionality in infrastructure regime dynamics, we apply Foucauldian genealogical analysis to critically understand how and why the superiority of gray infrastructure became naturalized as truth in Mexico City, Mexico. The analysis explores how gray infrastructure momentum was built over history and the sporadic emergence of collective intentions to break it. Findings show that shifting to a green- infrastructure-dominated regime in Mexico City today would benefit from strategies that simultaneously promote technical, political and subjective changes. Purely technical efforts to promote regime shifts are doomed to fail. Decentralization, democratization, and cultivating certain collective intentions are key factors to override evolutionary pressures. In the context of the anthropocene and growing recognition of the importance of artificially created environments, we remphasize subjectivity and intentionality.

TI  - Temporally Separated Data Sets Reveal Similar Traits of Birds Persisting in a United States Megacity
PY  - 2020
AB  - We present an analysis of life history and behavioral traits associated with urbanization for 53 breeding bird species on 173 survey blocks in the Los Angeles area of southern California, USA, across two time periods, 1995–99 and 2012–16. We used observational data from two community science efforts and an estimate of urban land cover in each block to develop an index of urban association, and then modeled the relationship between species occurrence and eight traits likely associated with urban tolerance. We found two traits to be significantly associated with urbanization in both eras: Structure-nesting (i.e., the tendency to build nests on human-built structures) was positively associated, and cavity-nesting (i.e., the tendency to build nests in natural tree cavities) was negatively associated. Our analysis provides a template for mining historical community science data, and for “retrofitting” contemporary data to gain insights into ecological trends over time, and illustrates the persistence of ecological traits of species associated with urban areas even as the makeup of these species communities may change.

TI  - Detecting the Complex Relationships and Driving Mechanisms of Key Ecosystem Services in the Central Urban Area Chongqing Municipality, China
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) are highly vulnerable to human activities. Understanding the relationships among multiple ESs and driving mechanisms are crucial for multi-objective management in complex social-ecological systems. The goals of this study are to quantitatively evaluate and identify ESs hotspots, explore the relationships among ESs and elucidate the driving mechanisms. Taking central urban area Chongqing municipality as the study area, biodiversity (BI), carbon fixation (CF), soil conservation (SC) and water conservation (WC) were evaluated based on the InVEST model and ESs hotspots were identified. The complex interactions among multiple ESs were determined by utilizing multiple methods: spearman correlation analysis, bivariate local spatial autocorrelation and K-means clustering. The linear or nonlinear relationships between ESs and drivers were discussed by generalized additive models (GAMs). The results showed that during 2000–2018, except for CF that exhibited no obvious change, all other ESs showed a decrease tendency. High ESs were clustered in mountains, while ESs in urban areas were lowest. At administrative districts scale, ESs were relatively higher in Beibei, Banan and Yubei, and drastically decreased in Jiangbei. Multiple ES hotspots demonstrated clear spatial heterogeneity, which were mainly composed of forestland and distributed in mountainous areas with high altitude and steep slope. The relationships between ES pairs were synergistic at the entire scale. However, at grid scale, the synergies were mainly concentrated in the high-high and low-low clusters, i.e., mountainous areas and urban central areas. Five ESs bundles presented the interactions among multiple ESs, which showed well correspondence with social-ecological conditions. GAMs indicated that forestland and grassland had positive impact on BI and CF. Additionally, SC was mainly determined by geomorphological factors, while WC were mainly influenced by precipitation. Furthermore, policy factors were confirmed to have a certain positive effect on ESs. This study provides credible references for ecosystem management and urban planning.

TI  - Modification of the third phase in the framework for vertebrate species persistence in urban mosaic environments
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation is rapidly transforming natural landscapes with consequences for biodiversity. Little is documented on the response of African wildlife to urbanisation. We reviewed case studies of vertebrate species' responses to urbanisation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to determine trends. Connected habitat mosaics of natural and anthropogenic green spaces are critical for urban wildlife persistence. We present a novel modification to the final of three phases of the framework described by Evans et al. (2010), which documents this sequence for vertebrate species persistence, based on the perspective of our research. Species in suburbia exhibit an initial phase where behavioural and ecological flexibility, life-history traits and phenotypic plasticity either contribute to their success, or they stay at low numbers. Where successful, the next phase is a rapid increase in populations and distribution; anthropogenic food resources and alternate breeding sites are effectively exploited. The modified third phase either continues to spread, plateau or decline.

TI  - Links between ecological and human wealth in drainage ponds in a fast-expanding city, and proposals for design and management
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) are engineering solutions for managing storm water, and they can also provide blue spaces that equitably benefit the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers. The main objectives of this study were to test whether affluent neighbourhoods have SuDS with better ecological quality in one of Europe’s fastest developing cities, and to investigate whether designable or manageable habitat characteristics of the SuDS, and the adjacent terrestrial area, are related to ecological quality. We estimated SuDS ecological quality by dimension reduction of five biotic and abiotic ecosystem components through performing a Principal Coordinate Analysis. Then we regressed SuDS ecological quality against socio-economic descriptors of the neighbourhood. We next applied non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests and probabilistic co-occurrence analysis to assess associations between habitat characteristics and ecological quality of SuDS. Our data showed that more affluent neighbourhoods have SuDS of higher ecological quality. We identified thresholds for some easily designable and manageable habitat characteristics of SuDS clearly linked to their ecological quality. There was strong co-occurrence of habitat characteristics, with aggregation of features linked to poor and good ecological quality, in SuDS designed as detention basins/swales or ponds respectively. Our results can be applied to the design and management of SuDS to foster good ecological quality irrespective of the neighbourhood. This study will be valuable for building and managing SuDS in a nature-based way, thus providing more socially equitable access to high-quality urban blue space.

TI  - Assessment of Rain Garden Effects for the Management of Urban Storm Runoff in Japan
PY  - 2020
AB  - Storm runoff is a growing concern against a background of increasing urban densification, land-use adaptation and climate change. In this study, a storm water management model was used to analyze the hydrological and water-quality effects of rain gardens (also known as bioretention cells) as nonpoint source control solutions in low-impact development (LID) practices for an urban catchment in the Nakagyo Ward area of Kyoto in Japan. The results of simulations with input involving Chicago hyetographs derived for different rainfall return periods (referred to as 3 a, 5 a, 10 a, 30 a, 50 a and 100 a) indicated the effectiveness of this arrangement, in particular for rainstorm 3 a, which exhibited the maximum contaminant reduction ratio (Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 15.50%, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) 16.17%, Total Nitrogen (TN) 17.34%, Total Phosphorus (TP) 19.07%) and a total runoff reduction volume of 46.56 × 106 L. With 5 a, the maximum number of flooding nodes was reduced to 87, demonstrating that rain gardens handle rainfall effectively over a five-year return period. There was a one-minute delay for 100 a, which again indicates that rain gardens support control of urban runoff and mitigate flooding. Such gardens were associated with reduced stormwater hazards and enhanced resistance to short-term rainstorms at the research site, and should be considered for urban planning in Kyoto and other cities all over the world.

TI  - Influence of habitat type and distance from source area on bird taxonomic and functional diversity in a Neotropical megacity
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Neotropical region has been subjected to massive urbanization, which poses high risks for some global biodiversity hotspots and losses of ecosystem functions and services. In this study, we investigate how distance from large patches of native forests (source areas) and vegetation (green)/and infrastructure (gray) characteristics affect bird species richness and functional diversity in Sao Paulo megacity, southeastern Brazil. We analyzed the effects of source areas and green/gray characteristics on species richness and functional diversity (richness, evenness, and divergence) indices. We detected 231 bird species, and our data confirmed our predictions: (1) bird species richness in urbanized habitats was found to be (~ 50–85%) lower than in source habitats; (2) species richness and trait composition significantly decreased as the distance from the source area increased, while functional richness was not affected by this metric; and (3) shrub and herbaceous covers and maximum height of trees were positively correlated with species richness and unique functional traits regarding habitat, diet, foraging and nesting strata and dispersal ability of birds in the forest-urban matrix. The number of buildings was negatively correlated with bird species richness and functional richness. Maximum height of buildings caused dramatic declines in functional evenness. Functional divergence was notably lower in sites with high shrub cover. Our study stresses the complexity of vegetation embedded in large Neotropical urban settlements and the need to maintain large protected areas surrounding megacities to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on birds.

TI  - Urban green roofs promote metropolitan biodiversity: A comparative case study
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract Urban green spaces can provide habitat and resources for urban dwelling fauna. Suburban green spaces occur most commonly as parks and roadside vegetation, but as human populations grow and space in cities becomes increasingly limited, space-efficient green solutions like green roofs and walls in metropolitan areas are becoming increasingly common. However, the efficacy of these forms of green infrastructure in attracting and promoting biodiversity remains limited. To address this, we compared arthropod, gastropod, and avian species richness and diversity between green and conventional roofs on neighbouring and identical buildings in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. By monitoring local biodiversity using motion sensing camera traps and regular insect surveys, we found that the green roof supported four times the avian, over seven times the arthropod, and twice the gastropod diversity of the conventional roof. Only the green roof attracted locally rare species including blue banded bees (Amegilla Cingulata) and metallic shield bugs (Scutiphora pedicellata). Our results suggest that green roofs, like other urban green spaces, can have ecological significance by attracting and supporting urban fauna that may then add important functional capacities to previously depauperate spaces. This study demonstrates the potential for the widespread adoption of green roofs to create more biologically diverse cities.

TI  - Sonic Tomograph as a Tool Supporting the Sustainable Management of Historical Greenery of the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin
PY  - 2021
AB  - The mission of botanical gardens is to work towards the conservation and sustainable use of plant diversity. In the case of gardens established on the premises of former manor estates, actions are also being taken to properly manage existing natural resources, e.g., historic tree stands. This article is based on the case study of the Botanical Garden in Lublin. To assess the health condition of the trees growing in the oldest part of the park—Kościuszko Redoubt—sonic tomography examinations were performed. The article presents the practical application of a newer form of digital imaging, put to the service of assessing the health of old trees in an important public space. The Redoubt is the only work of defense architecture in Poland related to the activity of General Tadeusz Kościuszko, the hero of Poland and the United States of America. It has survived in an excellent condition, preserved without significant changes, as an earth structure with ramparts; an interior, i.e., a yard; a cannon post located on an inaccessible cliff; and a brick basement serving as a shelter for soldiers and a warehouse. The entire surroundings also survived: ravines masked with a wild green, embankments with a safe hidden access road to the Redoubt, and a shaped defense line. The Botanical Garden area is located in the Slawinek district, in the valley of the Czechowka River, and includes a fragment of it and the slope adjacent to the west, cut by three loess ravines. The Botanical Garden was established in 1965, where there was a manor farm earlier, and then in the 19th century, a spa that was destroyed during World War I and II. Good soils and a varied microclimate provide the right ecological conditions for the high biodiversity of plants. With an area of 21.15 ha, the Garden area has the character of a landscape park with the theme of a manor garden from the turn of the 18th/19th century and a spa garden. The primary purpose of the work was to investigate the effectiveness of the use of computer tools in the sustainable management of historical greenery in the Botanical Garden. Research has shown that diagnostics with the use of sound waves allow for an accurate diagnosis and quick protective measures against the tree, improving the safety of visitors to the botanical garden. Moreover, the obtained results and a historical query were used to prepare an application to recognize Redoubt as a monument.

TI  - Bats and the city : urban bat biodiversity in a tropical biome transition zone
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanisation is an important factor in global land-use change which dramatically alters habitats at great detriment to wildlife. Our understanding of urban biodiversity patterns and their driving factors in tropical cities which interact with high levels of biodiversity is limited, yet it is pivotal to developing efficient and effective conservation guidelines for urban planning. This study uses a long-term data set (>10 years) of species occurrence records, collected as part of a public health monitoring scheme within the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil to quantify the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of bats in the city for each year and season of the study period. Linear regressions were then carried out to test whether the different facets of diversity show any significant trends over the study period. Moreover, a habitat suitability analysis for the five most common species was conducted using the MaxEnt algorithm, following the framework of Bellamy et al. (2013), and the most important factors affecting the presence of these species were identified. It was found that there was a significant increase in bat taxonomic diversity over time, however, functional and phylogenetic diversity remained unchanged over the period of 2004-2014. Maps of habitat suitability were produced for each focal species. Human population density and distance to natural resources, such as water and forest bodies, were important variables for all species modelled. The information gained from this study can be used to aid the development of effective bat conservation strategies and guidelines within the urban environments of southern Brazil.

TI  - Valuing the Role of Time in Urban Ecology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Author(s): Ossola, A; Cadenasso, ML; Meineke, EK | Abstract: Cities and towns are complex ecosystems with features that can vary dramatically in space and time. Our knowledge of the spatial structure of urban land and ecological systems is expanding. These systems have been investigated across spatial scales, urban to rural gradients, networks of urban macrosystems, and global megalopolises. However, the temporal dimensions of urban ecosystems – such as those related to ecological cycles and historical legacies – are far less understood and investigated. Here, we outline the main dimensions of time that can shape how events in urban ecosystems unfold, which we categorize as: (i) time flows and duration, (ii) synchrony, lags, and delays, (iii) trends and transitions, (iv) cycles and hysteresis, (v) legacies and priming, (vi) temporal hotspots and hot moments, and (vii) stochastic vs. deterministic processes affecting our ability to forecast the future of cities and the species that live in them. First, we demonstrate the roles of these understudied dimensions by discussing exemplary studies. We then propose key future research directions for investigating how processes over time may regulate the structure and functioning of urban land and biodiversity, as well as its effects on and implications for urban ecology. Our analysis and conceptual framework highlights that several temporal dimensions of urban ecosystems – like those related to temporal hotspots/moments and stochastic vs. deterministic processes – are understudied. This offers important research opportunities to further urban ecology and a comprehensive research agenda valuing the “Urban Chronos” – the change of urban ecosystems through time.

TI  - Heterogeneous urban green areas are bird diversity hotspots: insights using continental-scale citizen science data
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization fragments and destroys natural landscapes, generally decreasing bird diversity. While in some cases bird diversity continuously decreases in response to urbanization, in others a non-linear response is evident, with peak bird diversity observed at intermediate levels of urbanization. But many studies previously investigating this pattern are spatially or temporally constrained. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of urbanization on bird diversity, stratified to native and exotic species. We specifically investigated the differences in bird diversity between natural and urban green areas. We used eBird citizen science data (> 4,000,000 bird-survey lists) and remotely-sensed landcover data, throughout the contiguous United States of America. We found a non-linear response to urbanization for both species richness and Shannon diversity. There was distinctly greater bird richness and Shannon diversity in urban green areas compared to natural green areas. Our observed response is likely explained by an increase in habitat heterogeneity of urban green areas compared with natural green areas. Our work highlights the importance of diverse urban green areas for supporting bird diversity in urban areas. We recommend that urban planning should focus on maintaining high habitat heterogeneity in urban green areas to promote greater bird diversity.

TI  - Urban tree composition is associated with breeding success of a passerine bird, but effects vary within and between years
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Birds breeding in urban environments have lower reproductive output compared to rural conspecifics, most likely because of food limitation. However, which characteristics of urban environments may cause this deficiency is not clear. Here, we investigated how tree composition within urban territories of passerine birds is associated with breeding probability and reproductive success. We used seven years of data of breeding occupancy for blue and great tits (<jats:italic>Cyanistes caeruleus; Parus major</jats:italic>) and several reproductive traits for great tits, from 400 urban nest boxes located in five parks within the city of Malmö, Sweden. We found that tits, overall, were less likely to breed in territories dominated by either non-native trees or beech trees. Great tit chicks reared in territories dominated by non-native trees weighed significantly less, compared to territories with fewer non-native trees. An earlier onset of breeding correlated with increased chick weight in great tits. Increasing number of common oak trees (<jats:italic>Quercus robur</jats:italic>) was associated with delayed onset of breeding in great tits. Notably, as offspring survival probability generally increased by breeding earlier, in particular in oak-dominated territories, our results suggest that delayed onset of breeding induced by oak trees may be maladaptive and indicate a mis-match to this food source. Our results demonstrate that tree composition may have important consequences on breeding success of urban birds, but some of these effects are not consistent between years, highlighting the need to account for temporal effects to understand determinants of breeding success and inform optimal management in urban green spaces.</jats:p>

TI  - Social-Ecological Connectivity in Global South Cities
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cities are designed and built to be inhabited by humans, and therefore rely on connectivity to ensure the flow of services, movement, communication and agency for people as well as the flow of benefits or services from nature to people. In this chapter, we focus on the connectivity between the social and ecological components that urban systems are comprised of. We describe the social fabric as the social connection, how people connect with people, which is particularly relevant to the Global South, given the high density of people and rapid population growth in urban centres. People are also impacted by their surrounding environment which forms the focus of the second component where we look at the relationship between people and nature. This social-ecological connection represents natures’ contribution to people, or the provision of ecosystem services. The long-term sustainable use of these ecosystem benefits can only be ensured through the protection of nature, which relies on establishing ecological connectivity, connecting nature with nature. The relationships between these elements result in an emergent outcome which we understand as the city. Influencing the city therefore requires understanding these social and ecological components and how to ensure connectivity.

TI  - The relative importance of aquatic and terrestrial variables for frogs in an urbanizing landscape: Key insights for sustainable urban development
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Globally, urbanization threatens ∼950 amphibian species with extinction. Yet a lack of knowledge on the factors influencing common and infrequently encountered species in landscapes that are under increasing pressure from urban development is limiting effective conservation. We examined the relative importance of aquatic variables (pond) and terrestrial variables (at three spatial scales: 10 m, 100 m and 1 km), for commonly and infrequently encountered frogs in an urbanizing forested landscape in southeastern Australia. Species richness and the occurrence of four common species were influenced by the aquatic environment (water body size, aquatic vegetation). Species richness also decreased with increasing urbanization within 1 km. This trend was driven by a strong decrease in richness of infrequently encountered species with increasing road length within 1 km from breeding ponds. Richness of infrequently encountered species also decreased with a reduction in forest cover within 10 m to 1 km from breeding ponds. Our findings suggest that frog conservation in urbanizing landscapes requires a mix of strategies across different spatial scales. Maintaining or re-establishing common frogs in urbanizing forested landscapes is likely to be achieved by providing ponds with suitable habitat. However, to conserve several frog species that are sensitive to forest loss and urbanization, breeding habitats need to be maintained within a network of large forest reserves.

TI  - Biodiversity and Health: Implications for Conservation
PY  - 2019
AB  - The human health and well-being benefits of contact with nature are becoming increasingly recognised and well understood, yet the implications of nature experiences for biodiversity conservation are far less clear. Theoretically, there are two plausible pathways that could lead to positive conservation outcomes. The first is a direct win-win scenario where biodiverse areas of high conservation value are also disproportionately beneficial to human health and well-being, meaning that the two sets of objectives can be simultaneously and directly achieved, as long as such green spaces are safeguarded appropriately. The second is that experiencing nature can stimulate people’s interest in biodiversity, concern for its fate, and willingness to take action to protect it, therefore generating conservation gains indirectly. To date, the two pathways have rarely been distinguished and scarcely studied. Here we consider how they may potentially operate in practice, while acknowledging that the mechanisms by which biodiversity might underpin human health and well-being benefits are still being determined.

TI  - No overall effect of urbanization on nest-dwelling arthropods of great tits (Parus major).
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has been shown to strongly affect community composition of various taxa with potentially strong shifts in ecological interactions, including those between hosts and parasites. We investigated the effect of urbanization on the composition of arthropods in nests of great tits in Flanders, Belgium. These nests contain taxonomically and functionally diverse arthropod communities including parasites, predators, detritivores and accidental commensals. Using a standardized hierarchical sampling design with subplots (200 m × 200 m) nested in plots (3 km × 3 km) of varying urbanization levels, we collected arthropods from nests of resident great tits after the young had fledged. Arthropods were extracted, identified to Primary Taxonomical Groups (PTG) and counted. Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) we found diverging effects of urbanization on PTG occurrences and abundances at various levels, but we did not find an overall signal in arthropod diversity or richness. Also, visual inspection of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots did not reveal any community differences between urbanization levels at plot or subplot scales. Land use and environmental variables at different distances around nestboxes did not contribute much to the variation between communities. Our results indicate that arthropod nestbox communities are generally not adversely affected by urbanization, and even city gardens and parks harbor comparable communities to forests and suburban areas. We thus found no evidence for a parasite release effect due to urbanization, nor an increased risk of parasitism in human-dominated environments.

TI  - Identification of habitat controls on northern red-legged frog populations: implications for habitat conservation on an urbanizing landscape in the Pacific Northwest
PY  - 2017
AB  - In the Pacific Northwest of North America, research addressing lentic-breeding amphibian population vulnerability has emphasized aquatic habitats, frequently neglecting terrestrial habitats. Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance. Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance. Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales.

TI  - Assemblages and seasonal patterns in butterflies across different ecosystems in a sub-tropical zone of Jammu Shiwaliks, Jammu and Kashmir, India
PY  - 2021
AB  - The present study was aimed to understand the community structure and functionality of butterflies in three different sub-tropical ecosystems concerning the habitat types and seasonality. We sampled the butterflies for their abundance, diversity and host plant specificity from 21 linear transects placed in a stratified random manner in heterogeneous mosaic landscapes, urban green spaces and natural forests from April to December 2018. Overall, 6384 individuals of 118 butterfly species in 81 genera, six families and 20 subfamilies were observed. Our results indicated that the land cover type and the seasonal variability had a pronounced influence on the species richness, abundance, diversity and similarity across different sites with significantly higher values recorded for mosaic landscapes during the wet season. In contrast, the urban built-up site was more speciose with higher abundance than natural forests. Each system harboured unique species assemblages with high similarity among the sites as well as seasons. Presence of protected and habitat exclusive species substantiate a high conservation value of these habitats especially the urban green spaces, and thus, calls for effective management strategies for the conservation and proliferation of butterflies in sub-tropical areas of Jammu region.

TI  - Indigenous plants promote insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The contribution of urban greenspaces to support biodiversity and provide benefits for people is increasingly recognised. However, ongoing management practices still favour (1) vegetation oversimplification, often limiting greenspaces to lawns and tree canopy rather than multi-layered vegetation that includes under and midstorey; and (2) the use of nonnative plant species. These practices likely hinder the potential of greenspaces to sustain indigenous biodiversity, particularly for taxa like insects, that rely on plants for food and habitat. Yet, little is known about which plant species may maximise positive outcomes for taxonomically and functionally diverse insect communities in urban greenspaces. Additionally, while urban environments are expected to experience high rates of introductions, quantitative assessments of the relative occupancy of indigenous vs. introduced insect species in greenspace are rare – hindering understanding of how greenspace management may promote indigenous biodiversity while limiting the establishment of introduced insects. Using a hierarchically replicated study design across 15 public parks, we recorded occurrence data from 552 insect species on 133 plant species – differing in planting design element (lawn, midstorey and tree canopy), midstorey growth form (forbs, lilioids, graminoids and shrubs) and origin (nonnative, native and indigenous) – to assess: (1) the relative contributions of indigenous and introduced insect species and (2) which plant species sustained the highest number of indigenous insects. Our data indicates that the insect community was predominately composed of indigenous rather than introduced species. Our findings further highlight the core role of multi-layered vegetation in sustaining high insect biodiversity in urban areas, with indigenous midstorey and canopy representing key elements to maintain rich and functionally diverse indigenous insect communities. Intriguingly, graminoids supported the highest indigenous insect richness across all studied growth forms by plant origin groups. Taken together, our study emphasise the opportunity posed by indigenous understory and midstorey plants, particularly indigenous graminoids in our study area, to promote indigenous insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces. Our work provides a blueprint and stimulus for built-environment professionals to incorporate into their practice plant species palettes that foster a larger presence of indigenous over regionally native or nonnative plant species, whilst incorporating a broader mixture of midstorey growth forms.

TI  - A framework for understanding how biodiversity patterns unfold across multiple spatial scales in urban ecosystems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Whether cities are more or less diverse than surrounding environments, and the extent to which non-native species in cities impact regional species pools, remain two fundamental yet unanswered questions in urban ecology. Here we offer a unifying framework for understanding the mechanisms that generate biodiversity patterns across taxonomic groups and spatial scales in urban systems. One commonality between existing frameworks is the collective recognition that species co-occurrence locally is not simply a function of natural colonization and extinction processes. Instead, it is largely a consequence of human actions that are governed by a myriad of social processes occurring across groups, institutions, and stakeholders. Rather than challenging these frameworks, we expand upon them to explicitly consider how human and non-human mechanisms interact to control urban biodiversity and influence species composition over space and time. We present a comprehensive theory of the processes that drive biodiversity within cities, between cities and surrounding non-urbanized areas and across cities, using the general perspective of metacommunity ecology. Armed with this approach, we embrace the fact that humans substantially influence beta-diversity by creating a variety of different habitats in urban areas, and by influencing dispersal processes and rates, and suggest ways how these influences can be accommodated to existing metacommunity paradigms. Since patterns in urban biodiversity have been extensively described at the local or regional scale, we argue that the basic premises of the theory can be validated by studying the beta-diversity across spatial scales within and across urban areas. By explicitly integrating the myriad of processes that drive native and non-native urban species co-occurrence, the proposed theory not only helps reconcile contrasting views on whether urban ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots or biodiversity sinks, but also provides a mechanistic understanding to better predict when and why alternative biodiversity patterns might emerge.

TI  - How to build a biodiverse city: environmental determinants of bird diversity within and among 1581 cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Cities are novel environments compared with the evolutionary history of the species that reside within them. Collectively, cities and their fauna can be thought of as ecosystems, recognized as playing a critical role in supporting global biodiversity, but they are fundamentally a combination of ‘old species’ surviving or thriving in a new environment. We aimed to understand—at a broad macroecological scale—how biodiversity responds to urban ecosystems both among and within cities. We integrated > 5 million eBird citizen science observations with remotely sensed landcover products throughout 1581 cities within the continental United States. We first investigated the species-area relationship as it pertains to cities and compared the slope of this relationship to randomly sampled polygons (i.e., among cities). Second, we investigated how biodiversity responds to an urbanization gradient at the level of localized bird observations (i.e., within cities). We found strong support for the longstanding species-area relationship: geographically larger cities had greater species richness. Surprisingly, the species-area relationship was stronger (i.e., steeper slope) in cities when compared to the species-area relationship for randomly sampled polygons in the study region. Our findings suggest that diverse and heterogeneous cities play a significant role in supporting biodiversity. But we also found that there is a consistent threshold where the level of urbanization begins to profoundly and negatively affect biodiversity. Critically, urban planning at the city-scale and at a local-scale (e.g., neighborhood) should focus on preserving attributes of water-cover and tree-cover for increased biodiversity to keep as much of the city as possible above this threshold value.

TI  - The Need for an Urban Ecology of the Global South
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban ecology is a key discipline in guiding urban development, sustainability and consequently human wellbeing. However, most urban ecological research has, and continues to be, undertaken in the Global North, and thus urban ecological methods, principles and frameworks are dominated by contributions and understandings from the Global North. However, there are a multitude of local- and national-scale contextual differences between the Global North and the Global South that limit or question the universal application of Global North perspectives and knowledge. This chapter lays the foundation for the rest of the book in two ways. First, it explores the development and definitions of the terms ‘urban ecology’ and ‘Global South’. Second, it presents the major biophysical and socio-economic contextual characteristics of Global South towns and cities that differentiate them from those in the Global North. These contextual differences need to be accounted for in urban ecological research, theory and application towards the development of an urban ecology that is more relevant for the Global South, and when conjoined with understandings from the Global North allow for the exploration and development of truly universal urban ecology principles and frameworks.

TI  - Urban Animal Diversity in the Global South
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban animal ecology is a rapidly growing research area, yielding fascinating insights into the patterns and processes that shape biodiversity in the city. However, much of this research has focused on cities in the developed world, where the mechanisms affecting biodiversity might be very different to those in the developing cities of the Global South. Here we detail how the contemporary cities of the Global South diverge from their Global North counterparts and explain how several key differences in pattern can have important consequences for urban animal diversity and ultimately ecological function and ecosystem services. Our focus in this chapter is on several key taxonomic groups, including, birds, mammals, herpetofauna and invertebrates, and incorporates a case study on urban predators, as well as some views on novel insights that can be gained from studying urban animal diversity in the Global South. Additionally, we synthesise the available urban animal diversity research from the Global South and explore how varying landscape patterns, distinct abiotic conditions, and vastly different socio-economic contexts can lead to greatly different outcomes for biodiversity in Global South cities.

TI  - Urban trees in the Cities of Matsuyama (Japan) and Yogyakarta (Indonesia): tree species diversity, design, and culture
PY  - 2018
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the diversity and value of the tree species within the urban design of Yogyakarta and Matsuyama. We acquired the data by exploring the urban areas of Matsuyama, mainly main roads, during 2010-2013, while in Yogyakarta between 2015 and 2017. We identified the species of the trees and obtained the cultural value of them by interview. Matsuyama's urban forest has a distinctive vegetation on sakura (Prunus spp.), Japanese pine (Pinus sp.) and camellia (Camellia sp.). It develops urban designs for protecting and maintaining the urban forest i.e. a protective railing, a ring around the base of the stem, and a carpet for moisturizing and protecting. The Japanese pine is depicted as a city emblem, while camellia is visualized on the culvert cover. In Yogyakarta's urban forest, Pterocarpus indicus dominates as a shade tree with Mimusops elengi, Samanea saman, Tamarindus indica, Ficus elasticus, and/or Canarium indicum. Mentaok (Wrightia javanica) as a historical tree has great potential. The urban trees grow in the pots in the median and roadside. Malioboro Street has already built protective fences and rings around the base of the stem. Yogyakarta has also a philosophical axis that symbolized human journey. The axis keeps 8 tree species based on palace guidance.

TI  - Urban tree composition is associated with breeding success of a passerine bird, but effects vary within and between years.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Birds breeding in urban environments have lower reproductive output compared to rural conspecifics, most likely because of food limitation. However, which characteristics of urban environments may cause this deficiency is not clear. Here, we investigated how tree composition within urban territories of passerine birds is associated with breeding probability and reproductive success. We used 7 years of data of breeding occupancy for blue and great tits (Cyanistes caeruleus; Parus major) and several reproductive traits for great tits, from 400 urban nest boxes located in 5 parks within the city of Malmö, Sweden. We found that tits, overall, were less likely to breed in territories dominated by either non-native trees or beech trees. Great tit chicks reared in territories dominated by non-native trees weighed significantly less, compared to territories with fewer non-native trees. An earlier onset of breeding correlated with increased chick weight in great tits. Increasing number of common oak trees (Quercus robur) was associated with delayed onset of breeding in great tits. Notably, as offspring survival probability generally increased by breeding earlier, in particular in oak-dominated territories, our results suggest that delayed onset of breeding induced by oak trees may be maladaptive and indicate a mismatch to this food source. Our results demonstrate that tree composition may have important consequences on breeding success of urban birds, but some of these effects are not consistent between years, highlighting the need to account for temporal effects to understand determinants of breeding success and inform optimal management in urban green spaces.

TI  - Dwarf White Clover Supports Pollinators, Augments Nitrogen in Clover–Turfgrass Lawns, and Suppresses Root-Feeding Grubs in Monoculture but Not in Mixed Swards
PY  - 2021
AB  - The runoff or leaching of nitrogen fertilizers from monoculture turfgrass lawns contri-butes to water pollution, and such lawns are susceptible to insect pests and provide few resources for pollinators. One approach to creating more sustainable lawns is to incorporate white clover (Trifolium repens L.), a nitrogen-fixing legume, into grass seed mixtures or existing turfgrass swards. “Dutch” white clover (DWC), a ubiquitous landrace, forms non-uniform clumps when intermixed with turfgrasses, thus it is often considered to be a lawn weed. Recently, several dwarf varieties of white clover have been selected for their small leaf size and low growth habit, allowing them to tolerate low mowing heights and blend better with grasses. To date, there have been no studies published on the entomological aspects of dwarf clover in pure stands or intermixed with turfgrass. We established field plots with combinations of DWC, two cultivars of dwarf clover, and tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.) in monoculture or mixed swards, and compared the invertebrate communities therein. Predatory arthropods and earthworm numbers were similar in all plot types. The clover monocultures were resistant to white grubs, but the grub densities in the clover–tall fescue dicultures were similar to those found in the pure tall fescue swards. Dwarf clovers and DWC were similarly attractive to bees and supported similar bee assemblages. The tall fescue foliar N content was elevated 17–27% in the dicultures with clovers.

TI  - Global homogenization of the structure and function in the soil microbiome of urban greenspaces
PY  - 2021
AB  - The structure and function of the soil microbiome of urban greenspaces remain largely undetermined. We conducted a global field survey in urban greenspaces and neighboring natural ecosystems across 56 cities from six continents, and found that urban soils are important hotspots for soil bacterial, protist and functional gene diversity, but support highly homogenized microbial communities worldwide. Urban greenspaces had a greater proportion of fast-growing bacteria, algae, amoebae, and fungal pathogens, but a lower proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi than natural ecosystems. These urban ecosystems also showed higher proportions of genes associated with human pathogens, greenhouse gas emissions, faster nutrient cycling, and more intense abiotic stress than natural environments. City affluence, management practices, and climate were fundamental drivers of urban soil communities. Our work paves the way toward a more comprehensive global-scale perspective on urban greenspaces, which is integral to managing the health of these ecosystems and the well-being of human populations.

TI  - Urbanization affects oak–pathogen interactions across spatial scales
PY  - 2021
AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, thereby transforming natural landscapes and changing the abundance and distribution of organisms. However, insights into the effects of urbanization on species interactions, and plant–pathogen interactions in particular, are lacking. We investigated the effects of urbanization on powdery mildew infection on Quercus robur at continental and within-city scales. At the continental scale, we compared infection levels between urban and rural areas of different-sized cities in Europe, and investigated whether plant traits, climatic variables and CO2 emissions mediated the effect of urbanization on infection levels. Within one large city (Stockholm, Sweden), we further explored whether local habitat features and spatial connectivity influenced infection levels during multiple years. At the continental scale, infection severity was consistently higher on trees in urban than rural areas, with some indication that temperature mediated this effect. Within Stockholm city, temperature had no effect, while local accumulation of leaf litter negatively affected powdery mildew incidence in one out of three years, and more connected trees had lower infection levels. This study is the first to describe the effects of urbanization on plant–pathogen interactions both within and among cities, and to uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns at each scale.

TI  - Long-term afforestation efforts increase bird species diversity in Beijing, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Bird communities are important components of biodiversity and provide terrestrial ecosystems with multiple functions. The impact of long-term afforestation and rapid urbanization on bird species diversity (BSD) is of interest and has attracted increasing attention from biologists, government officials and the public. This study focused on patterns of BSD and changes in forest coverage in an Asian mega-city (Beijing). Forest coverage in Beijing increased moderately from 1.3% (in 1949) to 21.26% (in 2003), and rapidly from 21.26% (in 2003) to 41% (in 2014). Natural types of land cover (i.e., woodland, grassland and water) increased from 55.25% (9070.29 km 2 ) in 1985–63.41% (10411.16 km 2 ) in 2013, while anthropogenic types (i.e., cultivated land, construction land and unutilized land) decreased from 44.75% to 36.59% based on remote sensing data. Three sets of BSD records were obtained from the published literature, revealing a species diversity of 344 in 1987, 375 in 1994, and 430 in 2014. Approximately 15% of bird species were endemic and 80% were migratory. From 1987–2014, Beijing gained 81 bird species (37 species disappeared while 118 species appeared), which could be a result of the progressive increase in forest coverage. The changes in BSD may be affected by long-term afforestation efforts and rapid urbanization, along with meteorological factors. This study sheds some light on the effects of afforestation and urbanization on biodiversity.

TI  - Assessing Impacts of Urban Form on Landscape Structure of Urban Green Spaces in China Using Landsat Images Based on Google Earth Engine
PY  - 2018
AB  - The structure of urban green spaces (UGS) plays an important role in determining the ecosystem services that they support. Knowledge of factors shaping landscape structure of UGS is imperative for planning and management of UGS. In this study, we assessed the influence of urban form on the structure of UGS in 262 cities in China based on remote sensing data. We produced land cover maps for 262 cities in 2015 using 6673 scenes of Landsat ETM+/OLI images based on the Google Earth Engine platform. We analyzed the impact of urban form on landscape structure of UGS in these cities using boosted regression tree analysis with the landscape and urban form metrics derived from the land cover maps as response and prediction variables, respectively. The results showed that the three urban form metrics—perimeter area ratio, road density, and compound terrain complexity index—were all significantly correlated with selected landscape metrics of UGS. Cities with high road density had less UGS area and the UGS in those cities was more fragmented. Cities with complex built-up boundaries tended to have more fragmented UGS. Cities with high terrain complexity had more UGS but the UGS were more fragmented. Our results for the first time revealed the importance of urban form on shaping landscape structure of UGS in 262 cities at a national scale.

TI  - Urban green roofs provide habitat for migrating and breeding birds and their arthropod prey.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, and many previously biodiverse areas are now mostly composed of impervious surface. This loss of natural habitat causes local bird communities to become dominated by urban dweller and urban utilizer species and reduces the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds. Green roofs can increase green space in urban landscapes, potentially providing new habitat for wildlife. We surveyed birds and arthropods, an important food source for birds, on green roofs and nearby comparable conventional (non-green) roofs in New York City during spring migration and summer breeding seasons. We predicted that green roofs would have a greater abundance and richness of both birds and arthropods than conventional roofs during both migration and the breeding season for birds. Furthermore, we predicted we would find more urban avoider and urban utilizer bird species on green roofs than conventional roofs. We found that both birds and arthropods were more abundant and rich on green roofs than conventional roofs. In addition, green roofs hosted more urban avoider and utilizer bird species than conventional roofs. Our study shows that birds use green roofs as stopover habitat during migration and as foraging habitat during the breeding season. Establishing green roofs in urban landscapes increases the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds and can partially mitigate the loss of habitat due to increasing urbanization.

TI  - Biocultural diversity in an urban context: An indicator-based decision support tool to guide the planning and management of green infrastructure
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Cities face growing challenges and urban greenspaces (UGS) play a key role in improving cities liveability. UGS are complex socio-ecological systems and evidence-based and context-sensitive tools are needed to assist planning and manage environmentally sound and socially inclusive UGS. In this paper, we propose an innovative indicator-based tool to operationalize the biocultural diversity (BCD) framework in urban contexts, deriving from its three conceptual layers – materialized, lived and stewardship. Indicators proposed are bundled in themes representing essential components when assessing and analyzing urban BCD from a contextual and sensitizing perspective. The set of indicators highlight key features of socio-cultural and ecological systems, theirs links and interactions, both material and non-material, to capture the essence of biocultural diversity at site-level. By offering a uniform scoring system with the possibility to set site-specific benchmarks, these can be used in any type of greenspace of any city, while allowing different communities/neighborhoods/city councils to embrace different approaches to meet their objectives towards larger scale goals. Twelve urban parks in Lisbon were used as a test-bed for the indicator-based tool and proved its feasibility to gather an overall snapshot of all parks and to demonstrate the possibility to deepen the study to only two parks uncovering self-exclusion processes that otherwise would have remained hidden. The BCD tool brings together essential information scattered over several quality and good practices assessment tools and protocols and, by including indicators specifically addressing governance and stewardship, offers a policy-driven instrument able to capture trade-offs and/or synergies between ecological, social and political domains.

TI  - Ground-dwelling invertebrate diversity in domestic gardens along a rural-urban gradient: Landscape characteristics are more important than garden characteristics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanisation is increasing worldwide and is regarded a major driver of environmental change altering local species assemblages. Private domestic gardens contribute a significant share of total green area in cities, but their biodiversity has received relatively little attention. Previous studies mainly considered plants, flying invertebrates such as bees and butterflies, and birds. By using a multi-taxa approach focused on less mobile, ground-dwelling invertebrates, we examined the influence of local garden characteristics and landscape characteristics on species richness and abundance of gastropods, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, ants, ground beetles and rove beetles. We assume that most of the species of these groups are able to complete their entire life cycle within a single garden. We conducted field surveys in thirty-five domestic gardens along a rural-urban gradient in Basel, Switzerland. Considered together, the gardens examined harboured an impressive species richness, with a mean share of species of the corresponding groups known for Switzerland of 13.9%, ranging from 4.7% in ground beetles to 23.3% in woodlice. The overall high biodiversity is a result of complementary contributions of gardens harbouring distinct species assemblages. Indeed, at the garden level, species richness of different taxonomical groups were typically not inter-correlated. The exception was ant species richness, which was correlated with those of gastropods and spiders. Generalised linear models revealed that distance to the city centre is an important driver of species richness, abundance and composition of several groups, resulting in an altered species composition in gardens in the centre of the city. Local garden characteristics were important drivers of gastropod and ant species richness, and the abundance of spiders, millipedes and rove beetles. Our study shows that domestic gardens make a valuable contribution to regional biodiversity. Thus, domestic urban gardens constitute an important part of green infrastructure, which should be considered by urban planners.

TI  - The state of the world’s urban ecosystems: What can we learn from trees, fungi, and bees?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Positive interactions between people and nature inspire behaviours that are in harmony with biodiversity conservation and also afford physical and mental health benefits. Since most people live in towns and cities, urban greenspaces are key points of influence for conservation, but also provide diverse ecosystem services. City trees are a foundation for biodiversity in urban ecosystems, and their belowground interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and aboveground interactions with pollinators must be central to urban ecosystem planning. Messaging about biodiversity must be clearer to avoid unintended negative outcomes from conservation actions such as low diversity tree planting and unsustainable levels of urban beekeeping Summary Trees are a foundation for biodiversity in urban ecosystems and therefore must be able to withstand global change and biological challenges over decades and even centuries to prevent urban ecosystems from deteriorating. Tree quality and diversity should be prioritized over simply numbers to optimize resilience to these challenges. Successful establishment and renewal of trees in cities must also consider belowground (e.g., mycorrhizas) and aboveground (e.g., pollinators) interactions to ensure urban ecosystem longevity, biodiversity conservation and continued provision of the full range of ecosystem services provided by trees. Positive interactions with nature inspire people to live more sustainable lifestyles that are consistent with stopping biodiversity loss and to participate in conservation actions such as tree-planting and supporting pollinators. Interacting with nature simultaneously provides mental and physical health benefits to people. Since most people live in cities, here we argue that urban ecosystems provide important opportunities for increasing engagement with nature and educating people about biodiversity conservation. While advocacy on biodiversity must communicate in language that is relevant to a diverse audience, oversimplified messaging, may result in unintended negative outcomes. For example, tree planting actions typically focus on numbers rather than diversity

TI  - Understanding the drivers of Southeast Asian biodiversity loss
PY  - 2017
AB  - Southeast Asia (SE Asia) is a known global hotspot of biodiversity and endemism, yet the region is also one of the most biotically threatened. Ecosystems across the region are threatened by an array of drivers, each of which increases the probability of extinction of species in a variety of ecosystems. These issues are symptomatic of the issues that face the global tropics; however, with around 4 billion people in the wider region and the associated pressures on biodiversity, this region may be under some of the greatest levels of biotic threat. Deforestation rates in SE Asia are some of the highest globally, additionally it has the highest rate of mining in the tropics, around the greatest number of hydropower dams under construction, and a consumption of species for traditional medicines which is a threat to biodiversity globally. In this review, the greatest threats to regional biodiversity in the SE Asian region are discussed. Tree-plantations and deforestation represent one of the most imminent threats, and some countries have already lost over half their original forest cover (i.e., the Philippines, parts of Indonesia), with projections of as much as 98% loss for some regions in the coming decade. Hunting and trade represent a significant threat as demand stems not only for food, but also for medicine, for ornamentation, and as a status symbol. Mining represents a frequently overlooked threat, as the Asian region is one of the greatest exporters of limestone and various minerals globally, and the cost of this to biodiversity is not only through the direct loss of areas for mines, but also through the development of roads that further fragment the landscape, the leakage of heavy metals, and the destruction of limestone karsts, which represent global endemicity hotspots. Reservoir construction, wetland drainage, fires, pollution, invasive species, disease, and finally climate change are also considered. Once each issue has been discussed, the overall prognosis of regional biodiversity and priority actions to protect SE Asian biodiversity in the future is discussed.

TI  - Can local fieldwork help to represent intra-urban variability of canopy parameters relevant for tropical African climate studies?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization in tropical Africa is increasingly leading to unprecedented socio-economical and environmental challenges in cities, particularly urban heat and climate change. The latter calls for a better representation of tropical African cities’ properties relevant for urban climate studies. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of collecting urban canopy parameters during a field campaign in the boreal summer months of 2018 for deriving a Local Climate Zone (LCZ) map and for improving the physical representation of climate-relevant urban morphological, thermal and radiative characteristics. The comparison of the resulting field-derived LCZ map with an existing map obtained from the World Urban Data and Access Portal Tool framework shows large differences. In particular, our map results in more vegetated open low-rise classes. In addition, site-specific fieldwork-derived urban characteristics are compared against the LCZ universal parameters. The latter shows that our fieldwork adds important information to the universal parameters by more specifically considering the presence of corrugated metal in the city of Kampala. This material is a typical roofing material found in densely built environments and informal settlements. It leads to lower thermal emissivity but higher thermal conductivity and capacity of buildings. To illustrate the importance of site-specific urban parameters, the newly derived site-specific urban characteristics are used as input fields to an urban parametrization scheme embedded in the regional climate model COSMO-CLM. This implementations decreases the surface temperature bias from 5.34 to 3.97 K. Based on our results, we recommend future research on tropical African cities to focus on a detailed representation of cities, with particular attention to impervious surface fraction and building materials.

TI  - Large Cities Fall Behind in “Neighborhood Biodiversity”
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a major driver of global species loss. While cities with suitable habitats and conservation policies may support locally-high biodiversity levels, we suspected that the complexity of managing very large cities might counteract the advantage of large geographic area, and these cities may be less effective at biodiversity conservation. To answer this, we examined the relationship between the number of native indicator wildlife species (mean and maximum) in 112 cities across three metropolitan areas in California (Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose), metrics related to scale and environmental variables. We found that indicator species richness is positively related to area, income (the luxury effect), and pervious cover - including trees, shrubs and grasses. Despite having a high maximum number of indicator species within their boundaries, the largest cities in our study, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Diego, do a relatively poor job compared with smaller cities at distributing native biodiversity throughout neighborhoods, as measured by their mean species richness. Such variation in “neighborhood biodiversity” may exacerbate existing inequities in residents’ access to nature. Using Los Angeles County as a case study, we compared biodiversity management within the County’s 88 cities of various sizes and characteristics. We ranked General Plan wording in terms of references to biodiversity and conservation and created a management metric. We found that municipalities of various sizes that had high management scores generally had high indicator species richness. This suggests that robust policies may be able to overcome the challenges posed by city size and population.

TI  - Urban hedges : a review of plant species and cultivars for ecosystem service delivery in north-west Europe
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Urban hedges provide a number of important ecosystem services (ESs) including microclimate alteration, flood and pollution mitigation, and biodiversity provision, along with some disservices (DSs, e.g. invasiveness, allergenicity). However, hedge plant species differ in their capacity to promote different services, so it is important that the decision to plant hedges is evidence-based. The objectives of this study were thus to (i) to review the role of urban hedges within NW Europe; (ii) review the available literature detailing the ESs and DSs provided by different plant species and cultivars when used as hedge plants; (iii) identify where there is a lack of evidence for certain species or ESs/DSs; and (iv) develop a starting point for a discussion about appropriate species/cultivar selection to deliver multiple ESs, and avoid DSs. Many studies consider biodiversity and air quality ESs. There are significant gaps in the literature relating to rainfall mitigation/flood protection, but also CO2 sequestration, allergenicity and human psychological well-being impact of different species. Additionally, for noise and pollution mitigation studies, a range of methodologies and units are used, making comparisons between hedge species difficult/impossible. A number of common hedge species demonstrated high levels of ESs delivery, including Fagus sylvatica, Crataegus monogyna, Ilex aquifolium and Rosa rugosa. No species surveyed had an entirely negative association with ESs, and most provide at least some benefits in supporting ESs provision (e.g. Viburnum tinus, Laurus nobilis). We created a matrix, in a table form, linking plant species, key plant traits and ESs/DSs, which should make it easier for professionals to choose species best suited to provide multiple benefits, whilst minimising the drawbacks. Our review suggests that the relative contribution of urban hedges to ESs delivery may be under-valued currently, and calls for more research.

TI  - Taxonomic, Phylogenetic and Functional Diversity of Bird Assemblages in Urban Green Spaces: Null Model Analyses, Temporal Variation and Ecological Drivers
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urban expansion is a pervasive driver of biodiversity loss. To understand the effects of urbanization on diversity, we investigated the response of bird taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to urban green spaces’ characteristics in thirty-one green spaces of Mexico City. Selected sites encompassed variation of environmental factors along a transformation gradient, from natural protected areas to landscaped parks. Bird observations were conducted during winter (non-breeding season), spring (dry breeding season), and summer (wet breeding season). We used multi-model inference to assess the relationship of green space area, shape, isolation, tree richness, habitat diversity, and vegetation cover with species richness, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, and functional richness. We calculated standardized effect sizes from null models to assess phylogenetic and functional structure. We registered 91 species belonging to 28 families across all sites and seasons. The number of detected species was largest in winter and decreased toward the dry breeding season, and then toward the wet breeding season. We found a moderate to strong positive relationship of species richness with phylogenetic diversity and functional richness. Overall, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird communities in green spaces was neither clustered nor over-dispersed. However, few cases of functional clustering, phylogenetic clustering, or both were observed, and they corresponded to natural protected areas. Results showed a predominant role of green space area in determining community diversity and phylogenetic structure while it did not influence functional structure. Contrary to our predictions, habitat diversity had a negative effect on species richness and phylogenetic diversity and this effect was detected only during the wet breeding season, whereas isolation showed a positive relationship with phylogenetic and functional structure, during the wet breeding season and winter, respectively. This study emphasizes the use of complementary measures of diversity together with the comparison between observed and expected values to get a better insight into the mechanisms by which green spaces’ characteristics affect bird diversity across the seasons.</jats:p>

TI  - Urbanisation impacts the diversity, coloration, and body size of wild bees in a Mediterranean city
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Urbanisation is a growing phenomenon causing the decline of wild bees globally. Yet, bees manage to persist in the urban matrix thanks to islands of vegetation in public parks and private gardens. While we begin to comprehend the impact of urbanisation on bees’ diversity and abundance, our understanding of its impact on the functional diversity of wild bees is limited. Here, we use an integrative approach to investigate the response of wild bees to urbanisation at the community, species, and individual levels. To do so, we sampled wild bees in 24 public parks along an urbanisation gradient in the Mediterranean city of Marseille. We found that species richness and abundance decreased in more urbanised areas, but increased in larger city parks. Moreover, larger individuals within species, but not larger species, were found in larger city parks, suggesting that park size is crucial for the persistence of bees in cities. Interestingly, we show that brighter species were found in parks surrounded by a large amount of impervious surface, highlighting the importance of colour traits in the response to environmental changes. Finally, our results revealed that larger species, but not larger individuals, were also more colourful. In summary, our study not only confirmed that urbanisation negatively impacts community-level traits, but that it also affects species’ coloration and individuals’ body size, thus improving our understanding of the functional response of wild bees to urbanisation. We suggest that increasing park size may compensate for the negative effects of urbanisation on wild bees.</jats:p>

TI  - Looking Closer at the Patterns of Land Cover in the City of Porto, Portugal, between 1947 and 2019—A Contribution for the Integration of Ecological Data in Spatial Planning
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>As more people reside in cities and metropolitan areas, urban vegetation assumes an increasingly important role as one the main providers of ecosystem services in close proximity to human agglomerations. To improve the conditions for citizens and to optimise the sustainability of urban areas, the fields of landscape and urban ecology need to address the urgent priority to integrate ecological data in spatial planning, design, and management programs. With the objective to produce “actionable knowledge” for urban planning in the city of Porto (Portugal), we analyse the evolution of land cover since the mid-20th century at a fine spatial scale. Porto has followed the global trends of urbanisation, marked by a general increase in built-up and impervious surfaces that conquered the previously rural surrounding areas. This caused a severe decline in vegetation cover (especially herbaceous), as well as an increase in fragmentation and isolation of the remaining vegetation patches. These outcomes provide a detailed analysis of the city spatial dynamics, generating valuable information that can be relevant for future interventions regarding urban landscape change at a local scale, the most relevant for planning.</jats:p>

TI  - Supporting biodiversity: Structures of participatory actions in urban green spaces
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Biodiversity loss is an important topic considering climate change, global warming, and even the reasoning of current and future animal-related diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Urban biodiversity is also important because of the ecosystem services they provide, restorative benefits for well-being, and physical health of the people who live in urban areas. Each city has its own strategies to cope with this issue, and these strategies do not function without the contribution of habitants of the cities. We developed an index (BBS) of the existing possibilities to support urban biodiversity in Berlin to measure the awareness and willingness of the Berliners to participate and support urban biodiversity. A survey was conducted in a face-to-face situation in four districts of Berlin with 431 urban residents, measuring preference for three different levels of biodiversity, connectedness to residential greenspace, neighborhood and city, nature relatedness, and willingness in participatory actions around greenspace. The results show that the high biodiversity condition in a photo scenario was preferred by most residents, indicating the appreciation for urban biodiversity. The connectedness to the residential greenspace was high (and higher than the connectedness to neighborhood and city), showing large potential for quality of life. While the overall willingness to participate in actions to support urban greenspace was rather high, our index shows substantial differences in activities, which are perceived more or less. This is a key result for urban park management to increase urban biodiversity participation processes.</jats:p>

TI  - Avian species richness in cities: A review of the Spanish-language literature from the Southern Cone of South America
PY  - 2021
AB  - South America sustains an important part of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and its population is highly urbanized. Global syntheses have revealed a paucity of urban ecological research in the region; however, local research might be overlooked due to language barriers. As a contribution to disseminating local knowledge, we conducted a synthesis of Spanish-language literature on bird species richness in the Southern Cone of South America - an area of high diversity, endemism, and more than half of the world’s terrestrial biome types. In this systematic review, we identified patterns and trends in the literature, and the variables that influence bird species richness. Research has focused on national capital cities and green areas (large urban parks). Most studies covered short periods of time (1 year or less) and involved one season only (reproductive). The most studied biomes were temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands, and Mediterranean and temperate forests, and no studies were found in mountains or deserts. Bird species richness in cities from the Southern Cone was positively influenced by vegetation cover and plant and habitat diversity; whereas variables associated with urban cover and disturbance exhibited negative effects. Important gaps in knowledge include: research in small and medium size cities, in overlooked biomes (deserts, xeric shrublands, and montane grasslands and shrublands), long-term research comprising different seasons, the inclusion of green spaces other than urban parks, and interdisciplinary studies that consider environmental, social, and economic components of urban ecosystems. By filling these key knowledge gaps, researchers from South America can contribute to the development of science-based actions to preserve nature in an urbanizing world.

TI  - Effects of urban built-up patches on native plants in subtropical landscapes with ecological thresholds – A case study of Chongqing city
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Urbanization has become a widespread social development trend in China. The size and configuration of urban built-up patches (UBPs) at a regional scale is presumed to be related to the extinction of rural and urban native plants in the landscape because of a tolerance threshold. The current study aimed to test the species area relationships in the heterogeneous space of UBPs vs. native plant taxa, which would enable examination of the tolerance thresholds of native plants to UBPs size and configuration. We investigated the types of land use, the patch configurations in the main region of Chongqing in western China, the statistics of native woody plants belonging to different species, and the life/growth forms found in sampling transects from four directions (east, west, north and south) along the rural-suburb-urban gradient. The size of UBPs has significant threshold effects on the native plant taxa, as well as the types of life/growth forms. Shrubs and deciduous plants are more resistant to the UBP size, followed by trees and evergreens. In addition, the smaller, more scattered, and rounder UBPs are related to more likely survival of native plants. The effect of the UBPs sizes in the landscape on native plants is negative, with critical thresholds ranging from 52.94% to 57.54% in a subtropical, mountainous megacity. Different plant taxa/life forms have different response thresholds. The influence of UBPs configurations on native plants can be positive or negative. The underlying mechanism of thresholds is thought to be caused by the accumulation of UBPs that form a matrix on the landscape.

TI  - Dynamic Changes in Melbourne’s Urban Vegetation Cover—2001 to 2016
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding changes in urban vegetation is essential for ensuring sustainable and healthy cities, mitigating disturbances due to climate change, sustaining urban biodiversity, and supporting human health and wellbeing. This study investigates and describes the distribution and dynamic changes in urban vegetation over a 15-year period in Greater Melbourne, Australia. The study investigates how vegetation cover across Melbourne has changed at five-yearly intervals from 2001 to 2016 using the newly proposed dynamic change approach that extends the net change approach to quantify the amount of vegetation gain as well as loss. We examine this question at two spatial resolutions: (1) at the municipal landscape scale to capture broadscale change regardless of land tenure; and (2) at the scale of designated public open spaces within the municipalities to investigate the extent to which the loss of vegetation has occurred on lands that are intended to provide public access to vegetated areas in the city. Vegetation was quantified at four different times (2001, 2006, 2011, 2016), using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Dynamic changes of gain and loss in urban vegetation between the three periods were quantified for six local government areas (LGAs) and their associated public open spaces using a change matrix. The results showed an overall net loss of 64.5 square kilometres of urban vegetation from 2001 to 2016 in six LGAs. When extrapolated to the Greater Melbourne Area, this is approximately equivalent to 109 times the size of Central Park in New York City.

TI  - A multi-scale, multi-species approach highlights the importance of urban greenspace and pond design for amphibian communities
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation threatens species through habitat loss, isolation and fragmentation. Greenspace in urban landscapes often provides connectivity and habitat for wetland-dependent species. Accessible greenspace measures the combined effects of movement barriers (e.g., roads) and the total amount of greenspace on populations. I determined whether accessible greenspace was a better predictor of amphibian occupancy at ponds than the total amount of greenspace, and at what spatial scale. I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban–rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m – 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement. The best-ranked multi-species occupancy model included the proportion of total greenspace within a 1000-m radius of a pond and four local-scale covariates (presence of mosquitofish, pond permanence, vertical pond walls and water conductivity). There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site. There was no apparent effect of barriers on occupancy, indicating that urban areas may be more permeable for movement by some species than predicted. Individual species responses demonstrated that management actions are required at fine and broad spatial scales to benefit amphibian communities in urban landscapes.

TI  - An unexpected backyard hunter: breeding Barred Owls exhibit plasticity in habitat selection along a development gradient
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite extensive accounts in the literature describing Barred Owls (Strix varia) as obligate forest-interior species, Barred Owls have increasingly been observed in urbanized landscapes. To determine if certain habitat characteristics, such as mature urban trees, facilitate the occurrence of Barred Owls in developed regions, we deployed GPS transmitters on 20 breeding Barred Owls in northwestern South Carolina. We selected territories containing a gradient of development density and habitat types to examine predictors of home range size and habitat selection along an urban-rural gradient. We related nocturnal locations to habitat features using resource selection functions (RSFs). We explored differential use along a development gradient by modeling interactions between habitat parameters and measures of development in the home range. Home range size varied from 0.38 km2 to 3.38 km2; size increased with the percentage of treeless area in the territory such as agricultural fields and power lines. Distance to nest, tree height, and distance to canopy edge were the most important predictors of owl use. Barred Owl selection for roadsides and aquatic features increased with degree of fragmentation in the home range. This is the first resource selection study using GPS data to examine habitat use of Barred Owls in the context of development. Our results highlight the behavioral plasticity of a species previously described as sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. The presence of this large avian predator in urban forests suggests that retaining key habitat features can promote multi-trophic communities even when other aspects of the habitat are highly altered.

TI  - Community Perception of Brownfield Regeneration through Urban Rewilding
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Brownfield regeneration using a rewilding approach could provide an opportunity to create new green spaces in our cities. However, studies on public perceptions of rewilding projects are limited. Thus, the purpose of this study was to better understand the public’s perspective of brownfield regeneration and the perceived advantages that these regenerations may give if regenerated as urban green areas as part of rewilding projects. An online survey containing 21 dichotomous and multiple-choice items was created to learn about people’s preferences for brownfield regeneration, the advantages of urban rewilding, and the value of biodiversity in urban contexts. Results show that most people are aware of the benefits of urban regeneration and receptive to the idea of rewilding for urban resilience. Our findings raise awareness of the possibility of regenerating abandoned lots to create accessible green spaces for our communities.</jats:p>

TI  - Differential organization of taxonomic and functional diversity in an urban woody plant metacommunity
PY  - 2016
AB  - Questions Urban ecosystems present an opportunity to study ecological communities in the context of unprecedented environmental change. In the face of urban land conversion, ecologists observe new patterns of species composition, dominance, behaviour and dispersal. We propose a hypothetical socioeconomic template that describes a gradient in human investment in community composition to aid in organizing the human role in shaping urban biodiversity. We asked: (1) what is the relative magnitude of taxonomic and functional turnover of urban woody plant communities across different land-use types; and (2) do land uses exhibiting higher intensity of human management of biodiversity support higher turnover over those with less human influence? Location Baltimore, MD, USA (39°17′ N, 76°38′ W). Methods We examined patterns in woody plant biodiversity across 209 plots of different urban land uses. Six land-use types were arranged along a gradient in the intensity through which humans are hypothesized to manage species composition at the plot scale. We calculated local, or α-diversity, and compositional turnover, or β-diversity, of taxonomic and functional diversity across plots within each land-use type. We compared the magnitude of these biodiversity measures between land uses to test our conceptual template for how the intensity of human management can predict urban woody plant biodiversity. Results We observed high taxonomic turnover in residential and commercial plots compared with vacant or open space land-use areas. This was associated with a weaker, but similar, pattern in functional diversity. This was associated with low total abundance in residential and commercial plots. Furthermore, the number of unique species was extremely high in the same land-use types. Conclusions Our observations help explain why turnover can be high in heavily managed plots relative to vacant land. In patches without heavy human management, we found low levels of turnover. This highlights the importance of assessing diversity both locally and at the level of turnover between patches. Management and policy can benefit from the perspective embodied in the conceptual approach tested here.

TI  - Data from public and governmental databases show that a large proportion of the regional animal species pool occur in cities in Germany
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Cities have been shown to be biodiverse, but it is unclear what fraction of a regional species pool can live within city borders and how this differs between taxa. Among animals, most research has focused on a few well-studied taxa, such as birds or butterflies. For other species, progress is limited by the paucity of data. We used species occurrence data for 11 taxa and 23 German cities from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the different German states, in a 50-km buffer around the city centre, to investigate what proportion of species of the regional species pools also occur in cities. While data could be obtained for all cities from GBIF, state databases only provided data for a subset of cities. Sample coverage of data from GBIF was higher across all taxa than of the state databases. For each database and taxon, we analysed (i) all cities where the number of occurrences of a taxon was &amp;gt;50 and (ii) only those cities where additionally sample coverage was &amp;gt;0.85. Across all taxa studied on average, 44.9 ± 7.2% (GBIF) and 40.8 ± 9.6% (German states) of the species of the regional species pool were also found in cities. When all cities were considered together, more than 76% of all species occurred within city borders. Our results show that German cities harbour a large part of the regional diversity of different taxa when city borders rather than the city centre is considered. This opens up ample opportunities for conservation and for fostering human–nature relationships.</jats:p>

TI  - The country toad and the city toad: comparing morphology of invasive cane toads (<i>Rhinella marina</i>) from rural and urban environments
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Urbanization is a principal driver of global biodiversity loss. Although many studies have examined the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity, we are only beginning to study urbanization as an evolutionary force. Urban environments are hotspots for invasive species, but most previous studies have focused on phenotypic changes in native species responding to urbanization. Quantifying the phenotypic responses of invasive species to urbanization may help reveal mechanisms promoting invasion. There are, however, few studies investigating the phenotypic response of invasive species to urbanization. We compared morphological traits of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) between urban and rural areas in three cities in north-eastern Australia using generalized linear mixed models. We found that the parotoid glands, which are the major anti-predator defence of toads were smaller in urban than in rural populations. The tibiofibula length of males in urban populations was longer than those in rural populations, but females showed opposite trends, suggesting potential effects of urbanization on sexual dimorphism. These results demonstrate that urbanization drives morphological changes in invasive toads, suggesting they may adapt to urban environments rapidly.</jats:p>

TI  - Response of Spatio-Temporal Differentiation Characteristics of Habitat Quality to Land Surface Temperature in a Fast Urbanized City
PY  - 2021
AB  - The degradation and loss of global urban habitat and biodiversity have been extensively studied as a global issue. Urban heat islands caused by abnormal land surface temperature (LST) have been shown to be the main reason for this problem. With the accelerated urbanization process and the increasing possibility of abnormal temperatures in Zhengzhou, China, more and more creatures cannot adapt and survive in urban habitats, including humans; therefore, Zhengzhou was selected as the study area. The purpose of this study is to explore the response of urban habitat quality to LST, which provides a basis for the scientific protection of urban habitat and biodiversity in Zhengzhou from the perspective of alleviating heat island effect. We used the InVEST-Habitat Quality model to calculate the urban habitat quality, combined with GIS spatial statistics and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis, to explore the response of habitat quality to LST. The results show the following: (1) From 2000 to 2015, the mean value of urban habitat quality gradually decreased from 0.361 to 0.304, showing a downward trend as a whole. (2) There was an obvious gradient effect between habitat quality and LST. Habitat quality’s high values were distributed in the central and northern built-up area and low values were distributed in the high-altitude western forest habitat and northern water habitat. However, the distribution of LST gradient values were opposite to the habitat quality to a great extent. (3) There were four agglomeration types between LST and habitat quality at specific spatial locations: the high-high type was scattered mainly in the western part of the study area and in the northern region; the high-low type was mainly distributed in the densely populated and actively constructed central areas; the low-low type was mainly distributed in the urban-rural intersections and small and medium-sized rural settlements; and the low-high type was mainly distributed in the western mountainous hills and the northern waters.

TI  - A Conceptual Framework for Choosing Target Species for Wildlife-Inclusive Urban Design
PY  - 2019
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the significance of cities for biodiversity, making them important places for conservation in their own right. Current conservation approaches in cities are mostly defensive. Thus, they focus on remnant pockets of natural areas or try to protect particular species that occur in the built environment. These approaches are vulnerable to further urban development and do not create habitats. An alternative strategy is to make wildlife an integral part of urban development and thereby create a new habitat in the built-up area. Here we address the challenge of choosing target species for such wildlife-inclusive urban design. The starting point of our conceptual framework is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data. The existing habitat types on and around the development site and dispersal barriers limit the species numbers to the local species potential. In the next step, the site’s potential for each species is analyzed—how can it be upgraded to host species given the planned development and the life-cycle of the species? For the final choice of target species, traits related to the human–animal interaction are considered. We suggest that stakeholders will be involved in the final species selection. Our approach differs from existing practice, such as expert choice of priority species, by (1) representing an open process where many species are potential targets of conservation, (2) the involvement of stakeholders in a participatory way. Our approach can also be used at larger spatial scales such as quarters or entire cities.

TI  - Urban built form shapes avian richness in green spaces
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urban biodiversity plays an important role in ecological processes and ecosystem services within cities, making conservation a priority in many municipal sustainability plans. Urban green spaces (UGS) have been a key strategy for conservation by providing habitat for wildlife, including avian communities. While the ecological attributes necessary to enhance the habitability of UGS for avian communities are relatively well known, an understanding of how variation in the surrounding urban matrix influences avian richness outcomes in these spaces, is less understood. As new urban areas continue to develop and UGS become increasingly important habitat areas, urban designers and planners will need a better understanding of the ways in which urban built form patterns at the matrix-level influence avian biodiversity outcomes at the site-level in UGS. To that end, this study investigates the influence of 4 urban built form matrix-level variables , capturing three-dimensional (3D) configuration patterns, and 6 UGS site-level variables on total avian richness and avian richness by foraging guild using generalized linear model methods in 22 UGS. This analysis was conducted using high resolution land cover data, LiDAR data, and twenty years of bird occurrence data from the eBird community science program in well-surveyed UGS in Los Angeles, California. The size of the UGS was the best predictor of richness patterns across all groups, confirming previous findings. However, several urban form metrics, when included with UGS size, improved model prediction for Carnivores, Insectivores, and Omnivore foraging guilds, indicating that urban built form does influence some avian groups within UGS. The results of this study suggest that the most important factor for avian richness in UGS is the size of the green space, but that urban built form plays a role too, especially when considered from a 3D perspective.</jats:p>

TI  - First Record of Usnea (Parmeliaceae) Growing in New York City in Nearly 200 Years1
PY  - 2019
AB  - The decline and near extirpation of lichens from urban areas was documented worldwide over the past 2 centuries, with the lowest diversity observed in many cities during the 1960s and 1970s. One major contributing factor to this observed decline was high levels of unregulated air pollution, which has a strong negative impact on lichen growth and survival. Since then lichens have begun recolonizing cities, in many cases at a rapid rate. New York City followed these same trends in urban lichen diversity changes. To better understand the current state of New York City lichen diversity, we have been conducting surveys at green spaces throughout the city. During one of these surveys we found a single thallus of Usnea on one very large, old red oak (Quercus rubra L.) at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. The individual was too poorly developed to identify by its morphology and chemistry, so we took a DNA barcoding approach. Molecular data confidently assigned the thallus as Usnea mutabilis Stirton. Finding this thallus was highly notable, as it is the first report of an Usnea from New York City since 1824. The thallus is about 1.5 cm long, which suggests that it established within the last 30 yr. This finding highlights the continued improvement of urban environments for lichen recolonization, and the importance of cemeteries in providing stable green spaces for urban biodiversity.

TI  - What is an urban bird? Trait-based predictions of urban tolerance for the world's birds are modulated by latitude and human population density
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As human density increases, biodiversity must increasingly co-exist with urbanization or face local extinction. Tolerance of urban areas has been linked to numerous functional traits, yet few globally-consistent patterns have emerged to explain variation in urban tolerance, which stymies attempts at a generalizable predictive framework. Here, we calculate an Urban Association Index (UAI) for 3768 bird species in 137 cities across all permanently inhabited continents. We then assess how UAI varies as a function of ten species-specific traits and further test whether the strength of trait relationships vary as a function of three city-specific variables. Of the ten species traits, nine were significantly associated with urban tolerance. Urban-associated species tend to be smaller, less territorial, have greater dispersal ability, broader dietary and habitat niches, larger clutch sizes, greater longevity, and have lower elevational limits. Only bill shape showed no global association with urban tolerance. Additionally, the strength of several trait relationships varied across cities as a function of latitude and/or human population density. For example, the effects of body mass and diet breadth are more pronounced at higher latitudes, while the effects of territoriality and longevity were reduced in cities with higher population density. Thus, the importance of trait filters in birds varies predictably across cities, indicating biogeographic variation in selection for urban tolerance that could explain prior challenges in the search for global patterns. A globally-informed framework that predicts urban tolerance will be integral to conservation as increasing proportions of the world’s biodiversity are impacted by urbanization.</jats:p>

TI  - Biodiversity conservation in cities: Defining habitat analogues for plant species of conservation interest.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban green spaces, both unmanaged and managed, include novel ecosystems that may be suitable habitat analogues for native plant species of conservation interest. The objective of this study was to define habitat analogues in the Mediterranean city of Beirut for Matthiola crassifolia, a Lebanese steno-endemic only present in urban habitats. We adopted a stepwise method that integrates two vegetation assessments, floristics, and life form. We placed seventy-eight quadrats (1m x 1m) in 12 study sites following a deliberate biased approach to capture habitat diversity. In every quadrat, we performed taxonomic identification and recorded life forms of each species. We pooled species that shared the same life form and estimated area cover for each life form accordingly. We performed TWINSPAN analyses on both floristic and life form data, then combined these findings to generate a description of habitat analogues suitable for M. crassifolia. TWINSPAN analysis of floristic data clustered the 78 quadrats under 17 quadrat groups, while life form data assembled the quadrats under 11 quadrat groups. The integration of floristic and life-form classification results into one matrix generated 30 quadrat groups, 8, which were highly favorable to M. crassifolia, and 12, which excluded it. The stepwise method unveiled similarities between vegetation assemblages, which appeared distinct due to the high presence of ruderals. We found that habitat analogues favorable to M. crassifolia include green spaces dominated by palms, low-lying succulents, or shrubs with scale-like leaves. In contrast, areas dominated by turf grass, canopy trees, or vegetation that produces significant litter were not favorable to M. crassifolia’s persistence. Based on these findings, we generated a plant palette of life forms which guides designs of urban habitats favorable to M. crassifolia. Synthesis and applications The stepwise method was useful in producing informative plant lists and assemblages for planting designs and landscape management; it generated a plant selection palette that is not restrictive and does not enforce a native only policy. It also offered a wide range of potential habitat analogues for M. crassifolia.

TI  - Neighboring Green Network and Landscape Metrics Explain Biodiversity within Small Urban Green Areas—A Case Study on Birds
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Cities’ green areas are fragmented patches and are often confined to smaller sizes than the higher built-up proportions. Such small-sized green areas can be essential components of green infrastructure to compensate for biodiversity loss. As a proxy to biodiversity, we studied birds in nine small green area locations of Freiburg and eight area locations in Regensburg in Germany. We investigated the neighboring green networks (distance to the nearest water body and another green area) and landscape metrics (patch abundance and habitat heterogeneity at a 1 km radius) that might benefit and explain bird richness and composition in small green areas. We found that the variations in the observed species richness and composition at the surveyed locations were better explained solely by green networks in Freiburg and by green networks and landscape metrics in Regensburg. In general, it indicates that a small green area could be biodiverse if its spatial distribution considers a nearby water body and other green areas, allowing a higher abundance of similar patches and habitat heterogeneity in the neighborhood.</jats:p>

TI  - Connecting Biodiversity With Mental Health and Wellbeing — A Review of Methods and Disciplinary Perspectives
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Biodiversity conservation and mental health and wellbeing are of increasing global concern, with growing relevance to planning and policy. A growing body of literature exploring the relationships between biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing—based on early research conducted largely from social science perspectives—suggests that particular qualities within natural environments confer particular benefits. Results so far have been inconclusive and inconsistent, contributing to an incohesive body of evidence. While past reviews have focused on reporting variations in results, the present study builds on early reviews by exploring variations from the perspective of author disciplines and the use of different guiding theories, and variables used to measure biodiversity, mental health and wellbeing. This aims to address a research gap in understanding whether research in this topic has become more interdisciplinary or has employed more consistent study designs, which were highlighted as priorities in past reviews, but the progress of which has not yet been explored in depth. We found that research connecting biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing has become only marginally more interdisciplinary in recent years, and there is still a large inconsistency in the use of guiding theories, variables and overall study designs. The variation in disciplinary perspectives and methods reflects a growing interest in this field and the variety of ways researchers are trying to understand and test the complex relationships between biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing. Our study shows that there are unique perspectives that different disciplines can contribute to this body of research and continuing to increase collaboration between disciplines with the use of consistent mixed methods approaches in future may contribute to a more cohesive body of evidence. We provide a framework to conceptualize recommendations for future research, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration at multiple scales, and importantly focusing on more specific, mechanistic studies to inform decision-making that provides co-benefits for biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing.</jats:p>

TI  - Negative relationship between woody species density and size of urban green spaces in seven European cities
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) are important elements of urban landscapes. Woody vegetation is a key component of UGSs, providing many socio-ecological benefits such as habitat provision and human well-being. Knowing plant diversity and vegetation configuration that underpin urban ecosystem processes and functions is critical to maximize nature contributions to city dwellers. Here, we present a well-replicated multi-city study showing a detailed description of taxonomic and structural diversity of woody vegetation in 225 UGSs distributed across seven European cities along a NE-SW gradient. Our aim was to understand how UGSs attributes, including size and fragmentation, influence woody vegetation features. A total of 418 woody species belonging to 76 families were identified. UGS size displayed weak positive correlations with woody species richness, but a strong negative correlation with woody species density. Alien woody species were abundant in all cities (from 40% of all species recorded in Antwerp to 64% in Lisbon and Zurich). Among the native tree species we found a predominance of Pinus spp. in southern cities and Acer spp. in cooler climates. On average, tree canopies extent was 56% of UGSs. This paper provides insights on the plant diversity and woody vegetation composition in UGSs of different size, climate and urban planning history. Our results encourage and contribute to future urban ecology studies involving different taxa and ecosystem services as well as support effective urban planning and management practices. • We recorded 418 woody species in 225 urban green spaces (UGSs) in 7 European cities. • Selected cities cover a latitudinal gradient and UGSs vary in size and connectivity. • Alien species were abundant ranging from 40% in Antwerp to 64 % in Lisbon and Zurich. • There is a strong negative correlation between UGS size and species density.

TI  - Advancing management of urban forested natural areas: toward an urban silviculture?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cities worldwide are engaging in large-scale greening projects motivated by the wide range of documented ecological, economic, and social benefits of urban forests. Urban forested natural areas are a critical component of the total urban forest but are often overlooked and typically lack formal management frameworks. One approach to addressing this deficiency may be to borrow from traditional ecological management frameworks and practices (that is, silviculture). Although urban forested natural areas share similarities with rural forests, the impacts of urbanization on forest stand dynamics may require modification of these methods and in some cases development of novel silvicultural guidelines. We present an urban silviculture framework through which we synthesize emerging research and identify challenges and opportunities for advancing goal setting, assessments, and on-the- ground management strategies. Adapting silvicultural practices to cities can improve the long-term sustainability of urban forests and establish management approaches that address future conditions in forests across the urban–rural continuum.

TI  - Land-use diversity can better predict urban spontaneous plant richness than impervious surface coverage at finer spatial scales.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban spontaneous plants, that are not intentionally propagated by humans and do not belong to the remnants of the natural habitats, not only occur in green spaces but are also distributed in diverse microhabitats in impervious surface areas. Impervious surface coverage is commonly used in studies on spontaneous plant diversity patterns in human-dominated landscapes; however, the role of habitat diversity (i.e., land-use diversity) has been overlooked. Here, we surveyed spontaneous plant composition and land uses (12 types) in 321 0.25 ha sampling sites on the Chongming District islands, Shanghai, to determine the role of land-use diversity in explaining species richness. We examined the linear relationships between species richness and land-use diversity, and quantified the importance of impervious surface coverage and land-use diversity using the random forest (RF) method. All these analyses were conducted for spatial scales from 0.25 to 5 ha in 0.25 ha increments. We found an overall positive relationship between species richness and land-use diversity, and the RF model predicted approximately 50% of the species richness variation at the smallest spatial scale. However, the positive relationship weakened with spatial scale increase, and a rapid decline in explanatory power occurred for all predictor variables in the RF model. Besides impervious surface coverage, both the vegetated and non-vegetated land-use diversity contributed substantially to the prediction of species richness at finer spatial scales. The findings clarify how land-use diversity, both in green spaces and impervious surface areas, affect urban spontaneous plant richness and should be considered in urban biodiversity conservation strategies at the neighborhood scale.

AB  - SignificanceUnderstanding the impacts of urbanization and the associated urban land expansion on species is vital for informed urban planning that minimizes biodiversity loss. Predicting habitat that will be lost to urban land expansion for over 30,000 species under three different future scenarios, we find that up to 855 species are directly threatened due to unmitigated urbanization. Our projections pinpoint rapidly urbanizing regions of sub-Saharan Africa, South America, Mesoamerica, and Southeast Asia where, without careful planning, urbanization is expected to cause particularly large biodiversity loss. Our findings highlight the urgent need for an increased focus on urban land in global conservation strategies and identify high-priority areas for this engagement.

TI  - A typology for urban Green Infrastructure to guide multifunctional planning of nature-based solutions
PY  - 2022
AB  - • We present a hierarchical, feature-based typology of urban GI which supports both mapping and modelling purposes. • We synthesise the evidence behind the performance of each GI in addressing key services relating to environmental and social functions, including wellbeing. • Analysis separates out a suite of GI ranging from low to high multi-functionality for regulating services, and low to high scores for cultural services. Multi-functional GI typically support higher levels of biodiversity. • The multi-functional performance matrix can help design and plan new NBS in cities. Urban Green Infrastructure (GI) provides multiple benefits to city inhabitants and can be an important component in nature-based solutions (NBS), but the ecosystem services that underpin those benefits are inconsistently quantified in the literature. There remain substantial knowledge gaps about the level of service supported by less studied GI types, e.g. cemeteries, or less-studied ecosystem services, e.g. noise mitigation. Decision-makers and planners in cities often face conflicting or incomplete information on the effectiveness of GI, particularly on their ability to provide a suite of co-benefits. Here, we describe a feature-based typology of GI which combines elements of land cover, land use and both ecological and social function. It is consistent with user requirements on mapping, and with the needs of models which can conduct more detailed ecosystem service assessments which can guide NBS design. We provide an evidence synthesis based on published literature, which scores the ability of each GI type to deliver a suite of ecosystem services. In the multivariate analysis of the typology scores, the main axis of variation differentiates between constructed (or hybrid) GI types designed primarily for water flow management (delivering relatively few services) and more natural green GI with trees, or blue GI such as lakes and the sea, which deliver a more multi-functional set of regulating services. The most multi-functional GI on this axis also score highest for biodiversity. The second element of variation separates those GI which support very few cultural services and those which score highly in enabling physical wellbeing and social interaction and, to a lesser extent, restoring capacities. Together the typology and multi-functionality matrix provide a much needed assessment for less studied GI types, and allow planners and decision-makers to make a-priori assessments of the relative ability of different GI as part of NBS to address urban challenges.

TI  - Invasive Urban Mammalian Predators: Distribution and Multi-Scale Habitat Selection.
PY  - 2022
AB  - A barrier to successful ecological restoration of urban green spaces in many cities is invasive mammalian predators. We determined the fine- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics associated with the presence of five urban predators (black and brown rats, European hedgehogs, house mice, and brushtail possums) in three New Zealand cities, in spring and autumn, in three green space types: forest fragments, amenity parks, and residential gardens. Season contributed to variations in detections for all five taxa. Rodents were detected least in residential gardens; mice were detected more often in amenity parks. Hedgehogs were detected least in forest fragments. Possums were detected most often in forest fragments and least often in residential gardens. Some of this variation was explained by our models. Proximity of amenity parks to forest patches was strongly associated with presence of possums (positively), hedgehogs (positively), and rats (negatively). Conversely, proximity of residential gardens to forest patches was positively associated with rat presence. Rats were associated with shrub and lower canopy cover and mice with herb layer cover. In residential gardens, rat detection was associated with compost heaps. Successful restoration of biodiversity in these cities needs extensive, coordinated predator control programmes that engage urban residents.

TI  - Fostering the Resiliency of Urban Landscape through the Sustainable Spatial Planning of Green Spaces
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Background: It has been recognized that urban green spaces play a crucial role in providing many landscape services. The research aimed at identifying the main knowledge gaps in this framework and to support urban planning, taking into account the spatial configuration of green areas through a pilot study area, and mapping urban landscape services. Methods: In this research, (1) a systematic review, analyzed through a network analysis; (2) an urban pilot study to map the Urban Green Index and, jointly, the spatial composition and configuration of urban green areas, through the integration of three landscape metrics; and (3) the mapping of Urban Landscape Services Index have been carried out. Results: The 37% of the reviewed articles focused on regulating services, while the network analysis identified four clusters. The total Urban Green Index was 26%, and some districts showed a percentage that surpassed it. The total overall Green Connectivity Index was 21%. Some districts were the best providers of landscape services. Conclusions: This research was in line with the EU Joint Science for Policy Report suggesting giving emphasis to the spatial pattern map of green spaces in European cities to provide spatial data available for decision-makers in relation to GI deployment.</jats:p>

TI  - Long-term Christmas Bird Counts describe Neotropical urban bird diversity
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A significant gap in understanding the response of biodiversity to urban areas is the lack of long-term studies. Most of the information on urban birds comes from studies carried out in the northern hemisphere, and they include data that don’t exceed three years. Although short-term studies contribute to knowledge about bird community diversity and their spatial distribution in urban areas, they could be biased towards more conspicuous and abundant species. One of the few multi-temporal datasets available for birds in urban areas is the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). Using annual CBC data available between 2001 and 2018 from 21 urban and peri-urban sample sites assessed from the main cities of Colombia, we identified and analyzed long-term trends on the cumulative diversity of bird communities as well as on their spatial distribution. We estimated comparative trends in richness, abundance, similarity, and complementarity of avifauna for each city and sample site based on their responses to urbanization and dietary guilds. We identified almost a quarter of the species registered in Colombia (464 of 1954). The representativeness of the community obtained during 18 years exceeds 84%, showing richness that ranges between 214 and 278 species in the three cities. Bird species and individuals registered showed wide variation of the sample sites. We found more dwellers, insectivorous and granivorous species in urban areas, with frugivores relegated to peri-urban sites, usually coinciding with avoider species. Natural peri-urban areas and intra-urban wetlands and urban parks were the most important refuges for birds and maintained the highest avoider and utilizer species richness. Long-term inventories are fundamental for determining consolidated bird diversity and distributional patterns. This information established a baseline for decision-making and applying recommendations that allow reconciling the growing demand for urban areas with the need to preserve the native avifauna in megadiverse Neotropical countries such as Colombia.</jats:p>

PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p xml:lang="tr">Kentsel açık yeşil alanların temel bileşeni olarak bitkiler sadece estetik görünüşleri ile değil sağladıkları ekosistem hizmetleri ile de son derece önemlidirler. Bitkilerin kendilerinden beklenen faydaları sağlayabilmeleri için sahip oldukları özelliklerin bilinmesi ve bitkisel tasarımın doğru planlanıp uygulanması gerekir. Kentsel açık ve yeşil alanların tasarımında seçilen bitki taksonları hem fizyolojik hem de morfolojik özellikleri ile bir bütün olarak değerlendirilmelidir. Dolayısı ile kentlerde yapılacak bitkisel tasarım çalışmalarında kullanılacak olan bitki materyalinin sahip olduğu estetik özelliklerin yanı sıra aromatik özellikleri, zehirlilik durumları ve insanlar üzerinde alerjik reaksiyonlara neden olabilecek polen yayma özelliği gösterme durumları incelenmeli ve bu doğrultuda seçimler yapılmalıdır. Çalışma kapsamında Şanlıurfa ili Haliliye ilçesi açık ve yeşil alanlarında 85 bitki taksonu tespit edilmiştir. Bu bitkiler; yaşam formu, yaprak durumu, çiçeklenme zamanı, aromatik özellikleri, zehirlilik durumları ve alerjen oranları bakımından değerlendirilmiştir. Bu değerlendirme sonucunda doğal bitki kullanımının kısıtlı kaldığı, yaprak döken ve herdemyeşil bitki türlerinin dengeli kullanıldığı ve aromatik bitki çeşitliliği bakımından önemli bir zenginlik olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Ayrıca, açık yeşil alanlarda çok sayıda alerjen bitki kullanılmasının yanı sıra önemli sayıda zehir ihtiva eden bitki taksonu olduğu belirlenmiştir. Sonuç olarak tespit edilen bitki türlerinin bitkisel tasarım çalışmalarında kullanımları ile ilgili çeşitli öneriler geliştirilmiş ve açık yeşil alanlarda yapılan gözlem notları paylaşılmıştır.</jats:p>

TI  - The role of landscape in shaping bird community and implications for landscape management at Nanjing Lukou International Airport.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Understanding the patterns of bird diversity and its driving force is necessary for bird strike prevention. In this study, we investigated the effects of landscape on phylogenetic and functional diversity of bird communities at Nanjing Lukou International Airport (NLIA). Bird identifications and counting of individuals were carried out from November 2017 to October 2019. Based on the land-cover data, the landscape was divided into four main types, including farmlands, woodlands, wetlands, and urban areas. Bird phylogenetic and functional diversity were strongly affected by landscape matrix types. Species richness and Faith's phylogenetic distance were highest in woodlands, while mean pairwise distance (MPD), mean nearest-taxon distance (MNTD), and functional dispersion (FDis) were highest in wetlands. Based on the feeding behavior, carnivorous birds had the lowest species richness but had the highest FDis, which implied that carnivorous birds occupied most niches at the NLIA. Moreover, bird assemblages exhibited phylogenetic and functional clustering in the four kinds of landscapes. A variety of landscape attributes had significant effects on species diversity, phylogenetic and functional diversity. Landscape-scale factors played an important role in the shaping of bird communities around NLIA. Our results suggest that landscape management surrounding airports can provide new approaches for policymakers to mitigate wildlife strikes.

TI  - The Relationship between Landscape Construction and Bird Diversity: A Bibliometric Analysis.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urbanization development is the main cause of drastic habitat changes and biodiversity loss, and urban green space construction is one of the effective ways to mitigate biodiversity decay. The proper construction of urban green space landscapes can maintain or increase the resources provided by urban biodiversity, especially bird diversity. This paper is based on 4112 papers published in this research area between 2002 and 2022, and CiteSpace was used to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the research area in terms of the number of articles published, the country or region of publication, core authors, and academic development. The paper systematically reviews the hotspots, history, and frontiers of research on landscape architecture and bird diversity. At the same time, the relationship between landscape construction and bird diversity is discussed in the context of landscape features, vegetation characteristics, and human behavioral activities. The results revealed: (1) research on the association between landscape camping and bird diversity received high priority from 2002 to 2022. Moreover, this research area has become a mature discipline. (2) Throughout the research history, there are four research hotspots (fundamental research on bird communities, influencing factors related to changes in bird community characteristics, research on bird activity rhythms, and ecological and ornamental values of birds), four development stages (2002-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2015, and 2016-2022), and several research frontiers. (3) Our aim was to reasonably consider the activity characteristics of birds in future landscape construction, and to thoroughly study the landscape construction strategies and management principles for the harmonious coexistence of humans and birds.

TI  - The Role of Urban Cemeteries in Ecosystem Services and Habitat Protection
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Cemeteries, like urban public parks, are an important part of the urban ecosystem, providing semi-natural habitats for many plant and animal species as well as a wide range of ecosystem services: they improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island phenomenon and provide aesthetic and recreational value. This paper explores the role of the cemeteries in the green infrastructure network beyond their sacred and memorial role and their importance as a habitat for urban flora and fauna. In our study, we compared two large public cemeteries of Budapest (Nemzeti Sírkert/National Graveyard and Új Köztemető/New Public Cemetery) with the Zentralfriedhof Wien (Central Cemetery of Vienna), the latter of which has been forward-looking in terms of green infrastructure development and habitat creation in the past years. Our goal was to determine which maintenance technologies and green space development methods are most beneficial in terms of sustainable habitat creation and the use of appropriate plant species in public cemeteries.</jats:p>

TI  - Frontiers in Social–Ecological Urbanism
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>This paper describes a new approach in urban ecological design, referred to as social–ecological urbanism (SEU). It draws from research in resilience thinking and space syntax in the analysis of relationships between urban processes and urban form at the microlevel of cities, where social and ecological services are directly experienced by urban dwellers. The paper elaborates on three types of media for urban designers to intervene in urban systems, including urban form, institutions, and discourse, that together function as a significant enabler of urban change. The paper ends by presenting four future research frontiers with a potential to advance the field of social–ecological urbanism: (1) urban density and critical biodiversity thresholds, (2) human and non-human movement in urban space, (3) the retrofitting of urban design, and (4) reversing the trend of urban ecological illiteracy through affordance designs that connect people with nature and with each other.</jats:p>

TI  - Biodiversity sensitive urban design
PY  - 2017
AB  - Cities are increasingly considered important places for biodiversity conservation because they can harbor threatened species and because conservation in cities represents an opportunity to reconnect people with nature and the range of health and well-being benefits it provides. However, urbanization can be catastrophic for native species, and is a well-known threat to biodiversity worldwide. Urbanization impacts can be mitigated by urban design and development improvements, but take-up of these practices has been slow. There is an urgent need to incorporate existing ecological knowledge into a framework that can be used by planners and developers to ensure that biodiversity conservation is considered in decision-making processes. Here, we distill the urban biodiversity literature into five principles for biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD), ranging from creating habitat and promoting dispersal to facilitating community stewardship. We then present a framework for implementing BSUD aimed at delivering onsite benefits to biodiversity, and that is applicable across a range of urban development types and densities. We illustrate the application of the BSUD framework in two case studies focusing on the: (1) protection of an endangered vegetation remnant in a new low-density subdivision; and (2) persistence of an endangered reptile in an established suburban environment.

TI  - Determining the Origins of Plants at a Vancouver Park to Help Preserve Urban Biodiversity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Preserving natural biodiversity is a great way to increase ecological richness (Vila-Ruiz et al,2014.) and to help do so, I made it my objective to determine how many plant species are nativeor non-native to North America in a Vancouver park. I hypothesized that if the majority of theplants in the park I had surveyed were non-native to North America, then it was likely that otherparks in the city had a majority of plants non-native to North America as well. I counted treesand individual plants by sight and used a plotless distance-based plant survey technique, theclosest individual method, to determine the number of higher-density plants in the area. It wasdetermined that the majority of the plants were not native to North America (150/244 plants).The p-value was found to be 0.9185. There was no significant difference between the native andnon-native plants in Vancouver. The reasons for this are most likely due to sources of error, suchas the plotless technique I used or issues in plant identification. There were a few limitationsduring this study such as the fall weather and park restrictions. In the end, it was found that themajority of the plants in the park were non-native to North America and this has no effect on theother parks in the city.

TI  - Punching above their weight: the ecological and social benefits of pop-up parks
PY  - 2019
AB  - Current global enthusiasm for urban greening and bringing nature back into cities is unprecedented. Evidence of the socioecological benefits of large, permanent greenspaces is mounting, but the collective potential for pop-up parks (PUPs) – small, temporary greenspaces – to augment urban ecosystem services is unknown. To showcase the potential of PUPs, we first highlight a case study demonstrating how PUPs may enhance biodiversity in a densely urbanized area; we then review evidence linking the design of small greenspaces with positive social outcomes, including benefits to human well-being. Finally, we emphasize how PUPs can function as socioecological laboratories to help inform urban design, and then propose a research agenda to better understand how PUPs may be optimally designed to provide benefits to humans and other species.

TI  - Airsheds, watersheds and more – The flows that drive intra-extra-urban connections, and their implications for nature-based solutions (NBS)
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Cities interact with their surroundings from local to global scales in many domains • Here we define watersheds, airsheds, biodiversitysheds, resourcesheds and peoplesheds • Each shed can operate at multiple scales, which do not neatly overlap • There are interactions among these environmental, economic and social sheds • This understanding can help plan NBS to provide greater benefits and fewer trade-offs Cities are highly complex, inter-connected social-ecological systems, encompassing social, built and natural/semi-natural components. They interact with their surrounding extra-urban areas at varying scales, from peri-urban and rural to global. Space is a valuable commodity in cities. However, in most instances, city planners tend to think about interventions only within cities and rarely about the wider connected domains outside. Yet, considering the wider spatial context, including space outside of the city boundaries, may open up opportunities to achieve substantially greater benefit for city residents without sacrificing valuable space, leading to more sustainable city design for people and the environment. In this paper we discuss the intra-extra-urban flows which connect cities to their wider airsheds, watersheds, biodiversitysheds and resourcesheds, which in turn interact with their peoplesheds. For each domain, we illustrate the processes and the scales they operate at, and discuss the implications for optimum location of nature-based solutions (NBS) to address urban challenges. We suggest that integrating knowledge about these multiple sheds can inform holistic design of NBS to deliver greater benefit for city residents. This takes into account the synergies and multi-functional co-benefits which arise from a careful consideration of place and people, while minimising potential disbenefits and trade-offs.

TI  - Structure and Characteristics of Plant-Frugivore Network in an Urban Park: A Case Study in Nanjing Botanical Garden Mem. Sun Yat-Sen
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Interaction between animals and plants is an important way to maintain terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem function, but little is known about the structure of reciprocal networks between fruit plants and frugivore birds in urban habitats. To explore the characteristics of the plant–frugivore network and network roles of species, we observed the fruit ripening phenology of 21 species of fruit plants and the interactions between these plants and 39 species of frugivore birds during the whole year in a large urban park. Then, we assessed the characteristics of the total plant–frugivore and seasonal networks, and analyzed the network roles of species and the relationship between their network roles and ecological traits. Fruit ripened mainly in autumn and winter, and interaction connections in the two seasons contributed 39.68% and 44.83% to the total network, respectively. The specialization (H2′), connectance (C), nestedness, and interaction evenness (eH2) of the network were lower in autumn and winter, while the interaction diversity was higher. Compared with the networks (N = 1000) generated by the null model, the observed network exhibited higher nestedness and interaction diversity (E2) and lower specialization (H2′), connectance (C), and interaction evenness (eH2). A correlation analysis combining ecological traits and network roles showed that plants with black fruit had higher effective partners and partner diversity, while other traits of plants and birds were not significantly correlated with their network parameters.

TI  - Responses of Urban Bird Assemblages to Land-Sparing and Land-Sharing Development Styles in Two Argentinian Cities.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urbanization negatively affects biodiversity worldwide. Consequently, alternative urban development styles are required for an eco-friendlier urbanization process. Thus, two development styles have been suggested: land-sharing (buildings mixed with dispersed green space) and land-sparing (buildings interspersed with large green patches). We assessed differences in species diversity and composition of bird assemblages between both development styles in two Argentinian cities: Santa Fe and Buenos Aires. We surveyed birds in land-sharing and land-sparing areas during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. As a control, we also surveyed birds in areas dominated by impervious surfaces. At a local scale, we also measured the environmental noise and pedestrian traffic. At a landscape scale, we measured the percent vegetation cover surrounding development styles and their distance to the main river. In Buenos Aires, species richness was higher in land-sparing than in land-sharing. However, the Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity were higher in land-sharing. In Santa Fe, both urban development styles supported similar species richness and diversity. Species composition varied between land-sharing and land-sparing in both cities during the breeding season. The pedestrian traffic was negatively associated with species diversity. Therefore, both development styles and strategies to reduce pedestrian traffic should be taken into account to enhance different components of species diversity and composition within the urban matrix.

TI  - Urbanization increases fluctuating asymmetry and affects behavioral traits of a common grasshopper.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization has a major impact on biodiversity. For many organisms, the urbanization process means environmental stress caused by fragmentation and increased temperatures in cities and atmospheric, soil, light, and noise pollution. Such environmental stress can influence both the morphology and behavior of animals. Hence, individuals might be selected for survival-facilitating traits under high pressures in urban areas. The specific impact of urbanization on insect behavior is still largely unexplored. We studied the impact of urbanization on one of the most common grasshopper species in Germany, <i>Chorthippus biguttulus</i>, by comparing morphological and behavioral traits of individuals sampled from grasslands with low, medium, and high urbanization levels. We first investigated whether urbanization as a stressor affected body size and fluctuating asymmetry in the locomotor organs. Next, we examined whether urbanization induced changes in the individuals' boldness and activity. Our results showed that fluctuating asymmetry of grasshoppers' locomotory organs increased more than twofold with urbanization level. Further, individuals' boldness and walking activity increased from areas with low to high urbanization levels. Our results indicate strong responses of grasshoppers in terms of morphology and behavior to the urban environment. To compensate for urbanization effects on arthropod populations, management strategies need to be developed that maintain ecological processes and reduce environmental stress in urban areas.

TI  - How much city is too much city? Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning along an urban gradient at the interface of land and sea
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>A huge proportion of the world’s population resides in urban areas along the coast. As cities expand, the ability of coastal ecosystems to provide the benefits people derive from nature, ranging from food from fisheries to coastal defense to maritime transportation and beyond, is in question. While it is well understood that coastal development changes ecosystems, quantitative insights about how terrestrial urbanization fundamentally alters ecosystem structure and function in adjacent freshwater and downstream coastal marine habitats remain rare, though a general expectation is that impacts of terrestrial urbanization will attenuate from land to freshwater to coastal marine habitats. Empirical assessments of these phenomena are especially important for species that rely on freshwater and coastal marine habitats at multiple points in their life cycles, including endangered and threatened Pacific salmon (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus</jats:italic> spp.). We investigated associations between landscape-scale urbanization and ecosystem structure (biodiversity of epibenthic invertebrate taxa) and function (benthic net primary productivity and decomposition) in freshwater and coastal marine habitats across six pairs of more and less urbanized, coastal watersheds in Puget Sound, WA, USA, using principal components analysis, analysis of covariance, and Mantel tests. Greater upland urbanization was associated with greater reductions in freshwater biodiversity, measured as the density and evenness of epibenthic invertebrate families. In contrast and surprisingly, however, coastal marine biodiversity (measured as the density and evenness of epibenthic invertebrate families) tended to be higher at more urbanized sites, suggesting the potential role of low to moderate levels of urbanization-related disturbance in determining coastal marine biodiversity patterns. We found no statistical association between urbanization and freshwater and coastal marine ecosystem functions, estimated from changes in accumulated algal biomass on tiles (benthic net primary productivity) and loss of biomass from litter bags (decomposition). In addition, there was no evidence that changes in ecosystem structure and function with urbanization were more severe in freshwater than coastal marine habitats, as might be expected if the land-sea boundary diminished effects of landscape-scale urbanization. Our results suggest that the effects of urbanization can be complex and that attention to terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal marine systems in concert will produce more effective, ecosystem-based management.</jats:p>

TI  - Integrating ecosystem services and landscape connectivity into the optimization of ecological security pattern: a case study of the Pearl River Delta, China.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The ecological security pattern (ESP) focuses on key ecological elements in ecosystems by identifying, combining, and evaluating these elements. This study attempts to identify the ESP of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and provide suggestions for optimization. Ecosystem services were calculated and applied to construct the ecological resistance surface; morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity analysis were used to identify ecological sources; and minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model was applied to extract ecological corridors and ecological nodes. The results show that during 1995 to 2015, the main landscape transformation occurred between forest, cropland, and urban land, and the location of the transformation was mainly in the central part of the study area. Regarding the ESP, the average resistance value increased from 0.30 to 0.33; the area of ecological sources decreased by 5.12%; the ratio of total cumulative resistance to the length of the corridors increased by 14.82%; and the number of ecological nodes increased from 71 to 99. For the ESP optimization, based on the correction of the resistance surface, 1348 km blue corridors and 61 blue nodes were extracted. Based on hot spot analysis, nine stepping stones were identified. This optimization compensates for the lack of ecological elements in the center of the study area, enhances weaker corridors, and improves the connectivity of the ESP, thus making the ESP more stable and complete. The ESP constructed and optimized in this paper holds great significance and serves as a valuable reference for ecological protection and environmental management.

TI  - The response of plant diversity to human dominance in the meta-watershed ecosystem of Southwest China
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Intensified urban development threatened forest and riparian plant diversity. • Socioeconomic and water conservancy development deteriorated plant diversity. • Riparian plants were more susceptible to artificial development than forest plants. • Human dominance destroys ecosystem services provision in meta-watershed ecosystems. Plant diversity is essential to maintain terrestrial ecosystem stability and balance, but it is highly susceptible to environmental changes that are generally dominated by human activities. In the natural habitat, plant growth and distribution patterns are known to be regulated by abiotic environments such as water, temperature, and nutrient. However, how growing human dominance impacts plant diversity at the watershed scale remains unclear. From the view of the meta-watershed ecosystem, this study constructed indicators to examine the plant diversity responses in karst watersheds of different urban development intensities. The results revealed that the growing urban development intensity deteriorated plant diversity and riparian plant diversity in the meta-watershed ecosystem. Both socioeconomic and water conservancy development had noticeable adverse effects on plant diversity. The riparian plants were more susceptible to artificial development than forest plants. The predicted results of various development scenarios suggest that, by the middle of the 21st century, plant diversity and food production in the watershed will meet a crisis unless forest protection policies are applied, and large-scale urban expansion is curbed. In the meta-watershed ecosystem, growing human dominance increasingly destroys plant diversity and the ecosystem supply. Policies and measures are urgently needed to reverse the potential deteriorating trend of the ecosystem, maintain the stability of the ecosystem, and promote the sustainable development of human society.

TI  - The role of the urban landscape on species with contrasting dispersal ability: Insights from greening plans for Barcelona
PY  - 2020
AB  - With the expansion of urban areas, promoting urban biodiversity is now a priority. Many municipalities are implementing greening strategies to improve and increase green space within city boundaries. The effectiveness of these strategies, while rarely assessed, likely depends on the landscape and on relevant species intrinsic traits such as dispersal ability. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we evaluated the effect of the urban landscape on the projected distribution of three butterfly species with contrasting dispersal abilities, and assessed the effectiveness of the Barcelona greening strategy as a case study. Species distribution (in terms of patch occupancy) and effectiveness (in terms of population size and number of occupied gardens) were analysed using generalised linear models. The percentage of (semi) natural source area around each urban green space (garden hereafter) was the most important variable for the distribution of all three types of species, followed by the percentage of neighbouring gardens and by the garden carrying capacity, although the effect of neighbouring gardens was negative in the early phase of colonisation. The planned Barcelona greening strategy increased the number of gardens occupied by high and medium, but not by low dispersive species. Increasing the carrying capacity of the gardens improved colonisation for all three species types. While the best strategies can be context dependent, our results indicated that increasing garden area might be more effective in the long term but it can be overridden by garden capacity in the short term, especially if there are constraints to increasing garden area.

TI  - Examining component-based city health by implementing a fuzzy evaluation approach
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Cities have become the most important habitats for mankind in most regions of the world. Many researchers and organizations have attempted to evaluate the states of cities from the perspective of their functionalities. However, the comprising components of a city, which provide these functions, have not been evaluated explicitly and systematically. These components include people, infrastructure and environment, all of which are the foundations of city health and sustainability. In this study, we used the analogy of a healthy human and defined a healthy city as a state of complete demographic, infrastructural and environmental well-being, which means that all components are present with integrity and sufficiency and also function effectively, harmoniously and sustainably. Based on this concept, a component-based city health examination framework was constructed and tested in three major cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen) in both 2010 and 2015. A total of 27 indicators (seven for People, ten for Infrastructure and ten for Environment), each with a health reference value, were chosen and calculated. The fuzzy logic method was selected to perform the evaluation task due to its effectiveness in assessing uncertain and relatively subjective objects. Results showed that all three case study cities failed to meet the healthy condition in both years. Shenzhen was, relatively, the healthiest city among the three in 2015 and had the highest health score in Infrastructure and Environment. Shanghai possessed the highest score in People in both years. Additionally, five indicators with the largest potential for improvement were also identified for each city. This component-based city health evaluation model can be applied to better inform urban planning policies and potentially improve the quality of life in cities in the future.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal Networks in the Anthropocene: From Natural Ecosystems to Urban Planning.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Trees acquire hydric and mineral soil resources through root mutualistic associations. In most boreal, temperate and Mediterranean forests, these functions are realized by a chimeric structure called ectomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are highly diversified and vary widely in their specificity toward plant hosts. Reciprocally, association patterns of ECM plants range from highly specialist to generalist. As a consequence, ECM symbiosis creates interaction networks, which also mediate plant-plant nutrient interactions among different individuals and drive plant community dynamics. Our knowledge of ECM networks essentially relies on a corpus acquired in temperate ecosystems, whereas the below-ground facets of both anthropogenic ECM forests and inter-tropical forests remain poorly investigated. Here, we successively (1) review the current knowledge of ECM networks, (2) examine the content of early literature produced in ECM cultivated forests, (3) analyze the recent progress that has been made in understanding the place of ECM networks in urban soils, and (4) provide directions for future research based on the identification of knowledge gaps. From the examined corpus of knowledge, we reach three main conclusions. First, the emergence of metabarcoding tools has propelled a resurgence of interest in applying network theory to ECM symbiosis. These methods revealed an unexpected interconnection between mutualistic plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) herbaceous plants, embedding ECM mycelia through root-endophytic interactions. This affinity of ECM fungi to bind VA and ECM plants, raises questions on the nature of the associated functions. Second, despite the central place of ECM trees in cultivated forests, little attention has been paid to these man-made landscapes and in-depth research on this topic is lacking. Third, we report a lag in applying the ECM network theory to urban soils, despite management initiatives striving to interconnect motile organisms through ecological corridors, and the highly challenging task of interconnecting fixed organisms in urban greenspaces is discussed. In particular, we observe a pauperized nature of resident ECM inoculum and a spatial conflict between belowground human pipelines and ECM networks. Finally, we identify the main directions of future research to make the needed link between the current picture of plant functioning and the understanding of belowground ECM networks.

TI  - A global consistent positive effect of urban green area size on bird richness
PY  - 2019
AB  - Although the species-urban green area relationship (SARu) has been analyzed worldwide, the global consistency of its parameters, such as the fit and the slope of models, remains unexplored. Moreover, the SARu can be explained by 20 different models. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate which models provide a better explanation of SARus and, focusing on the power model, to evaluate the global heterogeneity in its fit and slope. We tested the performance of multiple statistical models in accounting for the way in which species richness increases with area, and examined whether variability in model form was associated with various methodological and environmental factors. Focusing on the power model, we analyzed the global heterogeneity in the fit and slope of the models through a meta-analysis. Among 20 analyzed models, the linear model provided the best fit to the most datasets, was the top ranked model according to our efficiency criterion, and was the top overall ranked model. The Kobayashi and power models were the second and third overall ranked models, respectively. The number of green areas and the minimum number of species within a green area were the only significant variables explaining the variation in model form and performance, accounting for less than 10% of the variation. Based on the power model, there was a consistent overall fit (r2 = 0.50) and positive slope of 0.20 for the species richness increase with area worldwide. The good fit of the linear model to our SARu datasets contrasts with the non-linear SAR frequently found in true and non-urban habitat island systems; however, this finding may be a result of the small sample size of many SARu datasets. The overall power model slope of 0.20 suggests low levels of isolation among urban green patches, or alternatively that habitat specialist and area sensitive species have already been extirpated from urban green areas.

TI  - Green infrastructure through the lens of “One Health”: A systematic review and integrative framework uncovering synergies and trade-offs between mental health and wildlife support in cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Green infrastructure improves environmental health in cities, benefits human health, and provides habitat for wildlife. Increasing urbanization has demanded the expansion of urban areas and transformation of existing cities. The adoption of compact design in urban planning is a recommended strategy to minimize environmental impacts; however, it may undermine green infrastructure networks within cities as it sets a battleground for urban space. Under this scenario, multifunctionality of green spaces is highly desirable but reconciling human needs and biodiversity conservation in a limited space is still a challenge. Through a systematic review, we first compiled urban green space's characteristics that affect mental health and urban wildlife support, and then identified potential synergies and trade-offs between these dimensions. A framework based on the One Health approach is proposed, synthesizing the interlinkages between green space quality, mental health, and wildlife support; providing a new holistic perspective on the topic. Looking at the human-wildlife-environment relationships simultaneously may contribute to practical guidance on more effective green space design and management that benefit all dimensions.

TI  - Wild inside: Urban wild boar select natural, not anthropogenic food resources.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Most wildlife species are urban avoiders, but some became urban utilizers and dwellers successfully living in cities. Often, they are assumed to be attracted into urban areas by easily accessible and highly energetic anthropogenic food sources. We macroscopically analysed stomachs of 247 wild boar (Sus scrofa, hereafter WB) from urban areas of Berlin and from the surrounding rural areas. From the stomach contents we determined as predictors of food quality modulus of fineness (MOF,), percentage of acid insoluble ash (AIA) and macronutrients such as amount of energy and percentage of protein, fat, fibre and starch. We run linear mixed models to test: (1) differences in the proportion of landscape variables, (2) differences of nutrients consumed in urban vs. rural WB and (3) the impact of landscape variables on gathered nutrients. We found only few cases of anthropogenic food in the qualitative macroscopic analysis. We categorized the WB into five stomach content categories but found no significant difference in the frequency of those categories between urban and rural WB. The amount of energy was higher in stomachs of urban WB than in rural WB. The analysis of landscape variables revealed that the energy of urban WB increased with increasing percentage of sealing, while an increased human density resulted in poor food quality for urban and rural WB. Although the percentage of protein decreased in areas with a high percentage of coniferous forests, the food quality increased. High percentage of grassland decreased the percentage of consumed fat and starch and increased the percentage of fibre, while a high percentage of agricultural areas increased the percentage of consumed starch. Anthropogenic food such as garbage might serve as fallback food when access to natural resources is limited. We infer that urban WB forage abundant, natural resources in urban areas. Urban WB might use anthropogenic resources (e.g. garbage) if those are easier to exploit and more abundant than natural resources. This study shows that access to natural resources still is mandatory and drives the amount of protein, starch, fat or fibre in wild boar stomachs in urban as well as rural environments.

TI  - Occupancy-frequency distribution of birds in land-sharing and -sparing urban landscapes in Europe
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Species presence/absence patterns can estimate wide-scale metacommunity diversity. • Land-sparing urban areas had more rare species than land-sharing areas across Europe. • A land-sharing development type can increase the number of common bird species. • City geographical locations explained core and satellite species number variations. Species richness is a widely used proxy for patterns of biodiversity variation in metacommunities. However, deeper analyses require additional metrics, such as the occupancy-frequency distributions (SOFD) of different local communities. The SOFD patterns indicate the number of shared species between study sites; therefore, they can provide new insights into the current debate on how to create more biodiversity-friendly cities. Breeding birds were counted from 593 point-count stations located in five 500 m × 500 m squares in land-sharing (LSH; low-density built areas interspersed with green spaces) and five similar nearby squares in land-sparing (LSP; densely built-up with set-aside, large-sized, continuous green spaces) landscapes in nine cities across Europe. High beta-diversity (with over 42% of the 103 species detected being restricted to a single city and only 7% found in all studied cities) showed the uniqueness of cities at the continental scale. Urban bird metacommunities followed the unimodal-satellite SOFD pattern at the European continental scale but a bimodal symmetric or asymmetric distribution at the city-level scale, suggesting that many common species occur in cities on a smaller scale. The LSP urban areas followed a unimodal satellite SOFD pattern with numerous rare species. In contrast, the LSH areas fit several types of bimodal SOFD patterns equally well, where communities share several common species. The findings also highlight the need to use multi-scale approaches to analyze the effects of LSH-LSP urban designs on urban bird diversity.

TI  - Beyond Assuming Co-Benefits in Nature-Based Solutions: A Human-Centered Approach to Optimize Social and Ecological Outcomes for Advancing Sustainable Urban Planning
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization deletes and degrades natural ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and alienates people from the experience of nature. Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are inspired and supported by nature have the potential to deliver multifunctional environmental and social benefits to address these challenges in urban areas under context-specific conditions. NbS implementation often relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit (e.g., biodiversity conservation) may have no influence on, or even negatively affect, others (e.g., social justice). Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes, prohibiting the identification of optimal solutions that maximize synergies across pathways. We present a comprehensive socio-ecological framework that addresses these issues by recognizing that cities are human-dominated environments that are foremost built and maintained to support humans. Our framework demonstrates how we can use experiments and niche species models to understand and predict where species will be and where people will be healthy and happy in a comparable manner. This knowledge can then be integrated into decision support tools that use optimization algorithms to understand trade-offs, identify synergies, and provide planners with the tools needed to tailor context-specific NbS to yield greener, more resilient cities with happier people and reduced inequality.

TI  - Nesting Site and Plumage Color Are the Main Traits Associated with Bird Species Presence in Urban Areas.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban areas are expected to grow in the next decades, filtering bird species from the regional pool based on their life history traits. Although the impact of urbanization on traits such as diet, habitat and migratory behavior has been analyzed, their joint role with other traits related to plumage color has not yet been analyzed. Urban characteristics such as impervious surfaces, human presence and pollutants may be related to dark and uniform plumages. The objective of this study is to determine different bird species responses to urbanization using ordination analysis, and to characterize their life history traits combining information about diet, habitat and plumage color. Birds were surveyed along urban-rural gradients located in three cities of central Argentina. Species associations with urban characteristics were assessed through principal component analysis. Two axes were obtained: the first related positively to urban exploiters and negatively to urban avoiders, and a second axis related negatively to urban adapters. The scores of each axis were related to species traits through phylogenetic generalized least squares models. Species identified as 'urban exploiters' tended to nest in buildings and have uniform plumage, whereas those identified as 'urban avoiders' tended to be ground-nesting species with variable plumage. A third type, 'urban adapters', tended to be tree-nesting species with a low diet breadth, intermediate plumage lightness, low presence of plumage sexual dimorphism and high presence of iridescence. The results suggest that nest predation and habitat loss may exclude ground nesting birds from urban areas. The high density of pedestrians and domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, in urban centers may favor uniform plumages in birds that enhance camouflage.

TI  - Preserving butterfly diversity in an ever‐expanding urban landscape? A case study in the highlands of Chiapas, México
PY  - 2019
AB  - We examined the relationship between landscape structure and composition, geographic ranges, microhabitat characteristics and the diversity of butterflies (Papilionidae, Nymphalidae, Pieridae, Hesperiidae, Lycaenidae) in an expanding urban landscape in the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. Between 2001 and 2016, mountain wetlands, secondary forest, and agro-pasture land, have declined significantly in area covered due to increasing housing activities and expansion of roads and conversion of land for cattle activity. Cloud forest exhibited a minor positive expansion in area, mostly through forest regeneration. In total, we recorded 3630 individuals from 90 species at key sites spanning natural, semi-natural and urban areas. A rarefaction curve analysis for local richness indicated that mountain wetland sites recorded the highest butterfly diversity. Logistic regression analyses suggested that species with narrow geographic ranges could be associated to cloud-forest sites, and that species with relatively more widespread distributions in the Neotropics were more likely to be classified as occurring in mountain wetland habitats. This was confirmed by IndVal analyses from which we identified 39 butterfly species as potential reliable land-cover indicators. Furthermore, canonical correspondence analyses suggested significant associations for the values of butterfly abundance and microhabitat variables such as canopy cover, open areas, presence of grasses, bare soil or rocks. It is a matter of urgency that should put in place monitoring schemes to assess occupancy and change so we can assess changes in the status of butterfly species in rapidly-expanding urban landscapes in tropical Mexico.

TI  - Influence of urbanization on the occurrence and activity of aerial insectivorous bats
PY  - 2016
AB  - Activity and species-specific responses of insectivorous bats in different urban-forest conditions provides a general perspective on the adaptability and vulnerability of bat species towards urbanization intensity. Here we evaluated species richness and activity patterns of aerial insectivorous bats across an urbanized landscape in the highlands of Chiapas, in Mexico. Acoustic monitoring of echolocation calls was conducted for 27 nights over a period of four months. Species richness and relative activity of insectivorous bats were estimated in a landscape with different conditions of urbanization intensity: urban areas, non-urban and forest areas. We identified a total of 14 bat species and three phonotypes. Bat species richness and relative activity was similar (X2 = 0.568, gl = 2, p > 0.05), but species composition differed among conditions. We observed a significant higher occurrence of Bauerus dubiaquercus, Eptesicus brasiliensis and Myotis californicus in forest sites. Urban sites presented higher occurrence of Molossus rufus and phonotype Molossidae 2, while non-urban sites presented a higher occurrence of Eptesicus furinalis and phonotype Molossidae 2. We were able to identify bat species according to their relative activity in relation todifferent landscape conditions. Species of the Molossidae family presented the highest activity in urban sites, which was positively affected by the number of streetlights, while species of the Vespertilionidae presented the highest activity in forest sites, which was positively related totree density. While urbanization tends to diminish native biodiversity and alter faunal communities, our results show a similar richness and relative activity of aerial insectivorous bats along the urban ecosystem. The effect of urbanization intensity becomes more apparent in species-specific bat activity; the response of species towards particular habitat conditions depends on local habitat quality and characteristics (i.e., presence of streetlights, vegetation cover and tree density).

TI  - Vegetation structure drives taxonomic diversity and functional traits of birds in urban private native forest fragments
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many studies in urban landscapes have revealed that vegetation structure influences the taxonomic diversity and traits of birds and drives greater bird richness in greenspaces. However, most of these studies have been carried out mainly in public spaces. Private lands represent large components of cityscapes worldwide, and so understanding the role they play in the maintenance of biodiversity, and how vegetation traits drive the ecological attributes of birds, remain poorly known. Here we identified local factors of vegetation related to the bird fauna of urban private native forest fragments in Sorocaba, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a focus on their ecological attributes. We predicted that increased vegetation structure would select birds that depend on forest environments and the resources they support. We sampled 13 vegetation traits in 28 private urban native forests to evaluate the relationship between vegetation structure and taxonomic diversity and functional traits of birds. Confirming our prediction, vegetation structure shaped the ecological attributes of birds, with five vegetation traits driving bird taxonomic diversity and functional traits, of which the number of standing dead trees was related to more bird ecological attributes. Vegetation structure in urban private native forest fragments may increase habitats and resources, thus supporting habitat- and feeding-specialist species. Our results provide insights for public policies aimed at management and maintaining vegetation structures that benefit bird fauna (e.g. number of standing dead trees, tree richness, canopy cover), in support of the ecological functions they perform in urban landscapes.

TI  - Dietary niche breadth influences the effects of urbanization on the gut microbiota of sympatric rodents.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cities are among the most extreme forms of anthropogenic ecosystem modification, and urbanization processes exert profound effects on animal populations through multiple ecological pathways. Increased access to human-associated food items may alter species' foraging behavior and diet, in turn modifying the normal microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), ultimately impacting their health. It is crucial we understand the role of dietary niche breadth and the resulting shift in the gut microbiota as urban animals navigate novel dietary resources. We combined stable isotope analysis of hair and microbiome analysis of four gut regions across the GIT to investigate the effects of urbanization on the diet and gut microbiota of two sympatric species of rodents with different dietary niches: the omnivorous large Japanese field mouse (<i>Apodemus speciosus</i>) and the relatively more herbivorous gray red-backed vole (<i>Myodes rufocanus</i>). Both species exhibited an expanded dietary niche width within the urban areas potentially attributable to novel anthropogenic foods and altered resource availability. We detected a dietary shift in which urban <i>A. speciosus</i> consumed more terrestrial animal protein and <i>M. rufocanus</i> more plant leaves and stems. Such changes in resource use may be associated with an altered gut microbial community structure. There was an increased abundance of the presumably probiotic <i>Lactobacillus</i> in the small intestine of urban <i>A. speciosus</i> and potentially pathogenic <i>Helicobacter</i> in the colon of <i>M. rufocanus</i>. Together, these results suggest that even taxonomically similar species may exhibit divergent responses to urbanization with consequences for the gut microbiota and broader ecological interactions.

TI  - High Diversity in Urban Areas: How Comprehensive Sampling Reveals High Ant Species Richness within One of the Most Urbanized Regions of the World
PY  - 2021
AB  - The continuous increase in urbanization has been perceived as a major threat for biodiversity, particularly within tropical regions. Urban areas, however, may still provide opportunities for conservation. In this study focused on Macao (China), one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, we used a comprehensive approach, targeting all the vertical strata inhabited by ants, to document the diversity of both native and exotic species, and to produce an updated checklist. We then compared these results with 112 studies on urban ants to illustrate the dual roles of cities in sustaining ant diversity and supporting the spread of exotic species. Our study provides the first assessment on the vertical distribution of urban ant communities, allowing the detection of 55 new records in Macao, for a total of 155 ant species (11.5% being exotic); one of the highest species counts reported for a city globally. Overall, our results contrast with the dominant paradigm that urban landscapes have limited conservation value but supports the hypothesis that cities act as gateways for exotic species. Ultimately, we argue for a more comprehensive understanding of ants within cities around the world to understand native and exotic patterns of diversity.

TI  - Urban Green and Biodiversity
PY  - 2017
AB  - The chapter explores the relationship between urban green and biodiversity . Cities are home to a large number of native plant and animal species. Non-native species are an essential component for the species richness in the cities worldwide. The population of animal and plant species is not stable and the number of native species has been declining over the last decades and the portion of non-native species is increasing. Public and private gardening are main causes for the introduction of non-native species. The different contrasting attitudes towards non-native species between urban dwellers and nature conservationists are discussed. Three approaches are described representing different scales, namely the city in the region, the urban matrix and green patches. These three approaches offer a sophisticated view about the relationship between urban green and biodiversity and provide ways for a tailored management to improve biodiversity in urban areas. For each scale, recommendations for the management of urban green are presented. The chapter ends with basic principles for the development and management of green areas and green structures to enhance urban biodiversity and ecosystem services in cities.

TI  - A Research Agenda for Urban Biodiversity in the Global Extinction Crisis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rapid urbanization and the global loss of biodiversity necessitate the development of a research agenda that addresses knowledge gaps in urban ecology that will inform policy, management, and conservation. To advance this goal, we present six topics to pursue in urban biodiversity research: the socioeconomic and social-ecological drivers of biodiversity loss versus gain of biodiversity; the response of biodiversity to technological change; biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships; urban areas as refugia for biodiversity; spatiotemporal dynamics of species, community changes, and underlying processes; and ecological networks. We discuss overarching considerations and offer a set of questions to inspire and support urban biodiversity research. In parallel, we advocate for communication and collaboration across many fields and disciplines in order to build capacity for urban biodiversity research, education, and practice. Taken together we note that urban areas will play an important role in addressing the global extinction crisis.

TI  - Review: Improving the Impact of Plant Science on Urban Planning and Design
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban planning is a vital process in determining the functionality of future cities. It is predicted that at least two thirds of the world’s citizens will reside in towns and cities by the middle of this century, up from one third in the middle of the previous century. Not only is it essential to provide space for work and dwelling, but also for their well-being. Well-being is inextricably linked with the surrounding environment, and natural landscapes have a potent positive effect. For this reason, the inclusion and management of urban green infrastructure has become a topic of increasing scientific interest. Elements of this infrastructure, including green roofs and facades are of growing importance to operators in each stage of the planning, design and construction process in urban areas. Currently, there is a strong recognition that “green is good”. Despite the positive recognition of urban greenery, and the concerted efforts to include more of it in cities, greater scientific attention is needed to better understand its role in the urban environment. For example, many solutions are cleverly engineered without giving sufficient consideration to the biology of the vegetation that is used. This review contends that whilst “green is good” is a positive mantra to promote the inclusion of urban greenery, there is a significant opportunity to increase the contribution of plant science to the process of urban planning through both green infrastructure, and biomimicry.

TI  - Comparing community garden typologies of Baltimore, Chicago, and New York City (USA) to understand potential implications for socio-ecological services
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban community gardens offer unique social and ecological benefits in cities. However, given the dynamic nature of cities and the profound effects of variable land uses on green space provisioning for people and wildlife, investigating community gardens from a landscape perspective offers valuable insight into the functions of these spaces in terms of ecosystem services and sustainable development. In this study, we use garden locations provided by stakeholder groups and fine-scale spatial data to compare community gardens across three cities: New York City, NY, Chicago, IL, and Baltimore, MD (USA). In each city, we assess the spatial distribution of gardens and compare the natural vegetation and impervious surface cover within these gardens to the surrounding neighborhood and landscape. We then compared these cities to clarify the role of community gardens in metropolitan development. Our findings demonstrate that gardens cluster in neighborhoods in New York City and Chicago, but they are more spatially distributed across the landscape in Baltimore. The distribution of Baltimore’s community gardens is more likely to be contributing to a greater network of ecosystem services across a broader urban landscape. Moreover, at the garden scale, gardens in NYC and Chicago have more canopy cover and built infrastructure than the more herbaceous gardens in Baltimore. This suggests that our case study cities exhibit different garden typologies, histories, and potential for ecosystem services. This work provides critical insight into the typology in and around community gardens in different cities, which is useful in understanding the potential ecosystem services and planning trajectories of these cities.

TI  - Butterfly richness and abundance along a gradient of imperviousness and the importance of matrix quality
PY  - 2020
AB  - Heterogeneity in quantity and quality of resources provided in the urban matrix may mitigate adverse effects of urbanization intensity on the structure of biotic communities. To assess this we quantified the spatial variation in butterfly richness and abundance along an impervious surface gradient using three measures of urban matrix quality: floral resource availability and origin (native vs. exotic plants), tree cover, and the occurrence of remnant habitat patches. Butterfly richness and abundance were surveyed in 100 cells (500 × 500 m), selected using a random-stratified sampling design, across a continuous gradient of imperviousness in Melbourne, Australia. Sampling occurred twice during the butterfly flight season. Occurrence data were analyzed using generalized linear models at local and mesoscales. Despite high sampling completeness, we did not detect 75% of species from the regional species pool in the urban area, suggesting that urbanization has caused a large proportion of the region's butterflies to become absent or extremely rare within Melbourne's metro-area. Those species that do remain are largely very generalist in their choice of larval host plants. Butterfly species richness and abundance declined with increasing impervious surface cover and, contrary to evidence for other taxa, there was no evidence that richness peaked at intermediate levels of urbanization. Declines in abundance appeared to be more noticeable when impervious surface cover exceeded 25%, while richness declined linearly with increasing impervious surface cover. We find evidence that the quality of the urban matrix (floral resources and remnant vegetation) influenced butterfly richness and abundance although the effects were small. Total butterfly abundance responded negatively to exotic floral abundance early in the sampling season and positively to total floral abundance later in the sampling season. Butterfly species richness increased with tree cover. Negative impacts of increased urbanization intensity on butterfly species richness and abundance may be mitigated to some extent by improving the quality of the urban matrix by enhancing tree cover and the provision of floral resources, with some evidence that native plants are more effective.

TI  - Urban meadows as an alternative to short mown grassland: effects of composition and height on biodiversity.
PY  - 2019
AB  - There are increasing calls to provide greenspace in urban areas, yet the ecological quality, as well as quantity, of greenspace is important. Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa. Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude further locally determined grassland development if management is appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil surface (0–10 cm), but in deeper soils (11–20 cm) community variation was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding differently. In addition to improving local residents’ site satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial communities compared with short mown grassland. Our results suggest that diversification of urban greenspace by planting urban meadows in place of some mown amenity grassland is likely to generate substantial biodiversity benefits, with a mosaic of meadow types likely to maximize such benefits.

TI  - Utilizing Urban Living Laboratories for Social Innovation
PY  - 2018
AB  - Cities have long been recognized as potential hubs of knowledge, social and cultural diversity, jobs, education, public services, and infrastructure. Alongside these opportunities, however, cities also face a changing climate, reduced availability of raw materials and natural resources, and dwindling physical space for the built environment. These challenges are accompanied by increasing disparities in income and resultant social inequalities; mounting threats to human health, well-being, and food security; growing refugee and migration influxes; and demographic changes. These concerns and associated governance challenges increase the urgency for new socially, ecologically, and culturally sensitive approaches to urban development. Such approaches need not only to reduce human vulnerability and environmental footprints, but also to build social cohesion and support ecological sustainability, cultural integration, and the establishment of a shared identity between citizens within a just system of distribution and access to urban resources and wealth.

TI  - Insectivorous bats respond to vegetation complexity in urban green spaces
PY  - 2018
AB  - Structural complexity is known to determine habitat quality for insectivorous bats, but how bats respond to habitat complexity in highly modified areas such as urban green spaces has been little explored. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether a recently developed measure of structural complexity is as effective as field-based surveys when applied to urban environments. We assessed whether image-derived structural complexity (MIG) was as/more effective than field-based descriptors in this environment and evaluated the response of insectivorous bats to structural complexity in urban green spaces. Bat activity and species richness were assessed with ultrasonic devices at 180 locations within green spaces in Vienna, Austria. Vegetation complexity was assessed using 17 field-based descriptors and by calculating the mean information gain (MIG) using digital images. Total bat activity and species richness decreased with increasing structural complexity of canopy cover, suggesting maneuverability and echolocation (sensorial) challenges for bat species using the canopy for flight and foraging. The negative response of functional groups to increased complexity was stronger for open-space foragers than for edge-space foragers. Nyctalus noctula, a species foraging in open space, showed a negative response to structural complexity, whereas Pipistrellus pygmaeus, an edge-space forager, was positively influenced by the number of trees. Our results show that MIG is a useful, time- and cost-effective tool to measure habitat complexity that complemented field-based descriptors. Response of insectivorous bats to structural complexity was group- and species-specific, which highlights the need for manifold management strategies (e.g., increasing or reinstating the extent of ground vegetation cover) to fulfill different species' requirements and to conserve insectivorous bats in urban green spaces.

TI  - Dispersal capacity underlies scale-dependent changes in species richness patterns under human disturbance.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Changes in the species richness of (meta-)communities emerge from changes in the relative species abundance distribution (SAD), the total density of individuals, and the amount of spatial aggregation of individuals from the same species. Yet, how human disturbance affects these underlying diversity components at different spatial scales and how this interacts with important species traits, like dispersal capacity, remain poorly understood. Using data of carabid beetle communities along a highly replicated urbanization gradient, we reveal that species richness in urban sites was reduced due to a decline in individual density as well as changes in the SAD at both small and large spatial scales. Changes in these components of species richness were linked to differential responses of groups of species that differ in dispersal capacity. The individual density effect on species richness was due to a drastic 90% reduction of low-dispersal individuals in more urban sites. Conversely, the decrease in species richness due to changes in the SAD at large (i.e., loss of species from the regional pool) and small (i.e., decreased evenness) spatial scales were driven by species with intermediate and high dispersal ability, respectively. These patterns coincide with the expected responses of these dispersal-type assemblages toward human disturbance, namely, (i) loss of low-dispersal species by local extinction processes, (ii) loss of higher-dispersal species from the regional species pool due to decreased habitat diversity, and (iii) dominance of a few highly dispersive species resulting in a decreased evenness. Our results demonstrate that dispersal capacity plays an essential role in determining scale-dependent changes in species richness patterns. Incorporating this information improves our mechanistic insight into how environmental change affects species diversity at different spatial scales, allowing us to better forecast how human disturbance will drive local and regional changes in biodiversity patterns.

TI  - Consistency in bird community assembly over medium-term along rural-urban gradients in Argentina
PY  - 2021
AB  - The analysis of bird community assembly rules is fundamental to understand which mechanisms determine the composition of bird species in urban areas. However, the long-term variation of community assembly rules has not been analyzed yet. The objectives of this study are (1) to analyze the variation of community assembly rules along rural-urban gradients of three cities in central Argentina and (2) to compare the patterns of community assembly between two periods separated by 6 years. Bird surveys were performed along transects in urban, suburban, and rural habitats during 2011 and 2017. Departures from null models that took into account differences in species richness (standardized effect size, SES) were calculated for functional and phylogenetic diversities. A total of 57 species were recorded. Bird species richness was higher in suburban than in urban and rural habitats. SES of functional diversity increased over the years and was significantly lower in urban habitats than in rural habitats, showing a pattern of functional clustering in the most urbanized areas and functional randomness in rural ones. Phylogenetic diversity was higher in both suburban and urban habitats than rural ones, and the phylogenetic clustering in rural bird assemblages changed to randomness in suburban and urban habitats. Bird communities in urban habitats were phylogenetically random and functionally clustered, evidencing environmental filtering by urbanization. In contrast, bird communities in rural areas tended to be phylogenetically clustered, evidencing that certain clades are adapted to rural areas. The processes structuring bird communities along rural-urban gradients were consistent between the 2 years compared.

TI  - Territories-in-­between: A Cross-case Comparison of Dispersed Urban Development in Europe
PY  - 2020
AB  - An increasing body of literature suggests that the conventional idea of a gradual transition in spatial structure from urban to rural does not reflect contemporary patterns of urban development and their potential for sustainable development. The research introduces the concept of territories-in-between (TiB) to address the issues surrounding the sustainability of dispersed urban development. A cross-case comparison research design was chosen to develop methods and principles that can be transferred to other geographical contexts. Ten cases in five countries were studied with the aim to answer the following questions: What spatial structures characterise dispersed urban areas in Europe? Which morphological and functional structures of dispersed urban areas offer the potential for more sustainable development? If so, how can this potential be mapped and measured to inform regional planning and design? Are there similarities and dissimilarities concerning potentials of dispersed urban areas in different locations, planning cultures, topographies and histories? Do dispersed urban areas have distinct characteristics? In sum, the findings show that dispersed urban areas in Europe are quite distinct from urban and rural areas and that they share characteristics from one place to another. The research investigated three aspects of sustainable spatial development, the potential of multi-functionality, the provision of ecosystem services and the presence and potential for mixed-use.

TI  - Domestic gardens as favorable pollinator habitats in impervious landscapes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners' coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on predator and parasitoid insects at multiple spatial scales.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Landscapes are becoming increasingly urbanized, causing loss and fragmentation of natural habitats, with potentially negative effects on biodiversity. Insects are among the organisms with the largest diversity in urbanized environments. Here, we sampled predator (Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and Crabronidae) and parasitoid (Tachinidae) flower-visiting insects in 36 sites in the city of Rome (Italy). Although the diversity of herbivorous insects in urban areas mostly depends on the availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, predators and parasitoids generally require a larger number of resources during their life cycle, and are expected to be particularly influenced by urbanization. As flower-visitors can easily move between habitat patches, the effect of urbanization was tested at multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and sub-regional). We found that urbanization influenced predator and parasitoid flower-visitors at all three spatial scales. At the local scale, streets and buildings negatively influenced evenness of predators and species richness and abundance of parasitoids probably acting as dispersal barrier. At the landscape scale, higher percentage of urban decreased predator abundance, while increasing their evenness, suggesting an increase in generalist and highly mobile species. Area and compactness (i.e. Contiguity index) of urban green interactively influenced predator communities, whereas evenness of parasitoids increased with increasing Contiguity index. At the sub-regional scale, species richness and abundance of predators increased with increasing distance from the city center. Compared to previous studies testing the effect of urbanization, we found little variation in species richness, abundance and evenness along our urbanization gradient. The current insect fauna has been probably selected for its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, being the result of the intensive anthropogenic alteration occurred in the area in the last centuries. Conservation strategies aimed at predator and parasitoid flying insects have to take in account variables at multiple spatial-scales, as well as the complementarity of resources across the landscape.

TI  - Urban moth communities suggest that life in the city favours thermophilic multi-dimensional generalists
PY  - 2020
AB  - Biodiversity is challenged worldwide by exploitation, global warming, changes in land use and increasing urbanization. It is hypothesized that communities in urban areas should consist primarily of generalist species with broad niches that are able to cope with novel, variable, fragmented, warmer and unpredictable environments shaped by human pressures. We surveyed moth communities in three cities in northern Europe and compared them with neighbouring moth assemblages constituting species pools of potential colonizers. We found that urban moth communities consisted of multi-dimensional generalist species that had larger distribution ranges, more variable colour patterns, longer reproductive seasons, broader diets, were more likely to overwinter as an egg, more thermophilic, and occupied more habitat types compared with moth communities in surrounding areas. When body size was analysed separately, results indicated that city occupancy was associated with larger size, but this effect disappeared when body size was analysed together with the other traits. Our findings indicate that urbanization imposes a spatial filtering process in favour of thermophilic species characterized by high intraspecific diversity and multi-dimensional generalist lifestyles over specialized species with narrow niches.

TI  - A biodiversity-crisis hierarchy to evaluate and refine conservation indicators
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 form the central pillar of the world’s conservation commitment, with 196 signatory nations; yet its capacity to reign in catastrophic biodiversity loss has proved inadequate. Indicators suggest that few of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi targets that aim to reduce biodiversity loss will be met by 2020. While the indicators have been criticized for only partially representing the targets, a bigger problem is that the indicators do not adequately draw attention to and measure all of the drivers of the biodiversity crisis. Here, we show that many key drivers of biodiversity loss are either poorly evaluated or entirely lacking indicators. We use a biodiversity-crisis hierarchy as a conceptual model linking drivers of change to biodiversity loss to evaluate the scope of current indicators. We find major gaps related to monitoring governments, human population size, corruption and threat-industries. We recommend the hierarchy is used to develop an expanded set of indicators that comprehensively monitor the human behaviour and institutions that drive biodiversity loss and that, so far, have impeded progress towards achieving global biodiversity targets. A conceptual model linking drivers of change to biodiversity loss identifies major gaps in the Aichi targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and provides a mechanism for developing new indicators.

AB  - Notre recherche porte sur l’identification des critères mobilisés par les usagers et riverains pour valoriser leurs trames vertes. Une recherche qualimétrique auprès de 534 individus, reposant sur la méthode de l’évaluation contingente, souligne que la sensibilité environnementale des usagers n’est pas systématiquement corrélée avec leur propension à payer. Leur attrait est ainsi tout autant celui d’un attachement pour la proximité sociale que d’un attachement pour ses caractéristiques écologiques. L’aménagement des trames vertes doit donc être un outil d’inclusion sociale au service de la qualité de vie de tous les usagers et riverains.

TI  - Planning for the Future of Urban Biodiversity: A Global Review of City-Scale Initiatives
PY  - 2017
AB  - Cities represent considerable opportunities for forwarding global biodiversity and sustainability goals. We developed key attributes for conserving biodiversity and for ecosystem services that should be included in urban-planning documents and reviewed 135 plans from 40 cities globally. The most common attributes in city plans were goals for habitat conservation, air and water quality, cultural ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity. Few plans included quantitative targets. This lack of measurable targets may render plans unsuccessful for an actionable approach to local biodiversity conservation. Although most cities include both biodiversity and ecosystem services, each city tends to focus on one or the other. Comprehensive planning for biodiversity should include the full range of attributes identified, but few cities do this, and the majority that do are mandated by local, regional, or federal governments to plan specifically for biodiversity conservation. This research provides planning recommendations for protecting urban biodiversity based on ecological knowledge.

TI  - Effectiveness of nature reserves for bird conservation in urban parks in Tokyo
PY  - 2021
AB  - In some urban parks in Tokyo, semi-natural habitat patches are maintained as nature reserves for birds, called bird sanctuaries. Bird censuses and vegetation surveys were conducted in eight urban parks in Tokyo from December 2015 to July 2016 to determine the effectiveness of bird sanctuaries on avian species composition. The relationship between avian species composition and environmental conditions was analyzed by partial redundancy analysis (partial RDA) using vegetation variables, number of visitors, presence or absence of reserves within the same park, area of wooded parts, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the surrounding area. The results of the partial RDA are as follows: (1) Area, lower vegetation cover, higher vegetation cover, tree species composition obtained from detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) on vegetation survey data, and NDVI in the surrounding area were considered as covariates and explained 17.4–33.6% of the total variation in bird species composition, (2) The presence or absence of sanctuary significantly explained bird species compositional variation regardless of season, indicating that the sanctuaries were beneficial for urban avoider species not only in the sanctuaries but also in the surrounding wooded area, and (3) Tree coverage within a 100 m range and leaf litter coverage also influenced avian species composition. We concluded that bird sanctuaries and other nature reserves can be beneficial to bird conservation, even within Tokyo. The positive effect of sanctuaries could be due to the limited influence of human presence and the developed vegetation within them. These reserves may play the role of core habitats within the studied urban parks.

TI  - Response of Beetle Assemblages (Insecta: Coleoptera) to Patch Characteristics and Habitat Complexity in an Ever-Expanding Urban Landscape in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico
PY  - 2021
AB  - Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity.These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness.This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements.

TI  - Urbanization causes biotic homogenization of woodland bird communities at multiple spatial scales.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to biodiversity declines. However, studies assessing effects of urban landscapes per se (i.e., disentangled from focal habitat effects) on biodiversity across spatial scales are lacking. Understanding such scale-dependent effects is fundamental to preserve habitats along an urbanization gradient in a way that maximizes overall biodiversity. We investigated the impact of landscape urbanization on communities of woodland-breeding bird species in individual (local scale) and across multiple (regional scale) cities, while controlling for the quality of sampled habitats (woodlands). We conducted bird point counts and habitat quality mapping of trees, dead wood, and shrubs in 459 woodlands along an urban to rural urbanization gradient in 32 cities in Sweden. Responses to urbanization were measured as local and regional total diversity (γ), average site diversity (α), and diversity between sites (β). We also assessed effects on individual species and to what extent dissimilarities in species composition along the urbanization gradient were driven by species nestedness or turnover. We found that landscape urbanization had a negative impact on γ-, α-, and β-diversity irrespective of spatial scale, both regarding all woodland-breeding species and red-listed species. At the regional scale, dissimilarities in species composition between urbanization levels were due to nestedness, that is, species were lost with increased landscape urbanization without being replaced. In contrast, dissimilarities at the local scale were mostly due to species turnover. Because there was no difference in habitat quality among woodlands across the urbanization gradient, we conclude that landscape urbanization as such systematically causes poorer and more homogeneous bird communities in adjacent natural habitats. However, the high local turnover and the fact that several species benefited from urbanization demonstrates that natural habitats along the entire urbanization gradient are needed to maintain maximally diverse local bird communities.

TI  - Persistence of a locally endangered mouse-deer amidst the re-emergence of two larger ungulates in small urban rainforest fragments
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Urbanisation has threatened native forests globally with remaining forests often existing as small isolated patches in a harsh landscape matrix. Devoid of large predators, forest patches may continue to support ungulate populations, but their conservation is challenging as unchecked population growth can bring about ecosystem imbalances and threaten other native species. Three ungulate species exist in small rainforest fragments of urbanised Singapore: the locally endangered lesser mouse-deer (Tragulus kanchil), and the re-emergent wild boar (Sus scrofa) and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Using an array of camera traps, we estimated the densities of the lesser mouse-deer, wild boar and sambar deer in rainforest patches, and determined the influence of habitat and landscape factors on their occupancies. We also studied the interactions of the wild boar and sambar deer with the lesser mouse-deer spatially and temporally. Estimates of the lesser mouse-deer density showed that the population has recovered since the 1990s. Its density was comparable to the wild boar, but higher than sambar deer. Detections of lesser mouse-deer were significantly higher in primary forests compared to old secondary forests, and increasing distance away from the nearest road or public trail was a strong predictor of its occupancy. There was no evidence that the wild boar and sambar deer competitively excluded the lesser mouse-deer, rather, co-occupancy was observed. We demonstrated that temporal niche partitioning between the lesser mouse-deer and the two other ungulates likely explained their co-existence. Notwithstanding this, there are indications of understorey alteration due to the wild boar occurrences. Thus, continued monitoring of ungulate populations and conservation efforts focused on maintaining the health of the primary and secondary rainforest patches, and reducing disturbance, are critical to sustain future populations of lesser mouse-deer. Our study has shed new light on the habitat use and species interactions of tropical ungulates in urban predator-free ecosystems and highlight the importance in gaining a deeper understanding of their dynamics to more effectively guide conservation and management decisions.

TI  - Determinants of microbat communities in urban forest remnants: a rapid landscape scale assessment
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanisation affects fauna in many ways; with some species persisting and going on to dominate urban habitats, while other species decline over time due to habitat disturbance and modification. Microbats comprise a major component of remnant mammalian fauna in urban areas but we have a comparatively poor understanding of how they respond to urbanisation compared to other taxonomic groups. We investigated the impacts of an urban gradient on microbat communities of habitat remnants on the Gold Coast, south-east Queensland, Australia. We conducted acoustic surveys of 34 sites categorised as urban, peri-urban or rural, with an additional five reference sites. A combination of landscape and habitat elements were quantified for each site and their influence on the richness and calling activity of microbats determined. Overall, more microbat species were detected in reference sites followed by peri-urban sites. Rural and urban sites had similar richness, but only 50 % overlap in species recorded. After accounting for sampling effort peri-urban sites were found to have the greatest species richness and calling activity. Three species accounted for 45.4 % of the variation in microbat species detected. Using generalised linear mixed models we found that site area and the extent of urban development in the landscape (i.e. urbanisation index) had the greatest impact on microbat richness and calling activity. Models including logging (clearfelling) and hollow-bearing tree measures were also important. Our results support the use of the urbanisation gradient as a key measure to quantify the impacts of urbanisation on biodiversity. Logging history plays an important role across the landscape as it is a potential driver of other landscape variables such as tree species diversity, stand density and hollow-bearing tree density.

TI  - Local habitat factors and spatial connectivity jointly shape an urban insect community
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract As the world becomes more and more urbanized, it is increasingly important to understand the impacts of urban landscapes on biodiversity. Urbanization can change local habitat factors and decrease connectivity among local habitats, with major impacts on the structure of natural food webs. However, most studies have focused on single species, or compared rural to urban habitats, which do not inform us on how to design and manage cities to optimize biodiversity. To understand the local and spatial drivers of ecological communities within urban landscapes, we assessed the relative impact of local habitat factors (sunlight exposure and leaf litter) and spatial connectivity on an oak-associated herbivore community within an urban landscape. From the local habitat factors, leaf litter but not sunlight exposure was related to herbivore species richness, with leaf litter contributing to the maintenance of high species richness on isolated trees. Guilds and species differed strongly in their response to local habitat factors and connectivity, resulting in predictable variation in insect community composition among urban oaks. Taken together, our study shows an interactive effect of local and spatial factors on species richness and species composition within an urban context, with guild- and species-specific life histories determining the response of insects to urban landscapes. To maintain biodiversity in the urban landscape, preserving a dense network of local habitats is essential. Moreover, allowing leaf litter to accumulate can be a simple, cost-effective conservation management practice.

TI  - A decadal review of urban ornithology and a prospectus for the future
PY  - 2016
AB  - The study of urban birds has increased exponentially in the last century. A prior review of the scientific literature up to the year 2000 found 100 research articles on urban birds, but in the past decade alone over 1000 have been published. Here I review the studies from 2006-2015 to characterize their approach, location, general findings and recent obsessions, with an eye toward suggesting important future directions. Urban ornithology remains centered in the northern hemisphere, although there is a rapid increase in studies from southern, tropical and biodiverse settings. Studies in the north have changed from documentation of the composition of urban avifaunas to include many studies of the demographic response to aspects of urban environments. Studies of pattern remain most common in Latin America, Asia, Africa, New Zealand and the Middle East. Across the world, ornithologists are revealing the rapid evolution of behavioural and morphological adaptations by birds to the urban environment, much of which is due to phenotypic plasticity. The relationship of humans to nature generally and birds specifically has been increasingly studied as a driver of avifaunal change as well as a factor affecting human ethics. Urban ornithology remains rarely experimental, but it has matured to the point of supporting synthetic reviews and meta-analyses that quantify the loss of avian diversity from city centres, characterize successful urban birds, discuss the role of amount and arrangement of vegetation on bird life, and explore the complex relationships between the subsidies and hazards of urban life and the survival and reproduction of birds. Yet much remains to be learned, including how some species thrive in cities with abundant predators; how city form and location affect the peak in avian richness that occurs typically at intermediate levels of urbanisation; the significance of functional biotic homogenization; and the ways in which engaging citizens in urban bird life informs their broader environmental land ethic.

TI  - Powerline Corridors Can Add Ecological Value to Suburban Landscapes When Not Maintained as Lawn
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of “natural” habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle (“old-field”), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.</jats:p>

TI  - Spatiotemporal interactions of a novel mesocarnivore community in an urban environment before and during SARS-CoV-2 lockdown.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Studying species interactions and niche segregation under human pressure provides important insights into species adaptation, community functioning and ecosystem stability. Due to their high plasticity in behaviour and diet, urban mesocarnivores are ideal species for studying community assembly in novel communities. We analysed the spatial and temporal species interactions of an urban mesocarnivore community composed of the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the marten Martes sp. as native species, the raccoon Procyon lotor as invasive species, and the cat Felis catus as a domestic species in combination with human disturbance modulated by the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown effect that happened while the study was conducted. We analysed camera trap data and applied a joint species distribution model to understand not only the environmental variables influencing the detection of mesocarnivores and their use intensity of environmental features but also the species' co-occurrences while accounting for environmental variables. We then assessed whether they displayed temporal niche partitioning based on activity analyses, and finally analysed at a smaller temporal scale the time of delay after the detection of another focal species. We found that species were more often detected and displayed a higher use intensity in gardens during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown period, while showing a shorter temporal delay during the same period, meaning a high human-induced spatiotemporal overlap. All three wild species spatially co-occurred within the urban area, with a positive response of raccoons to cats in detection and use intensity, whereas foxes showed a negative trend towards cats. When assessing the temporal partitioning, we found that all wild species showed overlapping nocturnal activities. All species displayed temporal segregation based on temporal delay. According to the temporal delay analyses, cats were the species avoided the most by all wild species. To conclude, we found that although the wild species were positively associated in space, the avoidance occurred at a smaller temporal scale, and human pressure in addition led to high spatiotemporal overlap. Our study sheds light to the complex patterns underlying the interactions in a mesocarnivore community both spatially and temporally, and the exacerbated effect of human pressure on community dynamics.

TI  - Sustainable Management of Very Large Trees with the Use of Acoustic Tomography
PY  - 2021
AB  - This manuscript summarizes the process by which large trees are protected in Poland, how they gain protected status, and the use of acoustic tomography to assess the structural soundness of five individual trees. The authors discuss tree stressors and tree care options, and how the outcome of each assessment was used in the decision-making process. Moreover, the use of acoustic tomography as an assessment tool helps to gain public acceptance for the assessment. In sustainable development, there is talk of the conscious management of urban vegetation, and specifically tree populations in the city. In line with sustainable development, actions are taken to manage the existing natural resources, e.g., historic trees, properly. Thanks to using an acoustic tomograph, it is possible to diagnose old tree specimens, take care of the safety of people and property near the natural monument, and to test candidates for their eligibility as monuments. Thanks to the research presented, it was ordered that one poplar tree be left and observed in Lublin, that two linden trees be cut down in Sandomierz and Lublin, that arborist works consisting of lowering the height of a linden tree in Sandomierz be undertaken, and that monument protection be applied for an ash tree in Łeczna. A visual tree assessment (VTA) was the starting point for this research. Each of the trees could endanger the safety of site users, and the diagnostics performed using sound waves were crucial in assessing their health condition. Our results highlight that acoustic tomography is an essential diagnostic method applicable to trees belonging to cultural heritage, such as old trees, and is effective in preventive tree management through the monitoring of mid- to long-term changes in internal decay or cavities that are difficult to diagnose with the naked eye.

TI  - Promoting wildflower biodiversity in dense and green cities: The important role of small vegetation patches
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The conservation and promotion of biodiversity in urban spaces has become a core concern in urban greening. As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were

TI  - Land-sharing vs. land-sparing urban development modulate predator-prey interactions in Europe.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban areas are expanding globally as a consequence of human population increases, with overall negative effects on biodiversity. To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator-prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator-prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development.

TI  - Environmental drivers of spider community composition at multiple scales along an urban gradient
PY  - 2017
AB  - Broad-scale modification of natural ecosystems associated with urbanisation often leads to localised extinctions and reduced species richness. Despite this, habitats within the urban matrix are still capable of supporting biodiversity to varying degrees. As species have different responses to anthropogenic habitat modification, the species composition of urban areas can depend greatly on the habitat characteristics of the local and surrounding areas. The aim of this study was to compare the community composition of spiders in private gardens, urban parks, patches of remnant vegetation and continuous bushland sites, so as to identify habitat variables associated with variation in spider populations along and within the urban gradient and matrix. Overall spider abundances and richness were highest in remnant vegetation patches and were associated with increased vegetation cover at microhabitat and landscape-scales. While gardens were not as diverse as remnant patches, they did support a surprisingly high diversity of spiders. We also found that species composition differed significantly between gardens and other urban green spaces. Higher richness within gardens was also associated with greater vegetation cover, indicating the importance of private management decisions on local biodiversity. Differences in community composition between land-use types were driven by a small number of urban-tolerant species, and spider guilds showed different responses to habitat traits such as vegetation cover and human population densities. This study demonstrates that urban land-uses support unique spider communities and that maintaining vegetation cover within the urban matrix is essential in order to support diverse spider communities in cities.

TI  - Namares—A Surface Inventory and Intervention Assessment Model for Urban Resource Management
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Densely built-up areas are challenged by reduced biodiversity, high volumes of runoff water, reduced evaporation, and heat accumulation. Such phenomena are associated with imperviousness and low, unsustainable utilisation of land and exterior building surfaces. Local authorities have multiple objectives when (re-)developing future-proof districts. Hence, exploiting local potentials to mitigate adverse anthropogenic effects and managing the resource of urban land/surfaces have become key priorities. Accordingly, a five-level hierarchy for a land-sensitive urban development strategy was derived. To support the operationalisation of the hierarchy, we present the model Namares, a highly resolved GIS-based approach to enable spatially explicit identification and techno-economic and environmental assessment of intervention measures for advantageous utilisation of available surfaces per land parcel. It uses existing data and covers the management of economic, natural, and technical resources. Nine intervention measures are implemented to identify potentials, estimate investments and annual costs, and assess the appeal of existing subsidies. The approach was applied to a case study redevelopment area in a large city in Germany. The results provide spatially explicit information on greening potentials, estimated investments, subsidy demand, and other quantified benefits. The case study results show the limited potential for additional unsealing of impervious surfaces by transforming ca. 10% of sealed ground surface area into new urban gardens. At the same time, up to 47% of roof and 30% of facade surfaces could be utilised for greening and energy harvesting. The approach enables a comprehensive localisation and quantitative assessment of intervention potentials to enhance decision support in land-sensitive urban development strategies.</jats:p>

TI  - City “Green” Contributions: The Role of Urban Greenspaces as Reservoirs for Biodiversity
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanization poses important environmental, social, and ecological pressures, representing a major threat to biodiversity. However, urban areas are highly heterogeneous, with some greenspaces (e.g., urban forests, parks, private gardens) providing resources and a refuge for wildlife communities. In this study we surveyed 10 taxonomic groups to assess their species richness and composition in six greenspaces that differ in size, location, management, and human activities. Species richness differed among taxonomic groups, but not all differed statistically among the studied greenspaces (i.e., sac fungi, bats). Plants, basidiomycetous and sac fungi, and birds showed intermediate assemblage composition similarity (<54%). The composition of assemblages of copro-necrophagous beetles, grasshoppers, amphibians, and bats was related to the specific traits of greenspaces, mainly size and location. The species richness contribution of each greenspace considering all studied taxonomic groups was highest in the largest greenspace that is located at the southeastern border of the city, while the lowest contribution was recorded in the smallest ones, all of them closer to the city’s center. Our results shed some light on the way in which different taxonomic groups respond to an array of neotropical urban greenspaces, providing an important basis for future studies.

TI  - Functional diversity and habitat preferences of native grassland plants and ground‐dwelling invertebrates in private gardens along an urbanization gradient
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is occurring around the globe, changing environmental conditions and influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Urban domestic gardens represent a small-grained mosaic of diverse habitats for numerous species. The challenging conditions in urban gardens support species possessing certain traits, and exclude other species. Functional diversity is therefore often altered in urban gardens. By using a multi-taxa approach focused on native grassland plants and ground-dwelling invertebrates with overall low mobility (snails, slugs, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, ants, rove beetles), we examined the effects of urbanization (distance to city center, percentage of sealed area) and garden characteristics on functional dispersion, functional evenness, habitat preferences and body size. We conducted a field survey in 35 domestic gardens along a rural-urban gradient in Basel, Switzerland. The various groups showed different responses to urbanization. Functional dispersion of native grassland plants decreased with increasing distance to the city center, while functional dispersion of ants decreased with increasing percentage of sealed area. Functional evenness of ants increased with increasing distance to the city center and that of rove beetles decreased with increasing percentage of sealed area. Contrary to our expectation, in rove beetles, the proportion of generalists decreased with increasing percentage of sealed area in the surroundings, and the proportion of species preferring dry conditions increased with increasing distance to the city center. Body size of species increased with distance to city center for slugs, spiders, millipedes, ants, and rove beetles. Local garden characteristics had few effects on functional diversity and habitat preferences of the groups examined. Our study supports the importance of using multi-taxa approaches when examining effects of environmental change on biodiversity. Considering only a single group may result in misleading findings for overall biodiversity. The ground-dwelling invertebrates investigated may be affected in different ways from the more often-studied flying pollinators or birds.

TI  - An integrating approach of cellular automata and ecological network to predict the impact of land use change on connectivity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract As a primary concern in biodiversity conservation, understanding the impact of land use/cover change (LUCC) on functional connectivity has the overarching significance. Yet, LUCC simulation models used in previous studies are insufficient to tackle the complex and non-linear interactions of land-use components, and thus may not be able to provide the accurate impact assessments. This paper aimed to fill this gap and to find a solution that avoids significant connectivity loss in the future LUCC. The artificial neural network (ANN) based cellular automata (CA) and graph theory were combined, to explore potential changes in functional connectivity under alternative urban expansion scenarios. Results show that, both urban land and forested land will increase in all of future scenarios; however, functional connectivity of each species will still decrease except under a population change based scenario. The increase in forested land and the contrary connectivity loss proved the strong barrier effect caused by urban expansion. The impacts vary by species: small forest mammals might benefit more from the gain in the stepping-stone-like patches, while the intra-patch connectivity loss is the primary threat for large terrestrial mammals. Finally, we identified the key connecting patches (i.e., stepping-stones) and suggested that those patches should be prioritized for protection.

TI  - Landscape structure influences urban vegetation vertical structure
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary Vegetation vertical structure is important for biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. In cities, however, while variation in the spatial extent and distribution of vegetation has been widely investigated, vertical vegetation structure and its potential drivers have not. Understanding how vegetation vertical structure varies across cities and identifying the potential drivers of this variation will improve the management of urban vegetation for biodiversity and ecosystem services. We used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to quantify the vertical structure of vegetation across Brisbane, Australia, at 1-km2 and 1-ha spatial scales and investigated how this structure varied in response to biophysical, socioeconomic, urban form and landscape structure variables. Using model selection techniques, we found that landscape structure variables related to tree cover (tree cover extent and spatial configuration) best explained the vegetation vertical structure at both spatial scales. Biophysical and urban form variables were also important, but only in combination with landscape structure. Mean vegetation vertical complexity, foliage projective cover and canopy height at a site all decreased as the treed proportion of the surrounding urban landscape decreased. In general, these vertical structure variables also increased where patches of vegetation were clustered together spatially. Synthesis and applications. Using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and model selection techniques, we show that the extent and vertical structure of urban vegetation are not independent and that reduced extent and increased fragmentation of urban vegetation are associated with simplification of its vertical structure. If common, this relationship means that managing urban vegetation for biodiversity and ecosystem services should not focus solely on the amount of tree cover or green space present across cities, but also on identifying where interventions to improve vegetation vertical complexity are required. Our study provides important insights into where these locations may be in cities.

TI  - Urban areas as hotspots for bees and pollination but not a panacea for all insects
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanisation is an important global driver of biodiversity change, negatively impacting some species groups whilst providing opportunities for others. Yet its impact on ecosystem services is poorly investigated. Here, using a replicated experimental design, we test how Central European cities impact flying insects and the ecosystem service of pollination. City sites have lower insect species richness, particularly of Diptera and Lepidoptera, than neighbouring rural sites. In contrast, Hymenoptera, especially bees, show higher species richness and flower visitation rates in cities, where our experimentally derived measure of pollination is correspondingly higher. As well as revealing facets of biodiversity (e.g. phylogenetic diversity) that correlate well with pollination, we also find that ecotones in insect-friendly green cover surrounding both urban and rural sites boost pollination. Appropriately managed cities could enhance the conservation of Hymenoptera and thereby act as hotspots for pollination services that bees provide to wild flowers and crops grown in urban settings.

TI  - Influence of urbanization on the avian species-area relationship: insights from the breeding birds of Rome
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the most investigated patterns in ecology and conservation biology, yet there is no study testing how different levels of urbanization influence its shape. Here we tested the impact of urbanization on avian SARs along a rural-urban gradient using the breeding birds of Rome (Central Italy). We divided the city into 360 cells of 1 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Each cell was classified as rural, suburban or urban using the proportion of impervious surface calculated from remote sensing data. For each of these three landscape categories, we constructed a SAR as a species accumulation curve (Gleason function) using bird species distribution data. SAR intercepts (i.e. the number of species per unit area) decreased from rural to urban areas, which indicates that urbanization depressed the number of species, reflecting the loss of specialized species strictly associated with natural habitats. The slope was highest for the rural curve, indicating that natural landscapes have the highest turnover due to their higher habitat heterogeneity. A higher slope for the urban cells, compared to the suburban ones, can be explained by the presence of green spaces embedded in the built-up matrix which host different avian communities. Previous studies that compared whole cities with natural areas failed to find differences in the respective SARs. Our study, which constructed SARs for different levels of urbanization, indicated significant changes in the SARs along the rural-urban gradient. Further analyses in other cities and taxa will be useful to test how general are our findings.</jats:p>

TI  - Taylor Made Landscapes: Using Taylor's Law to Scale Between Metapopulations and Source-Sinks in Urban Garden Space
PY  - 2020
AB  - The structure of terrestrial landscapes is commonly viewed as a problem of statistical description defined by the number, size and distance between habitat patches. Yet, for organisms living in that landscape, structure may be perceived very differently depending on the dispersal capacity of the organism of concern -- large animals may perceive a highly fragmented forest as a single patch if adjacent forest patches are sufficiently close, while small animals may be less likely to disperse across degraded habitat and therefore experience a much different patch structure. This is particularly relevant for fragmented landscapes like cities. Urban gardens are reputed to support a diversity of native and non-native urban species found in urban landscapes. Yet we know little about the long-term persistence of organisms associated with urban gardens. Here we utilize Taylor’s law, a universal scaling law denoting a power law relationship between population size and variance to indicate the synchrony of arthropod populations sampled across time in a fragmented urban landscape. Our results indicate that the utility of urban gardens as habitat is strongly dependent on sampling month, spatial scale and taxon. Constrained dispersal across the landscape may limit the potential of urban gardens to conserve natural enemies including ladybird beetles and parasitoid wasps. In contrast, aphid pests are moving much more freely in the landscape as exhibited through synchrony in abundances sampled across local and landscape scales. We find that regardless of the fragmentation pattern existing in the landscape, short-ranged arthropods are isolated to small, independent garden habitat patches (metapopulation-like) with abundances that oscillate out of sync, while long-ranged species traverse greater distances, synchronizing abundances across large, shared spaces (source sink-like). These results suggest an inherent link between Taylor’s temporal law and metapopulation theory, providing a potential mechanism to explain species-specific slopes of Taylor’s law as arising from the ability of organisms to differentially experience fragmented space along the continuum between metapopulation and source-sink.

TI  - Land cover change homogenizes functional and phylogenetic diversity within and among African savanna bird assemblages
PY  - 2019
AB  - Conversion of natural ecosystems into anthropogenic landscapes can result in biotic homogenization, whereby differences in species composition among sites are diminished through colonization or local extinction. This may reduce the resilience of assemblages to further perturbation and the range or quality of ecosystem services they offer. We investigate how land cover change has altered patterns of compositional, functional and phylogenetic diversity of avian communities in a typical African savanna. We investigate if there has been selection for closely-related or functionally similar species with increasing land use intensity and how this has affected alpha and beta components of diversity. We conducted point counts over 2 years in four distinct land cover types (urban, rural, protected and a transitional matrix), representing a gradient of land cover change. We compared alpha and beta phylogenetic, compositional and functional diversity between sites to assess whether land cover change has homogenized avian communities. While alpha diversity tended to be higher in transformed land cover types (urban, rural and matrix), measures of beta diversity among sites within these types were significantly lower than beta diversity within the protected area. Furthermore, assemblages in transformed areas were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expectation based on a null model, particularly in the urban area. While transformed areas may support higher diversity than natural habitats inside the protected area, human impacts are filtering for species with specific traits and thus homogenizing functional and phylogenetic diversity within and between sites in our study system.

TI  - Urban parks are a refuge for birds in park-poor areas
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urban parks provide amenities that support both human and animal communities. However, parks are often unevenly distributed within cities. One metric used to assess the distribution of parks to the public is termed the Park Score. The Park Score is an approach to measure access, acreage, investment, and amenities, and is designed to understand a city’s needs for greenspace, with a major focus on public health. In addition to issues related to public health, a disparity in the distribution of urban parks may pose a barrier for wildlife, such as birds. Yet, this remains unclear. We designed a study to quantify the role of parks in providing a refuge for birds across a park-needs gradient in Greater Los Angeles (LA), a metropolis with one of the lowest park scores in the United States. We had two objectives to address our goal. First, we quantified patterns in habitat features and avian communities within and adjacent to parks. Second, we analyzed relationships among habitat features within and adjacent to parks on avian abundance. We sampled birds and habitat features at 48 parks across a park-needs gradient in L.A. from October to March of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. We found three lines of evidence supporting the refugia effect of parks. First, habitat features within parks were similar between low- and high-needs areas of LA, and this likely influenced avian abundance patterns, which were also alike. Second, avian communities were generally similar across the park-needs gradient, where parks in high-needs areas harbored birds affiliated with forest and shrub ecosystems. Third, bird abundance patterns were related to numerous habitat features within parks, regardless of where parks occurred in the city. The patterns we uncovered were opposite to what is found in residential areas (i.e., luxury effect), suggesting that parks provide important habitat for birds, whether in high- or low-needs sections of LA. Our results stress the role of parks as refugia in park-poor areas because they provide habitat in otherwise inhospitable urban conditions. Continued investment in park development in high-needs areas can thus potentially be a win-win when considering the benefits to people and birds.</jats:p>

TI  - Using GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Networks as a tool for modelling urban biodiversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - The ability to predict spatial variation in biodiversity is a long-standing but elusive objective of landscape ecology. It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of ‘bigger, better, and more joined up’. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a GIS-coupled Bayesian Belief Network approach to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales in complex landscapes where current data and appropriate modelling approaches are lacking, and our findings have important implications for ecologists, conservationists and planners.

TI  - Arthropod abundance modulates bird community responses to urbanization
PY  - 2020
AB  - AIM: We analysed the role of species interactions in wildlife community responses to urbanization. Specifically, we investigated non‐trophic associations within a bird community and the role of trophic interactions in the responses of bird species to the urbanization gradient. LOCATION: City‐state of Berlin, Central Europe. METHODS: Arthropod and bird abundances were sampled across the study area and analysed using hierarchical joint species distribution models (JSDMs). Urbanization gradient was defined by environmental predictors reflecting anthropogenic disturbances, for example noise level and human population density, as well as nature‐like features, for example tree cover and open green area. Relevant environmental predictors for each group and relevant spatial resolution were selected a priori using AICc. Arthropod abundances were modelled for the bird sampling transects and included as additional predictor variable in the bird community model. In this model, we used abundances and traits of 66 breeding bird species as response variables. RESULTS: Bird species responses to urbanization were captured by the interaction between invertebrate abundance and environmental predictors. We identified three groups of birds: the urban group (12 species) showed no decrease in abundance along the urbanization gradient and were not related to arthropods abundance; the woodland group (18 species) were positively related to tree cover and arthropod abundance, also in areas with high anthropogenic disturbance; and the nature group (36 species) were positively related to arthropod abundance, but the species abundance decreased sharply with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. All the non‐trophic associations found within the bird community were positive. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Arthropod abundance clearly modulated birds’ responses to the urbanization gradient for most species. Especially at moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, the abundance of arthropods is key for the occurrence and abundance of bird species in urban areas. To maintain bird diversity in urban green areas, management measures should focus on maintaining and increasing invertebrate abundance.

TI  - Urbanization decreases the extent and variety of leaf herbivory for native canopy tree species Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, and Acer saccharum
PY  - 2019
AB  - The extent to which urban trees can support associated biodiversity and provide ecosystem services depends on how urbanization affects the relationship between plants and the herbivorous arthropods that feed on them. Previous studies suggest that urbanization tends to increase the abundance, but decrease the diversity of herbivorous arthropods, but also reveal that this pattern may be an artifact of a narrow focus on pests and ornamental plants. We aimed to assess the effect of urbanization on whole leaf herbivore communities of three native canopy trees, red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). For each species we compared the extent of herbivory (assessed as percent leaf loss) and diversity of herbivores (using the number of identifiable damage types as a proxy for feeding guild diversity) between sites in southeast Michigan that were more forested vs. more urbanized (with lower tree density and canopy coverage and higher percent hardscape and turf). We found that across all three species and sites compared, both the percent leaf area lost to herbivory and the number of different types of herbivory were consistently and significantly higher in forested than urbanized sites. While future studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms responsible, we conclude that at least for native canopy tree species, trees in more urbanized sites do not appear to experience higher herbivory, and instead support diminished herbivore communities compared to the same trees in a more forested setting.

TI  - Bird diversity in an urban ecosystem: the role of local habitats in understanding the effects of urbanization
PY  - 2018
AB  - ABSTRACT: Urbanization causes environment changes that directly affect biotic diversity, and understanding the relationship between fauna and urban features is a key aspect of urban planning. Birds are particularly affected by urbanization. Noise levels, for instance, negatively affect birds’ behavior and social communication, while the presence of green areas promotes bird diversity. The effects of urbanization could differ according with the level of urbanization, and our goal was to understand how bird species assemblages are related to urban features in an intermediate stage of urbanization (a city in Brazil with 2,470 inhabitants/km²). We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and generalized linear models (GLM) analyses to assess how bird species assemblages are affected by urban features (e.g., noise level, abundance of buildings) as well as habitat features (e.g., vegetation cover). Despite we did not find a clear pattern of urbanization both the urban and habitat features had, even if weak, an effect on bird species distribution. Bird species distribution was spatially correlated, and we identified three groups: 1) grassland and wetland species; 2) forest species; 3) species tolerant to habitat degradation. Species richness was positively related to the proportion of trees, abundance of people and presence of buildings, and negatively affected by higher levels of noise. The abundance of species decreased as noise levels increased, but the proportion of green areas (open or forest vegetation) had a positive effect. Agreeing with previous research, our study shows that noise levels and vegetation cover seem to be the best predictors of diversity in urban areas. Nevertheless, the presence of particular habitats (wetlands, grasslands, woodlots), patchily distributed in the urban matrix, could buffer the effects of urbanization on birds. These habitats should thus be taken into account in urban planning.

PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>En el presente trabajo se estudia la diversidad de escarabajos coprófagos en tres zonas urbanizadas del departamento de Sucre, Colombia, cada una con características ecológicas distintas. Los individuos fueron capturados con trampas de caída cebadas. Se analizaron el esfuerzo de muestreo, las curvas de rango-abundancia y los índices de diversidad alfa y beta. Se capturaron 710 individuos, agrupados en nueve géneros y 13 especies. El análisis de completitud arrojó valores por encima del 97%. El ensamble más diverso en cualquiera de los tres órdenes de “q” se encontró en la zona que alberga edificaciones, jardines y un parche de bosque de vegetación secundaria, seguido por una zona de pastizales, con pocas edificaciones; el ensamble de menor diversidad correspondió a la zona rodeada de edificaciones y con escasa cobertura vegetal. El índice de Sorensen-Dice arrojó una similitud total entre las tres zonas del 38%. Las curvas de rango-abundancia mostraron mayor equidad de especies en la zona más diversa. Los resultados indicaron que la composición del ensamble de escarabajos depende de las condiciones ambientales y el grado de urbanización. Así mismo, se evidenció que algunas especies pueden tener alta adaptabilidad y que algunas de ellas corren el riesgo potencial de presentar eventos de extinción local.</jats:p>

TI  - Drastic loss of insects (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in urban landscapes in a tropical biodiversity hotspot
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accelerating urbanization of natural areasis a particularly important threat to biodiversity in tropical countries. Understanding how this phenomenon affects different groups of the fauna is essential to develop conservation actions We evaluate the effects of urbanization on species diversity and composition of geometrid moths in a tropical biodiversity hotspot in southern Ecuador. Moths were collected at different land-use types: forest, forest-pasture, pasture, and urban. We collected a total of 3064 moths representing 299 morphospecies. Species richness of geometrid moths decreased drastically in the more urbanized areas and moth communities differed strongly in composition between the investigated habitats. Community composition was mainly affected by floristic composition and degree of urbanization. Beta diversity components between land-use types depend on the degree of disturbance, with turnover among communities dominant in initial transitions and nestedness prevailing at later stages of transitions. In summary, moth assemblages in this tropical biodiversity hotspot are not only severely impoverished due to urbanization, but the remaining assemblages are strongly different from those found in natural ecosystems. Implications for insect conservation. To mitigate negative effects we recommend a more cautious development of urbanized areas in the region through the creation of more green space within the city, mainly with high diversity of native plants which can serve as potential hosts for caterpillars of moths and multiple other insects.

TI  - Variation in vegetation structure and composition across urban green space types
PY  - 2016
AB  - The ecological sustainability and function of urban landscapes is strongly influenced by the composition and structure of the local plant community. Taxonomic composition generally refers to the identity of the species comprising the community, while we define structure as the presence of multiple canopy layers, as well as stems of varying diameter and age. These aspects of urban vegetation significantly influence the ecology of cities, yet they are generally poorly quantified across the range of natural and constructed plant communities present in urban landscapes. We quantified vegetation composition and structure to i) simultaneously assess their variation across four green spaces types (golf courses, public parks, residential neighbourhoods and patches of remnant vegetation) in Melbourne, Australia, and ii) investigate the relationship between vegetation composition and structure within these green spaces. The four green space types supported distinctly different plant communities. Vegetation composition in the residential neighborhoods differed significantly from the others (p<0.05), largely due to the increased richness of shrubs and cultivated plants, and the reduced presence of large trees. Residential neighborhoods had the highest plant species richness, although a large proportion of these species occurred infrequently. The structural complexity of understorey vegetation (calculated as % volume occupied) below 0.5 m was highest in remnant patches followed by golf courses, public parks and residential neighborhoods. The structural complexity of understorey vegetation in remnant vegetation patches was very similar to that of golf courses even though some of the latter were dominated by exotic plant species. Variation in the composition and structure of urban vegetation might have great implications for the retention of faunal diversity within cities because different taxa have specific habitat requirements. Hence, further understanding of variations in the composition and structure of both natural and constructed plant communities in cities will greatly improve our ability to create urban landscapes that enhance both plant and animal biodiversity.

TI  - Conserving native trees increases native bird diversity and community composition on commercial office developments
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>In cities, woody vegetation provides critical shelter, nesting and foraging habitat for bird species of interest. Human actions—including development and landscaping choices—determine vegetation community composition and structure, making these choices critically important to urban bird conservation. A better understanding of how bird communities are impacted by parcel-scale actions can help guide policy and management best practices to improve matrix habitat quality and quantity. Here, I examined how bird habitat use varies along a vegetation gradient created by different development and landscaping choices. I surveyed 20 commercial office developments near Seattle in the Puget Trough region of Washington, USA selected using stratified random sampling, where I quantified bird communities and observed feeding behavior. I used GLMM and PERMANOVA models with data likelihood metrics to identify the best supported variables for bird site use, along with TITAN models to identify changes in community composition along environmental gradients. I found that measures of bird effective species richness and bird community are positively influenced by the presence of more native conifers, including the presence of a stand predating development and the height and density of native conifers. Measures of the native bird community are negatively influenced by higher non-native tree density. In contrast to prior research, top-down landscape-scale variables did not explain variation in measures of the bird community on office developments. Importantly, I found that birds are associated with the same habitat on office developments as observed elsewhere. Together, my findings suggest an important role for developers, land owners, landscape architects, and tree protection policy in bird conservation.</jats:p>

TI  - Ecological traits and landscape characteristics predicting bird sensitivity to urbanization in city parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.

TI  - Local quality versus regional connectivity—habitat requirements of wintering woodpeckers in urban green spaces
PY  - 2017
AB  - In urban landscapes, city parks represent strongholds of avian biodiversity. Hence, understanding which variables promote species richness of bird communities has major implications for urban planning in order to sustain high biodiversity in an increasingly urbanised environment. From a management perspective, three options are available: increase park area, increase habitat quality within parks and increase connectivity between parks. We used two woodpecker species, a generalist species (Great Spotted Woodpecker) and a habitat specialist (Middle Spotted Woodpecker), as indicators to identify key variables promoting biodiversity in the city parks of Vienna. Bird surveys were carried out during winter time between 2005 and 2015 in 29 urban parks. An information theoretic approach based on generalised linear models identified park area as the most relevant local variable, positively affecting the occurrence of both species. The variable was included in all best ranked models of the two woodpecker species (based on Akaike's information criterion corrected for small-sample sizes). Other local scale variables as well as the position of city parks within the urban matrix and their connectivity were of minor importance. Our results also provide some evidence that city parks may act as refuges for birds during cold winters. The park occupancy of the Great Spotted Woodpecker increased significantly with decreasing mean winter temperatures. The management of existing parks and the planning of new parks represent opportunities to improve the ecological conditions for nature development in addition to their principal function to provide recreational, cultural and aesthetic values.© The Author 201

TI  - Long-term Christmas Bird Counts describe neotropical urban bird diversity.
PY  - 2023
AB  - A significant gap in understanding the response of biodiversity to urban areas is the lack of long-term studies. Most of the information on urban birds comes from studies carried out in the northern hemisphere, and they include data that don´t exceed three years. Although short-term studies contribute to knowledge about bird community diversity and their spatial distribution in urban areas, they could be biased towards more conspicuous species. One of the few multi-temporal datasets available for birds in urban areas is the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). Using annual CBC data available between 2001 and 2018 from 21 urban and peri-urban sample sites assessed from the main cities of Colombia, we identified and analyzed long-term trends on the cumulative diversity of bird communities as well as on their spatial distribution. We estimated comparative trends in richness, number of individuals counted, similarity, and complementarity of avifauna for each city and sample site based on their responses to urbanization and dietary guilds. We identified almost a quarter of the species registered in Colombia (464 of 1954). The representativeness of the community obtained for 18 years exceeds 84%, showing richness that ranges between 214 and 278 species in the three cities. Bird species and individuals registered showed wide variation of the sample sites. We found more dwellers, insectivorous and granivorous species in urban areas, with frugivores relegated to peri-urban sites, usually coinciding with avoider species. Natural peri-urban areas and intra-urban wetlands and urban parks were the most important refuges for birds and maintained the highest avoider and utilizer species richness. Long-term inventories are fundamental for determining consolidated bird diversity and distributional patterns. This information established a baseline for decision-making and applying recommendations that allow reconciling the growing demand for urban areas with the need to preserve the native avifauna in megadiverse Neotropical countries such as Colombia.

TI  - Influence of urbanization on the avian species-area relationship: insights from the breeding birds of Rome
PY  - 2020
AB  - The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the most investigated patterns in ecology and conservation biology, yet there is no study testing how different levels of urbanization influence its shape. Here we tested the impact of urbanization on avian SARs along a rural-urban gradient using the breeding birds of Rome (Central Italy). We divided the city into 360 cells of 1 km2. Each cell was classified as rural, suburban or urban using the proportion of impervious surface calculated from remote sensing data. For each of these three landscape categories, we constructed a SAR as a species accumulation curve (Gleason function) using bird species distribution data. SAR intercepts (i.e. the number of species per unit area) decreased from rural to urban areas, which indicates that urbanization depressed the number of species, reflecting the loss of specialized species strictly associated with natural habitats. The slope was highest for the rural curve, indicating that natural landscapes have the highest turnover due to their higher habitat heterogeneity. A higher slope for the urban cells, compared to the suburban ones, can be explained by the presence of green spaces embedded in the built-up matrix which host different avian communities. Previous studies that compared whole cities with natural areas failed to find differences in the respective SARs. Our study, which constructed SARs for different levels of urbanization, indicated significant changes in the SARs along the rural-urban gradient. Further analyses in other cities and taxa will be useful to test how general are our findings.
