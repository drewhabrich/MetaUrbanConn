AB  - The concept of green infrastructure (GI) seeks to identify and prioritize areas of high ecological value for wildlife and people, to improve the integration of natural values in landscape planning decisions. In 2018, the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, established a roadmap for biodiversity conservation, which includes the operationalization of GI covering 30% of the territory by 2030. In this paper, we demonstrate a GI mapping framework in the canton of Geneva. Our approach is based on the combined assessment of three ‘pillars’, namely species’ distribution, landscape structure and connectivity, and ecosystem services, to optimize the allocation of conservation actions using the spatial prioritization software, Zonation. The identified priority conservation areas closely overlap existing natural reserves. Including the three pillars in the landscape prioritization should also improve adhesion to the GI idea, without undermining the protection of threatened species. With regards to land use planning, public and private land parcels with high values for GI may require specific incentives to maintain their desirable characteristics, as they are more likely to be degraded than areas with more building restrictions. Visualizing priority conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner will support decision-makers in Geneva to optimally allocate limited resources for ecosystem preservation.

AB  - Ecological protection and the restoration of full-array ecosystems is an important part of ecological civilization construction, which is a powerful measure to implement the concept of green development and help bridge the gap between the respective inevitable requirements of the current ecological environment and economic development. To solve this problem, a multi-scale index system was constructed to identify ecological sources comprehensively. The minimum-cost path method, the circuit theory, and the cyclic window search method were adopted to quantitatively identify the important ecological sources and corridors in scale nesting and pinch points and barrier points that affect multi-level connectivity. Furthermore, the specific optimization layout strategy of the ecological network structure of the Hefei metropolitan area was proposed. According to the results, if ecological sources and corridors at two scales are overlaid, the coincident area of ecological sources at two scales is 1719.95 km2. As important ecological sources, Chaohu Lake Basin, Niuwangzhai, and Wuding Mountain, which are important areas to maintain the ecological network, need to be protected. Ten overlapping ecological corridors, which are mainly distributed in Changfeng County, are easily damaged long term. As a result, ecological nodes should be set up as temporary habitats for species transfer. In addition, based on the circuit theory and the cyclic window search method, calculating areas of pinch points at two scales yields 1637.75 km2 and 434.22 km2, respectively, and for areas of barrier points yields 2182.75 km2 and 126.97 km2, respectively. The ecological pinch points at two overlapping scales among them are important areas for future protection. Due to the small and fragmented spatial distribution in the urban area, pinch points with an average size of 0.58 km2 are easy to be restored and will greatly improve the connectivity of the ecological network after restoration. Furthermore, through the quantitative identification of ecological network elements of two scales, the paper puts forward an optimization strategy for an ecological network in the Hefei metropolitan area from three aspects of “point-line-polygon.” The research results can reference decision-making concerning the delineation of urban growth boundary, regional ecological security pattern, land space renovation, and ecosystem restoration.

TI  - An integrated approach to enhancing ecological connectivity and accessibility in urban areas: a case study of sheffield, uk
AU  - Ersoy, Ebru
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Recently, increasing environmental threats to the functioning of landscape and biodiversity have heightened the need for developing new approaches to nature conservation. Green and ecological networks have been developed as an attempt to maintain the functioning of landscapes, promote the sustainable use and conservation of nature, support the movement of species and increase people's use and enjoyment of the nature (Bennett and Wit, 2001; Bennett and Mulongoy, 2006; Lawton et al., 2010). These can be achieved by the identification and selection of the main features of ecological and green networks based on ecological and / or social functions we intend them to fulfil as well as the determination of objective conservation measures. The main purpose of this research is to focus on critically examining different ways of defining green and ecological networks and their functionality for biodiversity and people in the case of Sheffield, which were derived from different theoretical and professional perspectives (planning and ecology), and to explore the potential for different approaches to define ecological / green networks. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, this thesis uses a mixed research methodology, based on different methods of data collection and analysis. This research commences with the analysis of existing green and ecological network approaches, namely the Green Network (Sheffield City Council) and the Living Don (Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust). In order to analyse these approaches, policy document analysis, semi-structured interviews and ArcGIS spatial analyses were conducted to understand the rationale, aims and the spatial structure of current networks in the case of Sheffield. For the identification of criteria to develop alternative routes of connectivity, ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS were used. After generating land cover and land use maps at a very fine scale (2m raster resolution) and with different levels of detail, the alternative connectivity routes, for both biodiversity and people, were identified on the basis of two connectivity measures. The first set of spatial analyses took into account structural connectivity of landscape components as the main criteria, to develop potential routes using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS in combination. On the other hand, based on functional connectivity, the second set of alternative connectivity routes were developed using a least-cost corridor approach in ArcGIS. For the delineation of alternative connectivity routes for biodiversity, 10 species were selected from 3 different taxon groups (birds, mammals and reptiles); and for people, the alternative routes from residential buildings to (a) green and open spaces, (b) public buildings and (c) industrial / commercial units were used considering the effects of physical / legal accessibility and slope. Then, existing approaches and derived alternative routes of connectivity were compared and contrasted to each other in ArcGIS, to analyse the relationship between their structural properties and the urban morphologies in which they occur, with a view to predicting the implications for ecological connectivity and use by members of the public. The Sheffield City Council and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust aim at maintaining and enhancing ecological connectivity for the benefit of wildlife as well as supporting public enjoyment and movement, and both of their network approaches benefit from the linear connectivity formed around the main rivers, streams and valleys. However, it was found that there are significant differences in the representation, spatial coverage and arrangement of the Green Network and the Living Don based on the methods and the site selection criteria used for developing green and ecological networks. Regarding the structural connectivity routes for biodiversity and people, significant differences were found in the spatial extent and arrangement of alternative routes. On the other hand, functional connectivity routes for biodiversity showed both similarities and differences in their spatial extents and arrangements according to selected species' habitat requirements and movement behaviours across the landscape. Similarly, functional connectivity routes for people changed as I used different destinations and parameters. The overall results of this research provide further support for the conceptual premise that the definition of green and ecological networks is highly dependent on the methodology, ecological and / or social functions that are considered, and also criteria for the inclusion of different habitats or land uses within the network.

AB  - Conservation planning is crucial for megadiverse countries where biodiversity is coupled with incomplete reserve systems and limited resources to invest in conservation. Using Peru as an example of a megadiverse country, we asked whether the national system of protected areas satisfies biodiversity conservation needs. Further, to complement the existing reserve system, we identified and prioritized potential conservation areas using a combination of species distribution modeling, conservation planning and connectivity analysis. Based on a set of 2,869 species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants, we used species distribution models to represent species' geographic ranges to reduce the effect of biased sampling and partial knowledge about species' distributions. A site-selection algorithm then searched for efficient and complementary proposals, based on the above distributions, for a more representative system of protection. Finally, we incorporated connectivity among areas in an innovative post-hoc analysis to prioritize those areas maximizing connectivity within the system. Our results highlight severe conservation gaps in the Coastal and Andean regions, and we propose several areas, which are not currently covered by the existing network of protected areas. Our approach helps to find areas that contribute to creating a more representative, connected and efficient network.

TI  - Lichen Conservation in Eastern North America: Population Genomics, Climate Change, and Translocations
AU  - Allen, Jessica L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Conservation biology is a scientific discipline that draws on methods from diverse fields to address specific conservation concerns and inform conservation actions. This field is overwhelmingly focused on charismatic animals and vascular plants, often ignoring other diverse and ecologically important groups. This trend is slowly changing in some ways; for example, increasing number of fungal species are being added to the IUCN Red-List. However, a strong taxonomic bias still exists. Here I contribute four research chapters to further the conservation of lichens, one group of frequently overlooked organisms. I address specific conservation concerns in eastern North America using modern methods. The results of these studies provide insight into lichen conservation in each situation, implications for the broader ecosystems within the study regions, and advancement of methods for the study of lichen conservation and biology.The first research chapter (Chapter 2) is a population genomics study based on whole genome shotgun sequencing of Cetradonia linearis, an endangered, lichenized fungus. These data were used to 1) assemble and annotate a reference genome, 2) characterize the mating system, 3) test for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE), and 4) investigate the biogeographic history of the species. Approximately 70% of the genome (19.5 Mb) was assembled. Using this assembly, only a single mating type was located, suggesting the species could be unisexual. There was strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for Isolation by Distance, but no evidence for Isolation by Environment. The hypothesis that C. linearis  had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, was supported by Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. Given the findings here, it is recommended that C. linearis remain protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red-List.The third chapter is an estimation of the impacts of climate change on high-elevation, endemic lichens in the southern Appalachians, a global diversity hotspot for many groups, including lichens. Extensive field surveys in the high elevations of the region were carried out to accurately document the current distributions of eight narrowly endemic species. These data were compared with herbarium records, and species distribution modeling was used to predict how much climatically suitable area will remain within, and north of, the current range of the target species at multiple time points and climate change scenarios. Fieldwork showed that target species ranged from extremely rare to locally abundant and models predicted average losses of suitable area within the current distribution of species ranging from 93.8 to 99.7%. The results indicate that climate change poses a significant threat to high-elevation lichens, and illustrates the application of current modeling techniques for rare, montane species.In the fourth chapter, a dataset of >13,000 occurrence records for lichens in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain (MACP) of eastern North America was used to model distributions of 193 species. The resulting models were used to quantify the amount of each species’ distribution that is occupied by unsuitable land use types, along with the potential area that will be lost to sea-level rise (SLR). These analyses showed that species have likely already lost an average of 32% of their distributional area to development and agriculture, and are predicted to lose an average of 12.4 and 33.7% of their distributional area with one foot (∼0.3 m) and six feet (∼1.8 m) of SLR, respectively. Functional and taxonomic groups were compared to identify specific effects of SLR. Species reproducing with symbiotic propagules were found to have significantly larger distributions than species that reproduce sexually with fungal spores alone, and the sexually reproducing species were predicted to lose greater distributional area to SLR. Cladonia species occupy significantly less area in the MACP than Parmotrema species and were predicted to lose more of their distributions to SLR. Patterns of total species diversity showed that the area with the highest diversity is the Dare Peninsula in North Carolina, which was also predicted to lose the most land area to SLR. The workflow established here is flexible and applicable to estimating SLR impacts worldwide and can provide essential insights for local conservation planning. The fifth chapter describes the results of three experiments conducted to test new and established methods for lichen transplantation. First, small fragments of Graphis sterlingiana, Hypotrachyna virginica , and Lepraria lanata were placed on medical gauze attached to each of the species’ most common substrate to test the feasibility of transplanting narrowly endemic species. Second, burlap, cheesecloth, medical gauze, and a plastic air filter were directly compared for their use as artificial transplant substrates with Lepraria finkii as the test lichen. Third, transplants of Usnea angulata were established to test its amenability to transplantation via hanging fragments on monofilament. The first two experiments were established on Roan Mountain, North Carolina and the third experiment at Highlands Biological Station, North Carolina. In the first two experiments medical gauze did not withstand local weather conditions and nearly all pieces fell from the trees within 6 months. The plastic air filter and burlap performed best as artificial substrates for transplants, with a 100% and 80% success rate, respectively. Cheesecloth remained attached to the trees, but only 20% of lichen fragments remained attached to the substrate after one year. In the third experiment U. angulata  grew 3.5 ± 1.4 cm in 5 months, exceeding previously reported growth rates for this species. These results advance methods for conservation-focused lichen transplants, and expand established methods to a new region and new species.

TI  - Spatial Population Genomics and Landscape Ecology of Urban Brown Rats (Rattus norvegicus)
AU  - Combs, Matthew Aaron
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Spatial patterns of genetic variation provide a lens into the ecological and evolutionary responses of wildlife populations to landscape heterogeneity, though our understanding of urban landscapes remains limited. Further, it remains unclear whether species exhibit parallel responses to independent landscapes. Commensal rodents are widely distributed within cities and around the world, offering a useful model for understanding the influence of cities on gene flow, genetic drift, and habitat distribution. Here I study the population genetics and landscape ecology of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in four urban landscapes, New York City (NYC), New Orleans (NOL), Salvador (SAL), Vancouver (VAN), using genome-wide SNPs to understand the influence of urban landscapes on eco-evolutionary processes governing their distribution and functional connectivity.Rat populations in each city exhibited significant genetic discontinuities that coincide with landscape features, despite widespread isolation-by-distance processes. Genetic variation in NYC and SAL rats was clinal, but I identified genetic clusters separated by areas with lower genetic diversity and reduced migration. Rats in NOL and SAL exhibited stark genetic structure that coincided with a canal and major roadways, respectively. I identified spatially restricted dispersal in all populations leading to parallel decays in spatial autocorrelation with increased distance. Habitat suitability modeling revealed a consistent response of rat distribution to human population density, income, and building characteristics. Landscape genetic modeling indicated that models incorporating features of the built physical environment consistently predict gene flow processes, though unique landscape effects were identified in each city, particularly at local spatial scales. Further, I found that habitat suitability and genetic connectivity were uncoupled (i.e., driven by different factors) and habitat is rarely the best predictor of gene flow for urban rats. My results demonstrate the utility of multi-landscape studies in identifying generalized trends across populations, with implications for the management of invasive pest populations. Ultimately, this dissertation improves our understanding of the influence of urban landscapes on neutral evolutionary processes in widely distributed species and the ecology of commensal rodents.

AB  - Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei’s GST = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.

AB  - Gene flow in birds can be affected by urbanization depending on natural history traits and adaptability to habitat change. Contrasting results can be expected when comparing species with opposite resilience to urbanization. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis, and the urban dweller house wren Troglodytes aedon. We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion.

AB  - We monitored the last remaining Asian elephant populations in China over the past decade. Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, α and β, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu’Er) carried mtDNA from the α clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the β clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Understanding the environmental factors driving species‐genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs) is critical for designing appropriate conservation and management strategies to protect biodiversity. Yet, few studies have explored the impact of changing land use patterns on SGDCs specifically in aquatic communities. This study examined patterns of genetic diversity in roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) together with fish species composition across 19 locations in a large river catchment, spanning a gradient in land use. Our findings show significant correlations between some, but not all, species and genetic diversity end points. For example, genetic and species differentiation showed a weak but significant linear relationship across the Thames catchment, but additional diversity measures such as allelic richness and fish population abundance did not. Further examination of patterns in species and genetic diversity indicated that land use intensification has a modest effect on fish diversity compared to the combined influence of geographical isolation and land use intensification. These results indicate that environmental changes in riparian habitats have the potential to amplify shifts in the composition of stream fish communities in poorly connected river stretches. Conservation and management strategies for fish populations should, therefore, focus on enhancing connectivity between river stretches and limit conversion of nearby land to arable or urban use to maintain current levels of biodiversity.

TI  - Plant migration along freeways in and around an arid urban area: Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Gade, Kristin Joan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - General ecological thought pertaining to plant biology, conservation, and urban areas has rested on two potentially contradictory underlying assumptions. The first is that non-native plants can spread easily from human developments to "pristine" areas. The second is that native plants cannot disperse through developed areas. Both assume anthropogenic changes to ecosystems create conditions that favor non-native plants and hinder native species. However, it is just as likely that anthropogenic alterations of habitats will favor certain groups of plant species with similar functional traits, whether native or not. Migration of plants can be divided into the following stages: dispersal, germination, establishment, reproduction and spread. Functional traits of species determine which are most successful at each of the stages of invasion or range enlargement. I studied the traits that allow both native and non-native plant species to disperse into freeway corridors, germinate, establish, reproduce, and then disperse along those corridors in Phoenix, Arizona. Field methods included seed bank sample collection and germination, vegetation surveys, and seed trapping. I also evaluated concentrations of plant-available nitrate as a result of localized nitrogen deposition. While many plant species found on the roadsides are either landscape varieties or typical weedy species, some uncommon native species and unexpected non-native species were also encountered. Maintenance regimes greatly influence the amount of vegetative cover and species composition along roadsides. Understanding which traits permit success at various stages of the invasion process indicates whether it is native, non-native, or species with particular traits that are likely to move through the city and establish in the desert. In a related case study conducted in Victoria, Australia, transportation professionals and ecologists were surveyed regarding preferences for roadside landscape design. Roadside design and maintenance projects are typically influenced by different groups of transportation professionals at various stages in a linear project cycle. Landscape architects and design professionals have distinct preferences and priorities compared to other transportation professionals and trained ecologists. The case study reveals the need for collaboration throughout the stages of design, construction and maintenance in order to efficiently manage roadsides for multiple priorities.

AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon with major effects on species, the structure of community functional traits and ecological interactions. Body size is a key species trait linked to metabolism, life‐history and dispersal as well as a major determinant of ecological networks. Here, using a well‐replicated urban–rural sampling design in Central Europe, we investigate the direction of change of body size in response to urbanization in three common bumblebee species, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris, and potential knock‐on effects on pollination service provision. We found foragers of B. terrestris to be larger in cities and the body size of all species to be positively correlated with road density (albeit at different, species‐specific scales); these are expected consequences of habitat fragmentation resulting from urbanization. High ambient temperature at sampling was associated with both a small body size and an increase in variation of body size in all three species. At the community level, the community‐weighted mean body size and its variation increased with urbanization. Urbanization had an indirect positive effect on pollination services through its effects not only on flower visitation rate but also on community‐weighted mean body size and its variation. We discuss the eco‐evolutionary implications of the effect of urbanization on body size, and the relevance of these findings for the key ecosystem service of pollination.

AB  - We investigated the patterns of genetic diversity and structure of African forest elephants in a human‐modified landscape in the Gamba complex of protected areas (GCPA), a tropical wilderness area along the southwest coast of Gabon. We collected 298 elephant fecal samples from four sites (Sette Cama, Gamba area, Vera Plains, and Mayonami), along approximately 80 km of coastline from north to south. We used microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to successfully genotype 295 of the 298 fecal samples, and identified 213 individuals. Using sex markers, we identified 84 males and 118 females; we could not determine the sex of the remaining 11 individuals. We also characterized the sex, group size, and social status of crop‐raiding elephants and did not find characteristics distinguishing them from nonraiders. Overall, our mtDNA and microsatellite markers revealed that elephants in the research area maintain high levels of genetic variation and low levels of subdivision. Gene flow appears to be mostly mediated by male dispersal away from natal herds. Our structure analysis revealed two highly admixed genetic clusters, attributable to high connectivity among the protected areas. However, forest areas within the GCPA have become increasingly fragmented by human‐induced habitat modification. We detected a pattern of isolation by distance, accentuated by the presence of the town of Gamba between Sette‐Cama and Mayonami. We found a high degree of connectivity among sampling locations within the GCPA. This supports the importance of establishing agricultural best practices to reduce habitat loss that may sever gene exchange and to maintain connectivity, as well as to avoid human–elephant conflict that can result in retaliatory killing of elephants in this area. This study emphasizes the importance of conducting baseline monitoring of demographic data, genetic diversity, and structure to enable future comparisons to assess the long‐term impact of human‐induced habitat fragmentation.

TI  - Small mammal communities and functional connectivity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley: A landscape perspective
AU  - Dolman, Richard William
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity, negatively affecting all major taxonomic groups. To mitigate these effects, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas with 1 goal of serving as a wildlife corridor connecting the Gulf coast with Falcon Reservoir. Since its creation in 1979, the LRGV National Wildlife Refuge (LRGVNWR) has grown to include 146 individual tracts, totaling about 44,500 ha primarily along the Rio Grande. The refuge offers the ability to conduct research in an increasingly common landscape pattern, a mosaic composed of native/restored habitat fragmented by agricultural and urbanized land use. My study first examined how aspects of the habitat and landscape influenced small mammal diversity in LRGV refuge tracts. I live-trapped small mammals in 14 refuge tracts and calculated standard diversity indices from the resulting captures. Of 5,115 total captures, 49.7% were white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus ), representing 2 of 4 species statistically shown to prefer edge habitat. Although this demonstrated refuge lands were dominated by edge-adapted species, comparison to previous studies from within the refuge revealed a decrease in magnitude of their domination. Canonical redundancy analysis identified the amount of habitat available within 500 m of capture sites and average vegetation density within 150 m as important landscape features contributing to occurrence of small mammal species. These results demonstrated that the refuges in the LRGV are achieving their main goals to restore and maintain habitat. Secondly, I examined effects of agricultural and urban fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure in populations of P. leucopus from 5 refuge tracts in the LRGV. Low nucleotide diversity combined with high haplotype diversity indicated a time of low effective population size of white-footed mice followed by recent population expansion. Localized population structuring suggested that P. leucopus was unable to effectively disperse through areas dominated by urbanization, while agricultural matrix offered no resistance. These results highlight the importance of preferentially acquiring and restoring land in areas dominated by an agricultural matrix to protect small mammal species from future urban encroachment.

AB  - The success of species reintroductions can depend on a combination of environmental, demographic, and genetic factors. Although the importance of these factors in the success of reintroductions is well‐accepted, they are typically evaluated independently, which can miss important interactions. For species that persist in metapopulations, movement through and interaction with the landscape is predicted to be a vital component of persistence. Simulation‐based approaches are a promising technique for evaluating the independent and combined effects of these factors on the outcome of various reintroduction and associated management actions. We report results from a simulation study of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) reintroduction to three watersheds of the Pend Oreille River system in northeastern Washington State, USA. We used an individual‐based, spatially explicit simulation model to evaluate how reintroduction strategies, life history variation, and riverscape structure (e.g., network topology) interact to influence the demographic and genetic characteristics of reintroduced bull trout populations in three watersheds. Simulation scenarios included a range of initial genetic stocks (informed by empirical bull trout genetic data), variation in migratory tendency and life history, and two landscape connectivity alternatives representing a connected network (isolation‐by‐distance) and a fragmented network (isolation‐by‐barrier, using the known existing barriers). A novel feature of these simulations was the ability to consider the interaction of both demographic and genetic (i.e., demogenetic) factors in riverscapes with implicit asymmetric movement probabilities across the barriers. We found that connectivity (presence or absence of barriers) had the largest effect on demographic and genetic outcomes over 200 yr, with a greater effect than both initial genetic diversity and life history variation. We also identified regions of the study system in which bull trout populations persisted across a wide range of demographic, life history, and environmental connectivity parameters. Finally, we found no evidence that initial neutral genetic diversity influenced genetic diversity and structure after 200 yr; instead, genetic drift due to stray rate and population isolation dominated and erased any initial differences in genetic diversity. Our results highlight the utility of spatially explicit demogenetic approaches in exploring and understanding population dynamics—and their implications for management strategies—in fresh waters.

AU  - Hejkal, Judit

AU  - Klaus, Valentin H
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - An important limitation of studies on the ecological value of urban habitats is the question of habitat connectivity. While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Münster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement. The graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to analyse urban habitat connectivity but also to illustrate results obtained.

TI  - The Impact of Infrastructure on Habitat Connectivity for Wildlife
AU  - Bliss-Ketchum, Leslie Lynne
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wildlife need connected habitats to move across the landscape to meet foraging needs, reproduce and establish new territories. Increasingly, habitat areas are lost due to conversion to alternative uses such as agriculture or urban development and being carved into pieces by roads and other transportation infrastructure. Roads are considered a major contributor to habitat fragmentation particularly as they are long, linear features prevalent throughout the landscape. The potential barriers species encounter and interact with on the landscape, such as roads or fences, could be permeable to some species and a near complete barrier to others. This creates a challenge when conservation professionals work on methods to plan for enhancing and preserving connectivity across the landscape. While roads can present weak to complete barriers to wildlife, depending on the animal and traffic volume, mitigations such as under-crossings and green bridges on highways at least partially increase the permeability of the landscape to some of these species. The few studies evaluating the effectiveness of these structures for at least three years typically focused on a single species. Here, we monitored the crossing structure under Boeckman Road, in Wilsonville Oregon, for wildlife activity across summer seasons for ten years, since construction of the road and subsequent opening to traffic. This long-term multi-species dataset, which includes monitoring when the road was closed to traffic has provided a unique opportunity. Wildlife activity was collected using sand track pads monitored during summer seasons from 2009 to 2018. Wildlife activity showed a significant community level response from year to year and species-specific responses to year, vegetation change, disturbance, detection area, and previous experimental additions of artificial light. Black-tailed deer showed a significant negative association with disturbance, i.e. the presence of traffic and construction activity. Average annual detections of coyote, bullfrog, cottontail rabbit, and eastern gray squirrel demonstrate a dramatic but not significant response to the road closure period. In addition, it appears that the transition between species with preferences for lower canopy cover, and those preferring greater canopy cover, co-occurs with the road closure period, particularly in 2013. This is also the year that invasive plant management activities (mowing and spraying) stopped. Long-term studies such as this one can help researchers and managers design monitoring programs to best account for variable responses over time by documenting changes in use and working to identify covariates and interactive effects that may be driving those changes. Managers working on projects where vegetation disturbance or restoration is being conducted next to crossing structures may decide to delay monitoring until vegetation communities and/or habituation responses have had time to stabilize, avoiding erroneous conclusions about structure use. Roads create barriers to animal movement through collisions and habitat fragmentation. Investigators have attempted to use traffic volume, the number of vehicles passing a point on a road segment, to predict effects to wildlife populations approximately linearly and along taxonomic lines; however, taxonomic groupings cannot provide sound predictions because closely related species often respond differently. We assess the role of wildlife behavioral responses to traffic volume as a tool to predict barrier effects from vehicle-caused mortality and avoidance, to provide an early warning system that recognizes traffic volume as a trigger for mitigation, and to better interpret roadkill data. We propose four categories of behavioral response based on the perceived danger to traffic: Nonresponders, Pausers, Speeders, and Avoiders. Nonresponders attempt to cross highways regardless of traffic volume. Pausers stop in the face of danger so have a low probability of successful crossing when traffic volume increases. Hence, highway barrier effects are primarily due to mortality for Nonresponders and Pausers at high traffic volumes. Speeders run away from danger but are unable to do so successfully as traffic volume increases. At moderate to high volume, Speeders are repelled by traffic danger. Avoiders face lower mortality than other categories because they begin to avoid traffic at relatively low traffic volumes. Hence, avoidance causes barrier effects more than mortality for Speeders and Avoiders even at relatively moderate traffic volumes. By considering a species’ risk-avoidance response to traffic, managers can make more appropriate and timely decisions to mitigate effects before populations decline or become locally extinct. Barriers to animal movement can isolate populations, impacting their genetic diversity, susceptibility to disease, and access to resources. Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

AU  - Miller, Carol Lee
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A forest gap model was used to investigate how surface fires can create spatial pattern and to examine the consequences of that pattern on the spread of subsequent fires. These questions were examined in light of past fire suppression, current management options, and future climatic change. The model simulates forest characteristics, fuel loads and fire intensity within a forest stand with a spatial resolution of 0.02 ha.The spatial heterogeneity of species composition increased under a simulated fire regime relative to simulations without fire. Although simulated surface fires altered the structure of the spatial heterogeneity of basal area within a forest stand, analysis of spatial autocorrelation did not detect a fire-generated pattern. Crown fires may exert a self-organizing influence on landscape pattern, but results from this model suggest that surface fires may not.Simulations demonstrated that connectivity of burnable area was inversely related to fire frequency and generally increased with elevation. Certain conditions of fuel moisture and fuel bed bulk density outweighed these relationships. Nonlinear thresholds in connectivity occurred across the elevation gradient as a result of gradients in fuel loads and fuel bed bulk density simulated by the model.Potential effects of climatic change on forest structure, composition and the fire regime were investigated. The effects of climatic change on forest structure and composition were site-specific. Fire frequency responded directly to climate's influence on fuel moisture, while fire extent was affected by changes that occurred in either forest structure or species composition. The influence of species composition on fuel bed bulk density was particularly important. Future fires in the Sierra Nevada could be both more frequent and of greater spatial extent if climate model predictions prove true.The effects of fire suppression and current management options for restoring pre-suppression forest conditions were evaluated. Simulation results suggest that forest structure, species composition, and spatial autocorrelation structure may be restored quickly after 100 years of fire suppression if disturbances are reintroduced that cause significant tree mortality.

AB  - This study aimed to use the applications of Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (eSDM), Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for the design of a protected area (PA) for the critically endangered yellow-spotted mountain newt, Neurergus derjugini, by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape changes in western Iran and northeastern Iraq. Potential recent and future distributions (2050 and 2070) were reconstructed by eSDM using eight algorithms with MRI-CGCM3 and CCSM4 models. The GIS-based MCDA siting procedure was followed inside habitats with high eSDM suitability by eliminating the main roads, cities, high village density, dams, poor vegetation, low stream density, agricultural lands and high ridge density. Then, within the remaining relevant areas, 10 polygons were created as “nominations” for PAs (NPAs). Finally, for 10 different NPAs, the suitability score was ranked based on ratings and weights (analytical hierarchy process) of the number of newt localities, NPA connectivity, NPA shape, NPA habitat suitability in 2070, NPA size, genetic diversity, village density and distance to nearest PAs, cities, and main roads. This research could serve as a modern realistic approach for environmental management to plan conservation areas using a cost-effective and affordable technique.

TI  - Patterns and Processes of Genetic Diversity in the Endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox
AU  - Wilbert, Tammy R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Survival of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (SJKF; Vulpes macrotis mutica) is challenged by reduced and fragmented habitat resulting from anthropogenic land uses in the Central Valley of California. Because the SJKF is adapted to arid landscapes and utilizes large home ranges to prey on kangaroo rats, genetic techniques are very useful to study these elusive animals. We used annual noninvasive genetic surveys from 2009 to 2011 to document the kit foxes on the Topaz Solar Farms (TSF) in San Luis Obispo Co., California, prior to the construction of the solar facility. We identified 45 individuals from 351 fresh scat samples and found kit foxes predominantly used the annual grasslands and rarely used agricultural lands. Second, we conducted 3 years of systematic transect surveys for scat throughout the Ciervo-Panoche area. We identified 93 kit foxes, with half of the individuals carrying a mtDNA haplotype with a 16bp deletion that had not been previously identified. Next, we used 795 scat and tissue samples collected over a period of 20 years to ascertain landscape level patterns of connectivity and population dynamics of kit foxes in the San Joaquin Valley. We found 3 geographically and genetically distinct groups that are highly disconnected and have undergone a 76% reduction from their estimated historic population size. Finally, we used pyrosequencing to characterize three major histocompatibility (MHC) genes that have been shown to play a role in immunity. We selected a subset of individuals from two relatively stable natural environments and compared their patterns of MHC variation to kit foxes adapted to the urban environment in Bakersfield, CA. Every gene (DQA, DQB, and DRB) was polygenic with varying degrees of polymorphism, although DRB alleles translated into a greater number of unique antigen binding sites, and thus greater immune system diversity. Urban and wild populations had similar allelic diversity, and each carried unique alleles. Each of these studies resulted from long-term collaborative efforts from a team of researchers that are working closely with federal, state and private agencies responsible for the protection of the endangered SJKF. The results of our research on patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity are already playing an important role in the design of SJKF conservation and management plans.

AB  - Lemurs are among the world's most threatened mammals. The critically endangered black‐and‐white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), in particular, has recently experienced rapid population declines due to habitat loss, ecological sensitivities to habitat degradation, and extensive human hunting pressure. Despite this, a recent study indicates that ruffed lemurs retain among the highest levels of genetic diversity for primates. Identifying how this diversity is apportioned and whether gene flow is maintained among remnant populations will help to diagnose and target conservation priorities. We sampled 209 individuals from 19 sites throughout the remaining V. variegata range. We used 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and ~550 bp of mtDNA sequence data to evaluate genetic structure and population dynamics, including dispersal patterns and recent population declines. Bayesian cluster analyses identified two distinct genetic clusters, which optimally partitioned data into populations occurring on either side of the Mangoro River. Localities north of the Mangoro were characterized by greater genetic diversity, greater gene flow (lower genetic differentiation) and higher mtDNA haplotype and nucleotide diversity than those in the south. Despite this, genetic differentiation across all sites was high, as indicated by high average FST (0.247) and ΦST (0.544), and followed a pattern of isolation‐by‐distance. We use these results to suggest future conservation strategies that include an effort to maintain genetic diversity in the north and restore connectivity in the south. We also note the discordance between patterns of genetic differentiation and current subspecies taxonomy, and encourage a re‐evaluation of conservation management units moving forward.

AU  - DiLeo, Michelle Francis
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Understanding the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic landscape features on genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity has important implications for conservation of species living in fragmented environments. Here, I combine population genetic data, detailed land cover information, and computer simulations to explore how landscape shapes genetic structure across two regional populations of the threatened eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) in Ontario, Canada: one along the eastern shores of Georgian Bay and the other largely confined to the northern half of the Bruce Peninsula. First I used spatial Bayesian assignment to quantify the genetic population structure within each regional population. I found marked subpopulation structure within eastern Georgian Bay with differentiation of island and mainland snakes, a north-south split within the mainland coinciding with the town of Parry Sound, and evidence of further subdivision within the cluster of snakes north of Parry Sound. In contrast I found no population subdivision within the mainland of the Bruce Peninsula, but genetic distinction of mainland and island snakes. Next, I identified the landscape features that shape spatial genetic structure within regional populations. In eastern Georgian Bay I found local variation in the effect of landscape on populations. North of Parry Sound I found no effect of landscape on inter-individual genetic differentiation, but a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance. In contrast I found that both open water and roads restrict gene flow of snakes south of Parry Sound. I found no evidence of isolation-by-distance or that landscape shape genetic structure within the Bruce Peninsula.Finally I used individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to identify the lag-time associated with the detection of contemporary landscape feature effects on genetic structure of massasaugas, and explore the consequences of using spatially correlated land cover elements in landscape genetic analyses. I found that the genetic consequences of roads could be detected within 2-12 generations when population sizes were small or juvenile dispersal was low. However, I also found that roads could be spuriously identified as impediments to gene flow when spatially correlated features such as water are included in genetic models.

AB  - Seed and spore dispersal play important roles in the spatial distribution of plant species and communities. Though dispersal processes are often thought to be more important at larger spatial scales, the distribution patterns of species and plant communities even at small scales can be determined, at least in part, by dispersal. I studied the influence of dispersal in southern Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests by categorizing species by dispersal morphology and by using spatial pattern and habitat connectivity as predictors of species distribution and community composition. All vascular plant species were recorded at three nested sample scales (10000, 1000, and 100 m2), on plots with varying levels of habitat connectivity across the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Models predicting species distributions generally had higher predictive power when incorporating spatial pattern and connectivity, particularly at small scales. Despite wide variation in performance, models of locally dispersing species (species without adaptations to dispersal by wind or vertebrates) were most frequently improved by the addition of spatial predictors. Patterns in plant communities were also compared among dispersal categories, and though it was shown that species without dispersal adaptations were less likely to co-occur, this was more likely to be caused by differences in frequency across dispersal categories than by dispersal limitation per se. Spatial pattern, distance, and connectivity were significant predictors of non-random patterns of species turnover at all scales and were stronger among dispersal-limited species groups. Species with limited dispersal were also less frequent at all three sampling scales than those with adaptations for vertebrate dispersal and had smaller geographic ranges than either wind- or vertebrate-dispersed species. Species with no dispersal adaptations were overrepresented among southern Appalachian endemics and lineages endemic to North America, whereas species dispersed by vertebrates were overrepresented among Tertiary disjunct lineages, and species dispersed by spores were cosmopolitan. Relationships among dispersal and biogeographic affinity reflect the evolutionary history of the mixed mesophytic flora owing to adaptation of dispersal mechanisms to regional environmental conditions, the relative ages of lineages, and the effect of dispersal mechanism on the distributions of plants across time and space.

AB  - ContextGenetic diversity is one of the most important facets of biological diversity, and changes in the spatial pattern of habitats, often modified by human activity, are believed to have affected the genetic diversity of resident natural populations.ObjectivesWe undertook a landscape genetic analysis in order to determine which landscape features influence gene flow within Asian black bear populations and to identify the underlying processes.MethodsIn our evaluation of gene flow, we estimated four parameters of resistance with regard to landscape elevation: the mean, the difference between the highest and lowest, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation of elevation among individuals. We then examined the resistance effect of different land use types.ResultsWith the exception of mean elevation, we found that all parameters showed a significant relationship with genetic distance, indicating that unevenness in elevation provides functional resistance to gene flow. Although we found no evidence of landscape barriers (isolation‐by‐barrier), there was an indication of landscape resistance (isolation‐by‐resistance). Urban area and farmland are suggested to be the strong factors contributing to the resistance to gene flow, even though isolation‐by‐distance was also detected. When we examined gene flow for pairs of males and pairs of females, both isolation‐by‐distance and isolation‐by‐resistance were stronger in order of female pairs, male pairs, all individual pairs.ConclusionsWe conclude that landscape resistance was detectable with a high contrast in landscape heterogeneity and they are more influential on females than males.OPEN PRACTICESThis article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally‐shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

TI  - Inconsistent effects of urbanization on amphibian genetic diversity
AU  - Schmidt, Chloé
AU  - Garroway, Colin J
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading causes of vertebrate population declines. These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing population sizes in human transformed habitats. With time this can lead to reduced effective population size and genetic diversity which restricts the ability of wildlife to cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects are generally applicable across taxa. Here, we repurposed and synthesized raw microsatellite data from online repositories from 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density and the Human Footprint Index, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found no consistent relationships for any of our genetic metrics. While we did not detect directional effects for most species, a few generalist species responded positively to urbanization. These results contrast with consistent negative effects of urbanization in mammals and species specific positive and negative effects in birds. In the context of widespread amphibian declines, our results suggest that habitat loss in human transformed habitats is a more immediate concern than declining genetic diversity in populations that persist.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - As the rate of urbanization continues to increase globally, a growing body of research is emerging that investigates how urbanization shapes the movement—and consequent gene flow—of species in cities. Of particular interest are native species that persist in cities, either as small relict populations or as larger populations of synanthropic species that thrive alongside humans in new urban environments. In this study, we used genomic sequence data (SNPs) and spatially explicit individual‐based analyses to directly compare the genetic structure and patterns of gene flow in two small mammals with different dispersal abilities that occupy the same urbanized landscape to evaluate how mobility impacts genetic connectivity. We collected 215 white‐footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban‐to‐rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near‐panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban‐to‐rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution. Moreover, here we document the impacts of dispersal capacity on connectivity for native species that have persisted as the urban landscape matrix expands.

TI  - Genetic Connectivity of Stream Salamanders in Urban, Suburban, and Rural Habitats
AU  - Fusco, Nicole A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ongoing human population growth and increased urban development around the world is inflicting new pressures and challenges for wildlife living within areas affected by urbanization. Habitat alteration can have severe consequences for native species that remain in previously undisturbed areas. Urban development has shown to reduce abundance and density of populations and create barriers to gene flow for stream salamanders in urban areas. Although they are still relatively common and abundant through the Northeast, Northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) populations are declining in urban habitats including in New York City. In this study, I explored genetic structure of E. bislineata across an urban, suburban and rural habitat to better understand how urbanization is affecting genetic connectivity between headwater streams. Next, I investigated what environmental and/or urban features influence gene flow patterns in E. bislineata across these same three habitats using landscape genetic methods. Lastly, I used environmental DNA monitoring with metabarcoding techniques to explore stream salamander presence on an urban-to-rural gradient and to investigate overall vertebrate species richness differences to further understand how urban development may be affecting biodiversity in urban aquatic ecosystems.E. bislineata within the urban habitat had greater genetic structure, yet exhibited comparable genetic diversity levels to individuals in the suburban and rural habitat. A mixture of terrestrial variables influence gene flow in the urban habitat, percent canopy cover is most influential for gene flow in the suburban habitat, and variation in aquatic variables affects gene flow patterns for rural stream salamanders. Urbanization factors were identified as the second most important features affecting genetic variation for salamanders in the suburban and urban habitats. Finally, using eDNA from stream water, I found that E. bislineata is present in streams across a gradient of urban development, while another common stream salamander species, Desmognathus fuscus was only detected in more non-urban habitats. With this method, I also detected differences in species composition in urban versus non-urban habitats, mostly due to more non-native species eDNA detected in more urbanized streams. This dissertation provides further understanding of how urbanization affects the evolution of a native amphibian species and how urban development affects stream salamander distribution in the NYC metropolitan area. This information will inform conservation efforts and urban planning in cities that want to promote longevity of populations of this indicator species in our urban ecosystems.

T2  - PeerJ PrePrints
AB  - Although tramway tracks are found in most cities, their flora is not thoroughly researched. Many more studies relate to railway areas as specific anthropogenic habitats for the development of plants. Both railway and tram tracks represent specific ecological migration corridors for plants. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the floristic composition and selected soil parameters of tram tracks. In 2014-2015, floristic studies were carried out along tram tracks in the Upper Silesian conurbation (southern Poland). Depending on the dominant species, five groups of sites with varying floristic composition were distinguished. Five plots with an area of 1 m2 were randomly selected in each of the sites. The species composition was determined at each plot together with the cover-abundance of all species occurring at a given plot according to Westhoff’s and van Maarel’s scale. Soil samples were collected from each plot and analysed for pH, the content of biogenic elements and heavy metals. A total of 329 species of vascular plants were identified on the tram tracks of the surveyed area, and 40 species on the plots. The dominant species included: Amaranthus retroflexus, Achillea millefolium, Plantago lanceolata, Hieracium pilosella, Silene vulgaris, Taraxacum sp. and Trifolium repens. Grouping of plots in respect of soil factors largely reflects their species composition. It has been found that the content of nitrate nitrogen, lead and phosphorus has the strongest impact on the floristic diversity of the railway tracks. Based on these parameters, three groups of species were distinguished: nitrophytes, metallophytes and common, i.e. not closely associated with the studied soil properties. Three habitat types of varying plant species composition were distinguished based on the content of nitrate nitrogen and lead: 1) nitrophilous dominated by Amaranthus retroflexus, 2) with increased content of heavy metals, dominated by Silene vulgaris and 3) mesotrophic dominated by meadow species(Achillea millefolium, Plantago lanceolata, Hieracium pilosella, Taraxacum sp., Trifolium repens).

TI  - Wildlife Crossing Over Route 101 and the Benefits and Challenges it Presents
AU  - Moinuddin, Sheik
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Biodiversity across the world is in decline due to population increases as well as urban development. Subsequently, fragmentations of the landscape and habitat loss are occurring. Globally, only twenty-one biodiversity hotspots remain, and nowhere is the risk more severe than in Southern California. In countering these threats, it has become necessary to connect all available open lands in Southern California to create a network for wildlife movement. Such an interconnected set of reserves will allow natural ecological processes to continue and thrive, as they have for centuries. Thus, researchers in the field identified the Santa Monica – Sierra Madre Connection as the highest priority linkages to conserve, which would provide miles of roaming ground to a wide variety of animals, ranging from shrews to mountain lions. Mammals, especially mountain lions, require a large area for hunting and to thrive genetically. However, this once-contiguous mountain range stretching from Santa Monica to Sierra Madre was severed in the early 1970s by the construction of the US-101 Freeway, dividing the habitat range into isolated habitat fragments and severely restricting movement for many wildlife species, including mountain lions, bobcats, gray foxes, coyotes, and mule deer, between the two mountain ranges. For mountain lions in particular, this restriction has led to increased inbreeding, territorial fighting, and very low genetic diversity. Research conducted by the National Park Service since 2002 has demonstrated that because of a fragmented landscape, mountain lions could face extinction in the Santa Monica Mountains within fifty years, with a median of fifteen years.Therefore, researchers analyzed several locations and investigated probable alternatives and recommended the development of a vegetated bridge over US-101, near Liberty Canyon Road, in the City of Agoura Hills, which would both provide the best location in the region for improving connectivity and serve the broadest range of species.Once built, this bridge would be the largest wildlife crossing of its kind in the world and the first to attempt a large-scale intervention for wildlife in an urban area with over twenty million people—and over a roadway carrying over three hundred thousand vehicles per day. This project will set a model worldwide for urban wildlife conservation and help inform future efforts. It has renewed the urgency to keep our wildlife from going extinct because of urban development and demonstrates that animals and humans can coexist.

TI  - Human Disturbance on High Andean Forests in Colombia: Spatio-temporal Dynamics and Vegetation Analysis of Forests Fragments around Bogotá, and Potential Effects of Climate Change on Treeline Species Distribution
AU  - Calbi, Mariasole
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - This research presents a multi-scalar work on the effects of human disturbance on high Andean forests in Colombia. It focuses on the analysis of vegetation composition and structure and on the dynamics of forest cover change and connectivity through time in selected localities around Bogotá. Additionally, a distribution model exercise is carried out to further the understanding of the environmental constraints driving the present distribution of a distinctive Andean treeline species and to examine its response to climate change in the future.High Andean forests are a unique and highly biodiverse ecosystem, located at high elevations in one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, the Tropical Andes. Unfortunately, these forests are extremely fragmented and particularly vulnerable to climate change. Despite the fact that they provide essential ecosystem services to neighboring high Andean cities, such as the capital of Colombia, Bogotá, overall, high Andean forests have been poorly studied. Their fragility and their great value in terms of environmental services, together with their outstanding diversity, make them ecosystems with high priority for conservation. Nevertheless, especially around Bogotá, the vegetation studies carried out often have been rather circumscribed, rarely incorporating more complex parameters such as landscape fragmentation and anthropic disturbance metrics nor assessing functional and phylogenetic diversity attributes and ecosystem services. Also, there is a lack of studies that consider multiple vegetation strata at once and that address long-term changes in the extent and structure of high Andean forests, pairing plot-based work with forest cover change analysis. Lastly, few efforts have been made so far to model the response to climate change of high Andean forests and their species. Investigating these aspects could provide meaningful insights into species’ responses to anthropic influences and community assembly mechanisms, broadening our understanding of high Andean forests and strengthening strategies to conserve them.The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between human disturbance and the condition of high Andean forest in the surroundings of Bogotá, the growing capital city of Colombia. Therefore, three parallel approaches were developed and implemented. On one hand, permanent plots establishment and plot-based fieldwork was carried out in several localities in the surroundings of Bogotá. Here, tree layer and understory vegetation were assessed and analyzed in terms of their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, but also as to their structure and above-ground biomass production. A broad array of environmental factors and anthropic disturbance-related indicators was compiled and subsequently used to characterize the tree layer and understory plant communities using a cluster analysis in combination with ordination techniques (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and partial Redundancy Analysis). Finally, environmental and disturbance predictors were related to tree and understory diversity metrics and above-ground biomass by means of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). As a result, a noticeable effect of anthropic related predictors on both tree and understory layer community composition and also a direct negative effect on tree layer diversity and above-ground biomass production have been documented.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Planning and Management
AB  - The process of urbanization and urban land use conversion inevitably disturbs the structure and function of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions. The research concludes that regional urban-ecological sustainability based on scientific assessment, planning, and design provides a rational basis for sustainable urban development and landscape management.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Regularly managed electric power line corridors may provide habitats for both early-successional grassland plant species and disturbance-dependent alien plant species. These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups. We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity. The results have implications for grassland conservation and invasive alien species control in urban areas.

AB  - Freshwater species often show high levels of endemism and risk of extinction owing to their limited dispersal abilities. This is exemplified by the stenotopic freshwater crab, Johora singaporensis which is one of the world's 100 most threatened species, and currently inhabits less than 0.01 km2 of five low order hill streams within the highly urbanized island city‐state of Singapore. We compared populations of J. singaporensis with that of the non‐threatened, widespread, abundant, and eurytopic freshwater crab, Parathelphusa maculata, and found surprisingly high congruence between their population genomic histories. Based on 2,617 and 2,470 genome‐wide SNPs mined via the double‐digest restriction‐associated DNA sequencing method for ~90 individuals of J. singaporensis and P. maculata, respectively, the populations are strongly isolated (FST = 0.146–0.371), have low genetic diversity for both species (also for COI), and show signatures of recent genetic bottlenecks. The most genetically isolated populations for both species are separated from other populations by one of the oldest roads in Singapore. These results suggest that anthropogenic developments may have impacted stream‐dependent species in a uniform manner, regardless of ubiquity, habitat preference, or dispersal modes of the species. While signs of inbreeding were not detected for the critically endangered species, the genetic distinctiveness and low diversity of the populations call for genetic rescue and connecting corridors between the remaining fragments of the natural habitat.

AB  - Brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide. Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss are leading threats to global biodiversity and can alter patterns of dispersal, population dynamics, and genetics with implications for long-term species persistence. Most habitat fragmentation research has focused on recently fragmented species that historically occupied interconnected habitat patches. We know comparatively little about how naturally fragmented species may respond to habitat loss. For these species, local habitat patch quality may influence the dynamics and genetics of populations more than the structure of the surrounding landscape (e.g., degree of isolation of suitable habitat). I examined aspects of the ecology and evolution of populations inhabiting fragmented landscapes, using two butterfly species representing relict populations that are 1) recently fragmented by anthropogenic activities (Mormon metalmark, Apodemia mormo), and 2) naturally fragmented (bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe). I assessed patterns of genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP) and flight-related morphological variation, and their relationship to measures of surrounding landscape structure and local habitat quality.Population genetic analysis of the anthropogenically fragmented Mormon metalmark revealed a high degree of spatial genetic structure, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic scale (<20 km). Management of this endangered population should focus on increasing connectivity among the most isolated sub-populations and through urban areas. For the naturally fragmented bog copper, genetic diversity was explained by variables related to patch quality rather than landscape structure. Movement ability in the bog copper (inferred by flight morphology) appeared to depend on both local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape. Also, using an AFLP-based genome scan approach, I identified signatures of selection in the bog copper associated with fine-scale landscape heterogeneity.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes.

TI  - Demographic and genetic response of woodland amphibians to landscape change in southern Connecticut
AU  - Gibbs, James Peter
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A critical question in conservation biology concerns how changes in land-use patterns affect the persistence of plant and animal populations and the distribution of genetic variation within them. This dissertation focused on woodland amphibians occupying forested habitats arrayed along an urban-rural gradient in southern Connecticut for examining these issues. My objectives were: (1) to identify determinants of the structure of the forest mosaic, the arena within which demographic and genetic processes in woodland amphibians operated; (2) to examine whether amphibian dispersal occurred randomly with respect to several prominent, natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape; (3) to determine thresholds of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for different species of woodland amphibians; and (4) to test several hypotheses about microevolution in amphibian populations subjected to induced subdivision.Distinct trends in the structure and dynamics of forested lands, and hence the habitats available to woodland amphibians, occurred along a spatially continuous urban-rural gradient. Primary determinants of forest occurrence in 1990 included slope and drainage attributes of underlying soils, proximity to transportation corridors and urban centers, and historical 'common land' designations. Amphibian movements, measured from captures in strategically placed pit-fall traps, were generally facilitated by stream beds, hindered by roads, and variously affected by ecotones between forested lands and open lands. Notably, the most dispersive species with bi-phasic life cycles (Rana sylvatica and Notophthalmus viridescens) were the least tolerant of habitat fragmentation, whereas the least dispersive species with direct development (Plethodon cinereus) was the most tolerant. Tolerances to habitat fragmentation could be largely predicted with a spatially explicit population model. Genetic differentiation, measured with molecular genetic markers and morph frequencies in the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), was greater among fragmented subpopulations than among contiguous subpopulations. Among fragmented populations, differentiation was greater among those lacking historical forest connections than among those retaining such connections. Furthermore, genetic divergence was correlated with geographic distance in a population occupying continuous forest, whereas no such pattern was evident in a population occupying fragmented forests. Notably, overall levels of genetic diversity appeared to be affected little by population fragmentation.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Urban green space is an important refuge of biodiversity in urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between the landscape pattern of green spaces and biodiversity to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization. In this study, we collected insects from 45 green patches in Beijing during July 2012 using suction sampling. The green patches were dominated by managed lawns, mixed with scattered trees and shrubs. We examined the effects of landscape pattern on insect species density using hierarchical partitioning analysis and partial least squares regression. The results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that five explanatory variables, i.e., patch area (with 19.9% independent effects), connectivity (13.9%), distance to nearest patch (13.8%), diversity for patch types (11.0%), and patch shape (8.3%), significantly contributed to insect species density. With the partial least squares regression model, we found species density was negatively related to patch area, shape, connectivity, diversity for patch types and proportion of impervious surface at the significance level of p< 0.05 and positively related to proportion of vegetated land. Regression tree analysis further showed that the highest species density was found in green patches with an area <500 m2. Our results indicated that improvement in habitat quality, such as patch area and connectivity that are typically thought to be important for conservation, did not actually increase species density. However, increasing compactness (low-edge) of patch shape and landscape composition did have the expected effect. Therefore, it is recommended that the composition of the surrounding landscape should be considered simultaneously with planned improvements in local habitat quality.

TI  - Eco-Evolutionary Implications of Environmental Change Across Heterogeneous Landscapes
AU  - Homola, Jared J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Species use a variety of mechanisms to adapt to environmental change. These range from spatially tracking optimal environments, to phenotypically plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation. Due to increases in anthropogenic influence on environments, characteristics of change such as their duration and magnitude are undergoing fundamental shifts away from the natural disturbance regimes that shaped species’ evolution. This dissertation uses empirical data and simulation models to examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change across real, heterogeneous landscapes for multiple species, with an emphasis on anthropogenic changes. I used landscape genetics to evaluate the effects of urbanization on two native amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Population isolation was positively associated with local urbanization and lessened genetic diversity for both species. Resistance surface modelling revealed connectivity was diminished by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic landscape features relative to natural features. Further study of a subset of wood frog populations revealed adaptive evolution associated with urban environments. I identified a set of 37 loci with the capacity to correctly reassign individuals into rural or urban populations with 87.5 and 93.8% accuracy, respectively. I developed an agent-based model to examine how gene flow, rates of change, and strength of landscape spatial and temporal autocorrelation influence abundance outcomes for species experiencing an environmental shift. Analysis of 36 environmental scenarios suggests that environmental variation, which is an emergent property of landscape autocorrelation, is negatively associated with the magnitude and duration of abundance declines following environmental change. Higher levels of gene flow lessened this effect, particularly in abrupt change scenarios, although gradual changes also resulted in demographic costs. Lastly, I used an investigation of an emerging disease in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) to study within-generation responses to environmental pressures. Using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing I identified eight differentially expressed unigenes associated with the disease and seven related to environmental differences. Collectively, my dissertation provides numerous examples of how anthropogenically induced environmental change can direct ecological and evolutionary processes.

TI  - Matrix effects on individual and community-level responses of birds to forest fragmentation in Jamaica
AU  - Kennedy, Christina Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Land cover between habitat patches (“matrix”) can impact species persistence in fragmented landscapes by altering resource availability, edge effects, or inter-patch movement. This thesis examines how the matrix affects the Neotropical bird community in central Jamaica in landscapes where forest is embedded in three human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, peri-urban development, and bauxite mining) and one natural “matrix” (continuous forest). First, I examine whether richness, community composition, and abundances of resident birds differ in ∼ 100 forest patches within the four matrix types, and relate species responses to traits influencing dispersal, resource acquisition, and/or population growth. Agricultural landscapes were found to retain avian diversity and community assemblages most similar to intact forest relative to peri-urban and bauxite landscapes. Traits related to resource acquisition best predicted species responses, indicating that resource limitation driven by the matrix may be a primary factor driving bird responses to fragmentation. Next, I determine the relative influence of patch area, isolation, vegetation structure, and matrix type on the occupancy dynamics of resident insectivorous birds. Within-patch vegetation and matrix type were the most important determinants of colonization and extinction, but the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation on occupancy dynamics were matrix- and species-dependent. Across the community, the matrix influenced extinction probabilities more than colonization, indicating that extinction processes likely drive population dynamics. Finally, I examine the relative permeability of peri-urban, bauxite, and forested landscapes on the movement of the migrant American Redstart ( Setophaga ruticilla) and the resident Jamaican Tody (Todus todus) by experimentally translocating > 140 birds 0.6–4 km from their territories across landscape treatments. Redstarts returned with greater success and faster speed than Todies. Return success was not impacted by landscape treatment, but both species returned more rapidly in forest relative to bauxite matrix, with return times intermediate in a peri-urban matrix. These findings indicate that bird mobility in fragmented landscapes is mediated by the landscape matrix. This research is among few empirical studies to discern the impacts of different matrix types on species patterns and processes. These results inform theory on fragmentation as well as bird conservation in an understudied system.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Urbanization fragments landscapes and can impede the movement of organisms through their environment, which can decrease population connectivity. Reduction in connectivity influences gene flow and allele frequencies, and can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles, with potential negative effects for populations. Previous studies have detected effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and structure in terrestrial animals living in landscapes that vary in their degree of urbanization, even over very short distances. We investigated the effects of low-intensity urbanization on genetic diversity and genetic structure in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We captured 208 Song Sparrows at seven sites along a gradient of urbanization in and around Blacksburg, VA, USA, then genotyped them using a panel of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity was comparable among the seven study sites, and there was no evidence of genetic structuring among sites. These findings suggest that over a gradient of urbanization characterized by low density urban development, Song Sparrows likely exist in a single panmictic population.

TI  - Using Population Genetics to Examine White-Tailed Deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) Connectivity across Multiple Spatial Scales: Influences of Proximity, Landscape, and History
AU  - Gardner Almond, Lynne Carol
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Understanding the degree to which population connectivity is influenced by social structure, movement patterns, and management actions is important for development and evaluation of the impact of wildlife management strategies on wild game populations. I used population genetic tools to examine genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of an abundant, highly vagile habitat generalist game species, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). I used both microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to explore the roles of proximity, landscape, and population history on genetic connectivity of deer at local, statewide, and regional spatial scales. At local scales, I evaluated the effects of spatial proximity on levels of connectivity between urban and adjacent rural deer populations. I found high levels of genetic similarity, suggesting that localized management to control densities of urban deer populations may be complicated by recolonization due to movement of deer from rural into urban areas. I examined the effects of differences in population history and management on levels of connectivity to understand potential for disease spread between a captive and adjacent wild deer population. I found high levels genetic similarity that could be attributed to numerous mechanisms, and therefore could not make any definitive inferences regarding the captive facility as a source of infection for wild deer. At a statewide level, I evaluated the influence of landscape factors on deer spatial genetic structure across Iowa, and found weak genetic structure related to landscape factors, indicating that Iowa deer are part of a single continuous population across the state with few limitations on movement and potential for disease spread. At a range-wide scale, I found an impact of historical deer management on broad scale population connectivity of deer across their North American range. Specifically, translocation efforts led to higher levels of diversity and increased genetic similarity between geographically distant deer populations compared to naturally restored populations. My results suggest that, despite their high vagility and habitat generalist nature, social structure, landscape characteristics, and management history all impact genetic structure of white-tailed deer populations at multiple spatial scales.

AU  - Habrich, Andrew K

AU  - Fraser, Dylan J
T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Road networks and human density are major factors contributing to habitat fragmentation and loss, isolation of wildlife populations, and reduced genetic diversity. Terrestrial mammals are particularly sensitive to road networks and encroachment by human populations. However, there are limited assessments of the impacts of road networks and human density on population‐specific nuclear genetic diversity, and it remains unclear how these impacts are modulated by life‐history traits. Using generalized linear mixed models and microsatellite data from 1444 North American terrestrial mammal populations, we show that taxa with large home range sizes, dense populations, and large body sizes had reduced nuclear genetic diversity with increasing road impacts and human density, but the overall influence of life‐history traits was generally weak. Instead, we observed a high degree of genus‐specific variation in genetic responses to road impacts and human density. Human density negatively affected allelic diversity or heterozygosity more than road networks (13 vs. 5–7 of 25 assessed genera, respectively); increased road networks and human density also positively affected allelic diversity and heterozygosity in 15 and 6–9 genera, respectively. Large‐bodied, human‐averse species were generally more negatively impacted than small, urban‐adapted species. Genus‐specific responses to habitat fragmentation by ongoing road development and human encroachment likely depend on the specific capability to (i) navigate roads as either barriers or movement corridors, and (ii) exploit resource‐rich urban environments. The nonuniform genetic response to roads and human density highlights the need to implement efforts to mitigate the risk of vehicular collisions, while also facilitating gene flow between populations of particularly vulnerable taxa.

AB  - With the accelerated urbanization and frequent occurrence of climate extremes, the regional ecosystem service level has ushered in a great challenge, and the resilience of the ecological network has gradually weakened, leading to lower ecological benefits and production levels. As a core ecologically sensitive area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan metropolitan area has been expanding outward with rapid urbanization, crowding out surrounding arable and ecological land, and facing serious challenges to the sustainable development of the national space, while current cross-regional ecological protection measures need to be strengthened urgently, and exploring the structural resilience of its ecological network is of great significance to promote regional stability. In this study, Wuhan metropolitan area is taken as an example, and we explore the evolution and laws of ecological network structure from the perspective of network analysis by constructing ecological networks in Wuhan metropolitan area in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Firstly, we select regions from the ecological control line developed in China as ecological source sites, and also select multivariate data to supplement them. Then, the ecological network was established using the MCR model. Finally, network analysis was applied to discuss the evolution of network structure under multiple times and propose corresponding conservation strategies. The results show that (1) the major ecological resistance of Wuhan urban area has increased by 5.24% in 20 years. (2) The centrality and connectivity of the network nodes have increased over the 20-year period, and the overall structure of the network has stabilized and the resilience of the network has increased. (3) There is a strong link between changes in the network as a whole and local resilience. The results of the study will help analyze the relationship between the network as a whole and the region, and provide reference for optimizing the ecological network and constructing the systematic management of ecological security pattern.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Habitat Restoration on Shrubland Specialists: Case Study on the New England Cottontail and Shrubland Birds
AU  - Bauer, Melissa L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Loss and fragmentation of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States due to succession, suppression of natural disturbance regimes, and development (Cronon 1983, Litvaitis 1993) have resulted in declines of populations of shrubland specialist species, including the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and shrubland birds (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Schlossberg & King 2007). The New England cottontail’s range has declined by over 86% (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Fenderson et al. 2014, Brubaker et al. 2014) and remaining populations are small and exhibit fine-scale structure, limited dispersal, and loss of metapopulation function (Fenderson 2011, 2014, Cheeseman 2017, Chapter 1). In the Northeast, declining species of shrubland birds outnumber increasing species three to one (Schlossberg & King 2007). In response to these losses, active management is ongoing to maintain and create shrubland habitat on the landscape to restore populations of specialists dependent on this habitat type. Given the extensive investments and collaboration focused on restoring shrubland habitats in New England, research is needed to monitor the effects of habitat creation on populations of shrubland specialists. Understanding how shrubland specialists are responding to ongoing habitat creation will inform additional restoration strategies in an adaptive management context, an iterative process of incorporating new information into management practices and learning from previous management outcomes. Shrubland habitat creation and management in New England is largely focused on restoring habitat for the New England cottontail, with the idea that other species will also benefit. The New England cottontail is a highly threatened shrubland obligate requiring multiple patches of shrubland habitat within a short dispersal distance to support viable metapopulations long-term. Much of this management has been initiated by the New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative in response to the cottontail’s nine-year candidate listing status under the Endangered Species Act, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Keystone Initiative. Conservation efforts implemented for the New England cottontail have included the development of a range-wide inter-agency conservation strategy, designation of focal habitat restoration areas and habitat acreage and cottontail population recovery goals, engagement with private organizations and landowners to create shrubland habitat, implementation of a range-wide cottontail occupancy monitoring protocol, and public outreach and education (Fuller & Tur 2012). Habitat management underway incorporates techniques to set back forest succession, including harvesting trees, cutting and mowing to promote shrub regrowth, planting to improve old field habitat, and controlled burning on fire-maintained habitats like pitch pine-scrub oak. Landscape-level conservation design has been initiated to identify best parcels in terms of vegetation type and patch size that can be targeted for restoration (Tash & Litvaitis 2007, Fuller et al. 2011). Knowing how other species respond to widespread habitat management for cottontails is important to understand the full impacts and benefits of currently implemented management and to inform future management strategies. Given the resources invested in restoring shrubland habitat for cottontail populations, and the potential for other shrubland specialist species to benefit from this restoration, designating the New England cottontail a representative species could benefit strategic management for multiple species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Representative species designations are a tool for strategic management to provide the greatest benefit for the most species with available resources. Research is needed to identify which additional species would benefit most from restoration to create habitat for cottontails. I investigated shrubland specialist birds as a suite of species that could benefit from habitat management for cottontails, given declining population trends for shrubland birds and their high conservation need in the Northeast. In this thesis, I investigated the effects of habitat restoration on shrubland specialists in three case studies focused on New England cottontails and shrubland birds. In Chapter 1, I used genetic tools to assess the population structure, genetic diversity, effective population size, and census population size of an isolated New England cottontail population in an urban landscape in Londonderry, New Hampshire. I documented attributes of small populations that pose conservation challenges, including limited dispersal and loss of metapopulation function (Chandler et al. 2015), low genetic diversity, high relatedness (Brook et al. 2002, O’Grady et al. 2006), skewed sex ratios (Tella 2001, Clout et al. 2002), and stochastic decline on isolated patches (Stacey & Taper 1992). I used a resistance surface approach to highlight areas of potential connectivity in the landscape, including powerlines, a shrub wetland, and rail corridor. I parameterized a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that serves as a proof-of-concept for future work to compare the outcomes of alternate restoration scenarios on cottontail population size, genetic diversity, connectivity, and ability to persist in fragmented landscapes given best-case restoration scenarios.

AB  - AimMayr's central‐peripheral population model (CCPM) describes the marked differences between central and peripheral populations in genetic diversity, gene flow, and census size. When isolation leads to genetic divergence, these peripheral populations have high evolutionary value and can influence biogeographic patterns. In tropical marine species with pelagic larvae, powerful western‐boundary currents have great potential to shape the genetic characteristics of peripheral populations at latitudinal extremes. We tested for the genetic patterns expected by the CCPM in peripheral populations that are located within the Kuroshio Current for the Indo‐Pacific reef fish, Caesio cuning.MethodsWe used a panel of 2,677 SNPs generated from restriction site‐associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to investigate genetic diversity, relatedness, effective population size, and spatial patterns of population connectivity from central to peripheral populations of C. cuning along the Kuroshio Current.ResultsPrincipal component and cluster analyses indicated a genetically distinct lineage at the periphery of the C. cuning species range and examination of SNPs putatively under divergent selection suggested potential for local adaptation in this region. We found signatures of isolation‐by‐distance and significant genetic differences between nearly all sites. Sites closest to the periphery exhibited increased within‐population relatedness and decreased effective population size.Main ConclusionsDespite the potential for homogenizing gene flow along the Kuroshio Current, peripheral populations in C. cuning conform to the predictions of the CCPM. While oceanography, habitat availability, and dispersal ability are all likely to shape the patterns found in C. cuning across this central‐peripheral junction, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection in increasing smaller peripheral populations appear to be probable influences on the lineage divergence found in the Ryukyu Islands.

TI  - Comparative Population Genomics of Native (Sundamys Muelleri) and Invasive (Rattus Rattus) Rodents Along an Urbanization Gradient in Borneo
AU  - Herrera, Giselle Agatha
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization continues to be one of the most significant processes of global change modifying the environment rapidly and permanently. With increases in infrastructure and human settlement, natural areas become fragmented, and small populations in these patches become more vulnerable to genetic drift and are unable to disperse due to barriers to gene flow. Often these pervasive alterations to the environment result in the introduction of exotic species that can thrive in urban habitats with anthropogenically made available resources. Both native and nonnative wildlife that inhabit cities and nearby non-urban areas serve as ideal models to show how populations are evolving in response to developmental pressures. While native rodents in urban areas exhibit patterns of low genetic diversity and genetic connectivity, populations of invasive rodents reveal high connectivity and gene flow. Studying the evolutionary implications of this ecological change, particularly in understudied regions of rapid development like in biodiverse rich areas of Southeast Asia, will be vital to understand the variation of species responses to urbanization. In this study, I explored genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of populations of the native Müller's giant Sunda rat (Sundamys muelleri) and invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) across an urbanization gradient on the island on Borneo. Sundamys muelleri exhibited decreased genetic diversity in urban areas and was differentiated from rural and suburban locations. Populations of S. muelleri also displayed low genetic connectivity with urbanization posing a potential barrier to gene flow. Rattus rattus exhibited decreased genetic diversity in rural areas and a clinal genetic structure across the urbanization gradient. Populations of R. rattus also displayed high genetic connectivity, but development likely still prevents dispersal opportunities. This research provides useful information on how urbanization evolutionarily affects these two species of rodents (a native and invasive) and how development impacts population structure and connectivity. This information will provide useful for the conservation of endemic species in Borneo, to better understand the population genetics of these vector species and inform pest management across the urbanization gradient.

AB  - As human‐induced change eliminates natural habitats, it impacts genetic diversity and population connectivity for local biodiversity. The South African Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is the most diverse extratropical area for plant biodiversity, and much of its habitat is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site. There has long been great interest in explaining the underlying factors driving this unique diversity, especially as much of the CFR is endangered by urbanization and other anthropogenic activity. Here, we use a population and landscape genetic analysis of SNP data from the CFR endemic plant Leucadendron salignum or “common sunshine conebush” as a model to address the evolutionary and environmental factors shaping the vast CFR diversity. We found that high population structure, along with relatively deeper and older genealogies, is characteristic of the southwestern CFR, whereas low population structure and more recent lineage coalescence depict the eastern CFR. Population network analyses show genetic connectivity is facilitated in areas of lower elevation and higher seasonal precipitation. These population genetic signatures corroborate CFR species‐level patterns consistent with high Pleistocene biome stability and landscape heterogeneity in the southwest, but with coincident instability in the east. Finally, we also find evidence of human land‐usage as a significant gene flow barrier, especially in severely threatened lowlands where genetic connectivity has been historically the highest. These results help identify areas where conservation plans can prioritize protecting high genetic diversity threatened by contemporary human activities within this unique cultural UNESCO site.

TI  - Environmental granularity, rivers and climate history as shaping factors for species' distribution and diversity patterns
AU  - Nakazawa Ueji, Yoshinori Jorge
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Several mechanisms are involved in shaping species' distributions, such as abiotic parameters of climate and substrate; biotic interactions with competitors, predators, and mutualists; and geographic considerations that constrain dispersal. Janzen, in 1967, proposed that mountain passes are effectively higher in the Tropics than in temperate areas in terms of their effectiveness in limiting dispersal, creating greater opportunity for isolation of populations, and differentiation into new species. Here, I analyze quantitatively predictions derived from Janzen's theory via 1000 virtual species across South America covering all major environments on the continent, taking into account effects of environmental contiguity and connectivity, effects of seasonality, and presence of known biogeographic barriers (rivers, principally). Virtual species' distributions were obtained by calculating Euclidean distances in ecological space to 1000 seed points, and applying different thresholds of ecological similarity within which the species is allowed to disperse into adjacent pixels. Distributional areas were measured taking into account only mean environmental similarity across the year, and considering the effects of seasonality and known geographic barriers. The results illuminate the situation: distributional areas are smaller in temperate areas when only mean similarity is considered (contra Janzen), but the pattern reverses when seasonality and barriers are considered, confirming and clarifying Janzen's ideas regarding generation of greater biological diversity in tropical areas as compared with temperate areas. Keywords: landscape subdivision, species' distributions, biogeography, virtual species

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major extinction driver. Despite dramatically increasing fragmentation across the globe, its specific impacts on population connectivity across species with differing life histories remain difficult to characterize, let alone quantify. Here, we investigate patterns of population connectivity in six songbird species from Singapore, a highly fragmented tropical rainforest island. Using massive panels of genome‐wide single nucleotide polymorphisms across dozens of samples per species, we examined population genetic diversity, inbreeding, gene flow and connectivity among species along a spectrum of ecological specificities. We found a higher resilience to habitat fragmentation in edge‐tolerant and forest‐canopy species as compared to forest‐dependent understorey insectivores. The latter exhibited levels of genetic diversity up to three times lower in Singapore than in populations from contiguous forest elsewhere. Using dense genomic and geographic sampling, we identified individual barriers such as reservoirs that effectively minimize gene flow in sensitive understorey birds, revealing that terrestrial forest species may exhibit levels of sensitivity to fragmentation far greater than previously expected. This study provides a blueprint for conservation genomics at small scales with a view to identifying preferred locations for habitat corridors, flagging candidate populations for restocking with translocated individuals and improving the design of future reserves.

AB  - Maintaining ecological balance relies on biodiversity, and habitat network construction plays an imperative role in preserving biodiversity in regional areas. Nevertheless, there is a problem with the current habitat network construction, which focuses exclusively on ecological benefits without taking other benefits into account as well. In this paper, six species of birds with varying habitat types and varying adaptabilities to city life are selected as target species to build a habitat network based on the InVEST model, Circuit Theory, and Linkage Mapper, focusing on nuclei, patches, corridors, and islands for the harmonious coexistence of human-green space-birds in the most densely populated area of Nanjing, and to refine landscape design techniques for habitat creation. Below is a summary of the main results. Firstly, there is a direct relationship between species distribution and migration capabilities and the urbanization adaptation capabilities of species. Meanwhile, habitat quality has a significant impact on bird species distribution. Furthermore, the habitat network in Nanjing’s main urban area has a distributed and partially degraded core area, a single connectivity structure with poor functionality, and significant fragmentation of habitat patches. Finally, as a result of the above results, two perspectives of ecological landscape planning and design are proposed to optimize the relevant green space landscape in Nanjing’s central urban areas based on biodiversity and satisfying the tripartite symbiosis of humans, green space, and birds in the city. By planning and implementing habitat networks, it is possible to enhance the habitat quality of urban green spaces to a certain extent and provide new ideas for the overall planning of urban–natural systems.

TI  - Critical Effects of Urbanization on a Charismatic Carnivore: Genetic Change, Disease and Toxicant Exposure, and Disease Susceptibility in Bobcat Populations in an Urban, Fragmented Landscape
AU  - Serieys, Laurel Elizabeth Klein
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization has profound ecological impacts that reach beyond city boundaries. Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity. To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote (Canis latrans) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by > 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline.Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape.I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.

AB  - The updating and rethinking of vegetation classifications is important for ecosystem monitoring in a rapidly changing world, where the distribution of vegetation is changing. The general assumption that discrete and persistent plant communities exist that can be monitored efficiently, is rarely tested before undertaking a classification. Marion Island (MI) is comprised of species-poor vegetation undergoing rapid environmental change. It presents a unique opportunity to test the ability to discretely classify species-poor vegetation with recently developed objective classification techniques and relate it to previous classifications. We classified vascular species data of 476 plots sampled across MI, using Ward hierarchical clustering, divisive analysis clustering, non-hierarchical kmeans and partitioning around medoids. Internal cluster validation was performed using silhouette widths, Dunn index, connectivity of clusters and gap statistic. Indicator species analyses were also conducted on the best performing clustering methods. We evaluated the outputs against previously classified units. Ward clustering performed the best, with the highest average silhouette width and Dunn index, as well as the lowest connectivity. The number of clusters differed amongst the clustering methods, but most validation measures, including for Ward clustering, indicated that two and three clusters are the best fit for the data. However, all classification methods produced weakly separated, highly connected clusters with low compactness and low fidelity and specificity to clusters. There was no particularly robust and effective classification outcome that could group plots into previously suggested vegetation units based on species composition alone. The relatively recent age (c. 450,000 years B.P.), glaciation history (last glacial maximum 34,500 years B.P.) and isolation of the sub-Antarctic islands may have hindered the development of strong vascular plant species assemblages with discrete boundaries. Discrete classification at the community-level using species composition may not be suitable in such species-poor environments. Species-level, rather than community-level, monitoring may thus be more appropriate in species-poor environments, aligning with continuum theory rather than community theory.

TI  - The Relationship Between Species Diversity and Genetic Diversity in a Fragmented Forest System: A Case Study of Carex leptonervia in the Montérégie, Québec
AU  - Polcz, Catherine
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The fragmentation of native temperate forests is a defining issue of rural and urban development in southern Québec. From a forest plant perspective, as natural forest habitat is reduced and subdivided into smaller, more isolated patches, environmental conditions are altered, population size is decreased, and species dispersal may be interrupted. Thus, fragmentation may cause reduced species and genetic diversity in plant systems. Traditionally, ecological and population genetic studies have assessed the impacts of fragmentation on the two measures of diversity separately. In this thesis, we consider both fundamental aspects of biodiversity in a fragmented system. We chose to compare the genetic diversity (GD) of Carex letponervia with species diversity (SD) at two levels: study site and community level. Study site SD measurements approximate the diversity of all plant species growing in a forest, and community SD measurements describe the diversity of plant species growing with C. leptonervia. In chapter 2 of this thesis we describe the development of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers we developed for C. leptonervia. In chapter 3 we describe our overall goal of relating landscape structure, genetic diversity, and species diversity. We hypothesize that site area, connectivity, and environment will similarly impact SD of C. leptonervia communities and GD of C. leptonervia and that SD and GD are positively correlated.To address this, we assessed overall plant species richness in 20 forest patches ranging from six to over 2000 hectares. Within each forest, we also measured species diversity of the plant community associated with C. leptonervia by centering seven 4 m² quadrats on focal C. leptonervia plants. Thirty individuals of C. leptonervia, including one from each of the focal quadrats, were sampled at each site to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was characterized using six of the SSR loci that we developed in chapter 2. We found that species richness (SR) at the forest patch level shows a strong positive trend with patch area, but not with connectivity among patches. We found that at the point-community level, high SR related to high values of SR at the overall site and that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to community extent. We found no evidence that soil characteristics (pH and percent organic matter) impact values of point-community diversity. To assess patterns in genetic diversity, we ran tests of isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST, and a Bayesian clustering analysis. These results all show that C. leptonervia has low population structure and that there is gene flow throughout the Montérégie. To test for a species diversity-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC), we conducted Pearson correlation tests between all GD measures and SD measures (site and point-communities). We found that gene diversity exhibited a positive significant correlation to species richness at the site level but was not significantly correlated to the diversity of C. leptonervia point-communities. These results indicate that processes important at the level of site are also important in maintaining GD. We conclude that for an ecologically flexible and well-dispersed species, it is likely that the point-community diversity as estimated by quadrat sampling underestimates the actual diversity of species co-existing with C. leptonervia, and that the diversity of site may provide a more accurate approximation. We conclude that the parallel process driving the correlation is likely study site area. Surprisingly, we found that landscape connectivity was not an important determinant of SD or GD. In conclusion, we propose that linking population genetics and community ecology can further an understanding of natural systems and also that isolated forests are important in maintaining diversity in the Montérégie.

T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Natural landscape heterogeneity and barriers resulting from urbanization can reduce genetic connectivity between populations. The evolutionary, demographic, and ecological effects of reduced connectivity may lead to population isolation and ultimately extinction. Alteration to the terrestrial and aquatic environment caused by urban influence can affect gene flow, specifically for stream salamanders who depend on both landscapes for survival and reproduction. To examine how urbanization affects a relatively common stream salamander species, we compared genetic connectivity of Eurycea bislineata (northern two‐lined salamander) populations within and between streams in an urban, suburban, and rural habitat around the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. We report reduced genetic connectivity between streams within the urban landscape found to correspond with potential barriers to gene flow, that is, areas with more dense urbanization (roadways, industrial buildings, and residential housing). The suburban populations also exhibited areas of reduced connectivity correlated with areas of greater human land use and greater connectivity within a preserve protected from development. Connectivity was relatively high among neighboring rural streams, but a major roadway corresponded with genetic breaks even though the habitat contained more connected green space overall. Despite greater human disturbance across the landscape, urban and suburban salamander populations maintained comparable levels of genetic diversity to their rural counterparts. Yet small effective population size in the urban habitats yielded a high probability of loss of heterozygosity due to genetic drift in the future. In conclusion, urbanization impacted connectivity among stream salamander populations where its continual influence may eventually hinder population persistence for this native species in urban habitats.

AB  - Conversion and fragmentation of wildlife habitat often leads to smaller and isolated populations and can reduce a species’ ability to disperse across the landscape. As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (≤ 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a function of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation. Improving genetic diversity and connectivity among T. s. tetrataenia populations could promote persistence of this endangered snake.

T2  - New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science
AB  - BackgroundUrban forests are under increased pressure from invasion by exotic (alien) species. The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts.MethodsFifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m2 plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales.ResultsCanopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests.ConclusionsCanopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs.

AB  - The biogeographical relationships between far-separated populations, in particular, those in the mainland and islands, remain unclear for widespread species in eastern Asia where the current distribution of plants was greatly influenced by the Quaternary climate. Deciduous Oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) is one of the most widely distributed species in eastern Asia. In this study, leaf material of 528 Q. variabilis trees from 50 populations across the whole distribution (Mainland China, Korea Peninsular as well as Japan, Zhoushan and Taiwan Islands) was collected, and three cpDNA intergenic spacer fragments were sequenced using universal primers. A total of 26 haplotypes were detected, and it showed a weak phylogeographical structure in eastern Asia populations at species level, however, in the central-eastern region of Mainland China, the populations had more haplotypes than those in other regions, with a significant phylogeographical structure (NST = 0.751> GST = 0.690, P<0.05). Q. variabilis displayed high interpopulation and low intrapopulation genetic diversity across the distribution range. Both unimodal mismatch distribution and significant negative Fu’s FS indicated a demographic expansion of Q. variabilis populations in East Asia. A fossil calibrated phylogenetic tree showed a rapid speciation during Pleistocene, with a population augment occurred in Middle Pleistocene. Both diversity patterns and ecological niche modelling indicated there could be multiple glacial refugia and possible bottleneck or founder effects occurred in the southern Japan. We dated major spatial expansion of Q. variabilis population in eastern Asia to the last glacial cycle(s), a period with sea-level fluctuations and land bridges in East China Sea as possible dispersal corridors. This study showed that geographical heterogeneity combined with climate and sea-level changes have shaped the genetic structure of this wide-ranging tree species in East Asia.

AB  - Both intrinsic and extrinsic forces work together to shape connectivity and genetic variation in populations across the landscape. Here we explored how geography, breeding system traits, and environmental factors influence the population genetic patterns of Triodanis perfoliata, a widespread mix-mating annual plant in the contiguous US. By integrating population genomic data with spatial analyses and modeling the relationship between a breeding system and genetic diversity, we illustrate the complex ways in which these forces shape genetic variation. Specifically, we used 4705 single nucleotide polymorphisms to assess genetic diversity, structure, and evolutionary history among 18 populations. Populations with more obligately selfing flowers harbored less genetic diversity (π: R2 = .63, p = .01, n = 9 populations), and we found significant population structuring (FST = 0.48). Both geographic isolation and environmental factors played significant roles in predicting the observed genetic diversity: we found that corridors of suitable environments appear to facilitate gene flow between populations, and that environmental resistance is correlated with increased genetic distance between populations. Last, we integrated our genetic results with species distribution modeling to assess likely patterns of connectivity among our study populations. Our landscape and evolutionary genetic results suggest that T. perfoliata experienced a complex demographic and evolutionary history, particularly in the center of its distribution. As such, there is no singular mechanism driving this species' evolution. Together, our analyses support the hypothesis that the breeding system, geography, and environmental variables shape the patterns of diversity and connectivity of T. perfoliata in the US.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of how urbanization influences the evolution of native species is vital for urban wildlife ecology and conservation in the Anthropocene. With thousands of years of agriculture‐dominated historical urbanization followed by 40 years of intensive and rapid urbanization, Shanghai provides an ideal environment to study how the two‐stage urbanization process influences the evolution of indigenous wildlife, especially of anuran species. Therefore, in this study, we used mitochondrial Cyt‐b gene, microsatellite (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to evaluate the demographic history and genetic structure of the eastern golden frog (Pelophylax plancyi), by sampling 407 individuals from 15 local populations across Shanghai, China. All local populations experienced bottlenecks during historical urbanization, while the local populations in urban areas maintained comparable contemporary effective population sizes (Ne) and genetic diversity with suburban and rural populations. Nevertheless, the rapid modern urbanization has already imposed significant negative effects to the integrity of populations. The 15 local populations were differentiated into eight genetic clusters, showing a spatial distribution pattern consistent with the current urbanization gradient and island–mainland geography. Although moderate gene flow still occurred from the rural peripheral cluster to urban and suburban clusters, population fragmentation was more serious in the urban and suburban populations, where higher urbanization levels within 2‐km radius areas showed significant negative relationships to the Ne and genetic diversity of local populations. Therefore, to protect urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability, improving conditions in fragmented habitat remnants might be most essential for local populations living in more urbanized areas. Meanwhile, we highlight the need to preserve large unfragmented rural habitats and to construct corridor networks to connect discrete urban habitat remnants for the long‐term wildlife conservation in intensively urbanizing environments.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Metapopulation‐structured species can be negatively affected when landscape fragmentation impairs connectivity. We investigated the effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and gene flow for two sympatric amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), across a large (>35,000 km2) landscape in Maine, USA, containing numerous natural and anthropogenic gradients. Isolation‐by‐distance (IBD) patterns differed between the species. Spotted salamanders showed a linear and relatively high variance relationship between genetic and geographic distances (r = .057, p < .001), whereas wood frogs exhibited a strongly nonlinear and lower variance relationship (r = 0.429, p < .001). Scale dependence analysis of IBD found gene flow has its most predictable influence (strongest IBD correlations) at distances up to 9 km for spotted salamanders and up to 6 km for wood frogs. Estimated effective migration surfaces revealed contrasting patterns of high and low genetic diversity and gene flow between the two species. Population isolation, quantified as the mean IBD residuals for each population, was associated with local urbanization and less genetic diversity in both species. The influence of geographic proximity and urbanization on population connectivity was further supported by distance‐based redundancy analysis and multiple matrix regression with randomization. Resistance surface modeling found interpopulation connectivity to be influenced by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs. Our results highlight the influence of anthropogenic landscape features within the context of natural features and broad spatial genetic patterns, in turn supporting the premise that while urbanization significantly restricts interpopulation connectivity for wood frogs and spotted salamanders, specific landscape elements have unique effects on these two sympatric species.

AB  - As human‐induced change eliminates natural habitats, it impacts genetic diversity and population connectivity for local biodiversity. The South African Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is the most diverse extratropical area for plant biodiversity, and much of its habitat is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site. There has long been great interest in explaining the underlying factors driving this unique diversity, especially as much of the CFR is endangered by urbanization and other anthropogenic activity. Here, we use a population and landscape genetic analysis of SNP data from the CFR endemic plant Leucadendron salignum or “common sunshine conebush” as a model to address the evolutionary and environmental factors shaping the vast CFR diversity. We found that high population structure, along with relatively deeper and older genealogies, is characteristic of the southwestern CFR, whereas low population structure and more recent lineage coalescence depict the eastern CFR. Population network analyses show genetic connectivity is facilitated in areas of lower elevation and higher seasonal precipitation. These population genetic signatures corroborate CFR species‐level patterns consistent with high Pleistocene biome stability and landscape heterogeneity in the southwest, but with coincident instability in the east. Finally, we also find evidence of human land‐usage as a significant gene flow barrier, especially in severely threatened lowlands where genetic connectivity has been historically the highest. These results help identify areas where conservation plans can prioritize protecting high genetic diversity threatened by contemporary human activities within this unique cultural UNESCO site.

TI  - A Modeling Approach to Wildlife Corridor Creation: An Assessment Using ArcGIS and the San Joaquin Kit Fox in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA Project
AU  - McElwee, Lauren Rachelle
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study is a presentation of a corridor methodology and a proposed wildlife corridor between the Carrizo Plain and Camp Roberts in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA, using the federally and state listed San Joaquin Kit Fox as an umbrella species for corridor delineation. Since the Kit Fox has such a wide range, it is thought that many other federally and state listed species will be protected. Historic evidence has shown Kit Fox migration between these two core habitat areas. To keep the areas from becoming isolated patches of habitat, which inhibits genetic diversity and ultimately species survival, a corridor was proposed. ArcGIS was utilized to assess the viability and location of a potential wildlife corridor. Functions such as weighted overlays and neighborhoods were used to score and therefore indicate the best habitat area, the location of the corridor, highest development pressure areas, and priority sites for conservation. Further, a discussion on conservation tools is included to set up a “toolbox" for protecting the corridor.Using the two ArcGIS algebraic functions, a corridor location in the eastern portion of the County was identified, which splits in two and reconstitutes in the northern part of the county. Upon corridor identification, development pressure was analyzed by the use of a weighted overlay and revealed high development pressure along the route 46 highway, which bisects the proposed wildlife corridor. Priority areas were determined by overlaying habitat values with development pressure values to determine the best habitat areas under the greatest development pressure. Those areas within the identified corridor under the highest development pressure were considered high priority sites. Conclusions were that antiquated subdivisions located directly in the path of the corridor need further study to determine their ultimate effect on the corridor; 46 highway is a high development area and those areas of the corridor which are crossed by 46 are in need of immediate attention for conservation; ground-truthing needs to be done to verify findings; and that a combination of conservation tools will be needed to effectively protect the wildlife corridor identified.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits in response to heterogeneous environments has been observed in a number of fishes. Conversely, genetic structure has recently been detected in even the most wide ranging pelagic teleost fish and shark species with massive dispersal potential, putting into question previous expectations of panmixia. Shallow oceanic seamounts are known aggregation sites for pelagic species, but their role in genetic structuring of widely distributed species remains poorly understood. The yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a commercially valuable, circumglobal, epipelagic fish species occurs in two genetically distinct Southern Hemisphere populations (South Pacific and southern Africa) with low levels of gene-flow between the regions. Two shallow oceanic seamounts exist in the ocean basins around southern Africa; Vema and Walters Shoal in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, respectively. We analysed rare samples from these remote locations and from the South African continental shelf to assess genetic structure and population connectivity in S. lalandi and investigated life-history traits by comparing diet, age, growth and maturation among the three sites. The results suggest that yellowtail from South Africa and the two seamounts are genetically and phenotypically distinct. Rather than mere feeding oases, we postulate that these seamounts represent islands of breeding populations with site-specific adaptations.

TI  - The impact of riparian habitat quality on the activity of british bats in lowland river systems, and its relevance to conservation management
AU  - Scott, Sarah Jane
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Rivers and their associated floodplains are natural wildlife corridors used by a wide range of animal species. Most British rivers in both rural and urban areas have been significantly affected as a result of drainage, flood defence structures, urban development and direct habitat loss. This has, in some cases, fragmented the river corridor and affected the structure and function of the riparian zone. As landscape-scale conservation schemes aim to restore the ecology of rivers, I consider what affect the quality of the riparian zone (an area where the river channel, bank and flood plain interact) has on the foraging and activity of important riparian users, British bats, and assess their relevance as bioindicators of ecosystem health. A matched pairs design was used to test the effect of 'undisturbed' (high quality) and 'disturbed' (lower quality) riparian zones based on riparian width, habitat complexity, connectivity, and surrounding land use, on bat activity. In general, wider and more complex riparian zones did not show sign ificantly more bat activity overall, though exhibited significantly greater foraging activity expressed by the number of feeding buzzes recorded. However, species-specific responses showed that Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis spp. (probably mainly Myotis daubentonil) were influenced by the quality of the riparian zone more so than known habitat generalists, such as P. pipistrellus. Small differences in the complexity and width of the riparian zone positively affected the foraging and activity of P. pygmaeus, whereas the presence of wider stands of wet woodland positively affected the foraging and activity of Myotis spp. Broader landscape features and the availability of insect prey also affected the activity of two sympatric species, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. Both species were positively associated with the presence of urban habitat within a 2 km radius of survey sites and aquatic invertebrates, and showed niche differences related to known dietary preferences. The association with invertebrate abundance may make Pipistrellus bats potential bioindicators of riverine health. Pipistrellus bats select riverine habitats that are associated with urban areas, which may indicate a dependency on rivers in urbanised areas. The composition of the riparian zone and floodplain habitat affects the foraging and activity of riparian specialist British bats and should be considered when designing landscape-scale conservation schemes that include British rivers.

TI  - The ecological factors governing the persistence of butterflies in urban areas.
AU  - Loram, A.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that availability of high quality habitat rather than habitat connectivity or species mobility was the limiting factor in the distribution of grassland butterflies, but were mostly undertaken on specialist species in rural areas.  Consequently, this project tests the hypothesis that the quality of available habitat is more important that patch size or connectivity to the persistence of four grassland butterfly species in the West Midlands conurbation.  Two of the study species are widespread (Polyommatus icarus and Coenonympha pamphilus) whilst two have a more restricted distribution (Erynnis tages and Callophrys rubi).  However, unlike species with very specific requirements, all are polyphagous and can tolerate a wide range of conditions, making habitat quality different to quantify.  Several means of assessing habitat quality were developed and tested.  A detailed vegetation quadrant sampling method had the best predictive abilities for patch occupancy and summarised the habitat preferences within the urban context.  A model based upon habitat quality and connectivity was devised, with the ability to rank each patch according to potential suitability for each species.  For all four species, habitat quality accounted significantly for the greatest variance in distribution.  Connectivity had only a small effect whilst patch area had almost none.  This suggests that conservation efforts should be centred upon preserving and improving habitat quality.

T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Human‐mediated transport of species outside their natural range is a rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, particularly for island ecosystems that have evolved in isolation. The genetic structure underpinning island populations will largely determine their response to increased transport and thus help to inform biosecurity management. However, this information is severely lacking for some groups, such as the soil fauna. We therefore analysed the phylogeographic structure of an indigenous and an invasive springtail species (Collembola: Poduromorpha), each distributed across multiple remote sub‐Antarctic islands, where human activity is currently intensifying. For both species, we generated a genome‐wide SNP data set and additionally analysed all available COI barcodes. Genetic differentiation in the indigenous springtail Tullbergia bisetosa is substantial among (and, to a lesser degree, within) islands, reflecting low dispersal and historic population fragmentation, while COI patterns reveal ancestral signatures of postglacial recolonization. This pronounced geographic structure demonstrates the key role of allopatric divergence in shaping the region's diversity and highlights the vulnerability of indigenous populations to genetic homogenization via human transport. For the invasive species Hypogastrura viatica, nuclear genetic structure is much less apparent, particularly for islands linked by regular shipping, while diverged COI haplotypes indicate multiple independent introductions to each island. Thus, human transport has likely facilitated this species’ persistence since its initial colonization, through the ongoing introduction and inter‐island spread of genetic variation. These findings highlight the different evolutionary consequences of human transport for indigenous and invasive soil species. Crucially, both outcomes demonstrate the need for improved intraregional biosecurity among remote island systems, where the policy focus to date has been on external introductions.

AU  - Benedetti, Yanina

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Road and railway networks are pervasive elements of all environments, which have expanded intensively over the last century in all European countries. These transportation infrastructures have major impacts on the surrounding landscape, representing a threat to biodiversity. Roadsides and railways may function as corridors for dispersal of alien species in fragmented landscapes. However, only few studies have explored the spread of invasive species in relationship to transport network at large spatial scales. We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures.

TI  - The Effects of Urbanization on Riparian Forest Plant Communities in the Research Triangle Area of North Carolina
AU  - Lopez, Bianca E.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ongoing urban development is having profound impacts on ecosystems worldwide, by reducing the amount and connectivity of natural habitat and changing the local environmental conditions. Despite the ubiquity and the continued growth of urban areas, the effects of urban development on the diversity and composition of plant communities remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I address this issue by investigating the effects of urban development on patches of remnant riparian forest in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. To do this, I used a rural-to-urban gradient approach, comparing the plant species and environmental conditions of sites surrounded by different amounts of urban development. I first explored the effects of different “filters” created by urban development on plant biodiversity using structural equation modeling. In this, I tested the predictions of an established conceptual framework and developed a general model that could be used to compare the effects of urbanization on plant biodiversity across cities. I then examined changes in plant species’ functional traits along the rural-to-urban gradient and compared the species and traits found at these sites to high-quality riparian plant communities that represent potential targets for restoration. I found that plant traits change somewhat predictably along an urbanization gradient, particularly with regard to species’ seed dispersal modes, but that traits may not be as useful for predicting which species will establish in urban restoration efforts. Finally, I assessed the ability of environmental variables and spatial variables describing habitat connectivity to explain variation in plant species composition across sites. I found that species with limited dispersal ability showed the strongest signal of dispersal limitation across sites, and that urban development between sites appears to reduce connectivity for these species. This dissertation provides insight into the ways that urban development is altering riparian forests in the Research Triangle, which may have important impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. My results have implications for land management, restoration, and urban planning in this landscape.

However, whether some proposed indicators can explain biodiversity well at the local scale is still unclear. This study attempted to test whether the habitat quality index (HQI) as measured using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model could explain variations in bird diversity in New Jiangwan Town, a rapidly urbanized region of Shanghai, China. The relationships from 2002 to 2013 among HQI and the two diversity indices, species richness and species abundance, were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test and gray correlation analysis. No significant association was found. Habitat connectivity was then integrated to develop a new combined indicator of habitat quality and connectivity index (HQCI). The associations between HQCI and the two diversity indices were improved significantly. The results indicated that connectivity may be an important factor explaining the diversity of certain species at a local scale. More empirical studies should be conducted to provide scientific evidence relating habitat quality to biodiversity.

TI  - Ecological network planning method and case study : a case study in chongming island, china
AU  - Guo, Ji Guang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAlong with the process of urbanization, the development of natural and the reconstruction strengthen the changes in the city pattern. Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity & extinction on a global scale. The main reason is it may cause the reduction of the number of species and mortality and reduce species possibility of reproduction in other habitat. As a result of fragmentation, landscape plaques become smaller and smaller, more isolated and boundary, more or less is surrounded by unfavorable matrix. Through the ecological corridor to connect the habitat island, especially larger habitat, can reduce even eliminate the landscape fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. So constructing ecological networks and connecting the patches of spatial distribution is the effective way to protect wildlife. Existing ecology network planning methods more attention of nodes, connection and plants, these methods in solving problems in a single problem are very useful. However, these methods are less likely to find a regional scale of ecological network planning method. In this paper, integrated the research advanced experience both at home and abroad to put forward a comprehensive ecological network planning method. The major steps for ecological networks construction discussed in this paper are: (1) habitat resources assessment; (2) wildlife assessment; (3) Node chooses; (4) network analysis; (5) cost analysis; (6) least-cost analysis. The construction of ecological networks is discussed in this paper mainly adopts the method of gravity model, the resistance model and least cost model.(1) In the gravity model by the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of each node degree solved the problems of the importance of the corridor and which nodes are connected. (2) In the resistance model through analysis of the actual path through the landscape in each land use to determine each landuse's resistance value, resolve the problem of the relative resistance it is difficulted to determine. (3) At the least cost model the first two model analysis results is used to find a minimum cost between the nodes, resolve the spatial location of the corridor it is difficult to determine and reduce the problem of building cost. The advantages of this method is (1) gives the quantitative method of selecting the node; (2) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the corridor;(3) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the network connectivity; (4) gives the quantitative method of Corridor construction; (5) maximize the use of existing green space, wetlands resources,which can lower construction costs. Based on this method, this paper chooses Chongming Island as the case study. Chongming Island located in the northeast of Shanghai, water clean and flat and with a good ecological environment. The eastern part of the beach is the red-crowned cranes, swans and other rare habitats of migratory birds. Chongming Island, the geographical environment is very suitable for plant growth, but also there have been many large wild animals, however, since the last half century, as population growth, urban construction, and gradually changed the structure of natural ecosystems, landscape fragmentation serious. The main habitat types in Chongming Island including urban, agricultural land, plantation land, wetlands. Large-scale green patch mainly located in the eastern, western and Dongping National Forest Park. These habitats uneven distributed, separated by matrix between the green patch. The lack of contact is not conducive to the proliferation and the protection of animals. Therefore, this paper chooses two kinds of resource: Woodland and wetland, to construct ecological network system with different form corridor. The research result indicates that this method is effective. For the ecological and strategic resources can be fully utilize, more than 50% of the green corridor in the planning is existing resources, construction cost is low feasible, the cost of the construction is low and feasible. The innovation of this article is:(1) extract the advantages of Gravity model, Resistance model, Least cost model and uantify the ecological networks construction Methods;(2)With GIS, given the spatial location of corridor; (3)Maximize use of existing green space, wetland resources, to reduce the cost of building. The inadequacies of this paper is the only goal is to protect the animals. The future combination of cultural, aesthetic, human demand for open space to study the network

TI  - Loggerhead Shrike Detectability and Occurrence in Coastal South Carolina Urban Areas
AU  - Krauser, Michelle
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Grassland birds, such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), are threatened by extensive land-use change, including urbanization. Loggerhead shrikes have been declining since the early 1900s and are rare or extirpated in portions of their former range. Obtaining reliable population estimates of loggerhead shrikes is important to identify demographic trends and ensure conservation decisions are based on an accurate assessment of their current status. Imperfect detection, or the inability to detect every shrike during a survey, can result in biased population estimates. Estimating detection probability is labor-intensive and requires assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in most field studies. Understanding a species' detectability before beginning research is thus ideal.	In chapter one, I calculated the detection rates of long-term resident loggerhead shrikes along a highway corridor dominated by commercial and industrial development in Horry County, South Carolina. Using a generalized linear mixed model, I evaluated factors that could affect detection probability. All 47 shrikes included in the study were color-banded and monitored about twice per month year-round, from January 2019 through December 2021, allowing observers to determine occupancy and sex and track the status of each bird. Collectively, observers conducted 2,208 qualifying surveys on occupied territories. The best-fitting models showed that all predictor variables, including observer identity, season, sex, year, and the interaction between sex and season, affected detectability. The average detection rates for males and females had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, as did the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Loggerhead shrikes had an average detection rate of 0.58 (range = 0.28–0.75, SD = 0.10) and were detectable year-round, with an average detection rate of 0.67 (SD = 0.17) during the breeding season, 0.56 (SD = 0.17) during winter, and 0.51 (SD = 0.16) during the molting season. The breeding season was the only season where the 95% confidence intervals for male and female detection rates did not overlap, with males having a detection rate of 0.70 (SD = 0.17) and females 0.60 (SD = 0.19). Females likely had a lower detection rate during the breeding season because they were unavailable for detection while incubating. Observers had detection rates ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (SD = 0.08), suggesting variation among observers could affect population estimates. The results of chapter one can be used to improve the accuracy of population estimates by providing correction factors to account for the imperfect detection of urban shrikes. The correction factors can be used to identify the appropriate number of repeat surveys, increasing the efficiency of survey protocols and decreasing the costs of demographic studies. In chapter two, I identified habitat characteristics associated with loggerhead shrike occurrence along urban gradients in Charleston, Florence, Georgetown, and Horry counties, South Carolina. I surveyed 300 2.25-ha sites with impervious surface levels ranging from 3.2 to 96.3%. Using a generalized linear model, I assessed how impervious surface (%), highway density (m/ha), other road density (m/ha), total road density (m/ha), canopy cover (%), and powerline density (m/ha) are related to loggerhead shrike occurrence. Because loggerhead shrikes have been documented responding to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales, I measured predictor variables at the 2.25-ha, 20.25-ha, and 1-km scales.

AB  - Due to the recent increase in demand for agave-based beverages, many wild agave populations have experienced rapid decline and fragmentation, whereas cultivated plants are now managed at monocultural plantations, in some cases involving clonal propagation. We examined the relative effect of migration, genetic drift, natural selection and human activities on the genetic repertoire of Agave angustifolia var. pacifica, an agave used for bacanora (an alcoholic spirit similar to tequila) production in northwestern Mexico. We sampled 34 wild and cultivated sites and used over eleven thousand genome-wide SNPs. We found shallow genetic structure among wild samples, although we detected differentiation between coastal and inland sites. Surprisingly, no differentiation was found between cultivated and wild populations. Moreover, we detected moderate inbreeding (FIS ~ 0.13) and similar levels of genomic diversity in wild and cultivated agaves. Nevertheless, the cultivated plants had almost no private alleles and presented evidence of clonality. The overall low genetic structure in A. angustifolia var. pacifica is apparently the result of high dispersibility promoted by pollinators and the possibility of clonal reproduction. Incipient cultivation history and reliance on wild seeds and plants are probably responsible for the observed patterns of high genetic connectivity and considerable diversity in cultivated samples.

AB  - The main factor of damage to biodiversity is fragmentation of territory, due to various economic activities of man. One of these activities in the area is the construction of road infrastructures. However, their construction as well as in urban areas in those extra-urban, has led to significantly increase the impact of vehicle traffic on wild fauna and especially that of small vertebrate, with this apparent extra-urban areas, in agricultural and rural spaces. The impact becomes even greater in the absence of ecological networks, which will provide greater return flow antigenic sites on time animal populations, thus significantly limiting their dynamics. The possibility of intra and inter-specific exchange between animal populations can be achieved through ecological corridors, which remain single strategy for solving animal populations in terms of environmental fragmentation in particular from road infrastructures. The impact becomes even bigger in animal populations in case of presence of leaks forest ecosystems near roads, in eco-tonal generations. Expansion and improvement of the road network in Albania has grown significantly in the extent of the impact on small vertebrate fauna as in urban and extraurban areas. The study was conducted at three different points in the road network in urban area and outside urban areas. The results of the study evidenced a high level of impact on animal fauna and the evident lack of ecological infrastructure that would facilitate the movement of animals, especially on their reproductive periods.

TI  - Forest Structure Shapes Tropical Terrestrial and Arboreal Mesomammal Communities Under Moderate Disturbance
AU  - Masseloux, Juliana
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Tropical biodiversity is threatened globally by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly forest degradation and overhunting. Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller-bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed-dispersers). However, mesomammals are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals are especially vulnerable to forest conversion, particularly when reliant on old growth forest structures. Understanding species- and community-level responses of terrestrial and arboreal mesomammals to changes in forest structure and human activity is crucial for informing management decisions in protected areas where resources are limited. We deployed 20 arboreal and 75 terrestrial camera traps throughout Nam Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. The study objectives of the first chapter were to 1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and 2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community using community occupancy models. The objectives of the second chapter were to 1) evaluate the utility of arboreal camera traps for surveying nine arboreal and four semi-arboreal tropical mesomammals, 2) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on detection and occurrence of arboreal mesomammals using generalized linear mixed models and single-season occupancy models, and 3) estimate arboreality of semi-arboreal species using multi-scale occupancy models. We found that terrestrial mesomammal site occupancy was driven largely by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). We found no negative effects of anthropogenic factors at the community-level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remains an acute threat to native mesomammals. We also found that canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important across the arboreal community. The effect of tree and focal limb characteristics on species detection was most likely explained by physiological adaptations and tree use behavior. Mean occupancy was underestimated for most semi-arboreal species when only one method was used. Multi-method occupancy designs may thus improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use, which are important for guiding management and conservation decisions.

TI  - The Influence of Land Use and Habitat Fragmentation on Landscape Connectivity
AU  - Gray, Morgan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The built environment, especially roads, urban and suburban development, can reduce the ability for wildlife to move across landscapes. Maintaining landscape connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation, as corridors of intact habitat help maintain ecosystem functionality and, in the face of climate change, may provide migration paths for species. However, the influence of the built environment on connectivity is rarely quantified using empirical data informed by species detection, movement, or genetic structure. Rather, structural connectivity, as opposed to functional connectivity, is estimated using land cover alone. Structural connectivity estimates offer a simple and potentially powerful approach with fewer data requirements for wildlife corridor planning; however, models of structural connectivity are rarely if ever evaluated with empirical species data, limiting our understanding of their reliability and utility. This dissertation fills this gap by investigating the influence of human land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity using a suite of quantitative modeling approaches and mammals as the focal species, including cross comparisons among these approaches. Specifically, three methods that vary in levels of biological information are used to evaluate how well structural connectivity models perform for individual species, as well as their relationship to functional connectivity.To begin with, the utility of a structural connectivity model based on the distribution and intensity of land use is evaluated by comparing model predictions to observed land use by a generalist carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor). Findings from this study indicate that generic landscape permeability models can be used with confidence as a guide when prioritizing habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. Next, the utility of structural connectivity models is further evaluated by examining how the inclusion of specific human land use variables affects model accuracy in a species distribution model for gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Findings from this study indicate that species distribution models generated in human-dominated landscapes have higher accuracy when informed by indices of land use. Finally, a combination of spatial and genetic methods is used to evaluate the influence of roads on the functional connectivity for a small mammal, California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). Findings from this study indicate that a combined spatial and genetic approach can be used to identify locations where roads act as barriers. Given the importance of habitat fragmentation, there is a pressing need to rapidly develop and utilize connectivity assessment methods in conservation planning. Research findings presented here have already impacted mammal conservation planning and management in California in the following specific ways. The structural connectivity model was used to identify priority habitat linkages for inclusion in the Conservation Blueprint for Santa Cruz County, and the combined genetic and spatial approach was used by the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, CA to identify corridors and restore connectivity in an area with an existing road network. Beyond these regional impacts, future conservation planning worldwide can benefit from using readily available data collected by citizen scientists as input in predictive mapping to increase the sample size and spatial coverage for species distribution modeling.

TI  - Assessing the ecological significance of linkage and connectivity for avian populations in urban areas
AU  - Rosenfeld, Emma Jane
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - As urbanisation continues to fragment and degrade habitats there is a need to ensure that cities are managed to sustain ecosystem function and high biodiversity. Ecological theories suggest that areas with higher levels of functional connectivity sustain a more diverse avian population. By identifying the key habitat features that dictate the distribution and abundance of avian populations it is possible to inform planning policy to maximise biodiversity. Bird species presence and abundance across an urban gradient in Birmingham (UK) was surveyed at 70 sites over three sampling periods (between 2009 and 2010), in combination with a tree survey and digital analysis of land use. Functional connectivity was shown to increase the abundance of bird species and to ameliorate the impacts of urban development. Bird species were found to vary with their associations with vegetation structure and a proxy for invertebrate productivity. There was clear evidence for increasing native tree species in the urban matrix to support more bird species. Ringing data collected between 2008 and 2011 were used to examine bird movements through the city and the influence of habitat factors such as connectivity and built space in the matrix. Bird movements between ringing sites demonstrated the permeability of the city and the importance of connectivity in the landscape. This work showed that the composition of the matrix influences bird occupancy and turnover of sites. The novel findings presented in this thesis on the influence of the urban landscape on urban avian ecology should make an important contribution to urban conservation methods.

AB  - Whether urban parks can maintain viable and self-sustaining populations over the long term is questionable. In highly urbanized landscapes, urban parks could play a role in biodiversity conservation by providing habitat and resources to native species. However, populations inhabiting urban parks are usually small and isolated, leading to increased demographic stochasticity and genetic drift, with expected negative consequences on their viability. Here, we investigated a European red squirrel population located in an urban park close to Paris, France (Parc de Sceaux; 184 ha) to assess its viability. Using mitochondrial D-loop sequences and 13 microsatellite loci, we showed that the population presented high levels of genetic variation and no evidence of inbreeding. The size of the population was estimated at 100–120 individuals based on the comparison of two census techniques, Distance Sampling and Capture-Mark-Recapture. The estimated heterozygosity level and population size were integrated in a Population Viability Analysis to project the likelihood of the population's persistence over time. Results indicate that the red squirrel population of this urban park can be viable on the long term (i.e. 20 years) for a range of realistic demographic parameters (juvenile survival at least >40%) and immigration rates (at least one immigration event every two years). This study highlights that urban parks can be potential suitable refuges for the red squirrel, a locally threatened species across western European countries, provided that ecological corridors are maintained.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation related to human activities modifies the distribution and the demographic trajectory of a species, often leading to genetic erosion and increased extinction risks. Understanding the impact of fragmentation on different species that co-exist in the same area becomes extremely important. Here we estimated the impact produced by different natural and anthropic landscape features on gene flow patterns in two sympatric species sampled in the same locations. Our main goal was to identify shared and private factors in the comparison among species. 199 bank voles and 194 wood mice were collected in 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape, and genotyped at 8 and 7 microsatellites, respectively. Genetic variation and structure were analysed with standard approaches. Effective migration surfaces, isolation by resistance analysis, and regression with randomization were used to study isolation by distance and to estimate the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. Genetic structure was similarly affected by isolation by distance in these species, but the isolation-by-resistance analysis suggests that i) the wood mouse has constrained patterns of dispersal across woodland patches and facilitated connectivity in cultivated areas; ii) the bank vole connectivity is hindered by urban areas, while permeability is facilitated by the presence of woodlands, and cultivated terrains. Habitat loss and fragmentation can therefore influence genetic structure of small sympatric mammal species in different ways, and predicting the genetic consequences of these events using only one species may be misleading.

TI  - Resilience and Sensitivity to Changing Environments in North American River Otters (Lontra canadensis)
AU  - DeNeve Weeks, Danaan L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The North American river otter is a semiaquatic carnivore that occupies freshwater habitats across most of North America, and is a conservation symbol across most of its range. It is used as an indicator species, a keystone species, an umbrella species, and an example of conservation success. The broad distribution of river otters suggests a broad range of habitat tolerances, but they appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations. This apparently conflicting robustness across habitat types and sensitivity to habitat change has baffled researchers for decades. Using morphometric, modeling, and synthetic approaches I explored how otters relate to their environment on a broad scale to gain a better understanding of the conditions to which they are robust, the conditions to which they are sensitive, and the mechanisms by which they adapt to varying environments. Using Maximum Entropy species distribution models I determined that river otter distributions are not strongly affected by climate or macro-environmental variables. Using geometric morphometric methods to examine how cranial shape varies across geographic and ecological space, I determined that morphological variation which may affect feeding and locomotion occurs more intensely at local than broad scales, indicating local morphological adaptation is not strong in this species. Finally, a review of the phylogeography and ecology of river otters and related species indicated that this species evolved from a low-speciation lineage that tends to produce species that can occupy a wide variety of environments without undergoing evolutionary change. Overall I determined that river otters do indeed have a broad ecological niche, and do not respond strongly to climatic or environmental differences or changes across their habitats through altering their distributions or locally adapting. Evidence suggests that river otters may respond strongly to anthropogenic alterations of their habitats because anthropogenically-induced habitat alterations tend to have strong consequences for aquatic food chains, and otters may be more reliant on robust food webs than they are on other aspects of their habitats. These findings have implications for how we think of otter conservation and the conservation of species and ecosystems that are strongly affected by otter presence, as well as what otters indicate about their habitat quality. Additionally, these results may shed light on the ecologies of other mustelid carnivores.In the first chapter of my dissertation I conducted a review of the phylogenetics and biogeography of North and South American river otters to investigate how geography and environmental change have driven river otter evolution in the Americas, and how this informs the ecology of the modern species. I focused first on reviewing the biogeography and evolutionary history of Lontra and Pteronura, and then on the modern ecology, threats, and conservations status of each of the four modern species of Lontra and the single extant species of Pteronura. I chose to review these species because they overlap in geographic and environmental space, and because their shared history provides means for an evolutionarily-grounded examination of relative rarity, specialization, and level of conservation concern. I found that speciation between American otters primarily occurs allopatrically, and there is little functional differentiation in response to allopatric speciation, though they do appear to have the ability to adapt in response to extreme conditions when necessary. Additionally, allopatric speciation primarily occurs in response to changes in waterway connectivity, which is also responsible for changes in population connectivity within the modern species. Most otters have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought, as all species of Lontra persist across a wide variety of climates and semi-aquatic environments, and most of them do so without exhibiting a strong evolutionary response. All American river otters exhibit a strong sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat destruction, though several of them have also shown some ability to coexist with humans. Evidence from this study provides strong indication that this has to do with how human activities near waterways affect food webs, and more generally that on closer examination many habitat components previously thought to be requirements for otters may be better interpreted as indicators of food availability.In the second chapter of my dissertation I use species distribution modeling to examine river otter associations with climate and environment across their range to explore their apparently conflicting robustness to habitat change and sensitivity to human presence. Specifically, I examined the climate and landcover variables that constrain the geographic distribution of otters. I obtained otter occurrences from GBIF and BISON biodiversity databases, climate variables from BIOCLIM, and environmental layers from NASA’s SEDAC program. I built Maximum Entropy species distribution models at 80 and 150 km spatial thinning and varying numbers of background points. The combined model at 80 km spatial thinning and default number of background points produced the highest quality models. Six climatic and landcover variables explained over 10% of otter distributions each: open shrubland, net primary productivity, urban/built, water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter. Of these variables I determined that water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter likely have biological significance. However, the predicted range map generated by these models do not match river otter distributions generated by the IUCN and NatureServe. This is likely due to incomplete occurrence data because of low reporting in parts of the species range. I conclude based on these data that river otters have broad climatic and habitat tolerances (as there are six weakly predictive variables as opposed to 1–2 strongly controlling variables) and that local habitat factors, such as intact-ness of riverine food webs, may have greater impact on otter distributions than broad regional variables. Additionally, I call for improved monitoring and reporting of this and other broadly-distributed species to ensure we can adequately track their habitat requirements and conservation status.In the third chapter of my dissertation I use geometric morphometrics to explore the role of cranial morphological variation in otter persistence across the array of otter habitats. I address two research questions: 1. Is there morphological variation and structure in river otters across subspecies? 2. Is morphological variation in river otters best explained by a pattern of isolation by distance or isolation by ecology? I obtained 100 river otter crania from across the species range from museums. I 3-D scanned them using a Geomagic 3-D scanner and landmarked them using the IDAV Landmark program. To answer Q1 I conducted discriminant function analyses Procrustes ANOVAs and a Principal Components Analysis. None of these tests revealed strong morphological patterning, indicating there is not morphological differentiation across subspecies in cranial shape. T address Q2 I conducted Mantel tests and a Multiple Matrix Regression with Randomization (MMRR) on the relationship between morphological distance and geographic, climatic, and environmental distance. Both the Mantel test and the MMRR results indicated no significant relationship between morphological distance and climatic or environmental distance in otter crania. Both indicated a weak but negative relationship between morphological distance and geographic distance, indicating morphological variation is greater at short geographic distances and lower at broad geographic distances. I conclude that there is significant cranial variation between individuals, but little definable structure in this variation. The weak but significant (and potentially complex) relationship between geographic and morphological distance indicates the possibility that diversifying selection across smaller spatial scales may be more important than differentiation across broader populations, possibly indicating individual specialization within a generalist population.

AB  - Forest fragments are characteristic features of many megacities that have survived the urbanisation process and are often represented by unique assemblages of flora and fauna. Such woodlands are representations of nature in the city—often dominated by non-native and invasive species that coexist with resilient native congeners and purposefully introduced flora. These forest fragments also provide significant ecosystem services to urban society and therefore, understanding their compositional patterns is of considerable importance for conservation and management. In this work, we use a complex network approach to investigate species assemblages across six distinct urban forest fragments in the South Delhi Ridge area of the National Capital Territory, India. We generate bipartite ecological networks using conventional vegetation sampling datasets, followed by network partitioning to identify multiple cliques across the six forest fragments. Our results show that urban woodlands primarily form invasive–native associations, and that major invasive species, such as Prosopis juliflora and Lantana camara exclude each other while forming cliques. Our findings have implications for the conservation of these urban forests and highlight the importance of using network approaches in vegetation analysis.

AB  - Urbanization often negatively impacts biological diversity. Some organisms, however, have traits that are preadapted to urban environments and thus may thrive. Reticulitermes flavipes is one such organism. Indigenous to the Eastern US, it has been introduced into multiple countries. In France, R. flavipes causes major damage to buildings. Although Paris is one of the country’s most infested cities, the factors determining R. flavipes’ distribution and propagation are poorly understood. Using data on termite occurrence, termite genetics, and environmental variables, our study aims to identify factors that explain the distribution and spread of R. flavipes within Paris. First, we explored the association between several environmental variables and the termite’s distribution pattern in Paris; since 2000, a total of 2106 infestations have been recorded. Second, we inferred termite population and colony genetic structure at 66 sample locations using 9 microsatellite loci. Third, we used least-cost models and partial Mantel tests to study the effects of environmental variables on the termite’s population genetic structure. Our analyses revealed that building-related variables were significantly associated with termite infestations and could thus help explain the termite’s spatial distribution pattern. Furthermore, railway networks also explain termite propagation and genetic patterns. Additionally, we found that the termite’s spread is likely driven by budding dispersal, which may be constrained by buildings and roads. Even if budding dispersal could facilitate R. flavipes’ spread in urban areas, it cannot explain the termite’s distribution in Paris all on its own. Indeed, termite propagation seems to be significantly driven by anthropogenic activities.

T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - High-intensity urban development and economic exploitation have led to the fragmentation and isolation of regional habitat patches, and biodiversity is under serious threat. Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km2, 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of “two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes” was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas. This study can provide realistic paths and scientific guidelines for ecological security and high-quality development in the MASHP, and it can also have implications for the construction of ecological networks and comprehensive ecological management in other mountainous areas.

AB  - Doc number: 260AbstractBackground: Mato Grosso do Sul has been undergoing a process of urbanization which results in loss of native vegetation. This withdrawal makes vectors of man and domestic animals closer, causing changes in the epidemiology of diseases such as American Visceral Leishmaniasis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the phlebotomine fauna and environmental issues related to the transmission of AVL in Ponta Porã, Mato Grosso do Sul, between 2009 and 2010.Methods: Vegetation of the urban area was evaluated by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI).Results: The results showed that the phlebotomine fauna of the city consists of five species, especially Lutzomyia longipalpis  (Lutz and Neiva, 1912), the vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum.  Predominance of males was observed. The insects were captured in greater quantity in the intradomicile. Lu. longipalpis  was the most frequent and abundant species, present throughout the year, with a peak population after the rainy season. Vectors can be found in high amounts in forest and disturbed environments.Conclusions: The finding of Lu. longipalpis  in regions with little vegetation and humidity suggests that the species is adapted to different sorts of environmental conditions, demonstrating its close association with man and the environment it inhabits. The tourist feature of Ponta Porã reinforces its epidemiological importance as a vulnerable city. The geographical location, bordering Paraguay through dry border, makes possible the existence of a corridor of vectors and infected dogs between the two countries.

TI  - Factors affecting the diversity and abundance of roadside invertebrates and plants in urban areas
AU  - Jones, Elizabeth Louise
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - With increasing human populations and a rise in people migrating to urban areas there will be a corresponding rise in urbanisation across the globe. Urban green spaces are therefore becoming increasingly important for biodiversity as reserves and movement corridors. This thesis aimed to understand the impacts of traffic and environmental related factors on the ability of green space to be wildlife reserves using the town of Bracknell, Berkshire, UK, as a model urban area. Concentrations of NO2 declined with distance from the road but urban green spaces showed many exceedances of NO2 and NOx critical levels. There were decreases in soil moisture and total C and N at the road edge but increases in soil pH, C:N, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead. Some protection of urban green spaces from the road could be achieved with the use of tree shelterbelts. It was found that roads had a significant affect on plant communities; with more bare ground, moss, herbs and stress-tolerator species and less grass and competitive species near to the road edge. These changes are related to differences in the environmental conditions at the roadside. Carabid species richness, abundance and diversity and invertebrate abundance and plant diversity were all higher at the road edge than the site centres, indicating that these groups are able to take advantage of the road edge habitat. Overall, sites with decreased mowing had more invertebrates and the bioindicators carabids and woodlice. Reducing mowing frequency therefore provides a simple method to improve urban green spaces for biodiversity. Furthermore, older and larger sites had greater biodiversity. This thesis has demonstrated that environmental and traffic related factors have significant effects on urban biodiversity. There are methods which could be employed, however, to lessen these impacts to allow urban green space to act as effective wildlife reserves.

AB  - This study calculated the ecological network index (City Biodiversity Index 2) of 85 cities in Korea using the Land Cover Map. Based on the values of the index, four types of city were studied, including Miryang (Cluster A), Anseong (Cluster B), Samcheok (Cluster Cluster), and Yongin (Cluster D). Based on the current status of land use and natural green space in urban areas, small and medium-sized cities do not show many disconnected factors and have a positive (+) effect on the ecological network index (ENI) value. In order to promote urban biodiversity, it is necessary not only to expand the green area quantitatively, but also to improve the quality, such as expanding and connecting natural green areas, and reducing linear disconnection factors.

TI  - Butterfly conservation in fragmented landscapes
AU  - Leidner, Allison Kara
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Human activities disturb and fragment many natural areas, thereby altering the way in which species interact with their landscape. In natural settings, species often evolved to disperse through areas unsuitable for habitation, but in a world dominated by human-modified landscapes, species face novel features that may disrupt their movement, increasing the isolation of populations. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand if animals can persist in small natural areas separated by agricultural or urban development. The way in which species respond to fragmentation will inform if conservation actions are necessary to protect a species and what strategies might mitigate the consequences of fragmentation. My dissertation addresses these conservation problems using two studies of butterflies in fragmented landscapes. First, I used a novel synthesis of behavioral, mark-recapture, and population genetic studies to identify the effects of urban fragmentation on a rare butterfly. I present the synthesis in the context of a butterfly endemic to barrier islands in North Carolina, Atrytonopsis new species 1. Atrytonopsis  sp1 occupies sand dune habitat, which in this region has largely been converted to residential and commercial development. Many studies rely on a single method to measure movement, but combining methods may help elucidate the effects of natural or anthropogenic fragmentation. To test edge permeability, I conducted butterfly releases at four edge types: sand dune - beach, sand dune - maritime forest/shrub, sand dune - urbanization, and beach - ocean. I then used mark-recapture to compare Atrytonopsis sp1 movement rates in continuous sand dune habitat and between habitat patches separated by urban areas. Finally, I conducted a range-wide population genetic study to assess if there was significant population structure across the range of  Atrytonopsis sp1, and to determine how the structure was partitioned relative to natural barriers and urbanization. All three studies independently indicate that natural features, not urbanization, are barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 movement. Analyzed separately, each study would point to the same general conclusion, but could result in different conservation recommendations. Both linear corridors and stepping-stones are conservation strategies that can increase connectivity of fragmented landscapes. For stepping stones to work, however, Atrytonopsis sp1 must be willing to enter the matrix, successfully find new habitat, and integrate its genes into the new population. The edge behavior studies indicate that  Atrytonopsis sp1 will fly into urban areas, and the mark-recapture studies confirm that it can successfully disperse over short distances. The population genetic studies indicate that longer distances of urbanization are not intrinsically barriers to movement. Consequently, I recommend conservation strategies that focus on preserving stepping stones, rather than on habitat corridors. In a separate study, I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical butterfly communities. Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but its effects may be obscured by the ways in which different species respond to fragmentation. One reason that species display varying responses to fragmentation may be that variability itself is an effect of fragmentation. I tested whether forest fragmentation causes long-term hyperdynamism in butterfly communities, a taxon that naturally displays large variations in species richness and community composition. Using an 11-year dataset from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, I evaluated the effect of fragmentation on changes in species richness and community composition through time. Butterfly species richness did not differ between fragmented forest and intact forest. However, spatial and temporal patterns of butterfly species richness in fragmented forests were significantly more variable than in intact forest. Fragmented forest had a significantly lower proportion of understory shade species and a significantly higher proportion of edge species. I conclude that fragmentation fundamentally alters the natural dynamics of butterfly communities.

AB  - The scarcity of green areas in urban landscapes hinders connectivity among sites reducing the flux of organisms and seed dispersal. Ramphastos toco is an effective plant disperser in tropical landscapes, playing an important role in conserving plant connectivity. In this study we combined two methods of landscape connectivity analysis, in a way not yet explored, to assess the potential contribution of Ramphastos toco to enhancing connectivity among urban vegetation patches. We used spatial modeling techniques to evaluate least cost routes, or those that facilitate bird movement through green urban areas, in Belo Horizonte, a city in Southeast Brazil. We also assessed the relative importance of forest patches for conserving both bird and seed dispersal fluxes using the integral index of connectivity. The resulting least cost route of greater accessibility for the species included in its course an important forest patch under environmental licensing for the construction of a residential condominium. The number of green urban areas covered by forest, of highest habitat quality for the species, summed to 155 patches. Of this total only 5.2% were relevant for regional connectivity, while the four most important patches are targeted by the city’s expansion plans. Ramphastos toco is an effective connector for tropical green urban areas given its adaptability, wide range of movement and seed dispersal effectiveness. We emphasize the need for incorporating ecological knowledge and the prioritization of green areas into city planning, since current expansion projects jeopardize forest patches that are crucial to the functional connectivity of the urban landscape.

TI  - Temporal, Spatial, and Environmental Influences on the Demographics and Harvest Vulnerability of American Black Bears (Ursus americanus ) in Urban Habitats in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia
AU  - Tri, Andrew
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - To date, no research studies in the eastern United States have addressed the spatial ecology of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and suburban habitats, and there is limited information regarding black bear space use, habitat selection, and harvest vulnerability. I assessed the harvest vulnerability, home range size, and spatial ecology of black bears in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia in collaboration with the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. The major objectives of my study were to identify and quantitatively assess: (1) if black bears shift home ranges seasonally with respect to urban/suburban habitats; (2) harvest vulnerability and cause-specific mortality of black bears in urban/suburban habitats; (3) if black bears captured as result of nuisance complaints are transient or reside in urban/suburban habitats; (4) habitat characteristics of movement corridors utilized by black bears in urban/suburban habitats; and (5) if corridors likely to be used by black bears accessing urban/suburban environments can be predicted by habitat modeling. Over the course of the study (2010-2012), agency employees trapped, handled, and fit 119 bears with GPS-GSM collars. Individual study areas in each state were centered around West Milford, Stillwater/Branchville, and Vernon, NJ; Johnstown, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and State College, PA; Beckley, Charleston, and Morgantown, WV. A total of 57,816 bear locations were recorded in New Jersey, 114,451 locations were recorded in Pennsylvania, and 33,217 in West Virginia. Black bears shifted spatial distribution on the landscape in response to resource availability, and consequently I expected bears in urban areas to shift their home ranges seasonally in urban environments. On average, bears were most often found near city limits (<5 km). Home range centers of male bears were twice as far from city limits as female bears (2.31 km vs. 0.91 km, respectively). Bear home range size did not differ among seasons, but did differ between sexes (male home ranges were 5.6 times larger than female bears) and among study areas. Bears did not shift their home ranges closer to urban areas during times of food shortage (spring or late fall). Urban bears lived near town and were resident to the edge of the urban area, but this distance varied with the study area in which they resided. As a result, managers seeking to understand where potential bear conflicts may occur should focus their efforts on the edge of urban and suburban areas (known as the exurban areas) in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Regulated harvests have reduced mortality and allowed black bear populations to increase throughout the eastern United States over the past 30 years. This rapid and dramatic recovery in population size has led to increased human-bear interactions in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Harvest vulnerability of black bears is dependent on a variety of factors and therefore difficult to estimate. I measured harvest vulnerability by generating maximum entropy (Maxent) models of bear occurrence during the prehunting period and hunting season for each study area. I used Maxent to generate models of bear occurrence. In all but one study area, black bear occurrence was 5-75% less in the hunting season than in the prehunting period. Bear occurrence decreased from prehunting period to hunting season in both public hunting lands and urban areas. Bear occurrence probability shifted from public hunting areas to the periphery of the public hunting areas between the prehunting period and hunting season. Annual harvest rates of urban bears were highest in Pennsylvania (20.2%) and lower in New Jersey (5.9%) and West Virginia (17.3%). Despite the short timeframe (3 years) of my study, regulated hunting was effective in killing urban black bears Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Hunters in Pennsylvania harvested a similar proportion of urban bears to the long-term harvest rate of all bears in the state (20.2% vs. 20.0%, respectively). Probability of urban bear occurrence shifted from public hunting areas during the prehunting period to private lands on the periphery of urban areas during the hunting season. Average overall mortality rates of urban bears were highest in Pennsylvania (28.1%) and lower in West Virginia (17.5%) and New Jersey (15.1%). Despite the short timeframe of the study, regulated hunting was effective in killing a high number of urban black bears in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, when all mortality sources were taken into account.  Black bear populations have increased nationwide over the past 4 decades due to reduction in direct mortality. Bear population sizes have increased over time and as a result, human-bear conflicts have increased. I sought to determine whether nuisance bears in urban/suburban areas are residents to the area or transient. I predicted that the majority of bears found in urban/suburban areas form resident populations on the urban perimeter, rather than transient individuals that leave the core forests and enter the urban areas periodically. There was considerable support for my prediction that bear populations in urban areas are resident and spend much of their time on the city's edge. Black bears used private lands on the periphery of urban areas. I posit that this may have been because these areas likely had abundant food and provided reduced risk of disturbance (e.g., hunting, human disturbance).  Given the recent explosive increase in urban bear populations, managers are charged to determine which areas of urban/suburban centers are likely to be used by bears. It is unknown whether black bears use travel corridors within urban/suburban matrix to travel between habitat patches. There exists a paucity of information on how black bears use urban and suburban habitats. We used boosted regression trees to create two predictive models of bear occurrence in urban and suburban habitats for (1) New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and (2) West Virginia. We separated West Virginia from New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the modeling process because West Virginia's topography is more rugged and the population density of people was the lowest of all three states. We randomly selected a subset of 40,000 bear locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as, 30,000 bear locations in West Virginia from the full database of locations. We generated 40,000 random points within the study areas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and 30,000 random points within the study areas of West Virginia. We built three models (1) for New Jersey and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA, (2) State College and Johnstown, PA, and (3) West Virginia. We found that probability of bear occurrence was highest in New Jersey and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre study areas when bears were: (1) <1 km from edge forest, (2) <7.5 km from the nearest road, (3) <7.5 km from the nearest urban area, (4) land use/ land cover was forested, (5) <12 km from public land, and (6) NDVI < 0.3. We found that probability of bear occurrence was highest in Johnstown and State College study areas when bears were: (1) <1 km from edge forest, (2) <1 km from the nearest road, (3) <7 km from the nearest urban area, and (4) <7 km from public land. The highest probability of bear occurrence in West Virginia occurred when (1) NDVI was >0.6, (2) distance to public land was >22.0 km, (3) distance to urban areas was between 1-5 km, (3) topographic position index was >100 (steep, rugged terrain), (4) land use land cover was forested or "other", (5) distance to roads was >1.4 km, and (6) distance to core forest was >1.5 km. We found no support for our prediction that urban bears use corridors. Bears spent nearly 95% of their time on the edge of city limits and <5% of their time within city limits. We found no evidence that habitat quality on the edge of city limits was lower than that of "non-urban" bear habitat. There is likely not a physiological need for bears to traverse urban areas when they can remain in habitats where they would encounter less human disturbance. I found no support for my prediction that bears use corridors. Bears spent nearly 95% of their time on the edge of city limits and <5% of their time within city limits. I had no evidence that habitat quality on the edge of city limits was lower than that of non-urban bear habitat. There likely was no physiological need for bears to traverse urban areas because urban habitat patches are often safe from human disturbance and therefore, they did not use corridors. The final predictive model of the probability of bear occurrence will assist managers by identifying areas where urban bears are most likely to live and areas that require direct management actions.

AB  - Despite its importance as a component of urban green spaces, as far as we are aware no study has focused on plant diversity in urban green corridors (GCs). Therefore, this study aimed at: (i) characterizing tree and shrub communities in Lisbon’s GCs and (ii) assessing whether GCs’ users value trees and shrubs. We counted Lisbon’s GCs users in the same places where we assessed the tree and shrub community. Along the nine GCs, we observed trees and shrubs belonging to 70 species, distributed across 35 families with most (≥50%) species and plants being trees, exotic, pollinated by insects, with fruit dispersion by animals, evergreen leaves, and producing dry fruits. Most GCs had a similar number of users (20–30 users h−1 survey−1) except for those of Central and Ribeirinho, which were more frequented (60 and 100 users h−1 survey−1, respectively). Most users (≥50%) were adults, walking accompanied, and performing leisure activities. Finally, the number of users was shown to be influenced by: (i) tree and shrub relative abundance, confirming that users preferred greener corridors; and (ii) function(s), showing that users preferred the most multifunctional GCs (i.e., GCs fulfilling ecological, cultural, and recreational functions). Our data suggest that Lisbon’s GCs favor more the inclusion of citizens than ecological functionality and resilience.

AB  - We collected ants from six urban and one forest land-use types in Raleigh, NC to examine the effects of urbanization on species richness and assemblage composition. Since urban areas are warmer (i.e., heat island effect) we also tested if cities were inhabited by species from warmer/drier environments. Species richness was lower in industrial areas relative to other urban and natural environments. There are two distinct ant assemblages; 1) areas with thick canopy cover, and 2) more disturbed open urban areas. Native ant assemblages in open environments have more southwestern (i.e., warmer/drier) distributions than forest assemblages. High native species richness suggests that urban environments may allow species to persist that are disappearing from natural habitat fragments. The subset of species adapted to warmer/drier environments indicates that urban areas may facilitate the movement of some species. This suggests that urban adapted ants may be particularly successful at tracking future climate change. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Rapid urbanization development and construction has seriously threatened the connectivity of habitat patches in cities and hindered the construction of ecological networks in highly urbanized areas. Among them, China is affected by early compressed urbanization, and the broken ecological space in cities and towns has attracted the extensive interest of researchers. To avoid the subjective randomness and single analysis of ecological space in urbanization areas, this paper takes the central urban area of Wuhan as the main research area. It comprehensively evaluates the ecological network space by combining the MSPA-MCR model. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Identifying the ecological landscape types with important ecological significance in the study area: Core (88.29%), Islet (0.25%), Perf (0.63%), Edge (9.74%), Loop (0.22%), and Bridge (0.14%). Through the dPC landscape index, seven important ecological sources south of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were identified. (2) According to the comprehensive factors of natural and human factors constructed by the MCR model, the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surface was established, with an average value of 2.65, a maximum value of 4.70, and a minimum value of 1.00, showing a trend that the ecological resistance values in the central and eastern parts are lower than those in the western part. (3) According to the standard deviation ellipse, the distribution direction of NE–SW in ecological sources was analyzed. The ecological sources distributed in the north were less, and the spatial distribution was scattered on the whole. The strong global positive correlation and local spatial aggregation characteristics of ecological resistance surface were evaluated according to spatial autocorrelation. Based on the gravity model, the interaction intensity of ecological corridors between source areas was evaluated, and the importance of ecological corridor protection and restoration was quantitatively analyzed. The research results provide scientific and reasonable references and a basis for ecological planning of Wuhan central city.

AB  - The Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area urban agglomeration is an urban agglomeration with some of the most intensive urbanization since 1980s. A large amount of cultivated land, forest land, water bodies and other land types in the region has been occupied by construction land, resulting in fragmented ecological landscapes and biodiversity in the region and causing many other ecological problems. Based on this, this paper takes the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area as a case study, constructs an ecological network of the dispersion scale of five species from 1990 to 2020 based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method, identifies the ecological groups in the network and uses the core node-based community evolution path tracking algorithm to analyze the ecological groups in order to explore the changes of ecological network connectivity at different scales in the region and to reveal the overall and local characteristics and changes of the migratory space of terrestrial mammals with different dispersion capabilities. The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region. (2) There are obvious differences between the overall and local changes in the connectivity trends of multi-scale regional ecological networks. On the whole, the overall ecological connectivity of the ecological network at each scale showed a gradual upward trend, and the overall connectivity index IIC and the possible connectivity index PC gradually increased with the increase of the maximum dispersal distance of species. From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small. Small-scale (3 km), mesoscale (10 km) and large-scale (30 km) core nodes of ecological groups show a gradual increase trend, and the overall connectivity of ecological groups has improved. However, the core nodes of the extra-large-scale (60 km) and ultra-large-scale (100 km) ecological groups show a trend of decreasing fluctuations, and the overall connectivity within the ecological group has declined. This study is helpful to clarify the structural characteristics of regional ecological space and provide a theoretical basis for regional ecological planning.

AU  - White, R. Jonathan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Stream riparian zones are ecotones between terrestrial and aquatic environments. Studying these areas in urban environments is important since they lie adjacent to stream water supplies. I conducted a study of riparian woody and groundcover vegetation along urban, suburban, and rural streams (land-use designations based on % impervious surface) to assess how cities are affecting plant community structure. I also studied riparian soil gas flux (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) in relation to water table depth and groundwater nutrient concentrations spanning a 10-month period (January to October, 2008). I found distinct woody and groundcover communities associated with proportion of impervious surface surrounding the research sites. These communities differed regarding diversity and proportion of native, exotic, and wetland species distributions. The most urban communities generally had lower species richness, more exotic species, and fewer wetland species when compared to rural areas. Urban areas also exhibited the highest streambanks and lowest water tables. Carbon dioxide gas flux rates were higher in urban areas, but methane and nitrous oxide fluxes did not respond uniformly to site differences as classified by proportion of impervious surface. Methane and nitrous oxide differences, in addition to seasonal variability, were more greatly affected by local site level differences in substrate and nutrient ratios as well as soil moisture.

AU  - Hefty, Kira L

T2  - Conservation Science and Practice
AB  - Land use change can result in complex environments of varying habitat quality and permeability that directly and indirectly influence the effectiveness of natural areas for wildlife conservation. To assess how isolation and degradation of protected natural areas may affect long‐term conservation efforts across the range of a sensitive subspecies, we used multiscale occupancy analysis, species distribution modeling, and circuit theory to identify hotspot areas of occurrence and potential landscape connectivity among areas of high quality habitat within and between protected natural areas. Big Cypress fox squirrels (Sciurus niger avicennia: BCFS) are state‐threatened subspecies of fox squirrel endemic to forested wetlands in southwest Florida, which have been highly altered by human activities. Probability of occupancy of BCFS among conservation areas varied widely due to differences in environmental features (Hedge's g = 1.4705, 95% CI: 1.074–1.763). Fine‐scale features indicative of habitat degradation, such as increasing midstory vegetation cover and decreasing bromeliad cover, negatively influenced BCFS occurrence. Home‐range‐level tree canopy cover differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to urban areas. Additionally, home‐range‐level high summer temperature differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to cypress domes. Habitat was distributed patchily both within and among conservation areas, separated by large areas of unsuitable vegetation communities and urbanized features that were barriers to movement. Considering the threat of increasing isolation of conservation areas due to continued development as well as current and impending degradation caused by land use and climate change within conservation area boundaries, we suggest a strong need for interagency coordination to improve, maintain, and acquire rights for protection of additional remaining habitat.

AB  - Patterns of genetic differentiation within and among animal populations might vary due to the simple effect of distance or landscape features hindering gene flow. An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation‐by‐Distance (IBD), Isolation‐by‐Barrier (IBB), and Isolation‐by‐Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non‐native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north‐west (NW), central west (CW), south‐west (SW), north‐central east (NCE), and south‐east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed‐effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human‐transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large‐sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia.

AB  - The treeline is a sensitive region of the terrestrial ecosystem responding to climate change. However, studies on the composition and formation mechanisms of soil fungal communities across the treeline are still lacking. In this study, we investigated the patterns of soil fungal community composition and interactions among functional guilds above and below the treeline using Illumina high-throughput sequencing and ecological network analysis. The results showed that there were significant differences in the soil environment and soil fungal community composition between the two ecosystems above and below the treeline. At the local scale of this study, geographic distance and environmental factors affected the composition of the soil fungal community. Soil temperature was an important environmental predictor of soil fungal community composition. Species in soil fungal communities in the subalpine meadow were more closely related to each other compared to those in the montane forest. Furthermore, the soil fungal community in montane forest was more stable. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how mountain ecological functions respond to global climate change.

AB  - Coastal vegetation is under increasing pressure with the expansion of urban developments, tourism, population and changing climates. This study sought to examine the effects of fragmentation on the threatened plant community, Coastal Moonah Woodland, in southern Victoria, Australia. We examined the effects on community composition of surrounding land use (urban, rural, native vegetation), remnant size and environmental attributes at three spatial scales. At larger scales, geographic and environmental attributes, such as annual rainfall and temperature, were important drivers of community composition. At finer scales, remnant size, disturbance, weed invasion, connectivity, and immediate surrounding land use impacted more on community composition. At these scales, increasing native vegetation cover in the landscape, remnant connectivity and size positively influenced community composition. If coastal development continues at the current rate, all but a few remnants of this community will be surrounded by the urban landscape. Thus, planning for the integration of these remnants in the urban landscape through long-term management plans and community involvement is essential for the survival of these remnants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Improving ecological connectivity (EC) within landscapes by establishing corridors and ecological networks has been proposed to counteract the negative effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change on biodiversity. To be functional, ecological networks should be kept free of opportunistic invasive species that can disrupt EC between protected areas and cause biodiversity loss. The present study focused on perennial herbaceous species whose occurrence in the Adriatic-Ionian region has increased in the last two decades, namely common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Bohemian knotweed (Reynoutria × bohemica), giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea), Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), and Bermuda buttercup (Oxalis pes-caprae). All species have a high potential to spread in grasslands, abandoned agricultural fields, forest edges, and riparian areas and pose a significant threat to native plant communities and biodiversity. Restoring heavily infested sites is a major challenge because these perennial invaders are very persistent and tend to alter the soil environment in invaded habitats and prevent the recolonization of native plant communities. Therefore, early action should be taken to prevent the spread of these environmental weeds in ecological networks and protected areas with high conservation value.

T2  - Remote Sensing
AB  - To meet a growing demand for accurate high-fidelity vegetation cover mapping in urban areas toward biodiversity conservation and assessing the impact of climate change, this paper proposes a complete approach to species and vitality classification at single tree level by synergistic use of multimodality 3D remote sensing data. So far, airborne laser scanning system(ALS or airborne LiDAR) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with MLS data, overall accuracies of 78% and 74% for tree species and vitality classification can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7% and 4.64% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only.

AB  - Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.

TI  - Green Roofs and Urban Biodiversity: Their Role as Invertebrate Habitat and the Effect of Design on Beetle Community
AU  - Gonsalves, Sydney Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With over half the world’s population now living in cities, urban areas represent one of earth’s few ecosystems that are increasing in extent, and are sites of altered biogeochemical cycles, habitat fragmentation, and changes in biodiversity. However, urban green spaces, including green roofs, can also provide important pools of biodiversity and contribute to regional gamma diversity, while novel species assemblages can enhance some ecosystem services. Green roofs may also mitigate species loss in urban areas and have been shown to support a surprising diversity of invertebrates, including rare and endangered species. In the first part of this study I reviewed the literature on urban invertebrate communities and diversity to better understand the role of green roofs in providing habitat in the context of the larger urban mosaic. My review concluded that, while other factors such as surrounding land use and connectivity are also important to specific invertebrate taxa, local habitat variables contribute substantially to the structure and diversity of urban invertebrate communities. The importance of local habitat variables in urban green spaces and strong support for the habitat complexity hypothesis in a number of other ecosystems has led to proposals that “biodiverse” roofs—those intentionally designed with varied substrate depth, greater plant diversity, or added elements such as logs or stones—would support greater invertebrate diversity, but there is currently limited peer reviewed data to support this. In order to address the habitat complexity hypothesis in the context of green roofs, in the second part of this study I surveyed three roofs designed primarily for stormwater management, three biodiverse roofs, and five ground-level green spaces, from March until September of 2014 in the Portland metropolitan area. Beetles (Coleoptera) were sampled bi-weekly as representatives of total species diversity. Biodiverse roofs had greater richness, abundance, and diversity of beetle species compared to stormwater roofs, but were not more diverse than ground sites. Both biodiverse roofs and ground sites had approximately 20% native beetle species while stormwater roofs had only 5%. Functional diversity was also higher on biodiverse roofs with an average of seven trophic groups represented, while stormwater roofs averaged only three. Ground sites, biodiverse roofs, and stormwater roofs each grouped distinctively in terms of beetle community composition and biodiverse roof communities were found to be positively correlated with roof age, percent plant cover, average plant height, and plant species richness. These results support the findings of previous studies on the importance of local variables in structuring urban invertebrate communities and suggest that biodiverse design can reliably increase greenroof diversity, with the caution that they remain no replacement for ground level conservation.

TI  - Relationships between spatial configuration of tropical forest patches and diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in northeastern Puerto Rico
AU  - Galanes Rivera, Ileana T.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A primary goal of landscape ecology is to reveal the relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns. Landscape patterns may control the ecological processes that shape species diversity and composition. However, there are few studies about how the species diversity of plants and soil millipedes vary with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in tropical habitats. Moreover, there is very little information about the effects of landscape variables on soil biota, such as millipedes, and the relationships between millipede diversity and plant diversity is poorly known, even though millipedes play an essential role in litter decomposition and plant nutrient cycling. Woody plants and soil millipedes were sampled systematically from 12 forest patches (24-34 years old), surrounded by a matrix of mixed urban use and pasture, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Patch spatial characteristics were obtained from aerial color photographs from year 2000 that were digitized into a GIS package. Woody plant species diversity and composition were related mostly to the forest patch attributes such as area and shape, while soil millipede species diversity and composition were related to the forest patch surroundings (e.g. vegetation corridors, patch isolation, and amount of forest in the matrix). Thus, soil millipede and plant species diversity and composition responded to different aspects of the landscape structure, probably due to their different operational scales (e.g. mode of dispersal, habitat discrimination). The species composition of both groups of organisms correlated with the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and there was more similarity in woody plant and millipede species composition among more closely spaced forest patches. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between species diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in each forest patch. There was also no relationship between the species composition of woody plants and soil millipedes in a patch; indicating that soil millipedes are not specialist feeders on woody plant leaf litter. These findings show the importance of considering spatial relationships on a landscape scale when developing biodiversity theories and for the conservation and management of species diversity as well as land use planning, especially in areas of urban development.

AB  - By the mid-century, urban areas are expected to house two-thirds of the world’s population of approximately 10 billion people. The key challenge will be to provide food for all with fewer farmers in rural areas and limited options for expanding cultivated fields in urban areas, with sustainable soil management being a fundamental criterion for achieving sustainability goals. Understanding how nature works in a fast changing world and fostering nature-based agriculture (such as low-input farming) are crucial for sustaining food systems in the face of worsening urban heat island (UHI) effects and other climatic variables. The best fit for the context is transformative agroecology, which connects ecological networks, sustainable farming approaches, and social movements through change-oriented research and action. Even though agroecology has been practiced for over a century, its potential to address the socioeconomic impact of the food system remained largely unexplored until recently. Agroecological approaches, which involve effective interactions between researchers, policy makers, farmers, and consumers, can improve social cohesion and socioeconomic synergies while reducing the use of various agricultural inputs. This review presents a timeline of agroecology transformation from the past to the present and discusses the possibilities, prospects, and challenges of agroecological urbanism toward a resilient urban future.

AB  - Construction and protection of ecological networks (ENs) is considered to be an effective means to curb habitat fragmentation and strengthen landscape connectivity. In this study, a complete evaluation framework of ENs based on “quality–function–structure” was proposed to support the formulation of protection strategies for ENs. First, we built the ENs of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) from 2000 to 2020 based on the advantages of circuit theory and remote sensing data of land use monitoring. The results showed that land development activities are an important driving force for the temporal and spatial evolution of global ENs. Forest fragmentation, transitional urban expansion, and agricultural reclamation were important inducements for the shrinkage of ecological sources. They may also increase the resistance of species migration, which will lead to qualitative change and even fracture of ecological corridors. Second, circuit theory, centrality index, and complex network theory were applied to evaluate the quality defects, functional connectivity, and topology characteristics of ENs in WUA, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the antagonism between ecological corridors and land development activities led to ecological quality defects (ecological barriers and pinchpoints). Different land development models had differential effects on centrality indexes. Moreover, the main trunk in the northern Dabie Mountains and the southern Mufu mountains was developed, while the secondary trunks were abundant in the middle of WUA. Finally, we proposed protection strategies for ENs based on the coupling of the “quality–function–structure” of WUA in 2020. It is suggested that all ecological sources must be included in nature reserves to prevent natural or manmade erosion. The key areas to be repaired were determined through the quality evaluation of ecological corridors. The priority of construction and protection of ecological corridors was determined by coupling two topological structures and functions. We argue that specific protection strategies and directions can be determined according to the construction objectives of local ENs.

TI  - Multi-Scalar Drivers of Native Bee Community Composition and Population Genetic Structure in Human-Altered Landscapes
AU  - Ballare, Kimberly Michelle
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - One of the most well-documented ecological impacts of human-caused landscape change is the fragmentation of natural habitats by human infrastructure, with potential implications for 1) community composition, and 2) species-level gene flow patterns. By including quantifiable measurements of local habitat composition, regional land-use, and the composition of the landscape matrix in ecological studies, we can better understand how multi-scalar environmental factors drive changes in wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, and infer subsequent consequences for ecosystem functions and services across human-altered landscapes. Pollination is a critical ecosystem service driven in part by wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, but despite the importance of bee pollination for ecosystem function, very little is known about how land-use drives native bee community composition and their population gene-flow patterns. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating native bee communities (Chapter 1) and native bee gene flow (Chapter 2) across heterogeneous human-altered landscapes in Texas, and proposes methods for expanding conservation genetic research of pollinators using curated bee specimens (Chapter 3).In Chapter 1, we conducted an extensive survey of bee communities across two urban landscape gradients in Austin and Dallas, Texas, USA comparing communities within agricultural and native grassland habitat types. In Chapter 2, we investigate the genetic structure and gene flow patterns of the native eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica across a 450 km corridor spanning multiple land-uses in Texas. In Chapter 3, we test the effects of sampling and curation methods on next-generation sequencing of three widespread North American native bee species. Our results indicate that the composition of regional land-use differentially impacts bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management and between bee functional groups, and that contemporary land-use as well as regional and fine-scale geographic distance influence the gene flow patterns of a large wood-nesting bee. Lastly, we find that sampling and storage method influence sequence assembly quality, and that curated and trapped specimens can be successfully utilized for next-generation sequencing research.

AB  - PurposeMarine lakes are unique habitats that house diverse assemblages of benthic and planktonic organisms including endemic species. In this study, we aimed to assess to what extent geographical location (Berau versus Papua) and the degree of marine lake connectivity (relatively open versus closed) to the surrounding marine environment structures the prokaryotic community composition of the sponge species Suberites diversicolor.MethodsSponge specimens were sampled in five marine lakes in Borneo and Papua and one open sea habitat in Taiwan.ResultProkaryotic communities of S. diversicolor were dominated by members assigned to the Proteobacteria (particularly Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and Cyanobacteria, which together made up from 78 to 87% of sequences in all samples. The dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in most samples, OTUs 1 and 3, were both assigned to the alphaproteobacterial order Rhodospirillales with OTU-1 dominant in the marine lakes of Berau and Papua and OTU-3 in Taiwan. OTU-3 was also largely absent from Papuan samples but present in all Berau samples. Compositionally, S. diversicolor samples clustered according to geographical location with the main axis of variation separating marine lake samples collected in Berau from those collected in Papua and the second axis of variation separating open sea samples collected in Taiwan from all marine lake samples. In addition, our results suggest that the degree of lake connectivity to the open sea also influences prokaryotic composition.ConclusionAlthough previous studies have shown that sponge-associated microbial communities tend to be stable across different geographical and environmental gradients, in the present study, both geography and local environmental conditions were significant predictors of variation in prokaryotic community composition of S. diversicolor.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Biodiversity conservation requires modeling tools capable of predicting the presence or absence (i.e., occurrence‐state) of species in habitat patches. Local habitat characteristics of a patch (lh), the cost of traversing the landscape matrix between patches (weighted connectivity [wc]), and the position of the patch in the habitat network topology (nt) all influence occurrence‐state. Existing models are data demanding or consider only local habitat characteristics. We address these shortcomings and present a network‐based modeling approach, which aims to predict species occurrence‐state in habitat patches using readily available presence‐only records.For the tree frog Hyla arborea in the Swiss Plateau, we delineated habitat network nodes from an ensemble habitat suitability model and used different cost surfaces to generate the edges of three networks: one limited only by dispersal distance (Uniform), another incorporating traffic, and a third based on inverse habitat suitability. For each network, we calculated explanatory variables representing the three categories (lh, wc, and nt). The response variable, occurrence‐state, was parametrized by a sampling intensity procedure assessing observations of comparable species over a threshold of patch visits. The explanatory variables from the three networks and an additional non‐topological model were related to the response variable with boosted regression trees.The habitat network models had a similar fit; they all outperformed the non‐topological model. Habitat suitability index (lh) was the most important predictor in all networks, followed by third‐order neighborhood (nt). Patch size (lh) was unimportant in all three networks.We found that topological variables of habitat networks are relevant for the prediction of species occurrence‐state, a step‐forward from models considering only local habitat characteristics. For any habitat patch, occurrence‐state is most prominently influenced by its habitat suitability and then by the number of patches in a wide neighborhood. Our approach is generic and can be applied to multiple species in different habitats.

AB  - Forests and woodlands are under continuing pressure from urban and agricultural development. Tree-dependent mammals that rarely venture to the ground are likely to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales. Such studies are required to examine the generality of our findings for other tree-dependent species.

AB  - Recent concern over increasing loss of biodiversity has prompted considerable interest in the role of urban green spaces as reservoirs of local biodiversity. This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats.

AB  - The first inventory of the flora of Appia Antica Regional Park (Italy), one of the largest protected urban areas in Europe (4580 ha), its biological, ecological and biogeographical composition, and notes of the vegetation physiognomies and landscape are presented; physical characteristics of the territory (geomorphology, lithotypes, and phytoclimate) are also given. The landscape is defined by an agricultural matrix with natural and seminatural areas as patches, and riparian vegetation communities as corridors. The vegetation physiognomies are represented by types linked to the Mediterranean climate (mixed, Mediterranean, and riparian forests; scrubby, rocky, aquatic, and helophytic vegetation; anthropogenic communities). The floristic list includes 714 taxa (104 families and 403 genera). Therophytes prevail over hemicryptophytes; woody flora comprises about 30% of alien species. As regards chorotypes, together with a considerable number of Mediterranean species, there are many exotic species with wide distribution areas testifying to a long-lasting anthropic impact. Floristic novelties (european, national, and regional levels) for 21 taxa are reported. The extraordinary species diversity discovered (43% of flora of Rome and 20% of regional flora) is linked to the landscape heterogeneity, the characteristics of which are: (1) persistence of residual natural patches, (2) occurrence of quite well-preserved aquatic habitats and humid meadows, (3) a rich anthropogenic flora, (4) an interesting flora of archeological sites, (5) occurrence of species not common in Latium, (6) occurrence of populations of aliens in crops (which cause economic impact), (7) presence of aliens on archeological ruins (which cause economic-social impacts). The extensive set of data provided represents a general base framework for guiding future research efforts and landscape action plans consistent with environmental sustainability.

TI  - Ecology of mesopredators within an urban area in east Texas
AU  - Lombardi, Jason Vincent
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As urbanization is increasingly becoming more commonplace across the country, the effect of urban landscape features on wildlife species is becoming more important. Unlike large predators, mesopredators are expanding their geographic range and are readily adapting to living in and around urbanized areas. Even though urban mesopredator research has steadily been growing over the last 45 years, the majority of this has taken place in large metropolitan areas in the Midwest, Pacific and Northeastern regions. Research in the southeastern US, especially Texas and within small, urbanized areas is surprisingly lacking. In eastern Texas, mesopredators commonly found in urban areas include coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcats ( Lynx rufus), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). As more natural habitats are developed, it is important to identify variables likely to influence the density, occurrence and detectability of these species in order to establish sound management strategies to mitigate potential human-wildlife interactions. A mark-recapture study was conducted to: 1) Determine if density, occurrence and detectability of coyotes, red foxes, gray foxes, bobcats, raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks vary in predictable ways in response to urban landscape features, and 2) identify hot spots of high potential human-mesopredator contact.I utilized motion-activated cameras during summer 2013 and winter 2014 to determine how coyotes, bobcats, and red and gray fox respond to urban landscape features in the city of Nacogdoches and immediately surrounding areas. The mesocarnivore community in the study area was affected by a variety of urban landscape features and their presence, density, and detectability shifted seasonally, but was similar to studies conducted in larger urban areas in North America. Coyote and bobcat presence and detectability both differed seasonally and were primarily associated with natural cover. Gray fox presence was affected by low density of buildings, whereas red fox densities increased as distance to buildings and distance to urban edge decreased. Low density residential zones adjacent to large forested patches such as the southeastern and northeastern extremes of the study area may have the greatest potential for human contact with coyotes, bobcats, red and gray foxes.For raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks I conducted a live mark-recapture study during late August – early September 2013 and early – late January 2014 in both suburban (summer 1.76 km2; winter 1.23 km2) and urban (winter 1.37 km2) areas within the city of Nacogdoches, Texas. Densities of raccoons within urban habitat ranged from 7.0 – 59.0 / km2, (  x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), which is consistent with previous research, whereas I report the first density estimate of opossums in an urbanized area during the summer (4.8 ± 1.9 / km2) and winter (13.1 ± 7.5 / km2). At the urban site, raccoon density, presence and hot spots were tied to areas of greater road density with small forested patches and subsequent greater human presence whereas opossum occurrence and hot spots were tied to close proximity to water. At the suburban site, presence and detectability of opossums and raccoons was associated with proximity to water and near small forested patches.This research indicates that the mesopredator community does in fact vary in their density and occurrence within the city of Nacogdoches. Nacogdoches has one of the greatest densities (x¯ = 227 ± 0.46 ind/km2) of coyotes reported in the literature in both urban and nonurban areas. Densities of red fox (1.19 ind/km2), bobcats (x¯ = 0.57 ± 0.32 ind/km2) and raccoons (x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), were consistent with values reported for urban populations, while I also report the first population densities of Virginia opossum (4.8 – 13.1 ind/km 2) and gray fox (x¯ = 0.36 ± 0.19 ind/km 2) living within a small urban area.The ability to see how the densities of certain species changes throughout the landscape will help biologists, city officials and wildlife managers make important decisions regarding educating the public and reducing human – mesopredator contact and zoonotic disease transmission. The remarkable variability of these species to urban landscape features is a testament to their remarkable and seamless adaptability. However, I see the need to preserve or construct wildlife corridors within and/or on the edges of urbanized areas to facilitate the movements of mesopredators away from residential areas and possible human interaction. Although I provide new insights in the urban ecology to all of the focal species, there is still a lot to be learned in urban areas such as gray fox and opossum urban ecology.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to deteriorated wetland water quality, reduced biodiversity, and fragmented wetland landscapes, which seriously threaten the sustainable development of regional ecology. Based on land use data of Dongying City, Shandong Province, in 2020, this study selected the landscape disturbance degree and landscape fragility index to construct a landscape ecological risk evaluation model and to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk in Dongying City in 2020. The MSPA-Conefor-MCR model was used to extract the ecological network of wetlands in Dongying City, and the topological structure indices were quantitatively analyzed. Combined with the actual situation within the study area, the source sites to be optimized were identified by risk zoning and source importance; the ecological resistance surface was modified using landscape ecological risk, and the ecological network was optimized by simulating edge increase in order to evaluate the robustness of the ecological network before and after optimization and to verify the edge increase effect. The results show that the ecological risk in Dongying is high, mainly distributed in the central region and extending to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A total of 131 ecological source sites (6 core and 125 resting-stone source sites) and 180 ecological corridors were extracted, and the whole ecological network was found to be less stable and to have stronger network heterogeneity using a topological analysis. By simulating 11 additional edges, the robustness of the optimized ecological network was significantly improved. Optimizing the simulated-edge increase can enhance the smoothness of ecological energy flow, which can provide a scientific basis for the construction of the ecological security pattern of wetlands in Dongying City.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.

TI  - Data to Decision in a Dynamic Ocean: Robust Species Distribution Models and Spatial Decision Frameworks
AU  - Best, Benjamin D.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In this dissertation, I build robust species distribution models in two case study areas, US Atlantic (Best et al. 2012) and British Columbia (Best et al. 2015), predicting presence and abundance respectively, from scientific surveys. These models are then applied to novel decision frameworks for preemptively suggesting optimal placement of human activities in space and time to minimize ecological impacts: siting for offshore wind energy development, and routing ships to minimize risk of striking whales. Both decision frameworks relate the tradeoff between conservation risk and industry profit with synchronized variable and map views as online spatial decision support systems.For siting offshore wind energy development (OWED) in the U.S. Atlantic (chapter 4), bird density maps are combined across species with weights of OWED sensitivity to collision and displacement and 10 km2 sites are compared against OWED profitability based on average annual wind speed at 90m hub heights and distance to transmission grid. A spatial decision support system enables toggling between the map and tradeoff plot views by site. A selected site can be inspected for sensitivity to a cetaceans throughout the year, so as to capture months of the year which minimize episodic impacts of pre-operational activities such as seismic airgun surveying and pile driving. Routing ships to avoid whale strikes (chapter 5) can be similarly viewed as a tradeoff, but is a different problem spatially. A cumulative cost surface is generated from density surface maps and conservation status of cetaceans, before applying as a resistance surface to calculate least-cost routes between start and end locations, i.e. ports and entrance locations to study areas. Varying a multiplier to the cost surface enables calculation of multiple routes with different costs to conservation of cetaceans versus cost to transportation industry, measured as distance. Similar to the siting chapter, a spatial decisions support system enables toggling between the map and tradeoff plot view of proposed routes. The user can also input arbitrary start and end locations to calculate the tradeoff on the fly.Essential to the input of these decision frameworks are distributions of the species. The two preceding chapters comprise species distribution models from two case study areas, U.S. Atlantic (chapter 2) and British Columbia (chapter 3), predicting presence and density, respectively. Although density is preferred to estimate potential biological removal, per Marine Mammal Protection Act requirements in the U.S., all the necessary parameters, especially distance and angle of observation, are less readily available across publicly mined datasets.In the case of predicting cetacean presence in the U.S. Atlantic (chapter 2), I extracted datasets from the online OBIS-SEAMAP geo-database, and integrated scientific surveys conducted by ship (n=36) and aircraft (n=16), weighting a Generalized Additive Model by minutes surveyed within space-time grid cells to harmonize effort between the two survey platforms. For each of 16 cetacean species guilds, I predicted the probability of occurrence from static environmental variables and time-varying conditions. To generate maps of presence vs. absence, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to define the optimal threshold that minimizes false positive and false negative error rates. I integrated model outputs, including tables and plots, into an online spatial decision support system, allowing for easy navigation of models by taxon, region, season, and data provider.For predicting cetacean density within the inner waters of British Columbia (chapter 3), I calculated density from systematic, line-transect marine mammal surveys over multiple years and seasons (summer 2004, 2005, 2008, and spring/autumn 2007) conducted by Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Abundance estimates were calculated using two different methods: Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) and Density Surface Modelling (DSM). CDS generates a single density estimate for each stratum, whereas DSM explicitly models spatial variation and offers potential for greater precision by incorporating environmental predictors. Although DSM yields a more relevant product for the purposes of marine spatial planning, CDS has proven to be useful in cases where there are fewer observations available for seasonal and inter-annual comparison, particularly for the scarcely observed elephant seal. Abundance estimates are provided on a stratum-specific basis. Steller sea lions and harbour seals are further differentiated by ‘hauled out’ and ‘in water’. This information offers the opportunity to assess the risks posed to marine mammals by existing and emerging threats.Starting with marine animal observations at specific coordinates and times, I combine these data with environmental data, often satellite derived, to produce seascape predictions generalizable in space and time. These habitat-based models enable prediction of encounter rates and, in the case of density surface models, abundance that can then be applied to management scenarios. Specific human activities, OWED and shipping, are then compared within a tradeoff decision support framework, enabling interchangeable map and tradeoff plot views. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Ecological studies of the green space in xiaolan toww,zhongshan city
AU  - Li, Hua Wei
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - This thesis studies the composition of planting species, function and distribution of green space in Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan City. The eco-system of Xiaolan green land is planned by applying relative theories of urban ecology and landscape ecology.Xiaolan Town covers a large variety of garden plants including 105 families and 433 species. Public green land per capita is 5.02m2, and the coverage of greening 33.3%. In the urban area, there are 4 parks occupying 27.6 hm2, which are completely equipped with entertainment facilities and several plots of street green space of 4.35hm2. Street greening begins to take shape. The new urban areas are densely dotted with green trees, which consist of arbors, shrubs and grass. However, the street of the old urban area is narrow and its greenery is simply composed of single layer arbors. The new urban area, Jinju Garden, whose green land accounts for over 30% of the area, possesses central garden and courtyard green belt while the old urban area, Xinyong Road residential area, is densely populated and is crowded with houses with hardly any green land. Some green belts attached to units such as Today Group, Guli Corporation, Yongda Company, Xiaolan Middle School and the local government are well done with greening. Conversely, some schools and factories attach little importance to greening and even have no green land. The nursery in this town covering 8000 hm2 is one of the biggest bases for flower culturing in China, and seedlings are sold all over the country. In general, garden plants in Xiaolan town are abundant and varied, most of which are nursery and flower farmland. Varieties and richness of plants in parks are ranked the second. In contrast, there are much fewer street trees. Efflorescent arbors are widely cultivated in parks, having strong decorating effects. In addition, flowering shrubberies and colorful shrubberies are also effectively planted in parks and streets. Nevertheless, perpendicular greening is seldom used, and species of lianas need to be further researched into.As far as the aesthetic function is concerned, People's Park and Longshan Park are rich in landscape types with great aesthetic effects. The street in old urban areas is narrow with busy traffic with the concentration of CO2 relatively higher, 323.1ppm, while the street in new urban areas is wide with light traffic so that CO2 concentration is lower, only 312.0ppm. As far as concentration of air negative-ion and bacteria are concerned, there is no significant difference between new and old urban areas. On the average, air negative-ion is 224/cm3, the amount of bacteria 2453/m3 and Ci 0.17. Air is slightly polluted.At the bus station, the negative-ion is as low as 92/cm3 and Ci 0.03, which is below 0.09. The amount of bacteria is 2461/m3 and air is seriously polluted.On an average, in the urban area of Xiaolai town the concentration of CO2 amount of bacteria is 1784/m3, air negative-ion 1057/cm3 and air quality index (Ci) 1.12. The environmental air is the cleanest and of good quality in the whole town. As to the ecological function, there are abundant and various garden plants in parks and streets, while relatively fewer and monotonous in schools, residential areas and green land attached to some units. In a word, the coverage rate of green land is low in Xiaolan Town, and the present distribution of green space is out of proportion. According to the climate conditions of Xiaolan town, with the road planning and the urban planning considered, the eco-system of Xiaolan green land is planned to be a pattern of Ring-Net Type, One Line, One Center, One Belt and Two Loops by applying relative theories of urban ecology and landscaping ecology and sticking to the principle of priority to ecology. A linear corridor of Shengping East-Xingning Road is to be constructed from northeast to southwest oblique direction. In the meantime, the urban central park, with the Gym Center centered, is to be built. Moreover, the river green belt is to be expanded along the long dike, the eastern dike and the southern dike. The outside and inside green ring belts are also to be reconstructed. Finally, a suburb ecological shelter belt , which will be connected with the nursery culturing base in the south of the town and developed into a net of southeastern ecological shelter belt in Xiaolan town, is to be built at the windward direction of the town, which is situated at the south of Dongsheng street. The eco-system of the ring-net green space is relatively stable, which makes the serials of landscapes continuous and accessible, thus, Xiaolan town is to be surrounded with green and the ecological environment will be excellent. In accordance with the present distribution of green space and urban planning in this town, some measures have been proposed, which can increase green land areas and percentage of green coverage, and make green land areas bring about maximum ecological benefit as well.

T2  - Conservation Science and Practice
AB  - Human development and roads threaten wildlife through distinct mechanisms and understanding the influence of these elements can better inform mitigation and conservation strategies. We used camera traps to quantify the effects of major roads, environmental factors, and human development on the mammalian community composition between sites north and south of a major interstate highway in northern Utah, USA. We found no significant differences in species richness nor community similarity across the north–south divide of the highway. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we compared the effects of the distance to the highway, housing and human population density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the human footprint index to changes in mammalian community composition and species‐specific habitat usage. Community occupancy response, similarity, and species richness were negatively affected by increased housing and human population densities and positively affected by increased NDVI and decreased human footprint, whereas their response to the highway was more inconclusive. We conclude that mammalian community composition in our study area is influenced by both environmental conditions and human development while the effect of the highway was more nuanced, possibly due to the presence of a newly constructed wildlife overpass. Taken together, the lack of differences in species richness or community composition across the highway suggests that it may not currently exacerbate the effects of other anthropogenic sources of habitat fragmentation and highlights the need for additional research into human–wildlife conflict mitigation strategies.

TI  - Urban Integration of Green Roofs: Current Challenges and Perspectives
AU  - Joshi, Mitali Yeshwant
AU  - Teller, Jacques
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Green roofs (GRs) are a sustainable alternative to conventional roofs that provide multiple ecosystem services. Integrating GRs into urban areas is highly relevant considering the rapidly increasing built-up in cities. Therefore, this paper systematically and comprehensively reviews the recent literature from 2011 to 2019 on GRs to identify the challenges and perspectives related to the urban integration of GRs. The review suggests that the effectiveness of GRs in delivering ecosystem services is largely dependent on context-specific parameters such as weather conditions and existing construction or design-related parameters. Integrating GRs into urban areas can be challenging given the diversity of actors, functions, and conditions characterizing these areas. Although significant research has already been conducted on GRs, research covering more geographical locations and contexts is needed. The review points out the need to include future urbanization scenarios, such as tall buildings while analyzing the impact of GRs on ecological networks. Additionally, the review emphasizes the inclusion of urban morphological parameters alongside an analysis of the impact of GRs on microclimate regulation and air quality. In terms of social acceptance, this review points out the need to consider the temporal cycles of vegetation for noting users’ perspectives. Additionally, further research is required on the social impact of GRs, considering their influence on property prices. Lastly, the review stresses the need for more city-scale studies on the impact of GRs on ecosystem services.

TI  - If You Feed Them, They Will Come: How the Availability of Food and Cover Within a Zoo Enclosure Increases the Likelihood of Free-Living Birds Within
AU  - Brass, Jake Matthew
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Recently, the role of the modern day zoo has shifted away from ‘Ark’ style conservation towards more in-situ conservation and education. In-situ conservation often focuses upon exotic species and actions taken to conserve these species require extensive funding. A relatively unexplored and less costly form of conservation for zoos to become involved in is the promotion of free-living bird species within zoo grounds. However, within the peer reviewed literature there are few studies which describe free-living species across zoos and only one study (on free-living corvids) attempts to attribute factors within a zoo to the distribution of free-living species. The current study investigates factors affecting free-living bird abundances across multiple zoos. Over a period of seven months, four zoos were studied with 10 enclosures from each zoo being randomly selected for survey. Utilising point counts at an enclosure level, interactions of free-living bird species were recorded. Results highlight both cover within enclosures and the availability of subsidised feeding as significant factors in influencing free-living bird presence within. Further, results demonstrate that factors affecting bird presence and abundance are species specific, with access to subsidised food within an enclosure being significant for both house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), but not for the robin (Erithacus rubecula). While the study presented is limited by sample size and survey effort, a novel approach in relating free-living bird presence to enclosure design is described, allowing for future studies to fully explore factors influencing free-living species distributions across zoo grounds. Utilising results from this study, zoos can begin to actively promote native bird conservation and further develop biodiversity action plans designed to encourage native species conservation within zoo grounds.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction.

AB  - Increases in particulate matter in cities threaten both public health and ecosystems. Street trees, which are a corridor-type green infrastructure capable of absorbing particulate matter, have been promoted as one possible solution to this problem. However, planting selected trees solely with the goal of reducing particulate matter may adversely affect street tree ecosystem resilience by inhibiting species diversity. This study aims to investigate urban street tree planting strategies that reduce particulate matter while maintaining ecosystem resilience. To this end, a study site in Suwon, South Korea was selected, and street tree planting scenarios were developed based on the selected site information. A scenario analysis was conducted using a system dynamics model. The model simulated the long-term trends under each scenario regarding the amount of particulate matter absorbed by the trees and the changes in species diversity. The analysis results clearly show that strategic planting of street trees while focusing on only a specific purpose—reducing particulate matter—can adversely affect ecosystem resilience. The scenario analysis also revealed that increasing the number of street trees while maintaining a balance among various species is the best option for reducing particulate matter without degrading species diversity. Additionally, the results support the need to plant evergreen species to consider the winter season.

AU  - Carlen, Elizabeth
AU  - Jason Munshi‐South
T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Urbanization may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, we examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the eastern United States. We focused our sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). We performed ddRAD‐Seqon 473 samples, recovered 35,200 SNPs, and then used multiple evolutionary clustering analyses to investigate population structuring. These analyses revealed that pigeons formed two genetic clusters—a northern cluster containing samples from Boston and Providence and a southern cluster containing all other samples. This substructuring is possibly due to reduced urbanization across coastal Connecticut that separates Boston and Providence from New York and mid‐Atlantic cities. We found that pairs of pigeons within 25 km are highly related (Mantel r = 0.217, p = .001) and that beyond 50 km, pigeons are no more related than they would be at random. Our analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. We conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in feral pigeons.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion has significantly altered the regional landscape pattern, posing a serious threat to the sustainable development of natural and social ecosystems. By using landscape patterns indices and an area transfer matrix, this study analyzed the spatial-temporal changes of landscape patterns in the karst mountainous cities of southwest China from 2000 to 2020, by taking the central urban area of Guiyang City (CUAG) as the study area. This study explored the spatial and temporal driving factors of landscape pattern changes by using stepwise multiple linear regression and geographic detector methods. The results show: (1) CUAG’s landscape types altered changed drastically, with the area of forestland and construction land rapid increment and cultivated land decrement significantly. (2) The patches of construction land and forestland tended to be aggregated, the degree of fragmentation was reduced, and the shape was complex; cultivated land fragmentation was intensified. The connectivity of the landscape was improved, while the level of landscape diversity declined, the trend of landscape homogenization was obvious. (3) Socioeconomic and geographical endowment drivers have determined landscape pattern changes. The findings of this study may be used to interpret other similar landscapes worldwide and may imply the protection of urban ecosystem and sustainable development.

AB  - Simple SummaryUrban green areas are essential for many animals inhabiting cities, including bats. They provide food and shelter, and also facilitate migration. Our aim was to identify bat species inhabiting Planty Park in Cracow and determine how their activity differed depending on the weather and season. We recorded bats’ calls on ultrasonic detectors in 2016 and 2017. In total, 2 of 10 observed species were new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). We divided all species into groups of similar ecology for further analyses. Myotis bats were the least active group. Bats of genera Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio were the most active in late summer, similarly to Pipistrellus and Hypsugo, although statistics did not back the outcome for the latter two genera. In spring and early summer, Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio bats were more active during warmer nights, while in autumn, they preferred cloudless nights. Interestingly, Pipistrellus and Hypsugo bats decreased their activity at higher temperatures during summer. Our study will lead to a better understanding of bat ecology in urban areas and will contribute to setting urban landscape planning recommendations.AbstractMunicipal greenery can mitigate the negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity, including bats, by providing a migration corridor, food base and roosts. Our study aimed to evaluate the species composition and diversity, test the differences in activity between seasons, and identify the atmospheric conditions influencing the bats’ activity in the Planty Park (Cracow). Fieldworks were conducted in 2016 and 2017. We recorded 10 species, two new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Taxa were divided into three ecological guilds. Myotis group’s activity was insufficient to perform statistical analyses. The activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group peaked in late summer. A similar insignificant trend was observed for Pipistrellus and Hypsugo. Temperature enhanced the activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group in spring and early summer, while cloud cover suppressed their activity in autumn. Temperature also enhanced Pipistrellus and Hypsugo group activity in spring and autumn, but it suppressed their summer activity. Our study is one of the first to investigate temperate urban bats’ phenology and may serve as a preface for further research to introduce detailed urban landscape planning recommendations.

AB  - Nature-based solutions are some of the most effective strategies to promote sustainable city development; however, existing research on NbS is mostly comprised of single variable studies rather than multiple variables. The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of extending the NbS of a single variable to two variables for the better development of sustainable cities. Both forestation and wetland restoration are regarded as NbS for sustainable city development. The research approach of “forest–wetland” NbS was proposed and centers on the process and core issues of traditional NbS. Taking Tianjin as an example, the spatial patterns of forests and wetlands, correlation between the spatial distribution of forests and wetlands, and spatial correlation between the areas of forest growth and wetland growth within a certain distance in different years were studied using a spatial distribution pattern analysis, geographic concentration analysis, kernel density estimation and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Based on the core issues of NbS and the above spatial analysis, a “forest–wetland” spatial planning strategy was formulated. The main conclusions are as follows: forest and wetland were negatively correlated in the whole area of Tianjin, forest resources w mainly located in north, while wetland resources were mainly located in south. Compared with forests, the spatial distribution of wetlands in Tianjin was more balanced. There exist synergy and trade-offs between forest and wetland area under certain circumstances. Growth of forests was positively correlated with the growth of wetlands, within a distance of 0–400 m from 2000 to 2010, and within a distance of 0–600 m from 2010 to 2020. An increase in forest area will lead to an increase in evaporation, which in turn will hinder the growth of wetlands in Tianjin. Forest–wetland ecological network could promote synergistic between forest and wetland, and grey infrastructure to reduce potential trade-off between forest and wetland.

AB  - Simple SummaryUrban landscapes, though a primary contributor to habitat fragmentation, have the potential to facilitate habitat connectivity for native pollinator species, especially with strategic green space planning. Citizen science data have been proven to be useful to address conservation issues in urban areas, especially where knowledge is lacking about species richness and habitat preferences. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul, with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities, and what parts of the city facilitated habitat connectivity. We found that the most suitable habitats for multiple families were located in public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. These results are directly applicable in order to better understand urban planning stakes for pollinators and wildlife in general and provide avenues for improvement to recreate functional greenways in a dense city like Seoul.AbstractThe preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas. Innovative urban planning and architecture are therefore required as well as the setting-up of ecological management practices to lead to a more sustainable urbanism for pollinators and wildlife in general.

TI  - FIRELAN—An Ecologically Based Planning Model towards a Fire Resilient and Sustainable Landscape. A Case Study in Center Region of Portugal

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - This paper explores the role of landscape planning as a tool for rural fire prevention. It presents a methodology for a fire resilient and sustainable landscape model (FIRELAN) that articulates the ecological and cultural components in a suitable and multifunction land-use plan. FIRELAN is a conceptual and ecologically based model that recognizes river basin’ land morphology, microclimate and species combustibility as the fundamental factors that determine fire behavior and landscape resilience, along with the ecological network (EN) for achieving ecological sustainability of the landscape. The model is constituted by the FIRELAN Network and the Complementary Areas. This network ensures the effectiveness of discontinuities in the landscape with less combustible land-uses. It also functions as a fire-retardant technique and protection of wildland-urban interface (WUI). This model is applied to municipalities from Portugal’s center region, a simplified landscape severely damaged by recurrent rural fires. The results show that land-use and tree species composition should change drastically, whereas about 72% of the case study needs transformation actions. This requires a significant increase of native or archaeophytes species, agricultural areas, landscape discontinuities and the restoration of biodiversity in Natura 2000 areas. The EN components are 79% of the FIRELAN N area, whose implementation ensures soil and water conservation, biodiversity and habitats. This paper contributes to the discussion of the Portuguese rural fires planning framework.

TI  - Process Oriented Infrastructure for Climate-Driven Forest Migration Through Cities
AU  - Han, Qiyao
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Global climate change is expected to shift the geographical distribution of tree species worldwide. Increasing empirical evidence has emerged showing that many tree species are already moving toward higher latitudes to track suitable climatic conditions. Yet, such movement cannot guarantee their survival, especially if the accessibility of suitable climates is highly constrained by species dispersal capabilities and human-created barriers. In order to assist forest migration, many efforts have been made to translocate tree species from their native ranges to locations where the climate is projected to be suitable in the future (known as assisted migration). However, there are concerns that such translocations may not be successful and may lead to unpredictable adverse consequences. This is because uncertainties in species’ distribution projections could cause a risk of moving species too far or not far enough. Within this context, this study develops a process-oriented approach to map and design urban landscapes to facilitate forest migration under climate change. The focus lies on the connectivity of urban landscapes for effective seed dispersal. Since the migration of trees is a continuing process that does not rely on their future distributions, a process-oriented approach could avoid projections of species’ future distributions and thus might be more feasible and manageable, as well as more robust to future climate change, than the current “goal-oriented” strategy of assisted migration. This study is guided by the following three research questions: (1) Why should we consider cities in the process of forest migration and what roles can urban landscapes play in the process? (2) How can forest trees migrate through urban areas, and more specifically, how can urban landscapes, as seed sources or stepping stones, contribute to the process? (3) How to design urban green infrastructure to facilitate forest migration and, more specifically, to promote seed dispersal and species’ range expansion across urban areas? A three-phase research methodology, which includes a transdisciplinary literature review, a mapping-based approach and a research-by-design methodology, is proposed to answer each of the three research questions, respectively. The Greater Manchester area, which is one of the most urbanised regions in the UK, is selected as a case study site. Eurasian jays, Eurasian siskins, and coal tits are selected as the main seed dispersal agents in the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of urban landscapes to facilitate climatedriven forest migration through cities. By collecting and integrating knowledge and II information from multiple disciplines, this study suggests that cities could provide suitable climatic (urban heat islands) and environmental conditions for the persistence of outlier populations at higher latitudes than their native ranges, thereby shortening or even eliminating migration lags in tree species. The proposed process-oriented approach maps potential migration flows between urban woodlands in Greater Manchester, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Furthermore, by testing different afforestation strategies, this study reveals that the processes of forest migration at a metropolitan scale can be facilitated by creating small, distributed but functional-connected green spaces at site scales. The process-oriented approach can be used by designers to re-visualise urban landscapes as a series of interconnected flow channels, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to improve urban green infrastructure for climate adaptation. Moreover, this study will encourage researchers who currently work in climate-driven species migration to consider taking advantage of urban landscapes and will promote the cooperation between biologists, foresters, designers, and managers in urban planting to cope with the rapidly changing climate.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban forests adjacent to interstate corridors are understudied ecosystems across cities. Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e.g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Rapid urbanization and drastic land-use change have led to landscape fragmentation and ecological environment deterioration in the regions along the Grand Canal. Building an ecological network is an important means to improve the connectivity of habitat patches and carry out ecological protection and restoration of territorial space, which is of great significance to ensure regional biodiversity and ecological security. In this article, we took the Huaiyang Section of the Grand Canal (Huaiyang Canal) as the study area, used the ecosystem service assessment model, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and the landscape connectivity evaluation method to identify ecological sources, then used the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and the gravity model to extract and grade ecological corridors. Based on these, the ecological network was constructed by combining the identification method of ecological nodes and ecological breakpoints. The aim of this was to provide a reference for the ecological space optimization of Huaiyang Canal and even the entire Grand Canal, the formulation of an ecological protection plan, and the implementation of territorial space ecological restoration. The results showed that the spatial distribution of the water conservation service, soil conservation service, carbon sequestration service, and biodiversity conservation service were significantly different, and the level of ecosystem services showed a trend of continuous degradation from 1990 to 2018. There were 12 ecological source patches comprehensively identified by multiple methods, with a total area of 2007.06 km2. In terms of spatial distribution, large ecological source patches were mainly distributed in the central and western areas adjacent to the Grand Canal, while small ecological source patches were scattered in the eastern and southern border regions of the study area. The total length of ecological corridors was 373.84 km, of which the number of the primary ecological corridor, secondary ecological corridor, and tertiary ecological corridor were 9, 7, and 7, respectively, and the suitable width of the ecological corridor was 200–400 m. After optimization, the proposed ecological network was composed of 3 key ecological source patches, 9 important ecological source patches, 23 terrestrial corridors, 10 aquatic corridors, and 18 ecological nodes. Twenty-nine ecological breakpoints were key areas requiring ecological restoration. The overlap rate of the integrated ecosystem service change area and land-use change area was 99%, indicating that land-use change has a significant impact on regional ecosystem services. This study is of great significance for carrying out the ecological protection and restoration of the Huaiyang Canal and adjusting local land-use policies. It also provides a typical case demonstration for identifying an ecological network and formulating ecological restoration planning for other sections of the Grand Canal and cities along the canal.

TI  - Alien and native plants of urban river corridors: a study of riparian plant propagule dynamics along the river brent, greater london
AU  - Cockel, Christopher Paul
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This thesis investigates the dynamics of alien and native plant propagules in relation to the standing vegetation of the urban riparian corridor of the River Brent, London and also experimental results regarding the effectiveness of physical management of Impatiens glandulifera, one of the most common riparian alien invasive species in the United Kingdom. The study has shown that viable plant propagules are well-distributed within the top 10 cm of urban riparian soils, with no significant difference in propagule abundance or species richness between 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers or with distance (0-1, 1-2, 2-3 m) from the low flow channel. Urban riparian propagule banks are as species rich as those in more rural situations, but they contain a greater proportion of alien species (>20%). Soil propagule abundance was greater in the autumn than in the spring but species richness varied little. The propagule bank species composition varied seasonally, more unique alien species being recorded in the spring than in the autumn. Using artificial turf traps placed within the riparian zone, the deposition of fluvial sediment and viable propagules was investigated. Significant correlations between sediment weight and propagule abundance and richness indicated the important role of hydrochory in delivering viable propagules to the riparian zone, particularly during winter. Lower sediment weight and propagule species richness of summer samples and weaker correlation between sediment weight and propagule abundance and richness indicated the importance of local seed-rain in summer. Comparison of species composition of the propagule bank and standing vegetation demonstrated little relationship between the two, with far greater abundance of alien species in the propagule bank, the majority of which were not found in the local vegetation. The propagule bank also contained more species with long-lived persistent seeds, than was observed in the standing vegetation. Impatiens glandulifera was the most frequently occurring species in the standing vegetation, while Buddleja davidii was the most frequently occurring species in the propagule bank. Investigating experimental plots, the study found a strong negative relationship between percent cover of Impatiens glandulifera and of other species. Experimental pruning and removal of Impatiens glandulifera at six-week intervals over two years had a marked positive effect upon vegetation species richness and the percent cover of other species, particularly on heavily invaded plots, with removal showing a stronger effect than pruning

TI  - Population genomic inference of ecology, conservation, evolution, and demographic history of Atlantic seahorses and pipefishes (Syngnathidae)
AU  - Boehm, J.T.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In the Atlantic Ocean powerful directional ocean currents can play a significant role in the formation and persistence of marine species. Syngnathidae fishes have a sparse fossil record, high morphological plasticity, and many of these species are difficult to observe in the wild, therefore they frequently lack life history information and the status of regional lineages and species designations are often obscure. In this dissertation I explore the ecology, evolution, and conservation of primarily Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefish (Syngnathus) in four core chapters, using differing genetic datasets ranging from mitochondrial DNA to genome-wide RAD sequences. Most Synganthids have the potential to disperse passively by rafting on floating vegetation, and are direct developers, which is thought to limit their active mobility, yet many species have widespread distributions. The majority of genetic research on Syngnathids fishes has focused on Indo-Pacific species, however the Atlantic Ocean is home to dozens of species of pipefishes from nine genera and roughly 1/5th of the world's seahorses species. In Chapter 1, I use six loci to infer the species tree for all Atlantic seahorses and infer the demographic history and evolution of the "Hippocampus erectus complex." The results of this study support the establishment of an ancestral population of the H. erectus complex in the Americas, followed by the Amazon River outflow splitting it into Caribbean/North American H. erectus and South American H. patagonicus at a time of increased sedimentation and outflow. Following this split, colonization occurred across the Atlantic via the Gulf Stream currents with subsequent trans-Atlantic isolation. Based on the results of Chapter 1, the species H. erectus exhibited a panmictic genetic structure from Latin America to temperate New York waters. However, inhabitants of the temperate region are considered by some ecologists to be tropical vagrants that only arrive during warm seasons from the southern provinces and perish as temperatures decline. Contrary to the findings of Chapter 1, in Chapter 2, I use thousands of RADseq loci and show strong support that temperate inhabitants are genetically diverged from southern populations and are composed of an isolated and persistent ancestral gene pool. The aim of Chapter 3 is to investigate how major current forces as well as climatic and geographic processes have shaped the evolutionary and demographic history of western Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefishes (Syngnathus). This Chapter takes a comparative approach across five codistributed species (two seahorses and three pipefishes). Genomic patterns of subpopulation divergence and post-divergence gene flow may be shared amongst fish species with similar life history traits, however ecological differences (i.e., macroclimatic tolerance and rafting propensity) may impact the rates of gene exchange and/or isolation times between subpopulations. The result of this study show how directional ocean currents and the life history trait of rafting propensity impacts population divergence and connectivity, and predicts gene flow directionality and magnitude in four out of five of the focal taxa. Lastly in Chapter 4, I use a molecular forensics approach to track the U.S. dried seahorse trade. Due to global exploitation, the genus Hippocampus are the only fish to have all species listed under the Convention of International trade of endangered species (CITES). Millions of individuals are traded each year for the use in traditional Chinese medicine as well as for souvenirs and crafts. Using "DNA barcoding," while mentoring high school and undergraduate students, we identified and compared specimens collected from two primary U.S. dried seahorse end-markets: 1) traditional Chinese medicine and, 2) Internet and coastal souvenir retailers. The results of this study found a significant contrast in both the species composition and size of individuals being sold between each market.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Intense road development and urbanization have fragmented the natural landscapeacross coastal Southern California since the middle of the 20th century. As mitigationefforts, in 1992 the Natural Community Conservation Plan and Habitat Conservation Plans Iand II (NCCP&HCP I and II) allocated reserves and non-reserve open spaces to connectthese fragmented natural habitats and foster the coexistence of wildlife and people inOrange County. Here, I aim to evaluate the effectiveness of two established wildlifecorridors (the Sand Canyon Wash Corridor and the Bonita Creek Corridor) in southernOrange County, linking two large reserve areas (Figure 1). I conducted camera trappingsurveys by using 11 cameras placed along these two linkage corridors. Additionally, Iobtained more photographic data at 10 different camera stations within the Irvine RanchWater District (IRWD) San Joaquin Marsh & Wildlife Sanctuary. Then, I calculated RelativeAbundance Index (RAI) values based on the photographic capture rates of key vertebratespecies of concern for each location. I compared the current RAI values with values from astudy by Lyren et al. (2008) to illustrate the changes over a decade at three subsets oflocations. I also obtained wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) data from 2005 to 2019 from theCity of Irvine Local Animal Services. I found an average of two bobcat mortalities event peryear occurred until 2015. After 2015, no bobcat detection or roadkill mortality is observed.Additionally, the number of coyote detections has increased by almost 700% over a decadeat these locations. It is likely that this result reflects urban coyotes’ greater ability tofunction in a changing environment and (greater) resilience to anthropogenic effects. Thelong-term success of wildlife corridors requires understanding how the regional environment may influence species composition and potential use of these linkage elements reserve designs over extended periods.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - We investigate the growth dynamics of Greater London defined by the administrative boundary of the Greater London Authority, based on the evolution of its street network during the last two centuries. This is done by employing a unique dataset, consisting of the planar graph representation of nine time slices of Greater London's road network spanning 224 years, from 1786 to 2010. Within this time-frame, we address the concept of the metropolitan area or city in physical terms, in that urban evolution reveals observable transitions in the distribution of relevant geometrical properties. Given that London has a hard boundary enforced by its long standing green belt, we show that its street network dynamics can be described as a fractal space-filling phenomena up to a capacitated limit, whence its growth can be predicted with a striking level of accuracy. This observation is confirmed by the analytical calculation of key topological properties of the planar graph, such as the topological growth of the network and its average connectivity. This study thus represents an example of a strong violation of Gibrat's law. In particular, we are able to show analytically how London evolves from a more loop-like structure, typical of planned cities, toward a more tree-like structure, typical of self-organized cities. These observations are relevant to the discourse on sustainable urban planning with respect to the control of urban sprawl in many large cities which have developed under the conditions of spatial constraints imposed by green belts and hard urban boundaries.

AB  - Land use and landcover change alter the ability of habitat networks to maintain viable species populations. While their effects on the quality, amount and patterns of landcover patches are commonly studied, how they affect ecological processes, such as predation on focal species remains neglected. This macroecological study tests the hypothesis that predator assemblages are affected by land use intensity linked to different socio-economic contexts. We measured the distribution and abundance of two avian predator groups (generalist corvid birds and specialist raptors), and proxy variables that mirror their food resources, at three spatial scales in northern Europe’s West and East. In total, we made 900 survey counts for avian predators and their resources in six landcover strata throughout five landscapes and analyzed their relationships. The abundance of omnivorous corvid birds was associated with the number of anthropogenic food resources. Thus, corvid birds were most common in the urban and agricultural landcovers, and where forest cover was low. Corvid bird abundance, and availability of their resources, increased with increasing land use intensity. Raptors were less abundant than corvid birds and most common in semi-natural grasslands. The number of raptor species increased with decreasing land use intensity. This study shows that the abundance and composition of avian predator species must be understood to maintain functional habitat networks.

AB  - With the advancement of urbanization, the stress on the green infrastructure around the urban agglomeration has intensified, which causes severe ecological problems. The uncertainty of urban growth makes it difficult to achieve effective protection only by setting protection red lines and other rigid measures. It is of practical significance to optimize the resilience of the stressed green infrastructure. To this end, we explore a scenario simulation analysis method for the resilience management of green infrastructure under stress. This research applies artificial neural network cellular automata to simulate the impacts of the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration expansion on the green infrastructure in 2030 in three scenarios: no planning control, urban planning control, and ecological protection planning control. Based on the analysis, we identify four green infrastructure areas under stress and formulate resilience management measures, respectively. The results show that: (1) The distribution pattern of green infrastructure under stress is different in three scenarios. Even in the scenario of ecological protection planning and control, urban growth can easily break through the ecological protection boundary; (2) Residential, industrial, and traffic facility land are the main types of urban land causing green infrastructure stress, while forest, shrub, and wetland are the main types of the stressed green infrastructure; (3) Efficient protection of green infrastructure and the management of the urban growth boundary should be promoted by resilient management measures such as urban planning adjustment, regulatory detailed planning, development strength control and setting up the ecological protection facilities for the stressed green infrastructure areas of the planning scenarios and the no-planning control scenarios, for the areas to be occupied by urban land, and for the important ecological corridors. The results of this study provide an empirical foundation for formulating policies and the methods of this study can be applied to urban ecological planning and green infrastructure management practice in other areas as well.

AB  - Insects are key components of urban ecological networks and are greatly impacted by anthropogenic activities. Yet, few studies have examined how insect functional groups respond to changes to urban vegetation associated with different management actions. We investigated the response of herbivorous and predatory heteropteran bugs to differences in vegetation structure and diversity in golf courses, gardens and parks. We assessed how the species richness of these groups varied amongst green space types, and the effect of vegetation volume and plant diversity on trophic- and species-specific occupancy. We found that golf courses sustain higher species richness of herbivores and predators than parks and gardens. At the trophic- and species-specific levels, herbivores and predators show strong positive responses to vegetation volume. The effect of plant diversity, however, is distinctly species-specific, with species showing both positive and negative responses. Our findings further suggest that high occupancy of bugs is obtained in green spaces with specific combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. The challenge for managers is to boost green space conservation value through actions promoting synergistic combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. Tackling this conservation challenge could provide enormous benefits for other elements of urban ecological networks and people that live in cities.

Traveling through heterogeneous landscapes might be particularly risky for amphibians. Understanding how these species perceive their environment and how they move in heterogeneous habitats is an essential step in explaining metapopulation dynamics and can be important for predicting species’ responses to climate change and for conservation policy and management.Methods Using an experimental approach, the present study focused on the movement behavior (crossing speed and number of stops) on different substrates mimicking landscape components (human-made and natural substrates) in two amphibian species contrasting in locomotion mode: the common toad (Bufo bufo), a hopping and burrowing anuran and the marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), a walking salamander. We tested the hypothesis that species reaction to substrate is dependent on specific ecological requirements or locomotion modes because of morphological and behavioral differences.Results In both species, substrate type influenced individual crossing speed, with individuals moving faster on soil than on concrete substrate. We also demonstrated that long-legged individuals moved faster than individuals with short legs. In both species, the number of stops was higher in females than in males. In common toads, the number of stops did not vary between substrates tested, whereas in marbled newts the number of stops was higher on concrete than on soil substrate.Discussion We highlighted that concrete substrate (mimicking roads) negatively affect the crossing speed of both studied species, with an effect potentially higher in marbled newts. Our findings corroborate negative effects of such heterogeneous landscapes on movement behavior of two amphibian species, which may have implications for the dynamics of metapopulations.

TI  - Ecological evaluation on and plant disposition characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai
AU  - Wang, Ping Xu
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Based on theoretical analysis and argumentation, comprehensive principles for evaluating the green land of parks and the plant disposition were established, including high biodiversity, harmonious intra-species and interspecies relationship with reasonable ecological structure, multiple functions of ecological service, harmonious human-nature relationship, and the self-maintenance, self-adjustment, self-cycling, self-renewal, self-perfection and self-upgrading. Seven principles were put forward for evaluating the plant disposition, including paying attentions to the habits and interspecific relationship of plants, spatial disposition of plants, temporal disposition of plants, aesthetic effects of plant disposition, comprehensive application of pose, texture, color, aroma, sound, light and so on, humanities and artistic conception, and the harmony between plants and other landscape elements.According to the field investigations in the green lands of 80 parks in Shanghai, and the theoretical analysis, the characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai was discussed, which included the following aspects: the inheritance of plant disposition techniques of classical Chinese gardens, the absorption of advanced theories of modern western parks, the contemporary developments in the design of green lands of parks in Shanghai, and the scarcity of animal biodiversity. As to the third characteristic, the developments referred to the increase of plant biodiversity, the changes in life form spectrum, and the diversity of ecological structure and functions. The flora and species composition of trees, the frequency of commonly used trees and the applications of native trees in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were analyzed. The composition of native species in the green lands of parks in Shanghai according to families and genera was analyzed and compared with those in the whole area in Shanghai. The current situation of life form spectrum in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed and compared with that in the regional vegetation in Tiantong National Forest Park. The variety of structure and function of plant disposition in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed in terms of  tree height, light and soil requirements, resistibility to poisonous air. To solve the scarcity of animal biodiversity, some suggestions for the attraction and protection of wild animals were put forward, and the disposition of bird plants and nectar plants in the community were recommended.Some ecological countermeasures for the future development in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were discussed. Parks as the pool of biodiversity and the place for animal, plant and microbe to rest, reproduce, assembly and diffuse, should act as nodes of urban landscape ecosystem, so as to maximize the ecological effects at the scale of urban landscape ecosystem. Outside the parks, the other green lands in the city should serve as the corridors between the landscape nodes, the biodiversity patches.

AU  - Moffatt, Shaun Frederick Hermistow
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Extensive landscape modification from surrounding land use has led to the decline of riparian forests across North America. An urban-rural gradient was used to assess the impact of land use on riparian forests along the Assiniboine River. Above ground flora and seed bank were examined and species- and guild-level indicators of disturbance identified. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to land use, and included urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forests. Changes in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to landscape level measures of disturbance that included the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. These results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess the impacts of land use along urban-rural gradients. Opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and be used to select and monitor forests for further protection or active management.

TI  - Testing Biogeographic Predictions Derived from Quaternary Island Connectivity Using Genomic Data from Mammals in the Southern Philippines
AU  - Olson, Karen V.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Island archipelagos have long piqued the attention of evolutionary biologists interested in biogeographical patterns implying processes of diversification in terrestrial vertebrates. One model island archipelago, the Philippines, has emerged as an ideal geographical theater for testing hypotheses related to a 30 year biogeographical paradigm, derived from climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene and species pump expectations. To test predictions from the Pleistocene Aggregate Island Complex (PAIC) Paradigm, we generated the first ever Rad-seq datasets of thousands of genomewide loci from forest mammals restricted to the southern portions of the archipelago. We used genomic population-level statistics and demographic model selection techniques to test assumptions of the PAIC Paradigm and predicted differences among focal taxa based on life history and ecological preferences. Predictably, our analyses revealed pronounced differences in historical population demographics of forest rodents and understory bats in terms of geographical structure of populations and gene flow among populations, suggesting taxon-specific response to climatic and environmental variation across recent evolutionary timescales. In contrast to previous inferences derived from single-locus phylogeography of the same populations, our new genomic data warn against uncritical assumptions of highly divergent, geographically structured island populations. They also suggest that individual, species-specific, idiosyncratic response of small forest mammal lineages to the geographical and environmental template may become more prevalent in structured island systems, in strong contrast to the popularly hypothesized shared mechanisms of diversification that have been so prevalent over the last century.

TI  - An integrated assessment of disturbed plant communities near the future Mackenzie Valley pipeline route, Northwest Territories, Canada
AU  - Elliott, Milissa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The impact of natural resource extraction, and subsequent transportation to market, is hypothesized to have consequences on the plant community structure of the western Canadian Arctic. The Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline project will create new transportation and disturbance corridors and it is expected that this will facilitate the movement of introduced species northward. As a part of the IPY-GAPS project, an assessment of plant community composition among different types of disturbance was conducted within the vicinity of four communities in the Northwest Territories (Fort Simpson, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells, and Inuvik) from June – August 2008. Results indicate that the prevalence of introduced species was significantly higher in close proximity to roads, urban centres, and existing pipelines. These disturbance types had greater richness and cover of introduced species than seismic lines. The highest proportion of introduced species was found in Fort Simpson, especially along transportation corridors. The percent cover and occurrence of introduced species were found to be significantly higher along transects within 1-5 m from these roads compared to 10-20 m away. A community consultation survey was also completed on the perceptions of community members held toward the idea of invasive alien species (IAS), their willingness to participate in monitoring programs for IAS, and what role they wanted the government to play in monitoring IAS. The results of the survey suggested that people were willing to report the presence of an IAS, but would not use a website to submit that information. Furthermore, the concept of using an incentive to gather support and increase participation in a monitoring program was seen as unnecessary due to the participants' inherent connection to the land. The results of these studies suggest that future expansion of disturbances, such as roads, pipelines, and enlarged urban areas may increase the prevalence and number of introduced species within northern communities and that managing these impacts will require the development of a community based action plan geared towards the social and cultural background of each affected community.

AB  - Genders differ in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about plants, but how gender influences TEK sharing is still poorly understood. Here, we examined how gender is associated with the diversity, transmission, and structure of TEK. We tested whether women and men differ in terms of plant knowledge (species richness, α-diversity), knowledge heterogeneity (β-diversity), and in the structure of social-ecological networks they form. The study was carried out in a suburban community in the city of Ouro Preto, Southeastern, Brazil. Using the snow-ball technique, semi-structured interviews, guided tours, and participant observation, we gathered information from 33 women and 33 men in the community. We collected information about their culture, social-economic profiles, and plant knowledge from which we identified 291 plant species in 10 use categories. Overall, our results indicated that the cognition and sharing of ethnobotanical knowledge are structured by gender. Women rated better in their plant knowledge repertory (greater α-diversity), while plant knowledge among men was more heterogeneous (greater β-diversity), suggesting less information sharing among them. We observed that the network among women is more connected, exhibited greater information sharing, with a greater number of central individuals, who likely provide the cohesion and maintenance of TEK in the community. Our findings indicate how social-ecological networks can provide insights and information to unveil social patterns of knowledge transmission. Understanding how TEK is fostered and shared among community members will favor better planning of ethnobotanical studies, as well as inform decision-makers about strategies for the conservation of plant TEK.

T2  - Movement Ecology
AB  - Background Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour.Methods We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada.Results Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario.Conclusions Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.

AB  - The spatial distribution of biodiversity has specific patterns in urban environments. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological profiles of plants in man-made traffic corridors and natural river corridors in the city of Vantaa. The number of corridor species represented 76.3 % of Vantaa's total flora, even though corridors covered only 2.7 % of the city area. Corridor plants are mostly generalist species with wide ecological niches, and have ruderal and competitor life-strategies, while plants without occurrences in corridors are habitat specialists and species with narrow ecological niches. The conservation value of non-corridor habitats arises from the rarity of species, and the representation of the original boreal nature, while corridors contribute to the total diversity of species. The potential of corridors in urban conservation has not been fully appreciated.

AB  - Background Mobile animals transport nutrients and propagules across habitats, and are crucial for the functioning of food webs and for ecosystem services. Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes.Methods Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type.Results We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity.Conclusions Habitat specialization in urban-acclimated wildlife could reduce the exchange of propagules and nutrients between urban and natural areas, which has consequences both for beneficial effects of connectivity such as gene flow and for detrimental effects such as the spread of contaminants or pathogens.

AB  - Studies on bird community patterns and processes in Hangzhou heterogeneous urban landscape habitats (urban woodlots, street tree strips, western mountain, ecotone and wetlands etc.) were carried out during 1997 ~ 1999. The main results are as follows:1. 150 species were recorded.Based on sensitivities to urbanization and edge, and distributing in how many kinds of habitat, they were divided into 12 urban landscape habitat distributional guilds.2. The distributions of birds over urban woodlots were nonrandom. There was imperfect nested subset pattern in community assemblages. The heterogeneity between woodlots was the cause of the departure from perfect nested subset pattern.3.The species-area relationships of woodlot bird communities were the results of action of multi-factors, which included: the effect of different sample size (under the same sample size, the small woodlots have higher species density than large one), the habitat diversity (the diversity of tree species was the uppermost influencing factor), disturbance factors, species factors and the effect of different research scales etc.4. There were substantial turnover and distinct seasonal changes in woodlot bird communities. The overall stability of woodlot bird community was low. 5. Street tree strips had extensive ecological functions, they served birds not only as the roosting and feeding sites, but also the corridor of movement.6. The characteristics of distributions of bird communities from the edges of the city zone to the forest interior were misty. Species number, diversity and abundance had a great fluctuation along the linear space. They were correlated with the random distributions of heterogeneous features in western mountain.7. Edge effect could result in not only increasing of diversity, but also decreasing of diversity, it depended on the characteristics of the edge. Edge effect was transformable in time.8. With urban expansion, rare and interior species, waterbirds and insectivore declined. Meanwhile,some species showed limited adaptation to urbanization.9. Landscape habitats were correlative in space, and the factors influencing communities usually be at different scales. The diversity at definite scale correlated nearly with the heterogeneity at a definite scale.10. Urban bird community in Hangzhou was cognized as a landscape metacommunity. It possessed three characteristics: 1)  The habitat was landscape habitat composed of multi-patches; 2) All local communities were correlative and interdependent; 3) There were individual flows between local communities.

T2  - International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning
AB  - In the contemporary debate about key issues of urban science (sustainability, environment, governance, etc.) resilience has a fundamental role. It is defined as the ability of a complex system to cope with external stresses through adaptation and mutation strategies and to return to an equilibrium state (not necessarily equal to the original one). In particular, ecosystem resilience is based on the concepts of diversity (biodiversity), redundancy (ecological variability), cycles of adaptation (multiple equilibrium states), and interaction between spatial scales (hierarchy) and temporal (activation of different times responses). In an urban context with high soil sealing, such as historical centers, it is essential to find new methods and application techniques that will be able to integrate the use of natural solutions with artificial ones and increasing ecosystem resilience and urban ecological quality. In fact, in these contexts, the percentage of permeable and green public areas available is not capable of performing ecosystem functions: so, it is necessary to act on private property through green punctual interventions (such as green roofs and walls), that may become fundamental elements of the municipal ecological network. In fact, these actions bring benefits from several points of view (environmental, economic, building comfort, etc.) The aim of the paper is to study the relationship between technical aspects and urban policies, and, in particular, to resolve the main question: how to encourage private owners to invest in green interventions for improving buildings’ efficiency and environmental quality? In this process it is important to define sustainable policies acting on private property that consider both individual and global interests. Further, the article focuses on different case studies and examples taken from the United States with the objective to define similar policies in the Italian context.

TI  - Long-term Effects of Fire Hazard Reduction Treatments in the Southern Cascades and Northern Sierra Nevada, California
AU  - Chiono, Lindsay Aney
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Treating wildland fuels to reduce wildfire hazards has become a primary focus of contemporary forest management, particularly in the wildland-urban interface. The specific objectives of treatment are diverse, but in general, treatments address accumulated surface fuels, the fuel ladders that carry fire into the forest canopy, and surface and canopy fuel continuity.  This dissertation uses a chronosequence of treated stands to examine the temporal influence of treatment on forest structure, the understory plant community, and wildfire hazard.  The first chapter examines the effects of fuels reduction treatment on stand structure, overstory species composition, and ground and surface fuels. The stand structures and reduced surface fuel loads created by fuels modification are temporary, yet few studies have assessed the lifespan of treatment effects. The structural legacies of treatment were still present in the oldest treatment sites. Treatments reduced site occupancy (stand density and basal area) and increased quadratic mean diameter by approximately 50%. The contribution of shade-tolerant true firs to stand density was also reduced by treatment. Other stand characteristics, particularly timelag fuel loads, seedling density, and shrub cover, exhibited substantial variability, and differences between treatment age classes and between treatment and control groups were not statistically significant.   The second chapter evaluates fuel treatment longevity based on potential wildfire behavior and effects on vegetation. Forest managers must divide scarce resources between fuel treatment maintenance, which is necessary to retain low hazard conditions in treated stands, and the construction of new treatments. Yet the most basic questions concerning the lifespan of treatment effectiveness have rarely been engaged in the literature. In this study, field-gathered fuels and vegetation data were used to aid fuel model selection and to parameterize a fire behavior and effects model, Fuels Management Analyst Plus. In addition, a semi-qualitative, semi-quantitative protocol was applied to assess ladder fuel hazard in field sampling plots. Untreated sites exhibited fire behavior that would challenge wildfire suppression efforts, and projected overstory mortality was considerable. In contrast, estimated fire behavior and severity were low to moderate in even the oldest fuel treatments, those sampled 8-26 years after treatment implementation. Findings indicate that in the forest types characteristic of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades, treatments for wildfire hazard reduction retain their effectiveness for more than 10-15 years and possibly beyond a quarter century.  Fuel treatment activities disturb the forest floor, increase resource availability, and may introduce non-native plant propagules to forest stands. Non-native plant invasions can have profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function. For these reasons, there is concern that treatment for fire hazard reduction may promote invasion by exotic species. Several short-term studies have shown small increases in non-native abundance as a result of treatment, but the long-term effects have rarely been addressed in the literature. The final chapter examines treatment effects on the understory plant community and on cover of the forest floor, as mineral soil exposure has been linked to invasion. Regression tree analysis provided insights into the influence of treatment and site characteristics on these variables. Treatments increased forb and graminoid cover, but temporal trends in abundance were opposite. An initial increase in forb cover in the most recently treated sites was followed by a gradual decline, while mean graminoid cover was highest in the oldest treatments. Shrubs dominated live plant abundance. Shrub cover showed few temporal trends, but was negatively associated with canopy cover. Mineral soil exposure was increased by treatment and declined slowly over time, remaining elevated in the oldest treatments. Non-native plant species were very rare in the treatment sites sampled in this study. Despite the availability of bare mineral soil and the proximity of transportation corridors, a source of non-native propagules, non-natives were recorded in only 2% of sampling plots. This study suggests that forest disturbance associated with treatment for hazardous fuels reduction may not produce significant invasions in these forest types.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - [...]the proposed arrangement satisfies the multi-scale perspective advocated for GI planning [102,103] by demonstrating the viability of (a) defining priority objectives at relatively broad landscape scale, corresponding to the metropolitan/regional decision level, (b) choosing priority spatial location at an intermediate countryside scale, corresponding to the municipal/sub-municipal decision level, and (c) outlining priority management actions at site scale, corresponding to the farm/field decision level.First of all, the documentation regarding how much the condition of species, ecosystems and physical environment has been impaired by urban sprawl may give priority to the application of municipal ecological network measures in the site, speed up the actual institution of the agricultural and river corridor parks, and trigger the preservation of traditional and sustainable agricultural practices for addressing the rules of the Aniene River management plan.[...]the proposed multi-step and multi-scale framework (i) supports GI multifunctionality, by means of prioritisation of multiple objectives according to main demand for biodiversity and ES and in compliance with wide-area land planning tools; (ii) promotes the valorisation of traditional agricultural landscapes, by means of prioritisation of GI location according to co-occurring critical conditions and pressures on agroecosystems and in compliance with local development and management plans; and (iii) fosters the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices, by means of prioritisation of restoration and conservation actions according to the combined capacity of planned GI components to benefit biodiversity and provide the desired ES and in compliance with conditionality measures of the current EU agricultural policy.[...]main limitations of the work, which will be addressed in the near future, are related to the top-down approach adopted throughout the planning process, to the lack of comprehensive analyses of the potential disservices provided by land-sharing interventions, and to the assessment of GI benefits that overlooks a more exhaustive definition of monetary and social values.

TI  - Mapping Landscape Potential for Supporting Green Infrastructure: The Case of a Watershed in Turkey

T2  - Land
AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) is a strategic planning approach that can contribute to solutions for ecological, social, and environmental problems. GI also aims to conserve natural and semi-natural landscapes and enhance ecological networks. Within the scope of spatial planning, urban and rural landscape units can be integrated through GI planning. In this study, we propose a method to calculate the landscape potential and map GI in the lower Büyük Menderes River Basin, Turkey. We used landscape character assessment (LCA) to identify the landscape typology, which was one of the key steps for determining the landscape potential. Three thematic maps were produced and overlaid in ArcMap 10.7. A map showing the spatial distributions of 71 landscape types was created by means of LCA. Then, the landscape types were assessed according to defined criteria, and finally, GI of the study area was mapped. This study found that high-quality landscape types were located in the middle, northern, and eastern parts of the lower Büyük Menderes River Basin, rather than in the protected areas. Moreover, 68 of the 71 landscape types were present in the GI map. The findings show the necessity of including the landscape potential concept in conservation strategies. Thus, this paper provides a reference guideline for mapping GI as a contributor to nature conservation and spatial planning strategies.

AB  - Urbanization causes tremendous pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems at the global scale. China is among the countries undergoing the fastest urban expansion. For a long time, ecological environment protection has not been a priority in China’s urban planning process. Current urban growth optimization research has some limitations regarding the selection of more scientific ecological constraint indicators and the interaction between urban expansion and ecological factors. This paper at first aimed to establish a reasonable comprehensive biodiversity constraint indicator based on the indicators of net primary productivity, habitat connectivity and habitat quality, and then conducted a case study in Beijing and compared biodiversity loss and urban growth patterns under different developing situations. The integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs model and GIS-related methods were used to obtain biodiversity and ecological spatial distribution layers. Then an ecological priority-oriented urban growth simulation method was proposed to search for minimum biodiversity loss. The results showed that the important biodiversity security areas were mostly distributed in the western part of the study area and that the ecological degradation in 2000 had a radial pattern and was well in line with the urban construction and ring road distribution patterns. Meanwhile, biodiversity loss with the biodiversity constraint was much less than actual urban growth in 2000–2010. Under the guidance of ecological optimization, urban growth in the research results reflects decentralized and multi-center spatial development characteristics. This type of urban growth not only provides a new model for breaking the inertia of urban sprawl but also proposes ‘biodiversity security’ as an applicable regulatory tool for urban planning and space governance reforming.

TI  - Arthropods in Linear Elements : Occurence, Behaviour and Conservation Management
AU  - Noordijk, Jinze
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Intensification of agriculture and urbanisation have caused large‐scale destruction and fragmentation of natural and semi‐natural areas in the Netherlands, with a considerable loss of biodiversity. As a consequence, the conservation of the biodiversity in the remaining small landscape elements has become increasingly urgent. This thesis presents the results of our study of arthropods in (mainly) roadside verges. The diversity of species proved to be considerable, with several rare and threatened, as well as many specialised species. These arthropod assemblages should be taken into account during the management of roadside verges. Our research aimed at a better understanding of the distribution and ecology of these species, which enables us to recommend appropriate measures for their conservation. Roadside verges are often covered by grassland vegetation and need to be mown in order to retain a high biodiversity. We studied ground beetles, weevils, ants and epigeic spiders in experimental plots with five different mowing regimes: no mowing; mowing once a year in autumn with or without removal of the cuttings; mowing twice a year, in early summer and autumn, with and without removal of the cuttings. Plots were located on three different verges which represented a plant productivity gradient, ranging from low‐productive, through medium‐productive to high‐productive grassland. The different mowing regimes had hardly any effect on the biodiversity at the low‐productive site, whereas at the medium‐productive and high‐productive sites, mowing twice a year with removal of the cuttings resulted in the highest arthropod species‐richness and abundance. A second experiment carried out on the medium‐productive verge showed that mowing twice a year with removal of the cuttings also gave the highest values for flower richness, flower diversity and abundance of flower‐visiting insects. Therefore such verges also had the highest number of visits to flowers by insects. On low‐productive verges, yearly mowing is not necessary. However, to ensure a high diversity of arthropods on medium‐productive to high‐ productive grassland verges, a regime of mowing twice a year with removal of cuttings is recommended for the largest part of the verge. Small patches of vegetation should be left intact to provide a refuge for arthropods in the period just after mowing when their resources are otherwise almost absent. This type of rotational management will probably improve their chance of survival.  Sandy verges can be important to xerophilic and thermophilic arthropods. These species are in decline due to the fragmentation and decreasing quality of heathland nature reserves. In the past, habitats for these species were numerous in the roadside verges in the Veluwe area. However, now vegetation succession is causing them to disappear and restoration management is urgently needed. We sampled arthropods in patches of grey hair‐grass (Corynephorus canescens) vegetation on the verges, and found that there were fewer stenotopic ground beetles and spiders than in similar vegetation patches in nature reserves. This seems attributable to differences in ‘habitat quality’, namely a denser cover of grass in the verges, as well as more herbaceous plants and tree seedlings. Moreover, any suitable vegetation patches are smaller. In addition, we sampled ground‐dwelling and flying ground beetles in open sandy roadside verges and newly‐created linear forest clearings. The occurrence of teneral individuals and flightless species indicate that verges may function as ‘habitat corridors’. In the forest clearings, teneral individuals were rare, but flying beetles were very abundant: more than twice as many individuals were caught here than in nature reserves and on roadside verges. This indicates that the clearings are used particularly by dispersing ground beetles, and thus function mainly as ‘movement corridors’. To make conditions more suitable for xerophilic and thermophilic species in roadside verges, we recommend restoring nutrient‐poor zones and recreating pioneer conditions. Subsequently, a regular management of selectively removing encroaching vegetation should be installed. If this is done over large distances, roadside verges can act as habitat corridors. Linear clearings in forests, situated between separate heathland habitat areas can help species bridge short distances between them. In this way, ecological networks can be created in highly fragmented heathland landscapes. Being relatively straight and narrow, roadside verges have an enormous distance of edge biotopes. We therefore studied edge effects on insect species to obtain more insight into how a verge functions as a habitat. We looked at the effects of the border between the vegetation and asphalt of the road on the direction of movement of two ground beetle species. The road appeared to be a barrier for these species and its presence caused movement patterns parallel to the asphalt. In another study, the number of flying ground beetles increased in linear forest clearings, probably because they are directed by forest edges when dispersing. Both studies provide extra evidence that roadside verges may act as ecological corridors. In addition, we found that flying ants used forest edges to find each other for mating, while their nests were located elsewhere. All these results indicate a substantial effect of edges on insect behaviour and their occurrence. This knowledge can be applied in conservation management. Roadside verges are distinctive biotopes with anthropogenic disturbances and edge effects that may negatively influence arthropods. However, as roads are an inherent, inevitable part of the densely populated Netherlands landscape, we choose here to emphasise the positive aspects of these linear habitats. Our investigations show that arthropod communities of high conservation interest occur in roadside verges, that verges can be used to create ecological networks, that abrupt biotope edges in verges act as a guide for dispersing insects and are sometimes favoured as a mating site, and that a regular applied mowing scheme provides valuable conditions for arthropods of hay‐meadows.

AU  - McGuckin, Christopher P.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A spatial distribution model was developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model was validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared to the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity.The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.

TI  - Multiscale remote sensing analysis to monitor riparian and upland semiarid vegetation
AU  - Nguyen, Uyen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The health of natural vegetation communities is of concern due to observed changes in the climatic-hydrological regime and land cover changes particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Monitoring vegetation at multi temporal and spatial scales can be the most informative approach for detecting change and inferring causal agents of change and remediation strategies. Riparian communities are tightly linked to annual stream hydrology, ground water elevations and sediment transport. These processes are subject to varying magnitudes of disturbance overtime and are candidates for multi-scale monitoring.  My first research objective focused on the response of vegetation in the Upper San Pedro River, Arizona, to reduced base flows and climate change. I addressed the correlation between riparian vegetation and hydro-climate variables during the last three decades in one of the remaining undammed rivers in the southwestern U.S. Its riparian forest is threatened by the diminishing base flows, attributed by different studies either to increases in evapotranspiration (ET) due to conversion of grasslands to mesquite shrublands in the adjacent uplands, or to increased regional groundwater pumping to serve growing populations in surrounding urban areas and or to some interactions of those causes. Landsat 5 imagery was acquired for pre- monsoon period, when riparian trees had leafed out but before the arrival of summer monsoon rains in July. The result has showed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) had significant decreases which positively correlated to river flows, which decreased over the study period, and negatively correlated with air temperatures, which have increased by about 1.4°C from 1904 to the present. The predictions from other studies that decreased river flows could negatively impact the riparian forest were supported by this study. The pre-monsoon Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) average values in the adjacent uplands also decreased over thirty years and were correlated with the previous year's annual precipitation. Hence an increase in ET in the uplands did not appear to be responsible for the decrease in river flows in this study, leaving increased regional groundwater pumping as a feasible alternative explanation for decreased flows and deterioration of the riparian forest.  The second research objective was to develop a new method of classification using very high-resolution aerial photo to map riparian vegetation at the species level in the Colorado River Ecosystem, Grand Canyon area, Arizona. Ground surveys have showed an obvious trend in which non-native saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) has replaced native vegetation over time. Our goal was to develop a quantitative mapping procedure to detect changes in vegetation as the ecosystem continues to respond to hydrological and climate changes. Vegetation mapping for the Colorado River Ecosystem needed an updated database map of the area covered by riparian vegetation and an indicator of species composition in the river corridor. The objective of this research was to generate a new riparian vegetation map at species level using a supervised image classification technique for the purpose of patch and landscape change detection. A new classification approach using multispectral images allowed us to successfully identify and map riparian species coverage the over whole Colorado River Ecosystem, Grand Canyon area. The new map was an improvement over the initial 2002 map since it reduced fragmentation from mixed riparian vegetation areas. The most dominant tree species in the study areas is saltcedar (Tamarix spp.). The overall accuracy is 93.48% and the kappa coefficient is 0.88. The reference initial inventory map was created using 2002 images to compare and detect changes through 2009.The third objective of my research focused on using multiplatform of remote sensing and ground calibration to estimate the effects of vegetation, land use patterns and water cycles. Climate change, hydrological and human uses are also leading to riparian, upland, grassland and crop vegetation changes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, particularly in the arid and semi arid ecosystems, which are more sensitive to changes in water availability than humid ecosystems. The objectives of these studies from the last three articles were to evaluate the effect of water balance on vegetation indices in different plant communities based on relevant spatial and temporal scales. The new methodology of estimating water requirements using remote sensing data and ground calibration with flux tower data has been successfully tested at a variety sites, a sparse desert shrub environment as well as mixed riparian and cropland systems and upland vegetation in the arid and semi-arid regions. The main finding form these studies is that vegetation-index methods have to be calibrated with ground data for each new ecosystem but once calibrated they can accurately scale ET over wide areas and long time spans.

TI  - Landscape ecological analysis and assessment in an urbanising environment: Forest birds as biodiversity indicators
AU  - Mortberg, Ulla
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, infrastructure, land use changes and other developments must be considered on a landscape and regional scale. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity on a landscape scale, and for evaluating the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity on forest bird diversity in an urban-rural gradient. The purpose of the analyses was to develop knowledge and methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and assessments in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional scales. The study area was situated in and around Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, covering the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Data on breeding forest birds were collected through bird censuses in an urban-suburban gradient. In order to embrace also the peri-urban areas for a more complete urban-rural gradient, data on two fragmentation-sensitive forest grouse species were obtained through a questionnaire to hunters in the whole study area. Response variables in the analyses were forest bird species richness and diversity, relative species richness and occurrence of single sensitive species like selected sedentary forest birds, including the forest grouse species, and red list species. Habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were analysed using available data on abiotic conditions, including urban disturbances, and vegetation in geographical information systems. In addition, a field study on vegetation structure and composition was performed in a subset of the smaller sample sites. Relationships between the response variables and habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were explored using multivariate statistics. Further, for some models, spatial dependencies were quantified and accounted for. When habitat models were retrieved, they were used for spatial predictions of habitat suitability. They were also applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on sensitive species. In the urban-rural gradient, the forest structure and composition changed, so that in more urban areas, coniferous forest on rich soils, wet forests and wetlands became less abundant and more scattered.

TI  - Ecology of coyotes (Canis latrans) in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan
AU  - Dodge, William B., Jr.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Coyote distribution and habitat use, diet and foraging behavior, and space use patterns were investigated in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan. We found evidence of coyotes on 24 of 30 (80%) suburban and 7 of 11 (64%) urban plots. Overall fifty-eight percent of coyote evidence was found within edge habitats, with den sites and tracks the only types of evidence found strictly in interior habitats. Land cover around evidence points included more wooded land cover than expected in suburban areas, suggesting the importance of tree cover for coyote occupancy, and more open space and wooded land cover than expected in urban areas, highlighting their avoidance of heavily populated areas. Coyote diet was assessed through identification of remains of food items recovered in coyote scat. White-tailed deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, and small rodents were the most consumed prey in both urban and suburban areas. Coyote consumption of white-tailed deer biomass was 7.2% greater than expected in suburban areas and 10.0% less than expected in urban areas and the difference was significant (P< 0.004). More white-tailed deer, raccoon, and woodchuck biomass was consumed compared to other studies, likely due to high use of road-kill. In suburban areas, coyote selection for road-killed white-tailed deer was positive regardless of white-tailed deer or rabbit abundance. Coyotes in urban areas used a foraging strategy that incorporated both prey selection and switching, with no strong discernable pattern. Radio-telemetry technology was used to gather relocations of coyotes for analysis of home range and cores areas frequented by coyotes. Smaller home ranges were made up of greater proportions of urban land than natural land cover, although there was variation. Core areas were dominated by relatively large patches of natural land cover and had greater connectivity compared to home range areas. Radio-telemetry data suggested that coyotes were selective in their use of space, avoiding urban land in favor of natural land cover.

AB  - Beijing has an enormous transportation challenge: to relieve the extreme congestion that has arisen, largely due to overpopulation. To meet this challenge, the city administration has decided to extend its territory; a new city will be planned and built. This new city, Xiongan, will reduce the burden on the capital. A new high-speed railway (HSR) line is designed to transport millions of people every day within less than an hour. This study applies the potential of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and multicriteria methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE II), to determine the best alternative of transportation for the new high-speed railway line between Beijing and Xiongan, comparing different ones. The methodology consists of two stages. In the first stage remote sensing datasets such as ASTER DEM and LANDSAT images and GIS software such as ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS have been used to determine settlement distribution, station location, elevation model, slope percentage, vegetation percentage, and route alignment for a new high-speed railway line for better understanding of its spatial distribution pattern over the study area. The second phase of the study focusing on assessing the various alternatives of transportation has been determined, and three approaches to choosing the best alternative have been introduced. In the paper we examine criteria associated with travel and economic criteria: travel time, the number of train stops, public satisfaction with transport, the number of seats per day, connectivity, operating costs, profit, and the payback period. Six alternatives of transportation have been studied. The stops in Guan and stations in the metro’s rings have been investigated. In the second stage, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE II methods have been used to select the best alternative. The first approach uses only criteria related to the trip, as the criterion to choose the best alternative is the maximum of the net outranking flows by PROMETHEE II method; the second approach applies two independent criteria: the ratio of normalized operating costs and the normalized net outranking flows, and the ratio of the normalized payback period and the normalized net outranking flows; the third approach includes all defined criteria, and the criterion of choosing the best alternative is the maximum of net outranking flows as calculated by the PROMETHEE II method. The approaches have been analyzed with the purpose of comparing the results. The result indicates that it is expedient to have a station in Guan, which will increase the connection and connectivity among the cities while providing fast mobility options for a large number of inhabitants of Guan city. Furthermore, the result from Remote Sensing and GIS analysis demonstrates that the proposed high-speed railway line will be environmentally sustainable and is economically/socially feasible and that it will certainly attract current and future passengers because of their needs.

AB  - Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people’s values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for ‘tidy’ agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for ‘tidiness’ are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a ‘tidy garden’ versus a ‘messy garden’ influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular ‘tidy’ management practice–woodchip mulching–on the one hand, and simulating ‘messy’ gardens by adding ‘weedy’ plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for ‘tidy’ green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some ‘messiness’ in their garden plots as a “lazy gardener” approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.

TI  - Ungulates in the city: light pollution and open habitats predict the probability of roe deer occurring in an urban environment
AU  - Ciach, Michał
AU  - Fröhlich, Arkadiusz
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Although large and medium-sized herbivorous mammals avoid urbanized areas, they have recently begun to colonize towns and cities. In general, ungulates continue to avoid the centres of urban areas, and utilize mainly their thinly built-up outskirts. While extension of urban development is preventing ungulates from penetrating the urban landscape, the influence of noise and light pollution on the occurrence of mammalian herbivores is still poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the hypothesis that habitat availability shapes the distribution of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and artificial lightening discourages them from penetrating the urban landscape. Roe deer was recorded on 37% of randomly selected sample plots (N = 60) located within the city of Kraków (S Poland). The occupied plots contained significantly more open habitats, woodland patches were larger in them, but proximity to rivers, and noise and light pollution were significantly lower. The logistic regression model revealed that an increasing area of open habitats was positively correlated with the probability of roe deer occurring. However, the artificial lighting at night was negatively correlated with the probability of the species occurring: the negative effect of light pollution was mitigated by the greater area of open habitats. Our study highlights the very considerable potential of light pollution as a predictor of the occurrence of large mammals in the urban landscape. We argue that urbanization and the related artificial lighting at night may be a factor preventing ungulates from penetrating potentially suitable habitats in urban areas.

AB  - Background. Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour.  Methods. We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada.  Results. Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Anthropogenic development reduced connectivity by more than 80%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario. Conclusions. Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.

AB  - Although there has been considerable research on urban heat island (UHI) effects, most of the previous studies have attributed UHI effects to localized, surface processes. In this study, the impact of upstream urbanization on enhanced UHI effects is examined using surface observations and numerical simulations of an extreme UHI event that occurred on 9 July 2007 over Baltimore, Maryland. Under southwesterly wind, Baltimore experienced higher peak surface temperatures and higher pollution concentrations than did the larger urban area of Washington, D.C. Results from a coupled ultrahigh-resolution mesoscale-urban canopy model with 2001 National Land Cover Data showan advective contribution from upstream urbanization to the UHI event. This dynamical process is demonstrated by replacing Baltimore or its upstream urban areas by natural vegetation (in the model), indicating that the UHI effects could be reduced by as much as 25%. An analysis of the urban-bay interaction reveals the importance of horizontal wind direction in determining the intensity of bay breezes and the urban boundary layer structures. In addition, the vertical growth and structures of UHI effects are shown as layered "hot plumes" in the mixed layer with pronounced rising motions, and these plumes can be advected many kilometers downstream. These findings suggest that judicious land use and urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries, could help to alleviate UHI consequences, including heat stress and smog. They also have important implications for improving the prediction of urban weather, including the initiation of moist convection, air quality, and other environment-related problems.

AB  - Temporary streams are characterised by short periods of seasonal or annual stream flow after which streams contract into waterholes or pools of varying hydrological connectivity and permanence. Although these streams are widespread globally, temporal variability of their ecology is understudied, and understanding the processes that structure community composition in these systems is vital for predicting and managing the consequences of anthropogenic impacts. We used multivariate and univariate approaches to investigate temporal variability in macroinvertebrate compositional data from 13 years of sampling across multiple sites from autumn and spring, in South Australia, the driest state in the driest inhabited continent in the world. We examined the potential of land-use, geographic and environmental variables to predict the temporal variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages, and also identified indicator taxa, that is, those highly correlated with the most significantly associated physical variables. Temporal trajectories of macroinvertebrate communities varied within site in both seasons and across years. A combination of land-use, geographic and environmental variables accounted for 24% of the variation in community structure in autumn and 27% in spring. In autumn, community composition among sites were more closely clustered together relative to spring suggesting that communities were more similar in autumn than in spring. In both seasons, community structure was most strongly correlated with conductivity and latitude, and community structure was more associated with cover by agriculture than urban land-use. Maintaining temporary streams will require improved catchment management aimed at sustaining seasonal flows and critical refuge habitats, while also limiting the damaging effects from increased agriculture and urban developments.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Green Space Based on Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity: A Case Study on Tongzhou District in Beijing, China
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Green infrastructure is one of the key components that provides critical ecosystems services in urban areas, such as regulating services (temperature regulation, noise reduction, air purification), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic benefits), but due to rapid urbanization, many environmental impacts associated with the decline of green space have emerged and are rarely been evaluated integrally and promptly. The Chinese government is building a new city as the sub-center of the capital in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. A series of policies have been implemented to increase the size of green urban areas. To support this land-use decision-making process and achieve a sustainable development strategy, accurate assessments of green space are required. In the current study, using land-use data and environmental parameters, we assessed the urban green space in the case study area. The bio-energy and its fluxes, landscape connectivity, as well as related ecosystem services were estimated using a novel approach, the PANDORA model. These results show that (1) in the highly urbanized area, green space is decreasing in reaction to urbanization, and landscape fragmentation is ubiquitous; (2) the river ecology network is a critical part for ecosystem services and landscape connectivity; and (3) the alternative non-green patches to be changed to urban, urban patches which can improve landscape quality the most by being changed to green, and conservation priority patches for biodiversity purposes of urban green were explicitly identified. Conclusively, our results depict the spatial distribution, fluxes, and evolution of bio-energy, as well as the conservation prioritization of green space. Our methods can be applied by urban planners and ecologists, which can help decision-makers achieve a sustainable development strategy in these rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide.

The presence of certain epiphytic species in the urban area assists in the evaluation of the environmental quality of both the city and its surroundings. We conducted a qualitative survey of species vascular epiphytes in urban areas of Palmeira das Missões, Rio Grande do Sul State, including the main squares, the Municipal Park and the campus of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. We found eight species of angiosperms and six species of pteridophytes, mostly species of broad ecological spectrum. A rare species in the State was recorded in the study. These results represent a contribution to knowledge of plant biodiversity in urban areas and forest fragments in the Northern of Rio Grande do Sul

AB  - The Earth’s freshwater ecosystems are currently under threat, particularly in developing countries. In Mexico, intensive land use and inadequate monitoring policies have resulted in the severe degradation of the country’s freshwater ecosystems. This study assesses how the macroinvertebrate communities in the Pesquería River, located in Northeastern Mexico, are affected by riparian land use, in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators to evaluate the macroinvertebrate integrity of the Pesquería River. First, we characterized the land use cover in the riparian channel. Second, we sampled 16 sites for benthic macroinvertebrates along the main channel during the wet and dry seasons. Third, we evaluated the influence of the riparian channel land use on the macroinvertebrate community using 42 different biological metrics. The land use characterization depicted a riparian channel mainly influenced by agricultural and urban land use. Eighty-one invertebrate taxa were identified during the study. Permutational analysis of the variance analysis confirmed significant differences across the different land use classes and the macroinvertebrate community composition while no differences were found between seasons. The indicator species analysis revealed 31 representative taxa for natural land use, 1 for urban, and 4 for agricultural land use. Our modelling analysis showed that 28 of the 42 biological metrics tested responded significantly to land use disturbances, confirming the impact of land use changes on the Pesquería River’s macroinvertebrate communities and suggesting that these metrics may have a use as bioindicators. Finally, this study may provide significant biological information for further studies in similar conditions.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures can affect the distribution of species and elicit the appearance of spatial patterns that provide insights into the species’ responses to environmental filtering, mediated by their functional traits. Due to the functional redundancy in ecological communities, the spatial variations of species and functional traits can occur at different scales, but little is known on this topic, especially for soil arthropods with limited dispersion capabilities and highly dependent on environmental characteristics. The present research aims at shedding light on the spatial ecology of both the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of collembolan communities colonizing urban parks, adopted as model taxa for their functional traits, diversity and sensitivity to environmental drivers. To this end, the spatial patterns and scales of collembolan communities from 8 parks in Naples (Italy) and 14 in Montpellier (France) were investigated through an approach based on Moran eigenvector maps, modified to allow for evaluating the community spatial connectivity and the scales underpinning the spatial variation of each species and functional trait. The obtained findings demonstrate a limited spatial connectivity of collembolan communities in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversity, with mostly species-specific micro-scale variations that may be shaped by environmental constraints.

AB  - Breeding birds in forest ecosystems are generally diverse, habitat selective, and easily sampled. Because they must integrate environmental variables over space and time, local populations of forest birds (like other animal and plant taxa) may provide meaningful signals of local forest health or degradation. We evaluated 949 breeding bird surveys in areas ranging from degraded urban/suburban forest remnants to relatively pristine old growth forests in the western Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. The “human footprint” across this landscape was represented by a one‐dimensional numeric gradient derived from land cover variables, forest fragmentation metrics, and publicly available data on housing density and transportation corridors. We used an iterative, maximum likelihood approach to quantify species‐specific responses to this human disturbance gradient. Many species showed significant directional responses, consistent with known life history attributes. Other species were most commonly detected at intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, yielding unimodal responses. Relationships between the “human footprint” and occurrences of 38 bird species were illustrated by general Gaussian functions that represented both unidirectional and unimodal patterns. These biotic response (BR) functions were combined into a bird‐based index of ecological condition (IEC) ranging from 0 (maximally degraded) to 10 (minimally degraded). We described a successful application of the IEC method at the Wild Rivers Legacy Forest (WRLF), a >260 km2 conservation landscape in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, managed primarily under a working forest conservation easement established in 2006. In general, areas within the WRLF yielded high IEC values (7.0–9.0), but nearby forest areas not under the conservation easement were characterized by significantly lower IEC values based on breeding bird assemblages.

AU  - Small, E.C.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Carabid surveys were first conducted at a wide range of sites.  Three habitats were then selected for further study (derelict sites, wetlands and woodlands), representing a spectrum of disturbed to more stable habitats.  Sites were located across the rural-urban gradient, and at varying distances from potential corridors.  At each site carabids were sampled using pitfall and hand search, and various measures of the habitat and surrounding landscape structure were taken.  A study of the genetics of two species from urban woodlands was also conducted.   The findings indicate that urban derelict and wetland habitats are particularly important for carabid conservation at the local scale, containing rich assemblages and some nationally scarce species.  Grasslands, which dominate urban green space, are relatively depauperate.  A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands.  This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species.  No effect was observed at derelict sites.  However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat.  Derelict and wetland assemblages  were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance.  The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors.  The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists.  These findings have considerable implications for the application metapopulation and island biogeography theories to urban conservation.  Other findings provide important insights on how site selection and management of urban habitat fragments can be optimised to maximise the number and interest of carabid species finding refuge in cities.

TI  - The Role of Aquatic Subsidies in Riparian Food Webs and the Effect of Urbanization on the Diet, Diversity and Web-Spinning Behavior of Riparian Spiders
AU  - Kelly, Sean P.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The exchange of nutrients and organic material that occurs along the riparian zones of stream ecosystems has long been recognized to be vital in providing energetic subsidies for both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Web-spinning spiders that inhabit stream channels are considered specialists of aquatic ecosystems and are major consumers of emerging aquatic insects, while other spider taxa are more commonly found in riparian forests and as a result may rely more heavily on terrestrial insects. The proportion aquatic insects in the diet of riparian spiders will most likely depend on factors such as spider taxa and prey diversity. However, the majority of studies focusing on the movement of subsidies between aquatic and riparian food webs have been conducted in non-urban areas and little is known about how human impact through urbanization may be affecting the transfer of energy between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The overall objective of this dissertation was to improve our understanding of how spider communities can be utilized in studying the connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This objective was achieved by using a combination of stable isotope analyses along with measuring diversity and web-spinning behavior of riparian spiders. Results showed that spider assemblages are strongly associated with aquatic ecosystems due to their dependence on aquatic insects as a major energy source. In addition, results showed that urbanization can have a strong effect on the diet, web building behavior and body condition of riparian spiders and overall negatively affected spider diversity along an urban gradient. This study is of great importance because of the constant expansion of urban areas and as a result of this we need to have a better understanding how urbanization is impacting ecosystem interactions that are essential for sustaining complex food webs that could have negative effects for many aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In addition this dissertation has also provided evidence that spider communities should be included as part of integrated biotic indexes for stream ecosystems due to their ability to provide novel insights for more holistic analyses of the condition of the entire stream ecosystem, including the riparian areas.

AB  - Large-scale distribution models are effective predictors of habitat suitability and connectivity across broad landscapes and are useful management tools, though few large-scale species distribution models exist for medium-sized predators in urban landscapes. We modeled the potential distribution of 4 medium-sized predators in a 17,361-km2 portion of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. We applied a maximum entropy algorithm model (MaxEnt) using presence-only data collected via remote cameras from 54 Lake County, Illinois, forest preserves during August–October 2008–2012. Environmental data layers used to model distributions were distances to forest, grassland, barren land, crops, wetlands, developed open space, developed low intensity, developed high intensity, water, primary roads, secondary roads, and tertiary roads. Coyotes (Canis latrans) had the greatest area of potential distribution followed by opossums (Didelphis virginiana), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Models for all species had high AUC values (0.90–0.94) indicating strong predictive performance. More than 50% of the study area was predicted to be within the distributional limit for each focal species. Distance to forest was the most important contributory predictor for all species modeled (82% - 96%) and higher probability of presence for all 4 species was indicated closer to forest and further from tertiary roads. However, coyotes and raccoons were predicted to prefer habitat closer to highly-developed areas. Our research indicates medium-sized predators are highly synanthropic and able to persist within the Chicago Metropolitan Area given adequate availability of non-urban land cover, particularly forest, and ample green space linking forest patches within highly-developed areas.

AB  - Karst tiankengs are oases in degraded karst landscapes and act as repositories for biodiversity conservation; however, knowledge about the bacterial and fungal structure and function of the karst tiankeng ecosystems is limited. This study investigated the microbial communities in three different tiankeng (nondegraded, moderately degraded, and heavily degraded tiankeng) by Illumina NovaSeq sequencing. We found that the degradation of karst tiankeng can lead to changes in microbial community structure and functions, while there are differences in bacterial and fungal responses. There were significant differences in bacterial and fungal community composition and beta diversity in the three tiankeng soils. Random molecular ecological network analysis results indicated that a more complex and stable bacterial network existed in nondegraded tiankeng, while more complex fungal networks existed in moderately degraded tiankeng. The keystones of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota played essential roles in maintaining soil function and stability. The functional profiles revealed that tiankeng habitat changes may affect microbial survival strategies, such as increasing gene abundance associated with the carbon cycle. To our knowledge, this is the first report on bacterial and fungal communities in different degrees of karst tiankeng, which provides crucial insights into our understanding of the microbial communities' structure and potential function in karst tiankeng ecosystems.

TI  - Botanical processes in urban derelict spaces
AU  - Austin, Kevin Charles
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This thesis set out to investigate the processes that determine the richness and composition of plant communities on derelict land in the West Midlands. Experimental work included vegetation surveys, soil seed bank investigation, field mapping and seed rain trapping methods. Interpretation of the data involved a range of approaches including vegetation classification and ordination, comparative analysis of plant functional attributes and the development of regression models incorporating landscape and habitat variables. Derelict habitats were identified as holding a diverse array of communities at the early stages of succession which are poorly represented by current vegetation classifications, functional diversity is however much lower in pioneer communities. The majority of these species employing the expected strategies of early succession notably high reproductive capacity and seeds which are small, highly dispersive and form persistent seed banks. Dense seed banks were typically formed on sites and were dominated by a small set of consistently occurring species. Changes in seed bank density and composition were consistent with time represented both by the chronosequence of sites and increasing soil depth. Little evidence was found to suggest that diversity or species composition is linked to site connectivity related to either patch density or the presence of linear features. These findings have considerable implications for application of principles of metapopulation and island biogeography principles to urban conservation. In particular the trend for planners to designate urban wildlife corridors is questioned as being probably of no benefit to native diversity and indeed these features are identified as being instead potentially significant pathways for invasive alien species. The most important factors influencing the composition of sites were seen to be those linked closely with past and present human activity. Particularly significant are the nature of dereliction substrates and haphazard disturbances such as fire and tipping which influence vegetation succession temporally and spatially.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Urban areas are often considered to be a hostile environment for wildlife as they are highly fragmented and frequently disturbed. However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine‐scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence.Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine‐scale variation in socio‐economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (Vulpes vulpes) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity.We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas.Our results suggest that fine‐scale variation within urban environments can be important for understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in urban wildlife and could have wider implication for the management of urban carnivores.

AU  - Vankina, Priyanka
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Landscapes are mosaics of patches and corridors which are formed by hills, different soils types, vegetation patchiness, natural disturbances and human activities. As humans have developed, the patches and corridors have become fragmented and edges have been created. These edges become the critical points of interaction for wildlife with their surroundings. This is especially true in urban areas where development has created harsh edge environments.   \This study investigates the edge structure of Olmsted's Emerald Necklace to understand how edges can be designed to create habitat for wildlife in urban areas. The Emerald Necklace is located in Boston, MA and was designed in the 1800s by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Necklace is the first designed greenway and has been used as a model by many cities throughout the country. As such, the Emerald Necklace can be studied to gain insight into how the edges of an urban greenway can be designed to augment animal diversity in urban areas. The goal of the study is to provide design recommendations that can be used as a guide by landscape architects to maintain current urban greenways and to plan future ones.  The study's major findings suggest that plant and animal species vary along the park as per the original design. Additional findings show that there is no separation of spaces for people and animals along the Necklace which can lead to habitat disturbance. In addition eight design recommendations are suggested to improve the current conditions of the Emerald Necklace. Moreover the recommendations are not site specific and can be applied to other existing and future urban greenways. These include protecting existing habitat, using native plants and eradicating invasive species. The results and findings are discussed in further detail. Overall the Emerald Necklace is ecologically healthy and provides functions for both people and animals.

TI  - Multiple-scale approaches to the restoration of deciduous forest in southwestern Ontario, Canada
AU  - McLachlan, Stephane Marc
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Intense agricultural and urban land-use has reduced forest cover to 3% in Essex county, southwestern Ontario, Canada. The remaining forest has been degraded by over-grazing, non-native species, recreational use, and, in some cases, poor management. From 1994 to 1996, field studies were conducted in and around Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) with the overall objective of assessing various approaches to habitat restoration.A preliminary landscape-level analysis of three areas near to PPNP used satellite imagery and geographical information systems (GIS). Forest cover in the area directly north of PPNP (Pelee-north) was less than 3%, while that of nearby Cedar Creek and Pelee Island was 9% and 14%, respectively. The relatively large number of forest patches $<$10ha and great inter-patch distances in Pelee-north suggested that the management focus in this area should be on habitat protection. In contrast, restoration efforts might be more effective elsewhere, where land values are lower and possibilities of increasing the connectivity between the forest remnants are greater.Since the 1960s, cottages and roads in PPNP have been removed and these sites allowed to regenerate (passive restoration). Since 1988, many sites have been actively restored. Although actively-restored sites were still dominated by ruderal non-natives, results suggested that passively restored sites increased in similarity to relatively undisturbed reference sites as time-since restoration increased. After 35 years, some mesic sites seemed to have recovered completely. In addition, there was no overall difference in native diversity between restored and reference sites. However, multivariate analyses showed significant differences in native species composition between reference and restored sites. Spring ephemerals with restricted seed dispersal were highly vulnerable and will likely have to be reintroduced. Non-native species diversity showed a significant decline over time, especially in wet/mesic sites. Ruderal non-natives declined most rapidly as time-since-restoration increased, while regeneration-inhibiting non-natives showed a less rapid decline. The non-native garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) had little longterm effect on the native understorey plant community.The success of agroforestry and afforestation was examined in a post-agricultural field outside of PPNP. The effects of fertilisation, weed control, and corn shelter treatments on the growth of three native deciduous tree species was studied from 1994 to 1996. Fertiliser significantly increased tree growth, but only when weeds were adequately controlled. Trees in clover treatments had less growth than those in either full-weed or mown-weed treatments, while trees in weed-free and inter-weed treatments had the greatest growth. Silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) growth was greatest under the corn shelter when plots were fertilised and controlled for weeds. In contrast, growth of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) was adversely affected by the corn.The restoration of deciduous forest holds great promise for this region, whether it create new natural habitat or accelerate the recovery of existing but degraded habitat. However, this region is so highly fragmented that restoration should be co-ordinated at the landscape level if generations of neglect are to be successfully reversed.

TI  - The Influence of Flow Variation on Community Composition in Streams and Rivers
AU  - Saffarinia, Parsa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Global change has severely impacted the flow regimes of river systems across the globe, and the species inhabiting those systems now find themselves adapted to hydrographs that no longer exist. This includes many of the flow regimes in California, as streams are experiencing an altered precipitation cycle and a system of dams, culverts, and wastewater treatment plants that have transformed rivers that were once naturally flowing into occasionally concrete-lined channels. In the following chapters, I report the results of several studies aimed at understanding the relationship between flow variability and the persistence of ecological communities in river systems, particularly diatoms and benthic macroinvertebrates. In chapter one, I utilize a set of high-elevation experimental stream channels to subject the stream benthic community to a gradient of drought treatments. In this study, I found that pool habitat serves as a better refuge to benthic macroinvertebrates than riffles, contingent on the presence of hyporheic flow. Additionally, perennial flow–adapted communities appear to resist flow reduction, up to the point when surface flow is lost. My second chapter examines the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrate community composition and flow regimes, spatial connectivity, and environmental variables at large spatial scales and long temporal scales. I found that spatial processes, such as drainage density and upstream area, and flow metrics, such as flow variability and zero-flow days, best explain temporal beta diversity in macroinvertebrate communities at the multi-catchment scale. Chapter three explores the impact of urban flow disturbance, in the form of effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and storm runoff, on benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate communities through space and time. I found that macroinvertebrates in such systems are resistant to flow perturbations, compositionally reflected in a relatively disturbance-tolerant community, while the diatoms reflected fast-paced resilience strategies. While erratic flow shutdowns from wastewater treatment plants result in losses of taxa and lower densities of individuals, large storm events further compound flow regime disturbance in the urban stream system. Overall in this dissertation, I demonstrate that flow disturbance is a strong predictor of benthic freshwater communities, and that determining the extent of hydrological disturbance at the correct timescale is critical to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity.

TI  - Maximizing ecological and social benefits of habitat restoration in the Lower Duwamish River: A spatial framework for site selection
AU  - Brandon, Tess B.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Lower Duwamish River (LDR) estuary is an 11-mile stretch of river that contains the core of industrial activity in the Seattle area. As the city's only river, the LDR also provides important habitat for many of the region's valued fish and wildlife species. However, its long history of urban development and industrial activity has polluted and degraded the river, and significant habitat restoration is now required under federal and state law. Given the highly developed urban industrial setting of the LDR, habitat restoration projects tend to be small and opportunistic, with limited ecological value. At the same time, the LDR is home to several underserved urban neighborhoods, and restoration projects have the potential to bring significant social value to these communities. Maximizing this potential value together with ecological value requires a more strategic approach to restoration. Through a review of local and regional planning documents, I developed a list of community-defined characteristics that contribute to a restoration project's potential ecological and social value in the LDR. I then used these characteristics to explore the spatial distribution of potential restoration value in the river, creating a series of heat maps of potential value for each characteristic, and for overall potential ecological and social value. I developed six ecological metrics and eight social metrics, which I calculated for 511 waterfront parcels in the LDR. Results show more variability with positive skewness in the ecological index, and a more normal distribution with higher average values in the social index. Spatial analysis revealed higher ecological value in the northern, industrial section of the LDR, with particular dependence on the existing habitat network. Social value was higher in the southern section and as the river passes through residential neighborhoods. These results can inform site selection for future restoration projects in the LDR. Methodologies and results for individual metrics can be used to address project-specific objectives, while use of the complete collection can inform those restoration projects that seek to maximize overall ecological and social benefits in the LDR.

TI  - Urban forestry -- Linking naturalness and amenity: The case of Ljubljana, Slovenia
AU  - Hladnik, David

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Urban forestry tries to connect the concept of forest ecosystem with the idea of nature preservation as well as with social needs of urban society, often living close to such a natural environment, thus being a part of it. The ability to connect the human need for the natural environment with life support system of persistent forest ecosystem should become an important contributing factor of urban forestry for well-being of urban society. In the range of 1 km walking distance around the city of Ljubljana and within urban areas of the city, forests comprise more than one quarter of the area. The most prevalent in the area are patches of forest fragments, estimated to have a shallow depth of the inner environment. The concept of urban forests in the Ljubljana Green System as a backbone of a green network has been confirmed especially by the two largest forest patches of Golovec and Roznik, indented as a part of forest matrix up to the city centre. Based on the analysis of the continuum of these forests, it was possible to assume that in the past, more than three quarters of forest grounds were meant for no other land use. In the other quarter of the city and its Green System, forests were more significantly reduced in the past, given the fact that we can estimate its continuum only for one half of today's area. On a detailed level, it is recommended for the urban forests to contain a significant percentage of trees and other species that would naturally appear on the sites of the area. Whereas on a landscape level, it is not enough to address only such species, but also temporal stability of forest patches, corridors or even forest matrix in urban areas and its urban-rural gradient into suburban areas.

AB  - Background Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong’an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities.Methods A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity.Results Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD).Discussion Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species α-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region. Finally, based on the biodiversity hotspots identified by this research, ecological corridors should be carefully planned to improve the stability of regional bird communities.

AB  - Cultivated plants are foundational species in urban areas, where they simultaneously provide essential ecosystem services while posing a risk of invasion into natural communities. We sought to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of cultivated plants using historical data to better understand the origins of the patterns of diversity observed in present‐day human‐dominated landscapes.Using records of 5098 ornamental vascular plant species available in 319 US nursery catalogs published from 1719 to 1946, we quantified the taxonomic and phylogenetic α‐diversity, phylogenetic structure, and β‐diversity of the historical US nursery flora in cultural regions, biomes, latitudinal bands, and longitudinal zones.We showed a peaked increase in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the US nursery flora over time, concurrent with the proliferation of nurseries and the addition of new species to nursery offerings. However, standardized phylogenetic diversity showed a convex pattern, with a trough during a time of peak growth and connectivity in the nursery industry, and diversity actually decreased at the end of the time series. We also showed a pattern of increasing homogenization of regional nursery floras, as well as a shift from offering predominately native to predominately alien species.Echos of the history of the US nursery industry can be found today in patterns with great ecological relevance. Previous reports of high alien plant diversity in urban areas, phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion among naturalized alien plants, and homogenization of urban plant communities are all consistent with the historical availability of these plants in the nursery flora.

TI  - Avian Communities and Ecoacoustics in a Tropical Human-Modified Landscape
AU  - Bradfer-Lawrence, Tom
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Large areas of the tropics have been cleared of forest and converted to agriculture. The consequent human-modified landscapes (HMLs) comprise a heterogenous mix of habitats; forest fragments and riparian strips are embedded in a matrix of cattle pasture, non-native timber plantations, and urban centres. These habitat changes can have dramatic consequences for wildlife, leading to range shifts and extirpations. In turn, this can influence the integrity of ecosystem services such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Understanding how habitat conversion affects natural ecosystems is critical to inform conservation interventions, but requires long-term biodiversity monitoring and detailed knowledge of species-level responses to HMLs. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in the Emparador HML, in central Republic of Panama. In Chapter 2, we show that the regional avian community is shaped by extent of forest cover across the landscape, and to a lesser degree, extent of forest fragmentation and distance to core forest. Effects of forest cover and fragmentation were examined at local (10 ha) and landscape (500 ha) scales. Species-level responses to these factors varied widely; while abundance of many species increased with greater local-scale forest cover, greater landscape-scale forest cover was often associated with declines. Generalist species that readily persist in HMLs still responded positively to local-scale forest cover, suggesting that even smaller forest fragments in these landscapes are important for maintaining diverse avian assemblages. Critically, we found that species’ responses were not associated with particular traits such as dietary composition or forest dependence, highlighting that species may often exhibit idiosyncratic responses to landscape structure. Chapters 3 and 4 address the wider issue of long-term monitoring, and the potential for data collection over large spatiotemporal scales using remote audio recorders. Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound is a relatively new discipline, and as such there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding best-practice for collecting and processing recordings. One of the most straightforward means of utilising audio recordings for environmental monitoring is via acoustic indices. These are objective measures of sound based on features such as pitch and amplitude. To date, attempts to use these indices have been hindered by inconsistent or inappropriate methodologies. In Chapter 3, we determine how many recordings are required to comprehensively capture a soundscape, the acoustic energy of a location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are habitat-specific patterns in acoustic indices values, suggesting that these indices reflect differences in vegetation structure and wildlife. We develop this further in Chapter 4, where we show that avian species richness and abundance are clearly linked to patterns in acoustic indices values. Critically, these patterns were coherent among habitat types emphasising their potential for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies occupied by bird song have the greatest potential for monitoring an avian community. The results from these two chapters suggest that acoustic indices can be effective tools for monitoring biodiversity, with values reflecting consistent differences across habitats, and among avian assemblages. Audio recordings are a source of permanent, verifiable evidence that can be collected at much greater spatiotemporal scales than traditional biodiversity monitoring data. As the use of audio recorders grows, it is important to compare their efficacy with standard methods of data collection. In Chapter 5, we contrast data derived from audio recordings with that gathered using standard point count methods, and consider whether recorders are a feasible means of surveying antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a disturbance-sensitive avian taxon. Both approaches revealed species’ responses to landscape structure, with qualitatively similar patterns in response to forest cover and vegetation quality. We show that common species can be readily monitored using audio recorders, with greater levels of detectability compared with point counts. However, rarer species were more likely to be detected using point counts. The work presented in this thesis helps to explain the patterns seen in avian responses to Neotropical HMLs. In particular we emphasise the importance of forest cover for maintaining bird assemblages in these landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of audio recorders for data collection, and highlight their potential for future biodiversity monitoring. In the face of human population growth, and ongoing habitat disturbance and agricultural intensification, conservation efforts are essential to avoid widespread species extinctions and ecosystem collapse. Interventions must take place in HMLs, to bolster ecosystem services, provide buffer zones for protected areas, and improve connectivity in the wider landscape.

AB  - Patterns of behavioural variation and migratory connectivity are important characteristics of populations, particularly at the edges of species distributions, where processes involved in influencing evolutionary trajectories, such as divergence, mutual persistence, and natural hybridization, can occur. Here, we focused on two closely related seabird species that breed in the Mediterranean: Balearic shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) and Yelkouan shearwaters (Puffinus yelkouan). Genetic and phenotypic evidence of hybridization between the two species on Menorca (the eastern and westernmost island in the breeding ranges of the two shearwaters, respectively) has provided important insights into relationships between these recently diverged species. Nevertheless, levels of behavioural and ecological differentiation amongst these populations remain largely unknown. Using geolocation and stable isotopes, we compared the at-sea movement behaviour of birds from the Menorcan ‘hybrid’ population with the nearest neighbouring populations of Balearic and Yelkouan shearwaters. The Menorcan population displayed a suite of behavioural features intermediate to those seen in the two species (including migration strategies, breeding season movements and limited data on phenology). Our findings provide new evidence to support suggestions that the Menorcan population is admixed, and indicate a role of non-breeding behaviours in the evolutionary trajectories of Puffinus shearwaters in the Mediterranean.

AB  - Streams and rivers have essential roles in landscape connectivity; however, urban watersheds are frequently modified to drain stormwater from urban areas. To determine whether an earthen stormwater drain in an urban landscape provides fish habitat temporally, we compared the fish assemblage among three reaches of a contiguous urbanized watershed in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. Watts Creek is connected to an earthen municipal surface stormwater drain (herein Kizell Drain), before discharging into the Ottawa River. We delineated transects in three reaches of the system, in Watts, in the Drain, and below their confluence (Main) and assessed the fish community using single-pass electrofishing repeated across eight months covering all seasons. Fish community composition was compared among reaches using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutated multivariate analyses of variance (perMANOVA). Sign association tests identified indicator species driving assemblage patterns among reaches. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the transects on fish assemblage structure. Finally, fish assemblage measures were separated by month and temporal comparisons of fish assemblage were performed with NMDS and perMANOVA. Over the year, fish assemblages were distinct among the three reaches, and appear to be significantly influenced by temperature, undercut banks, and riparian vegetation type. Biotic homogenization in the Drain can be attributed to degraded physical features associated with channel modification in stormwater drains. Despite management and jurisdictional differences between streams and stormwater drains, evidence that earthen stormwater drains can maintain fish assemblages temporally demonstrates their biological potential and need to be considered as interconnected fish habitat elements within the overall watershed.

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Collaborative Landscape-Scale Ecological Research: Emerging Trends in Urban and Regional EcologyUrban ecosystems evolve over time and space as the outcome of dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical processes operating over multiple scales. The ecological resilience of urban ecosystems--the degree to which they tolerate alteration before reorganizing around a new set of structures and processes--is influenced by these interactions. In cities and urbanizing areas fragmentation of natural habitats, simplification and homogenization of species composition, disruption of hydrological systems, and alteration of energy flow and nutrient cycling reduce cross-scale resilience, leaving systems increasingly vulnerable to shifts in system control and structure. Because varied urban development patterns affect the amount and interspersion of built and natural land cover, as well as the human demands on ecosystems differently, we argue that alternative urban patterns (i.e., urban form, land use distribution, and connectivity) generate varied effects on ecosystem dynamics and their ecological resilience. We build on urban economics, landscape ecology, population dynamics, and complex system science to propose a conceptual model and a set of hypotheses that explicitly link urban pattern to human and ecosystem functions in urban ecosystems. Drawing on preliminary results from an empirical study of the relationships between urban pattern and bird and aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in the Puget Sound region, we propose that resilience in urban ecosystems is a function of the patterns of human activities and natural habitats that control and are controlled by both socio-economic and biophysical processes operating at various scales. We discuss the implications of this conceptual model for urban planning and design.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Botanical processes in urban derelict spaces.. (BL: DXN066523)
AU  - Austin, K.C.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This thesis set out to investigate the processes that determine the richness and composition of plant communities on derelict land in the West Midlands.  Experimental work included vegetation surveys, soil seed bank investigation, field mapping and seed rain trapping methods.  Interpretation of the data involved a range of approaches including vegetation classification and ordination, comparative analysis of plant functional attributes and the development of regression models incorporating landscape and habitat variables.  Derelict habitats were identified as holding a diverse array of communities at the early stages of succession which are poorly represented by current vegetation classifications.  Functional diversity is however much lower in pioneer communities.  The majority of these species employing the expected strategies of early succession notably high reproductive capacity and seeds which are small, highly dispersive and form persistent seed banks.  Dense seed banks were typically formed on sites and were dominated by a small set of consistently occurring species.  Changes in seed bank density and composition were consistent with time represented both by the chronosequence of sites and increasing soil depth.  Little evidence was found to suggest that diversity or species composition is linked to site connectivity related to either path density or the presence of liner features.  These findings have considerable implications for applications for application of principles of metapopulation and island biogeography principles to urban conservation.  In particular the trend for planners to designate urban wildlife corridors is questioned as being probably of no benefit to native diversity and indeed these features are identified as being instead potentially significant pathways for invasive alien species.  The most important factors influencing the composition of sits were seen to be those linked closely with past and present human activity.  Particularly significant are the nature of dereliction substrates and haphazard disturbances such as fire and tipping which influence vegetation succession temporally and spatially.

TI  - Population dynamics and occupancy patterns of Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) in New York City parks and adjacent suburbs
AU  - Nagy, Christopher M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) are one of the few raptor species that permanently reside in New York City (NYC).  To better inform management of this charismatic species in urban parks, I sought to determine the present status and future viability of existing screech owl populations in NYC and identify potential landscape characteristics that affect park occupancy by screech owls.  Using captive, non-releasable owls and isolated free-living owls, I developed a method of identifying individual screech owls via vocalization analysis.  Using call-broadcast surveys and subsequent recording of owl responses, I gathered capture-recapture histories of urban owls in three NYC parks and one comparison nature preserve, the Mianus River Gorge Preserve (MRGP), a rural/suburban nature preserve in Bedford, NY.  These histories were used to estimate abundance and survival rate in each of the parks.  I then projected simulated populations using my estimated adult survival and previously published yearling survival and reproductive rates.  I built my projection model to include density dependence based on park area, realistic sex ratio fluctuations, and periodic drops in survival rate due to hypothetical environmental events.  Survival in urban parks was 0.98–1.0, much greater than in the MRGP, 0.57 ± 0.15.  Despite the high adult survival, populations in parks could be extirpated within 10–20 years by severe drops in survival rate (e.g., extreme winters, storms, or secondary poisoning) if such conditions occurred more often than once every ten years or if parks were smaller than 1.0km2.    In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues and I conducted a citizen science-based study on screech owl occupancy patterns across three counties adjacent to NYC: Westchester and Putnam, NY, and Fairfield, CT.  Volunteers conducted call-broadcast surveys on their own properties and sent my colleagues and me the results in 2008 and 2009.  Occupancy and detection were modeled as functions of the amount of forest cover and impervious surface cover at each survey point.  These models were validated against an independent dataset collected by myself and other trained scientists.  Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. Both the citizen science and the systematic datasets supported similar owl-habitat patterns of higher occupancy probabilities in developed areas compared to rural.  The above patterns described eastern screech owl habitat use in rural and suburban areas outside of NYC.  I hypothesized that at some point urbanization would become too intense for owls to tolerate,  and they would be primarily relegated to protected greenspaces in extremely urbanized cities, as I observed in NYC.  In 2010, I surveyed 13 additional parks in NYC and the more urban southern sections of Westchester to characterize occupancy patterns in highly urban areas.  I used similar landscape measurements as in the citizen science study, only these measurements were taken across the entire park.  Occupancy appeared to decline sharply if the percent impervious cover surrounding a park rose above 50–60%.  I interpreted this pattern as evidence that high urbanization around a park acts primarily as a barrier to immigration.  It is also possible that high urbanization around a park leads to higher mortality from vehicles.        In terms of management, my work has indicated that in large parks (e.g., >1km2), extinction probability is relatively low, but parks larger than 3km2 may be less suitable if big parks allow the establishment of larger raptors such as barred (Strix varia ) or great horned owls (Bubo virginianus).  Managers can enhance population persistence by increasing the amount of available habitat via habitat restoration and reforesting or re-meadowing developed but unused parks (e.g., large lawns and paved areas) and increasing over-winter survival and reproductive rates by installing nest boxes.  However, frequent chance events can extirpate any park-bound population, and thus managers and city planners should also look to enhance the probability of dispersal and recolonization via corridors or reducing the general level of urbanization around protected parks.

TI  - Planning Landscape Corridors in Ecological Infrastructure Using Least-Cost Path Methods Based on the Value of Ecosystem Services
AU  - Lee, Jung A

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Ecosystem service values have rarely been incorporated in the process of planning ecological infrastructure for urban areas. Urban ecological infrastructure is a network system of natural lands and waters that provides ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to design landscape corridors that maximize the value of ecosystem services in ecological infrastructure planning. We explored the optimal corridors to enhance the connectivity among landscape elements to design an ecological infrastructure for the city of Gwacheon, South Korea, as an example of a small urban area. We calculated the value of ecosystem services using standardized estimation indices based on an intensive review of the relevant literature and employed the least-cost path method to optimize the connectivity of landscape structural elements. The land use type in the city with the highest estimated value of ecosystem services was the riparian zone (i.e., 2011 US$7,312.16/ha). Given areal coverage of all land use types, the estimated value of developed area open spaces was 2011 US$899,803.25, corresponding to the highest contribution to the total value of ecosystem services. Therefore, the optimal configured dispersal corridors for wildlife were found from the riparian zones (source area) to the developed area open spaces (destination area) in the city. Several challenges remain for improving the estimation of the value of ecosystem services and incorporating these ecosystems in ecological infrastructure planning. Nonetheless, the approaches taken to estimate the value of ecosystem services and design landscape corridors in this study may be of value to future efforts in urban ecological infrastructure planning.

AB  - With the widespread population growth in cities, anthropogenic influences inevitably lead to natural disturbances. The metropolitan area of Istanbul, with its rapid urbanization rate, has faced intense pressure regarding the sustainability of urban habitats. In this context, landscapes comprising patches affected by various disturbances and undergoing temporal changes must be analyzed, in order to assess city-related disturbances. In this study, the main objective was to understand how urbanization changed the function of the spatial distribution of the urban mosaic and, more specifically, its relationship with the size, shape, and connection among land-use classes. For this purpose, we took Besiktas, a district of Istanbul, as the study area. We evaluated the landscape pattern of the urban environment in two stages. First, we used medium-resolution satellite imagery to reveal the general interactions in the urbanization process. Landscape- and class-level landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape connectivity, and the distances between classes (green areas and artificial surfaces), patterns, and processes, using five satellite images representing a time span of 51 years (1963, 1984, 1997, 2005, and 2014). The general landscape structure was examined by looking at the temporal–spatial processes of artificial surface and green areas obtained from these medium-resolution satellite images. The trends in selected landscape-level metrics were specified and discussed through the use of a moving window analysis. We then used Pleiades high-resolution satellite imagery (2015) to analyze the landscape structure in more detail. This high-resolution base image allows us to recognize the possibility of classifying basic cultural landscape classes. The findings regarding the spatial arrangement of each class in the areas allocated to 14 cultural landscape classes were interpreted by associating them with the landscape functions. Finally, particulate matter (PM10) concentration data were collected and evaluated as an ecological indicator, in order to reveal the relationships between landscape structure and landscape function. In short, we first evaluated the whole landscape structure using medium-resolution data, followed by the classification of cultural landscapes using high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a time-effective—and, therefore, essential—auxiliary method for landscape evaluation. This two-stage evaluation method enables inferences to be made that can shed light on the landscape functions in an urban environment based on the landscape structure.

TI  - Poor ecological quality of urban ponds in northern England: causes and consequences
AU  - Noble, Andrew
AU  - Hassall, Christopher
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The value of ponds in urban areas historically has been overlooked. While some recent studies have described considerable biodiversity in urban areas, it is unclear as to how far this extends to different urban habitats. The aims of this study were to determine the condition of 21 urban ponds in Bradford (northern England) and to quantify the connectivity of wetlands in the district. The study showed that macroinvertebrate and plant biodiversity was substantially lower than would be expected based on pristine reference sites. Of the 21 ponds surveyed, 15 were found to be classified as having very poor ecological quality, with 5 being classed as poor and just 1 was classed as moderate. The number of aquatic plant species found in the ponds ranged from 0 to 6 and the number of macroinvertebrate families found ranged from 4 to 13. It was suspected that the aquatic plant diversity was low due to management techniques such as the removal of emergent vegetation. The average distance to a wetland was found to be higher in urban areas (533 m) compared to rural areas (448 m) although this difference was small, which indicates that the low diversity found in urban ponds is likely due to habitat variables.

AB  - BackgroundDengue viruses are endemic across most tropical and subtropical regions. Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be ~100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of what parameters impact dispersal is essential for efficient implementation of any mosquito population suppression program. Population replacement and genetic control strategies currently under consideration are also dependent upon a thorough understanding of mosquito dispersal in urban settings.Methodology and Principal FindingsWe examined the effect of a major highway on dispersal patterns over a 2 year period. A. aegypti larvae were collected on the east and west sides of Uriah Butler Highway (UBH) to examine any effect UBH may have on the observed population structure in the Charlieville neighborhood in Trinidad, West Indies. A panel of nine microsatellites, two SNPs and a 710 bp sequence of mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) were used for the molecular analyses of the samples. Three CO1 haplotypes were identified, one of which was only found on the east side of the road in 2006 and 2007. AMOVA using mtCO1 and nuclear markers revealed significant differentiation between the east- and west-side collections.Conclusion and SignificanceOur results indicate that anthropogenic barriers to A. aegypti dispersal exist in urban environments and should be considered when implementing control programs during dengue outbreaks and population suppression or replacement programs.

AB  - The Mekong River is one of the largest rivers in the world and hosts the second greatest fish diversity in the world after the Amazon. However, despite the importance of this diversity and its associated biomass for human food security and the economy, different anthropogenic pressures threaten the sustainability of the Mekong River and fish diversity, including the intense damming of the main river. Both the increase in salt-water penetration into the Mekong Delta and the disrupted connectivity of the river may have serious impacts on the numerous freshwater and migratory species. To evaluate the potential of an eDNA approach for monitoring fish diversity, water was sampled at 15 sites along the salinity gradient in the Mekong Delta and along 1500 km of the main stream, from Vietnam to Thailand and Laos. A total of 287 OTUs were recovered, of which 158 were identified to the species level using both reference sequences available in GenBank and references obtained locally. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering and PCA identified up to three main species assemblages in our samples. If the transition from brackish to freshwater conditions represents the main barrier between two of these assemblages, more surprisingly, the two other assemblages were observed in the freshwater Mekong, with a spatial disjunction that did not match any biogeographic ecoregion or the Khone falls, the latter thought to be an important fish dispersion barrier. Between 60% and 95% of the freshwater species were potamodromous. This pioneer eDNA study in the Mekong River at this geographical and ecological scale clearly confirmed the potential of this approach for ecological and diversity monitoring. It also demonstrated the need to rapidly build an exhaustive Mekong fish barcode library to enable more accurate species’ assignment. More eDNA surveys can now be expected to better describe the ecological niche of different species, which is crucial for any models aimed at predicting the impact of future damming of the Mekong.

TI  - The forgotten forest: Ecosystem structure, function, and services of forested verges along interstates in Louisville, KY
AU  - Trammell, Tara L. E.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Cities, and the interstates that connect them, alter the local environment by changing the microclimate, elevating pollutant deposition, introducing species, and disturbing ecosystems. How these multiple factors interact to affect natural areas within the urban environment and adjacent to interstates is important to understand. However, the vegetation communities along urban interstates are forgotten in urban and road ecology studies. In previously forested landscapes, remnant vegetation alongside urban interstates are "forgotten forests" that may be extremely beneficial in providing ecosystem services to society and habitat corridors for plant and animal species in the urban environment. I examined forested verges along interstates in Louisville, KY and determined whether introduced plant species, disturbance legacy from interstate construction, current interstate impacts, or the surrounding urban context explained variation in woody plant composition and the underlying soil matrix. A primary production study and a decomposition experiment were conducted to assess the ecosystem function of these forests. The UFORE and CENTURY models were used to estimate ecosystem services (i.e., carbon storage and accumulation, pollutant removal) provided by these forest verges. The tree species composition of these forests was almost entirely native whereas exotic invasive species were more frequent in the understory (i.e., shrubs and vines). An exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), was the most important species explaining variation in woody vegetation composition. Amur honeysuckle may further enhance its own establishment by reducing native tree regeneration via lower light levels below honeysuckle shrubs, by increasing carbon reserves through an extended growing season, and by increasing nitrogen release from decaying honeysuckle litter during early spring before other species may access the nitrogen. The legacy of planting honeysuckle post-construction and disturbing soils during construction has lasting effects on the forest composition. Exotic species, including honeysuckle, were more prevalent and native tree regeneration was lower on disturbed soils. The combined impact of honeysuckle presence and soil disturbance diminished ecosystem services provided by these forests and the future ability of these forests to provide ecosystem services is expected to decline over time with the continued dominance of honeysuckle. Altered forest composition and diminished ecosystem services in locations where interstate construction activities occurred demonstrates the lasting effects of past human activity on forest composition. However, the existence of native stands along urban interstates provides hope that naturally regenerating forests can persist in the urban environment along interstate corridors. To promote the ability of native woody species to maintain their populations along forested highway verges, management needs to reduce exotic invasive species and to plant native species. These "forgotten forests" contribute many ecological services and they deserve recognition for their value.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most severe drivers of current global biodiversity loss and has contributed to severe declines in many amphibian species. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL).Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models.In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CONTROL, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of STOPON seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management.

AB  - The fragmentation of protected areas is a common issue in global conservation, which means a new approach to planning and management needs to be explored. In this paper, we proposed the concept of a group of natural protected areas (GNPA) and studied the construction of GNPAs. Firstly, the spatial distribution characteristics of 1363 natural protected areas (NPAs) in Guangdong Province were qualitatively studied. The overall spatial pattern among NPAs and the spatial distribution characteristics of mountain ranges, river basins, urbanization level and economic density were analyzed, and the relationship between the distribution of NPAs and physical geography and social development was clarified. Then, the geographical concentration index, nearest index and Gini coefficient were used for quantitative analysis. The geographical concentration index was 24.6, and the nearest neighbor index was 0.8. The Gini coefficients of the spatial distribution of NPAs in Guangdong Province were Gini = 0.956 and C = 0.044. These indices proved that the overall spatial patterns of NPAs in Guangdong Province had the tendency and characteristics of agglomeration. On this basis, 29 agglomeration areas were constructed using kernel density analysis and the natural break point classification method. According to the requirements of spatial connectivity and management feasibility, combined with the characteristics of physical geography, ecosystems and biodiversity, 32 GNPAs were constructed based on the reasonable adjustment of 29 agglomeration areas. Using Geodetector statistics to analyze the spatial stratified heterogeneity of the GNPAs, the results showed that mountain range, water system, population density, economic density and urbanization level were all factors that could explain the clustering distribution of the natural protected areas. The most important factor was mountain range (p = 0.190), followed by population density (p = 0.162). The 32 GNPAs covered the most representative natural ecosystems in the province and had compact spatial organization, a close ecological relationship and feasible unified management, which means they could aid in resolving the fragmentation of protected areas and improving management efficiency.

Occurrence points of bear damage were collected from field surveys completed from 2017 to 2019. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was then used to assess house break‐in risk. Circuit theory modeling was used to simulate risk diffusion paths based on the risk map generated from our MaxEnt model. The results showed that (a) the total risk area of house break‐ins caused by brown bears was 11,577.91 km2, accounting for 29.85% of Zhiduo County, with most of the risk areas were distributed in Sanjiangyuan National Park, accounting for 58.31% of the total risk area; (b) regions of alpine meadow located in Sanjiangyuan National Park with a high human population density were associated with higher risk; (c) risk diffusion paths extended southeast to northwest, connecting the inside of Sanjiangyuan National Park to its outside border; and (d) eastern Suojia, southern Zhahe, eastern Duocai, and southern Jiajiboluo had more risk diffusion paths than other areas examined, indicating higher risk for brown bear break‐ins in these areas. Risk diffusion paths will need strong conservation management to facilitate migration and gene flow of brown bears and to alleviate bear damage, and implementation of compensation schemes may be necessary in risk areas to offset financial burdens. Our analytical methods can be applied to conflict reduction efforts and wildlife conservation planning across the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau.

T2  - Forests
AB  - Invasions of exotic forest insects and pathogens can devastate evolutionarily naïve habitats and could cause irreversible changes to urban and natural ecosystems. Given the ever-increasing volume of trade in wood and plant stock worldwide, establishment of non-native pests under climate change is one of the most important forest health concerns currently. The European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, is a damaging, phloem-feeding insect of Norway spruce, Picea abies, in Eurasia. Endoconidiophora polonica is the most virulent ophiostomatoid fungal associate of I. typographus. Spruce species native to North America are susceptible to this insect-pathogen complex. We studied the suitability of ‘current’ (1970–2000) and future climates (2021–2100) in Canada and the United States for these two species via ensemble species distribution models. We also determined overlapping regions favorable to both I. typographus and E. polonica. Our results indicate that, currently, climate is particularly suitable for I. typographus and E. polonica in western Canada and throughout the United States. Northward shifts in climatic suitability are projected to occur in Canada for both species under climate change. By the end of the 21st century, a coast-to-coast corridor of climatic suitability for I. typographus and E. polonica will occur in Canada under high-temperature regimes.

T2  - Remote Sensing
AB  - While for most of a landscape, urbanization leads to a significant habitat loss, rivers in urban areas are usually maintained or developed for their drainage function. Rivers are often the most important biophysical and ecological connection of cities with their surrounding ecosystems, although usually heavily altered due to urban impacts. For the conservation of urban rivers as ecological corridors, it is important to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality. In this study, we used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs) habitat quality model to assess the individual and combined impacts of built-up areas, first- and second-order road and water pollution from urban drainage, and wastewater discharge on habitat quality within a 200 m wide river corridor. The Pochote River in León, Nicaragua, was used as a case study. Our results show the spatial distribution and magnitude of the individual threat impacts, as well as the respective contribution of each threat to the overall impact of urbanization on the habitat quality within the river corridor. While close to the city center, all threats almost equally contributed to severe habitat degradation, while further downstream, an individual threat influence became more distinct with only water pollution having a consistent negative impact. We concluded that the InVEST habitat quality model can be used to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality in river corridors at a high spatial resolution. The results can help to improve urban planning and development to improve habitat conservation along urban rivers.

TI  - Riparian woody plant diversity, composition, and structure across an urban-rural land use gradient in the Piedmont of Georgia, United States
AU  - Burton, Michele L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. Understanding the impacts of urbanization on riparian forests is critical because riparian areas provide a variety of important ecological services and are biological hotspots for species diversity. The overall goal of this work was to describe the relationships among landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, species composition, and plant functional traits of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. The objectives were to: (1) examine the influence of land use and urbanization indices on riparian woody plant species diversity and composition, (2) quantify changes in riparian forest structure across an urban-rural gradient, (3) elucidate changes in woody plant functional traits along an urban-rural gradient, and (4) compare trends in diversity, composition, structure, and trait characteristics in the mature forest stand and forest tree regeneration. This work demonstrates that changes in species diversity, composition, and structure are occurring in response to land use and the surrounding landscape matrix. Non-native invasive species appear to be driving many of the changes, specifically the shrub,  Ligustrum sinense. Species richness was positively correlated to rural landscape characteristics and negatively related to urban characteristics. Shannon diversity was negatively associated with dominance of non-native species, especially for the forest regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native species and several pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense, and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, the unmanaged forest type exhibited a structurally distinct midstory. Midstory tree biomass was positively related to forest cover and negatively related to impervious surface cover and shrub biomass was positively related to patch density. Urban and agriculture sites showed signs of recruitment failure. Species functional traits also varied across the gradient. Specifically, differences in leaf type, plant form, flood and shade tolerance, seed dispersal, pollination, growth rate, rooting characteristics, and life span were found. Flood tolerance was strongly reduced in the regeneration layer in urban riparian areas suggesting a potential shift in hydrologic function. Results from this study highlight the impact of urbanization on riparian forest plant biodiversity and structure.

TI  - The persistence of prairie dogs within urban habitat islands in the Colorado Front Range
AU  - Magle, Seth B.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I investigated the ecology of black-tailed prairie dogs in fragmented urban habitat in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. My study area consisted of 387 habitat fragments, 54 of which were colonized by prairie dogs. These fragments were highly isolated and surrounded by roads and development, and my studies represent the first studies of prairie dogs in highly urban environments. I evaluate the interactions between urban prairie dogs and vegetation and find that prairie dogs in urban areas tend to be present on sites with high grass coverage, though the grass layer is reduced in the immediate vicinity of the colonies. Prairie dogs interact with vegetation similarly in urban areas and natural habitat, providing evidence that the ecological role of prairie dogs as keystone species may be partly retained in human-dominated landscapes. I provide the first study using mark-resight methodology to evaluate the local population density of prairie dogs, and find it more accurate than traditional methods of burrow counts or visual indices. I observed extremely high densities for prairie dogs in urban settings, probably because of a fence effect where animals are restricted to available habitat due to the difficulty of dispersal in an urban environment. I compare connectivity metrics to determine which have the best predictive power for the occurrence of colonies in this area, and find that complex methods incorporating area of patches and cost-weighted distance surfaces perform best. In general, inclusion of biological information improves the ability of metrics to predict wildlife distribution. This study provides a rare opportunity to compare the performance of connectivity metrics using empirical data on wildlife distribution and will be of benefit to future spatial and landscape analyses. Finally, I evaluate a series of landscape and local variables to determine which have the most importance to the distribution of prairie dogs across our study system. Fragment area and local variables such as litter coverage have the most explanatory power, but all tested metrics had importance to prairie dog occurrence. My results can be used to target potential habitat for prairie dog conservation and to inform future research on wildlife in urban areas.

AB  - Background As urban areas expand, scientists now agree that the city is an important space for biodiversity conservation. Yet, still relatively little is known about how urban forms could have a differential impact on terrestrial species and ecosystems. If some reviews have been conducted to examine the link between biodiversity and urban characteristics at an infra-city scale, none have explored the relationship between urban organization and biodiversity and tried to assess the capacity of various urban forms to maintain and possibly favour flora and fauna in the city. The resulting map will present the state of knowledge regarding possible relationships between urban forms and its features on the establishment and settlement of terrestrial and temperate biodiversity at infra-city scale in western cities.Methods The systematic map will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) Guidelines. We will collect the relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature in French and English language. The scientific literature will be retrieved with the use of a search string in two publication databases, one environmental and one social science database (Web Of Science Core Collection, and Cairn.info). We will also perform supplementary searches (search engines, call for literature, search for relevant reviews). All references will be screened for relevance using a three-stage process, according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. Our study will concentrate on urban areas at the infra-city scale in cities of the temperate biogeographical zone. The subject population will include terrestrial species and ecosystems, except for archaea and bacteria. The exposure will consider all types of urban forms described by any urban descriptors or measures including heterogeneity, fragmentation, housing density, organisation of urban matrix, urban fabric) and all types of urban features (e.g. size, age of the buildings, materials, urban artefacts). All relevant outcomes will be considered (e.g. species richness, abundance, behaviour). We will provide an open-access database of the studies included in the map. Our results will also be presented narratively, together with tables and graphs summarising the key information coded from the retained articles (e.g. study characteristics, types and areas of research that has been undertaken, types of exposure, population concerned, etc.).

TI  - Spatial movements and ecology of mountain lions in southern Arizona
AU  - Nicholson, Kerry Lynn
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Managing wildlife in urban areas is increasingly necessary for wildlife conservation. Large carnivores like mountain lions ( Puma concolor) present a particular challenge to managers because of public safety and the polarizing emotional reactions to human-lion encounters. Intensive development and conversion of large open spaces to small properties and subdivisions has caused increased habitat loss, fragmentation and encroachment. Preserving movement corridors for access to habitat patches is important in maintaining landscape connectivity to ensure viable populations adjacent to urban areas. Because mountain lion habitat is often adjacent to urbanization in Arizona and lions traverse large landscapes, mountain lions are ideal models to examine how human alteration of habitats influences their life history characteristics and ability to adapt to a variety of environments. The objective of this study was to examine the ecology and spatial movements of mountain lions surrounding urban areas. We studied habitat selection, urban use by mountain lions, spatial movements and overlap, genetic relatedness, feline disease, and ectoparasites of mountain lions in southern Arizona.

TI  - Status and Conservation of the Grass Snake in Jersey
AU  - Ward, Robert John
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Global biodiversity losses are being driven by anthropogenic pressures; the most pervasive of which is habitat loss resulting in fragmentation and population isolation. These issues are prevalent throughout Europe due to high intensity agriculture and increasing human population densities. Limitations imposed by resources and the secretive lifestyles of many species hinder the ability of conservationists to undertake status assessments and identify conservation actions. This thesis investigates the threats to an isolated population of grass snakes Natrix helvetica on the island of Jersey, providing recommendations for conservation management and recovery, whilst testing the suitability of tools for monitoring cryptic species. Grass snakes were historically widespread throughout Jersey; however, anthropogenic influences have restricted their distribution to the west and southwest. Furthermore, recent monitoring efforts have detected few individuals and their status is unknown.Intensive surveys to locate individuals combined with occupancy and N-mixture (abundance) models identified continued occupancy of semi-natural sites in the island's west and southwest, but also highlighted poor detectability of the species unless utilising a large survey effort. Therefore, a large amount of effort is required to determine absence of snakes, and declines in the population cannot be detected with reasonable power. Occupancy models were more reliable than N-mixture models, particularly due to the risks of closure violation when estimating abundance. Nonetheless, N-mixture models estimated an abundance of 48 snakes (95% CI: 23?1279) across the study sites. Radio-tracking also provided evidence for low detection rates. Additionally snakes demonstrated small ranges (mean: 2.48 ha ± 3.54 SD), site fidelity, preferences for ranges close to paths and compost heaps, but avoided crossing roads. Snakes were positively associated with structurally complex habitats including rough grassland, dense scrub and gorse at multiple spatial scales, but negatively with open and wooded habitats.Species distribution modelling indicated similar habitat preferences to radio-tracking and poor suitability of agricultural habitats. Areas close to amphibian prey populations were also suitable whereas those with high road densities were not. A fifth of Jersey contained priority conservation areas, however almost 90% of these areas do not receive statutory protection. Those in the west and southwest should be prioritised for protection due to their proximity to extant subpopulations. Mitochondrial genes identified the population to belong to a western lineage of grass snakes Natrix helvetica helvetica, with a probable natural colonisation prior to separation from northwest France. Within Jersey, microsatellite markers identified three subpopulations, with significant differentiation between snakes in the south and west. This coincides with a dense urban area, through which connectivity needs improvement.The Jersey grass snake population can be classified as regionally Vulnerable (D2) under IUCN guidelines. The study illustrates how nature reserves are important for maintaining isolated subpopulations and the potential avenues by which statutory protection, sympathetic management practices and efforts to improve inter-reserve connectivity can contribute to conservation objectives.

AU  - Burrus, Roxanne Grace
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - House fly, Musca domestica L., dispersal up to 3 km from a dairy release site into a nearby town was documented in this study. Dispersal occurred by both direct flight across multiple, mixed habitat types including open fields with interspersed tree copses, and by corridors and edges provided by local roads. Marked flies were collected at an adjacent dairy, and at most traps that were set along two well-travelled roads connecting the dairies and the town. Additionally, one marked fly was captured on a trap that was placed outside of a restaurant in town 3 km from the release site. In total, 0.67% (250) of marked house flies were recaptured from a total release of 37,200 marked flies over 11 wk.Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated from two dairies in north-central Florida using immunomagnetic separation followed by direct culture plating onto CHROMAgar and sorbitol MacConkey agar supplemented with potassium tellurite and cefixime (CT-SMAC) selective media. Presumptive identification of E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the fliCH7 and rfbEO157 gene amplification.Dairy samples that were tested included pools of house flies, spilled grain, and fresh dairy cattle manure. Forty-two percent (24/57) of samples were positive by direct-culture using both CHROMAgar and CT-SMAC agar, with 11 positive samples from CHROMAgar and 13 positive samples from CT-SMAC agar. The 24 positive samples were submitted to PCR; of those 24 samples, 14 (58%) were confirmed by PCR. Two of the PCR-confirmed samples were false-negatives on CHROMAgar media, but presumptive positive on CT-SMAC media, indicating the importance of analyzing samples by more than one method, and demonstrating the sensitivity of PCR.Direct culture prevalence rates from CHROMAgar were 14.0% (8/57) for house flies, 5.3% (3/57) for grain, and 0% (0/57) for manure. The rate of CHROMAgar isolation of E. coli O157:H7 from house flies was 2.6 times greater than from grain. The PCR confirmation rates were 67% (8/12) for house flies, 56% (5/9) for grain and 33% (1/3) for manure. These data suggest that detection of E. coli O157:H7 on dairies might be more accurately determined by testing house flies instead of grain or manure samples, regardless of which isolation method is utilized.Flies are easy to collect and process, and because they disperse into urban areas, they provide valuable information regarding a mobile element for pathogen transmission that is lacking in grain and manure samples. House flies should be an important consideration in the design of a pathogen monitoring program on dairies.

T2  - Forests
AB  - Global tree cover products are widely used in analyses of deforestation, fragmentation, and connectivity, but are rarely critically assessed. Inaccuracies in these products could have consequences for future decision making, especially in data-poor regions like the tropics. In this study, potential biases in global and regional tree cover products were assessed across a diverse tropical country, Costa Rica. Two global tree cover products and one regional national forest cover map were evaluated along biophysical gradients in elevation, precipitation, and agricultural land cover. To quantify product accuracy and bias, freely available high-resolution imagery was used to validate tree and land cover across these gradients. Although the regional forest cover map was comparable in accuracy to a widely-used global forest map (the Global Forest Change of Hansen et al., also known as the GFC), another global forest map (derived from a cropland dataset) had the highest accuracy. Both global and regional forest cover products showed small to severe biases along biophysical gradients. Unlike the regional map, the global GFC map strongly underestimated tree cover (>10% difference) below 189 mm of precipitation and at elevations above 2000 m, with a larger bias for precipitation. All map products misclassified agricultural fields as forest, but the GFC product particularly misclassified row crops and perennial erect crops (banana, oil palm, and coffee), with maximum tree cover in agricultural fields of 89%–100% across all crops. Our analysis calls into further question the utility of the GFC product for global forest monitoring outside humid regions, indicating that, in tropical regions, the GFC product is most accurate in areas with high, aseasonal rainfall, low relief, and low cropland area. Given that forest product errors are spatially distributed along biophysical gradients, researchers should account for these spatial biases when attempting to analyze or generate forest map products.

T2  - International Journal of Conservation Science
AB  - Remnant habitat patches can provide ideal space for conservation of native flora in agricultural and urban landscapes. Graveyards are ideals for such conservation actions if they are managed scientifically. Present study analyzed current status of the tree diversity and related issues of the graveyards from Tehsil Mansehra for their utilization in native tree conservation. Random sampling was made through 35 vegetation stands covering 35 graveyards occupying 35 Union Councils. Total 56 species including 35 trees and 21 shrubs, belonging to 46 genera and 31 families were documented from study sites including 44 naturally growing and 12 planted species. Total 2645 mature trees and 2532 regenerating trees were counted, and 14 tree species shows high rate of regeneration. Presence of noxious invasive tree Broussonetia papyrifera and Ailanthus altissima however stipulated the active management of such remnant habitats because of severe invasion threats. Involvement of the local communities can effectively result in utilization of the graveyards as steppingstones and functional corridors in rapidly intensifying urban areas and agricultural lands. Such approach can be applied to other areas for identification and utilization of remnant habitats in plant conservation.

AB  - Urban development has major impacts on connectivity among wildlife populations and is thus likely an important factor shaping pathogen transmission in wildlife. However, most investigations of wildlife diseases in urban areas focus on prevalence and infection risk rather than potential effects of urbanization on transmission itself. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a directly transmitted retrovirus that infects many felid species and can be used as a model for studying pathogen transmission at landscape scales. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among FIV isolates sampled from five bobcat (Lynx rufus) populations in coastal southern California that appear isolated due to major highways and dense urban development. Divergence dates among FIV phylogenetic lineages in several cases reflected historical urban growth and construction of major highways. We found strong FIV phylogeographic structure among three host populations north‐west of Los Angeles, largely coincident with host genetic structure. In contrast, relatively little FIV phylogeographic structure existed among two genetically distinct host populations south‐east of Los Angeles. Rates of FIV transfer among host populations did not vary significantly, with the lack of phylogenetic structure south‐east of Los Angeles unlikely to reflect frequent contemporary transmission among populations. Our results indicate that major barriers to host gene flow can also act as barriers to pathogen spread, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility of fragmented populations to novel directly transmitted pathogens. Infrequent exchange of FIV among host populations suggests that populations would best be managed as distinct units in the event of a severe disease outbreak. Phylogeographic inference of pathogen transmission is useful for estimating the ability of geographic barriers to constrain disease spread and can provide insights into contemporary and historical drivers of host population connectivity.

AB  - Nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) is Indonesian native tree species originating from Maluku Island, especially Ambon and Banda. The spread of nutmeg in Bogor area can be traced back to the Dutch colonial period when different kinds of spices were traded across the Indonesian archipelago and beyond. Having this long history, nutmeg is now widely used in Bogor’s culinary. At the national level, it has high economic value and become one of Indonesia’s main export products. However, there is little research on nutmeg tree spatial distribution. The objectives of the study were : (1) identify the nutmeg trees spatial distribution in Bogor city (2) mapping the existence and identification of nutmeg trees conditions and growing environment. This research was conducted Bogor City from February - May 2018. The data was obtained through direct interview, study field, and study literature. Data collection is determined based on the distribution of nutmeg trees in Bogor City, and extinct status based on study literature. Furtehermore, the existence of nutmeg trees in Bogor collected used purposive and snowball technique. The results showed that a total of 108 nutmeg trees were found in all sub-districts of Bogor city. These trees grow in a variety of areas such as green corridor, public park, agriculture farm, riverbanks, yard, office park, and cemetery. The results of this study can be used as the basis for determining the preservation strategy and area for nutmeg conservation in Bogor city.

AB  - Competitive interactions between species are fundamental to understanding species assemblages, community dynamics, and ecological processes. Anthropogenic landscape change, particularly resulting from urbanization, can alter interspecific interactions; however, different forms of urbanization are predicted to have contrasting effects on competitive interactions. We developed contact networks between bobcats and pumas to evaluate (1) the potential for interspecific interactions between wild felids and (2) how space‐use metrics might change along the urban gradient, including low‐density exurban development, wildland–urban interface, and wildland habitat, at both the population and individual level. We used an extensive telemetry data set for bobcats and pumas across multiple study areas to evaluate four space‐use metrics: space‐use overlap (used to define potential interactions among animals) and three additional contact network metrics, including degree (the number of potentially interacting animals), in‐strength (sum of space‐use overlap for animals), and equivalent social connectivity (ESC; considering both space‐use extent and the amount of space‐use overlap). Space‐use extent was an important predictor of potential social interactions as measured by space‐use metrics. Bobcats appeared to have a greater opportunity to interact with female pumas based on space‐use overlap, degree, and in‐strength, which demonstrates that relative scale of space‐use extent among animals could be important for understanding interactions; ESC, however, was greater between bobcats and male pumas, likely due to the larger space‐use extent by male compared to female pumas and the positive relationship between space‐use extent and ESC. In addition, pumas and male bobcats exhibited a greater opportunity to interact, based on space‐use overlap, degree, and in‐strength, and demonstrated higher ESC compared to female bobcats. Counter to our predictions, felids associated with urbanized grids or with greater amounts of urbanization in their extent of space use did not appear to exhibit greater values of space‐use metrics compared to animals with less exposure to urbanization; these results appear consistent with previous research evaluating population characteristics of felids across broad scales in our study areas. Greater ESC for male pumas and male bobcats suggests that males could be particularly important for facilitating connectivity of some ecological processes, such as the transmission of disease, through interspecific contact networks.

TI  - Medium and large mammal conservation in the City of Cape Town: factors influencing species richness in urban nature reserves
AU  - Schnetler, Andrea K
AU  - Radloff Frans G T
AU  - O’Riain M Justin
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32–8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean ± SD = 7 ± 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

TI  - Spatial models of morning commute consistent with realistic traffic behavior
AU  - Lago, Alejandro
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban planners are increasingly concerned about the sprawling suburban development in metropolitan areas around the world, which they often blame for growing traffic congestion and excessive highway investment needs. This dissertation seeks to shed light on this issue by studying the relationship between morning commute congestion and urban form. The causes and consequences of traffic congestion have been extensively studied in the economics and engineering literatures. Unfortunately, most conclusions have been drawn from very idealized models, which either fail to consider adequately the spatial nature of congestion, by neglecting the effects of physical queues and merging interactions, or overlook dynamic aspects, such as commuters' departure time adaptation during the rush-hour. To better capture the spatial-dynamic nature of morning commute traffic, this dissertation proposes a new analytical framework that explicitly incorporates  spatially distributed commuter origins, realistic traffic behavior and commuter timing decisions. The work combines the departure-time equilibrium theory (as first proposed by Vickrey [1969]) with the spatial model of traffic dynamics of Newell [1993] and the model of merge traffic interactions of Daganzo [1994, 1995a]. Focus is placed on idealized urban configurations, where traffic behavior can be studied analytically and general insights can be gained. We first study the equilibrium problem in a stylized two-origin network. This enables us to understand the fundamental role of merging bottlenecks and queue spillovers when commuters have different origins. The analysis is then extended to model congestion behavior in long freeway corridors and monocentric cities. We develop an exact procedure to solve the dynamic departure-time equilibrium for single-destination freeway tree networks. Solutions are characterized for cases with and without an alternative street network. The results show that the location-based congestion cost is very dependent on the spatial behavior of queues and that congestion can be reduced by altering the freeway access priorities given to different origins. At the same time, urban sprawl is shown to contribute not only to larger travelled distances but also to increased overall delays. Sprawl effects, however, are not as severe as often assumed. We finally propose some closed-form continuous approximations for the location-based congestion cost. These formulae provide an improved and simple representation of the dependence of congestion on the spatial distribution of population that can be easily incorporated to study policy issues. The design of more effective measures to reduce congestion and control urban development is an immediate example.

AB  - Body size is intrinsically linked to metabolic rate and life-history traits, and is a crucial determinant of food webs and community dynamics. The increased temperatures associated with the urban-heat-island effect result in increased metabolic costs and are expected to drive shifts to smaller body sizes. Urban environments are, however, also characterized by substantial habitat fragmentation, which favours mobile species. Here, using a replicated, spatially nested sampling design across ten animal taxonomic groups, we show that urban communities generally consist of smaller species. In addition, although we show urban warming for three habitat types and associated reduced community-weighted mean body sizes for four taxa, three taxa display a shift to larger species along the urbanization gradients. Our results show that the general trend towards smaller-sized species is overruled by filtering for larger species when there is positive covariation between size and dispersal, a process that can mitigate the low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. We thus demonstrate that the urban-heat-island effect and urban habitat fragmentation are associated with contrasting community-level shifts in body size that critically depend on the association between body size and dispersal. Because body size determines the structure and dynamics of ecological networks, such shifts may affect urban ecosystem function.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Anthropogenic change, specifically urbanization, has lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Past work has linked green space variables and socioeconomic characteristics with biodiversity in urban areas. Shrinking cities present an interesting case for studying biodiversity because many of these places have implemented demolition policies to remove vacant buildings from the landscape, which returns previously urbanized land back into a “natural” state. The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on “citizen science” data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds. We also found that areas that have undergone considerable demolition may be a potential deterrent to eBird participation, and eBird users may create bias by sampling areas with greater green space connectivity, and thus higher richness.

TI  - Urbanization drivers differentially affect ground arthropod assemblages in the city of Turin (NW-Italy)
AU  - Piano, Elena
AU  - Bona, Francesca
AU  - Isaia, Marco
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanization is a complex process associated with environmental changes affecting many biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, which cause the alteration of biological communities, habitat features, connectivity and stability. In particular, the urbanization process is usually associated with a decrease in species richness that parallels a general increase in the overall abundance of individuals, mostly due to generalist and tolerant species taking advantage of the altered environmental conditions and outcompeting and excluding native species. We here adopted a hierarchically nested sampling design to investigate the response of ground arthropods to the combined effects of multiple facets of urbanization, namely increased impervious surface cover, temperature and patch isolation, measured at small, intermediate and large spatial scale. We studied 15 plots of 150 m in diameter located in the city of Turin (NW-Italy), along an urbanization-cover gradient ranging from suburbia to the city center. For each plot we considered the level of urbanization at three different scales (circular buffers with a 100, 400 and 1600 m radius). Within each plot, we identified a control and an isolated subplot, and in each subplot, we measured ground temperature using dataloggers and we sampled ground arthropods with pitfall traps. Firstly, by relating ground temperature and urbanization cover, we showed that temperature values reflected an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which indicates increasing values of temperature along the urbanization gradient. This trend was particularly evident at large scale regarding daily and diurnal temperature, and at small scale regarding nocturnal temperature. Secondly, we demonstrated that different groups of ground arthropods respond differently to urbanization cover, with major effects at the largest spatial scale. Finally, we extrapolated the differential contribution of urbanization cover, UHI-effect and patch isolation to the observed activity density of the investigated taxonomic groups: Coleoptera and Hemiptera were influenced by temperature, whereas Hymenoptera, Collembola, Acari and Araneae were mainly influenced by urbanization, especially in control subplots. Our results emphasize how a multitaxonomic approach can help unravel patterns of community assembly in urban areas.

AU  - De Vos, Alta
AU  - Cumming, Graeme S
T2  - People and Nature
AB  - The relationship between diversity and resilience is relatively well‐established for ecological systems, but remains much less explored for socio‐economic systems. Institutional diversity can have particular relevance for protected areas, whose managerial responses to environmental change depend on their legal basis, ability to make and enforce rules and socio‐political acceptance and endorsement.Protected area expansion strategies are increasingly turning to private land conservation to increase the configuration and connectivity of national protected area networks. Yet, we know little about the relative role of privately owned protected areas in protecting threatened and poorly protected (under‐represented) habitats, and in the overall connectivity of the national protected area network.We present an empirical assessment of protected area tenure diversity across South Africa.Privately owned protected areas comprise 25.58% (2,878,422.26 ha) of the area of the total protected area estate.Private nature reserves emerged as the dominant protected area type in under‐represented and threatened habitats, protecting, on average, 32%, 38% and 41%, respectively, of poorly protected, threatened and endangered vegetation classes.Private nature reserves had the largest overall effect, compared to other protected area types, on connectivity within the national network. A spatially randomized comparison showed that privately owned protected areas are overdispersed and more strategically positioned to connect other types of protected areas than would be expected by chance from their extent and abundance.Our results suggest that privately owned protected areas enhance the resilience of the national protected area network, making it more extensive and better‐connected, with greater levels of habitat redundancy. More generally, our analysis highlights the potentially valuable role of institutional diversity in building resilient habitat networks for biodiversity conservation.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.

T2  - Hystrix
AB  - With cities growing at a rapid pace, animal species must either retreat to patches of intact natural habitat or adapt to novel conditions in urban areas. While this disturbance causes most species to be in local decline, some show specific behavioural plasticity, facilitating success in a new habitat. The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a common small mammal species which occurs in high numbers in urban environments. To determine which characteristics enable its success, we investigated space use and activity budgets of seven free-ranging individuals living in semi-natural and urban habitats within a large city. We did not find significant differences in animals’ space use between habitat types but tendencies towards smaller home ranges and increased home range overlap existed among individuals in the urban site. Squirrels differed between sites in both overall activity levels and temporal activity patterns: urban animals spent less time active and activity onset was later compared to semi-natural conspecifics. This is likely explained by a combination of dense and reliable supplementary food sources in the urban habitat, reducing foraging effort, and restrictions to movement imposed by higher fragmentation. Flexibility in space use and activity budgets, as well as the ability to exploit anthropogenic food sources and tolerate reduced habitat connectivity, are likely the most important factors contributing to the squirrels’ success in cities. Accordingly, these traits could be used as indicators of low sensitivity towards urbanisation when assessing other species’ potential resilience. However, they do not immunise squirrels against extirpation. Further research on individuals’ foraging ecology and population health may reveal possible threats to urban red squirrels and help predict their future persistence in this challenging habitat.

TI  - Movement behaviour and distribution of forest songbirds in an expanding urban landscape
AU  - Tremblay, Marie Anne
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is viewed as a major threat to global biodiversity because of its role in the loss and fragmentation of low-lying, productive habitats associated with coastal plains and river valleys. My study examines the effects of urbanization on the movements and distribution of songbirds in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I conducted playback and translocation experiments to assess the permeability of small-scale (e.g. transportation corridors, rivers) and large-scale (e.g. multi-lane expressways, areas of urban development) features of the urban landscape, respectively. I then used these empirical data to parameterize spatially explicit models and determine functional landscape connectivity across the study area. Finally, using point surveys conducted at 183 sites across the urban matrix, I examined the role of land cover type, local vegetation characteristics, landscape-level forest cover, and isolation from natural features on the distribution of songbirds. In 563 playback trials involving the responses of 2241 birds, I found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement across linear features; the likelihood of movement sharply decreasing as the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m. The results of 176 translocation trials provided further evidence of the barrier effect of gaps. Multiple gaps, in particular, constrained the movements of both yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) and black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). The bird surveys revealed that natural forest stands played a critical role in sustaining regional avian diversity in the study area. Moreover, functional distance to the nearest forested natural area or water body often explained more variation in the probability of occurrence of focal species than straight-line distance, suggesting that barriers identified from the permeability experiments may have affected not only the movements of songbirds but their settlement patterns as well. Taken together, my results suggest that preserving a functionally connected network of natural areas is vital to conserving avian biodiversity in cities. My research describes novel methodologies for characterizing the composition and configuration of highly heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. It also provides a unique examination of the link between the movement behaviour of individual birds and population-level distribution patterns within this context.

AU  - Ramírez-Álvarez, Diego

AU  - Salgado, Iván
T2  - Animals
AB  - Simple SummaryThe presence of carnivores near human settlements is a poorly studied topic that generates concern and perception of risk in some human communities, especially for medium to large felids. Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human–carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes.AbstractThe wildland–urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes—creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O’Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km2 of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human–carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.

TI  - Active Citizenship in Green Space Governance
AU  - Mattijssen, Thomas
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - BackgroundThe role of authorities in green space decision-making and management is increasingly supplemented with activities from citizens. Research has shown how citizens across Europe nowadays engage in a wide variety of practices to accomplish their green space-related objectives. In this way, citizens contribute to the management of protected natural areas, rural landscapes and urban green spaces.The current focus on active citizenship in green space governance brings about important debates. This includes discussions about how to best govern and protect our green spaces. There are also democratic debates about the roles and responsibilities of different actors in green space governance. While citizens potentially contribute towards the realization of public policy, their objectives can also clash with the formal responsibilities and preferences of authorities. There might also be tensions between and inequalities among citizens.Thesis aims and research questionsThis PhD-project specifically focuses on forms of governance in which active citizens play a leading role in realizing, protecting and/or managing public green space. The main research aim is to contribute to scientific and societal debates on active citizenship in green space by studying its relevance for the governance, management and protection of green space. For this purpose, four main research questions have been formulated to address four main knowledge gaps regarding the involvement of active citizens in green space governance:• What are the overall scope and key characteristics of active citizenship in green space governance?• What are the benefits and co-benefits of different types of active citizenship in green space governance?• What factors contribute to or constrain the long-term continuity of active citizenship in green space governance?• How can the transformative potential of active citizenship in green space governance be understood?Research approachThis PhD-research focuses on the study of daily practices that involve active citizens in green space governance. To do so, this thesis departs from the Policy Arrangement Approach (PAA) and enriches it with elements from practice theory in order to tailor it towards this study of daily practices.The Policy Arrangement Approach is an established analytical framework used to study the governance of natural resources through four analytical dimensions: actors (those involved in governance), discourse (the content and verbal aspects of governance), rules (guiding principles that govern actions of actors) and resources (tools and skills used to achieve certain outcomes). By adopting elements from practice theory this thesis adds a focus on human activities as a fifth dimension. It also adds a stronger recognition of the constitutive role of materiality in practices and an emphasis on the ends to which practitioners orient their activities.I argue that a deeper understanding of the role and relevance of active citizenship in green space governance requires both a broader overview of the scope of these practices and a deeper understanding of specific practices. In order to do so, I used a 3-layered framework for this thesis. This started with a broad inventory and analysis of 264 different practices in order to gain an overview of their characteristics and diversity. The second layer progressed upon this with a detailed qualitative analysis of a subsample of 50 practices in order to gain more reliable knowledge and a deeper understanding of these practices. In the third layer, four case studies have been conducted to gain in-depth knowledge on a number of specific issues.The scope and key characteristics of active citizenshipWhen I started with this thesis, there was a scarcity of good quality baseline data on the nature and diversity of active citizenship in green space governance. The analysis of 264 examples of active citizenship across the Netherlands in layer one of this thesis gives a good overview of the variety of ways in which active citizens engage in green space governance. They for example aim to protect the habitat of an endangered species or manage land within a nature reserve. However, improving social cohesion through community gardening or providing access to a woodland can be important objectives just as well. Active citizenship in the green domain thus often works across traditional policy silos and crosses borders between nature, culture and social domains.This study on the scope and key characteristics of active citizenship highlights that most of the practices in which citizens engage are small scale; they are usually limited to local areas spanning no more than a few hectares, and often much less. Most of the active citizenship in green space governance takes place outside of protected reserves, often in (peri-)urban areas. It also shows that citizens do not always engage in the actual management of green space. In contrast to most previous studies, this research highlights the additional relevance of political activities such as lobbying and protesting, as these activities are important means for citizens to accomplish their objectives.Active citizenship is often linked with other actors in the public domain. Citizens often cooperate with local authorities and NGOs, and occasionally also with business actors such as farmers. Funding from local authorities can be an important source of income, as well as sponsoring by companies and private donations. In many practices, involved citizens donate their own money and sometimes revenues are generated through delivering products and services.The benefits and co-benefits of active citizenshipThe detailed qualitative analysis in layer two addresses a lack of insight into the outcomes produced by active citizens. This makes it difficult to comprehend the implications of a shift towards active citizenship for the natural environment and the population.The analysis shows how the large majority of the 50 practices contribute towards ecological benefits, such as biodiversity, urban greening, landscape restoration, expansion of green space areas, or species protection. This large majority also contributes towards socio-economic co-benefits, such as environmental awareness and the use functions of green space (accessibility, recreation, amenity). Other cobenefits relate to social cohesion, food production, employment and the protection of cultural aspects of the landscape. The exact benefits and co-benefits strongly depend on the type of practice.The practices in this study generally generate benefits on a much smaller scale than those of authorities and large NGOs. While green self-governance does contribute towards realizing environmental and social objectives, this contribution is therefore mostly of local relevance. It is also important to be aware of potential tensions between benefits and co-benefits related to the activities of active citizens, for instance when an increase in recreation negatively affects biodiversity. Furthermore, citizens are not always successful in accomplishing their objectives and the activities of citizens can also produce outcomes considered as negative.The long-term continuity of active citizenshipIn the studies in layer one and two citizens expressed concerns about the longterm continuity of active citizenship in green space governance. This was an important motivation for me to conduct three European case studies into placekeeping, the long-term responsive management of places, in order to preserve the qualities and benefits that a place offers.These cases show how citizens can manage public green spaces over multiple decades. While similar examples are rare, such cases can provide important inspiration for other groups that aim to protect certain green values in the long term. They show how citizens can develop an inspiring idea, mobilize fellow citizens, realize a green space and maintain it over time. Even so, these studies also highlight how even after several decades, groups still struggle to continue their activities. Changing policies such as declining subsidies, urban development such as encroachment, and the ageing of volunteers all put pressure on the continuity of citizens’ activities.A number of important lessons for continuity can be distilled from these cases. First of all, long-term continuity is supported by a degree of formalization: established rules and internal procedures provide stability to citizens. Secondly, the importance of adaptive capacity is also underlined: citizens need to be able to respond and adapt to political, socio-economic and cultural developments over time. Third, authorities play a key role in place-keeping by citizens: their longterm support can provide stability to citizens, but they can also constrain citizens when they change their policies.The transformative potential of active citizenshipTensions between the activities of citizens and the role of authorities are manifest throughout this thesis. Prior research shows that active citizens are often hindered by institutions and often face difficulties in scaling up beyond the local level. I therefore conducted an in-depth case study on how citizens can transform practices in governance and reshape the relationship between citizens and (local) authorities.This fourth and final case study shows how discourses and activities promoted by citizens became embedded in spatial planning and green space management. This instigated institutional changes, and showcases a transformative potential in both substance (redevelopment of a green space) and governance (co-creation). Yet, this study also highlights the persisting influence of institutionalized rules and procedures. Institutional change in local governance is often a slow and complex process, in which citizens need to align with the institutions that they want to change in order to be able to instigate these changes. This conditions the activities of citizens, reducing their autonomy.Even so, transformation in governance is not necessarily a matter of citizens striving to realize their objectives vis-à-vis authorities trying to realize theirs. Instead, this study shows that when certain ways of working are under pressure, when motivations align towards a shared end-goal, and when there is a shared sense of urgency, transformation can take place through co-creation between citizens and authorities. In this, the success of practices that involve active citizens in governance can clear the way for involvement of citizens in other practices, eventually instigating a gradual rather than disruptive change in how society is locally governed.DiscussionThis thesis shows how citizens can make an important contribution to the governance and management of green space. Most practices are currently situated outside protected nature reserves, but they can enhance urban greening and biodiversity in the city or ensure the conservation of cultural elements in the landscape. Even so, the contribution of citizens to (inter)national policy goals and ecological networks is still relatively small, as the outcomes of active citizenship in green space governance are mostly limited to the local scale level.In the long run, co-benefits of active citizenship in green space may increase people’s connection and involvement with nature, leading to increased support for environmental protection. With this, co-benefits can provide a first step towards the realization of more direct benefits for nature conservation. After all, practices with an explicit focus on co-benefits often also produce benefits - and vice-versa. Relating to co-benefits can therefore be an effective strategy for governments or environmental NGOs aiming to involve active citizens in their work.From a democratic point of view, critical scholars have highlighted how authorities prefer to deal with citizens whose objectives correspond with their own policy aims. While authorities often aim to promote active citizenship in their discourse, this will sometimes put them at odds with citizens who pursue different goals. Conflicts between citizens and authorities often manifest themselves in my work, but such notions are often overlooked in the political discourse, which tends to focus on cooperative forms of active citizenship. My work also reiterates citizens’ dependency on authorities and shows how the continuity of their activities can depend on the role of local governments.Scholars have also been critical of the exclusion of non-active citizens in these debates. Previous research has shown how certain societal groups are less represented in active citizenship, and there are ongoing debates about how the costs and benefits of active citizenship in the green domain are spatially distributed. Authorities still have an important task to represent everyone, also disengaged or less successful citizens, to make sure that everyone has the chance to enjoy the benefits offered by green space. The fragmented nature and local scale of active citizenship also point towards a need for a continued central role of authorities in safeguarding green space values and realizing ecological networks.In this, active citizenship can offer a valuable addition to what governments do, contributing important benefits and co-benefits to the environment and the population. By strategically supporting or collaborating with active citizens, authorities can strengthen their contribution to policy objectives and stimulate direct forms of democracy. Over the long term, authorities can support placekeeping by citizens by providing security via stable policies, formally protecting the involved spaces, allowing long-term management contracts and contributing resources.In this context, the adoption of a more polycentric and context-sensitive approach to green space governance can help authorities in achieving their policy objectives. The diversity of active citizenship does not match with generic ‘one-size-fitsall’ policy and governing approaches of authorities. Rather, it calls for a flexible role of authorities in governance: in some instances authorities should have a leading role, in other instances an enabling or facilitating role, and sometimes a collaborative approach to governance is called for – all of this with sensitivity to the local context.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5-20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure - through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity - but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

AB  - The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population abundance than small-scale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local extirpation of I. obesulus and other small- to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however, adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-active conservation approach is required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-term probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and currently relatively common species from becoming rare.

AB  - Urban development has major impacts on connectivity among wildlife populations and is thus likely an important factor shaping pathogen transmission in wildlife. However, most investigations of wildlife diseases in urban areas focus on prevalence and infection risk rather than potential effects of urbanization on transmission itself. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a directly transmitted retrovirus that infects many felid species and can be used as a model for studying pathogen transmission at landscape scales. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among FIV isolates sampled from five bobcat (Lynx rufus) populations in coastal southern California that appear isolated due to major highways and dense urban development. Divergence dates among FIV phylogenetic lineages in several cases reflected historical urban growth and construction of major highways. We found strong FIV phylogeographic structure among three host populations north‐west of Los Angeles, largely coincident with host genetic structure. In contrast, relatively little FIV phylogeographic structure existed among two genetically distinct host populations south‐east of Los Angeles. Rates of FIV transfer among host populations did not vary significantly, with the lack of phylogenetic structure south‐east of Los Angeles unlikely to reflect frequent contemporary transmission among populations. Our results indicate that major barriers to host gene flow can also act as barriers to pathogen spread, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility of fragmented populations to novel directly transmitted pathogens. Infrequent exchange of FIV among host populations suggests that populations would best be managed as distinct units in the event of a severe disease outbreak. Phylogeographic inference of pathogen transmission is useful for estimating the ability of geographic barriers to constrain disease spread and can provide insights into contemporary and historical drivers of host population connectivity.

TI  - Bee Community Response to Local and Landscape Factors along an Urban-Rural Gradient
AU  - Birdshire, Kristen R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Over a third of the world’s crops—including fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, and oilseed—require insect pollination. Reliance on the pollination services that promote these food products continues to rise due to increasing demands from growing human populations; therefore, it is imperative to understand the ecology of insect pollinators. While extensive research describes pollination services in both agricultural and urban settings, few studies examine pollinator activity along urban-rural gradients. Even fewer address how bees with different bee life history characteristics respond to urbanization, and to my knowledge, never from a high elevation semi-arid environment. This study documented different pollinator assemblages from 12 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used define the extent of urbanization. Wild bees were collected in the summer of 2017 and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Bee species’ life history characteristics were assigned to ecological guilds, and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Given findings from a similar study, I hypothesized that bee communities in urban landscapes would be dominated by smaller bees with more ecologically generalized characteristics (e.g., polylectic and eusocial) than bees in rural landscapes, which were hypothesized to contain bee communities with more specialized traits (e.g., oligolectic). Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. Moreover, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness, and negatively to the degree of urbanization in the landscape, suggesting that urbanization in the Denver metropolitan area is detrimental to entire bee communities. For the Denver metropolitan area, the findings suggest incorporating a greater diversity of floral species and increasing pollinator resource corridors throughout the city of Denver.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wrocław city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2–20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts in cities are becoming increasingly common worldwide and are a challenge to urban biodiversity management and landscape planning. In comparison to compensatory management, which often focuses on addressing emergency conflicts, precautionary management allows decision-makers to better allocate limited resources on prioritized areas and initiate long-term actions in advance. However, precautionary approaches have rarely been developed or applied in biodiversity conservation. Since 2020, human-raccoon dog conflicts in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the world, have tripled in reported number due to the rapid spread of the species in the city from 70 residential districts in 2020 to 249 residential districts in 2022. Here, we use ensemble and circuit modeling to predict suitable raccoon dog habitat and identify their potential dispersal pathways to aid the development of precautionary management strategies. We find that raccoon dog distribution is positively associated with several anthropogenic factors, including residential buildings and nighttime light, which could be signs that the species’ foraging behavior has adapted to the urban environment. We find that raccoon dogs only occupy 10.1% of its suitable habitat, and thus there is a high potential for the expansion of the raccoon dog population and more frequent human-raccoon dog conflicts in the near future. We predict 60 potential dispersal pathways across Shanghai, seven of which cross densely human populated areas and are likely to trigger excessive conflicts. Based on our findings, we propose priority areas where precautionary management strategies, such as constraining stray animal feeding and wildlife-vehicle collision prevention, would potentially alleviate human-raccoon dog conflicts. We present the first study on the precautionary approach of human-wildlife conflict in China’s major cities, and provide a practical example of how comprehensive modeling approaches can be used as the foundation of precautionary management in urban landscapes.

T2  - Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group)
AB  - The influence of urban structures and land use patterns of metropolitan cities on the distribution of contaminants is not well understood. In this study, two metropolitan cities [Jeddah (a typical corridor city) and Madinah (a typical compact city)], featuring different spreading patterns and urban structures, were selected to investigate the contamination level and potential risk caused by metals (i.e., Pb, Zn, Co, Fe, Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Mn) associated with urban dust. The findings of this study show that a metropolitan city with a limited variety of activities and a polar center (e.g., Madinah) displays a typical distribution pattern of metals, i.e., concentrations of metals increase gradually toward the center of the city. In contrast, a metropolitan city with multiple major activities (e.g., Jeddah) displays a different distribution pattern, controlled by multiple key actors (e.g., seaports, oil refineries, and desalination/power plants) able to shift the location of highest contamination away from the city center. The above findings are supported by the results of several contamination and health indices. In Jeddah, the highest Pb contamination was found near an oil refinery based on geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), and ecological risk (Ei) values; whereas, the highest Zn contamination was found near a seaport, based on EF, CF, and Ei values. However, in Madinah, the contamination indices indicate that the most contaminated locations are near the city center. The highest non-carcinogenic health risk in Jeddah was found near an oil refinery and in the city center; whereas in Madinah, it was found mainly in the city center. Although there is no significant risk of cancer due to metals associated with dust in the two cities, Cr, representing a health risk contribution of >24%, was the major contributor of non-carcinogenic health risk in the two metropolitan cities.

AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.

AB  - As linhas de água são sistemas de drenagem natural e elementos integrantes da paisagem. A presença permanente ou temporária de água origina um desenvolvimento de sistemas bióticos de grande diversidade e riqueza, com grande interesse em conservar. É na proteção dos espaços próximos de água que maiores proveitos se conseguem obter para a saúde humana e para a própria saúde da vegetação e da vida animal, e ainda no contributo para uma maior qualidade do ar, da água e do clima em geral.Ao longo da história, o Homem tentou desde sempre tirar o máximo partido da utilização, mais ou menos intensa, dos recursos e vantagens oferecidas pela proximidade aos cursos de água. Porém, uso intensivo e abusivo destes recursos conduziu à degradação dos ecossistemas ribeirinhos levando a uma destruição dos sistemas de drenagem natural sobretudo em áreas urbanas, destruição da flora, poluição difusa devido à utilização de fertilizantes e pesticidas na agricultura, bem como o lançamento de efluentes domésticos e industriais. Face à importância dos recursos hídricos, surge então a necessidade de os reabilitar.Neste contexto, pretende-se com esta dissertação elaborar uma proposta ao nível da bacia hidrográfica do rio Coina, no âmbito do ordenamento do território, abordando alguns conceitos fundamentais relacionados com a reabilitação de rios e ribeiras com vista à valorização das linhas de água e galerias ribeirinhas, contribuindo para o melhoramento do ambiente, da qualidade de vida e segurança em meio urbano. Serão propostas medidas que levem a uma melhor consolidação das margens e proteção contra a erosão, a uma melhoria da drenagem e funcionalidade da corrente, a uma maior manutenção da diversidade, conservação da flora e consequentemente da fauna, bem como à minimização da artificialização das margens. Com isto, pretende-se contribuir para o desenvolvimento sustentável do ecossistema indo ao encontro do equilíbrio da vida

AB  - Understanding how environmental changes driven by urbanization impact the biodiversity in urban riparian areas has great importance for landscape planning and river ecosystem conservation. There have been many studies on the response of bird communities to different environmental variables in urban parks; however, although supporting some of the highest bird diversities, case studies in urban riparian areas remain limited. In existing research, few studies have considered the impact of both local waterfront characteristics and surrounding environmental variables at a larger scale. In this study, we selected birds as the indicator to clarify their response to both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables in riparian areas of Tsing river, Beijing, in terms of (a) vegetation composition, (b) human disturbance, (c) land cover, and (d) landscape connectivity. We hypothesized that birds with different biological characteristics may respond differently to environmental variables. Birds were then further grouped according to the habitat type, residential type, and feeding type. It turned out that the coverage of grass and the disturbance of pedestrians are the most influential variables. Besides, compared with the land cover and landscape connectivity, the total contribution of vegetation characteristics and human disturbance accounts for the main proportion of explained variance. Information pertaining to these environmental variables can provide evidence to support bird conservation efforts in urban areas, and the identified distance threshold provides a basis for future landscape connectivity assessments.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide problem affecting wildlife negatively. Cities cause habitat suppression, fragmentation, among other disease spreading, suitable conditions for exotic species, and direct animal kills—consequently, local native species might be extinct. Still, urban areas can also provide biodiversity maintenance because some species can be adapted to the urban environment. Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix. By managing the spatial heterogeneity, it is possible to direct how the species use the space, promoting the displacement to desired areas, avoiding the more urbanized ones.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on the behavior, distribution, and conservation of forest birds
AU  - Minor, Emily Stuart
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is occurring rapidly around the world, but ecologists are just beginning to realize the effects on birds and other wildlife. This dissertation has two major goals: (1) to document some of the effects of human development on bird distributions and movement in the North Carolina Piedmont, and (2) to test and develop graph theory as a tool that can be used for habitat assessment and conservation in fragmented habitats. These issues are critical to explaining and predicting bird occurrences in today's landscapes and are important for both basic ecological research and management. The first portion of this dissertation uses empirical data collected from 272 point counts to quantify the effects of urbanization on forest songbirds. Initial results indicate that avian community composition varies across the study area with urban land cover and road density. However, an in-depth examination of the effects of roads on species abundance revealed that the importance of roads is simply an artifact of the vegetation and land cover changes that typically accompany them rather than a direct effect of the roads themselves. A final analysis of the field data considered the importance of roads and other land cover classes to bird movement in fragmented landscapes. Using alternative representations of bird dispersal behavior to predict species abundance, I showed that forest interior birds experience high dispersal cost through non-forest habitat but no cost of dispersing over roads. The second portion of this dissertation presents graph theory as a tool for understanding bird movement, distribution, and conservation in fragmented landscapes. I compare the performance of graph theory to a more computationallyand data-intense spatially explicit population model (SEPM) in selecting important habitat patches for conservation, and show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in some cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM. In addition, I use graph theory to make inferences about movement, disturbance, and conservation strategies across the entire study area, concluding that the study area displays an intermediate level of connectivity and should be fairly resilient to development and disturbance.

TI  - Biological conservation of aquatic inland habitats: these are better days
AU  - Winfield, Ian J
T2  - Journal of Limnology
AB  - The biodiversity of aquatic inland habitats currently faces unprecedented threats from human activities. At the same time, although much is known about the functioning of freshwater ecosystems the successful transfer of such knowledge to practical conservation has not been universal. Global awareness of aquatic conservation issues is also hampered by the fact that conditions under the water surface are largely hidden from the direct experience of most members of society. Connectivity, or lack of it, is another challenge to the conservation of freshwater habitats, while urban areas can play a perhaps unexpectedly important positive role. Freshwater habitats frequently enjoy benefits accruing from a sense of ownership or stewardship by local inhabitants, which has led to the development of conservation movements which commonly started life centred on the aquatic inland habitat itself but of which many have now matured into wider catchment-based conservation programmes. A demonstrable need for evidence-based conservation management in turn requires scientific assessments to be increasingly robust and standardised, while at the same time remaining open to the adoption of technological advances and welcoming the rapidly developing citizen science movement. There is evidence of real progress in this context and conservation scientists are now communicating their findings to environmental managers in a way and on a scale that was rarely seen a couple of decades ago. It is only in this way that scientific knowledge can be efficiently transferred to conservation planning, prioritisation and ultimately management in an increasingly scaled-up, joined-up and resource-limited world. The principle of ‘prevention is better than cure’ is particularly appropriate to most biological conservation issues in aquatic inland habitats and is inextricably linked to educating and/or nudging appropriate human behaviours. When prevention fails, some form of emergency rescue such as captive breeding or translocations may be justified for particularly important animal or plant populations. However, long-haul missions of habitat rehabilitation or restoration are generally to be preferred even if they usually take many years if not decades to reach fruition. Conservation researchers, managers and practitioners must be realistic in their objectives and timescales for such programmes and take positive steps to communicate such information to stakeholders. Now more than ever, people are interested in conservation and sustainability. There are substantial challenges ahead, but these are better days for the biological conservation of aquatic inland habitats.

TI  - Aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of lowland rural and urban ponds in Leicestershire
AU  - Hill, Matthew J
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Ponds are common and abundant features in nearly all landscapes typical of European lowland landscapes yet research on freshwater biodiversity has traditionally focussed on larger waterbodies such as lakes and rivers. This has led to an increased need to understand and quantify the biodiversity associated with pond habitats to better inform the active conservation and management of these small waterbodies. This thesis examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and conservation value of 95 ponds in Leicestershire, UK, across a variety of urban and rural landscape types and at a range of spatial scales. In addition, the relative importance of local (physicochemical and biological) and spatial (connectivity) variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities within ponds is investigated. At a regional scale, the greatest macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation value was recorded within meadow ponds compared to urban, agricultural and forest ponds. Spatially, ponds were highly physically and biologically heterogeneous. Temporally (seasonally), invertebrate communities were most dissimilar in meadow and agricultural ponds but assemblages were similar in urban and forest ponds. In urban landscapes, park ponds supported a greater diversity of invertebrates than other urban or garden ponds and typically had a greater conservation value. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor of those investigated. Perennial floodplain meadow ponds supported a greater biodiversity of invertebrates compared to ephemeral meadow ponds although conservation value was similar. Despite regular inundation from the River Soar, ephemeral ponds supported distinct communities compared to perennial meadow ponds. Aquatic macrophytes supported a higher diversity of taxa than other pond mesohabitats across all landscapes studied. Physicochemical factors were identified to be the dominant influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages although, a combination of local and spatial factors best explained the variation in community composition at a regional scale and for meadow ponds. Spatial factors were not identified to significantly influence urban pond communities. This study highlights the ecological importance and conservation value of ponds in rural and anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at regional and landscape scales is important for future conservation of pond habitats and will help focus and direct conservation strategies to where they are needed most.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Using false rings to reconstruct local drought severity patterns on a semiarid river
AU  - Morino, Kiyomi Ann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In this research, I describe the use of false rings to reconstruct local histories of seasonal drought in riparian ecosystems in semiarid regions. In tree-ring analysis, false rings are boundary-like features often formed as a response to drought within the growing season. Drought can be a common feature in hydrologic regimes of dryland rivers but in recent decades drought has been intensifying due to climate change and increasing water use by cities, agriculture and industry. Identifying when and where water availability has decreased along the river course is critical for understanding, and therefore managing, these generally endangered ecosystems. The higher density of trees compared to instrumental data make them ideal candidates for reconstructing site-specific drought patterns. The first part of this dissertation is an observational study conducted on the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona during 2002. I used dendrometer data and local hydrological data to show that a period of negligible radial growth in cottonwood during the middle of the growing season coincided with a channel drying event. Tree-ring core samples confirmed that false-rings had formed in each of the instrumented trees. The second part of this dissertation is an experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of different levels of water stress on false-ring formation in cottonwood and willow. I showed that experimental decreases in water availability for periods as short as ten days were enough to induce false-ring formation in willow. Longer periods of reduced water availability were generally required to induce false-ring formation in cottonwood. In the final part of this dissertation, I reconstructed false-ring occurrence in Fremont cottonwoods at three sites along the San Pedro River. I infer from false-ring frequencies that the severity of summer drought has been increasing over the last four to six decades but that the drought severity varies along a hydrological gradient. Overall, the findings in this body of research confirm that false rings in riparian tree species can be used as indicators of seasonal drought and underscore the importance of identifying site-specific responses to reduced water availability along the riparian corridor.

AU  - Brom, Peta
AU  - Underhill, Les G
AU  - Winter, Kevin
T2  - PeerJ
AB  - Globally insects are declining, but some guilds of pollinators are finding refuge in urban landscapes. The body of knowledge on urban pollinators is relatively mature, which means it is now possible to begin to make generalization. Unfortunately, studies do not represent climatic regions evenly and there is a gap in research from the African continent. This study aimed to address some of the gaps on urban pollination knowledge in South Africa and to identify opportunities to improve urban habitats for pollinators. We reviewed the international literature on urban pollinators and the South African literature on pollinators with a landscape ecology focus, drawing on literature with an emphasis on agricultural and ecosystem services. The findings show that some taxa (e.g. large-bodied, cavity nesting bees) will exploit urban environments increasing in abundance with urban intensity. Moderately sensitive taxa (such as small-bodied, ground-nesting bees) take advantage of urban environments only if local habitats are supportive of their needs for resource provision and habitat connectivity. The South African urban poor rely on pollination services for subsistence agriculture and the reproduction of wild-foraged medicines and food. Potential interventions to improve habitat quality include strategic mowing practices, conversion of turf-grass to floral rich habitats, scientific confirmation of lists of highly attractive flowers, and inclusion of small-scale flower patches throughout the urban matrix. Further research is needed to fill the Africa gap for both specialized and generalized pollinators (Diptera, Halictids, Lepidoptera and Hopliini) in urban areas where ornamental and indigenous flowering plants are valued.

AB  - Impact mitigation practices are currently one of the hottest topics in conservation and regarded as priorities worldwide. Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 2004-2012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.

AB  - The puma (Puma concolor), a generalist species, have a realized niche that is constantly changing due to new urban development and management strategies. They have an extensive geographic range, from northern British Columbia down to Patagonia, and from sea level up to an elevation of 4,500 m, which is currently highly fragmented in many key areas. Using historic occurrence points, Genetic Algorithm for Rule set Prediction (GARP) is used to model the potential living area for pumas at the contiguous United States, California, and then southern California regional scales. Then post processing will separate urban areas, roads, and other non-suitable living areas from the model. An analysis of these model results with current conservation strategies and wildlife corridor locations will determine their effectiveness, and allow new strategies to be recommended.

AU  - Johnson Kwan, Melanie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This research examines the space currently protected for the movement of pedestrians within the downtown of Winnipeg as a  sidewalk landscape. This complex landscape contains both cultural and ecological systems which need to be considered holistically in order to maintain a healthy sidewalk landscape. As an application of the United Nations' ‘Healthy City’ principles, a healthy sidewalk landscape includes healthy vegetation, ecologically responsible design and maintenance, and a safe, economically sustainable, and contextual experience for pedestrians. The sidewalk landscape of downtown Winnipeg is well used as a functional corridor, but its systemic health is suffering. The growing requirements for urban vegetation, the climatic and experiential effects upon pedestrians, and the lack of an ethical approach toward groundwater and wind are examined by looking at this landscape as a right of way, a private and public sector investment, a public space, and as an ecological network. These perceptions of the sidewalk space are a translation of cultural values into the planning and regulatory legal documents written for this landscape. In order to understand this landscape, this research examines the sidewalk as a product of cultural values serving many cultural purposes, and an evolving landscape affected by emerging civic goals and priorities expressed in provincial legislation, and municipal by-laws and planning policy. Two goals of this research were to educate landscape architects about the sidewalk as a cultural and outdoor landscape, and to prepare a framework for sidewalk design as a form of applied landscape theory. Landscape architects as teachers and designers can provide leadership toward a review of the practices and legal documents shaping the sidewalk landscape.

TI  - Green Infrastructure Planning Principles: An Integrated Literature Review
T2  - Land
AB  - Green infrastructure is a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas, including green and blue spaces and other ecosystems, designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services at various scales. Apart from the ecological functions, green infrastructure, as a planning tool, contributes to social and economic benefits, leading to the achievement of sustainable, resilient, inclusive and competitive urban areas. Despite recent developments, there is still no consensus among researchers and practitioners regarding the concept of green infrastructure as well as its implementation approaches, which makes it often difficult for urban planners and other professionals in the field to develop a robust green infrastructure in some parts of the world. To address this issue, an integrative literature review was conducted to identify which green infrastructure planning principles should be acknowledged in spatial planning practices to promote sustainability and resilience. As a result of this literature review, the most common eight green infrastructure planning principles were selected—connectivity, multifunctionality, applicability, integration, diversity, multiscale, governance, and continuity. These principles intend to promote and simplify the development and use of green infrastructure by different academic and implementation organizations and provide a more defined model for sustainable landscape management in order to help practitioners and decision makers during the conceptualization and planning of green infrastructure.

TI  - Evolution and Ecology of Urban Pigeons (Columba livia) in Northeastern North America
AU  - Carlen, Elizabeth Jane
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is drastically changing landscapes across the globe leading to changes in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within cities. This urban landscape change may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, I examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the Northeastern United States. I focused my sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). I performed ddRAD‐Seq on 473 samples. My analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. I conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in pigeons. Additionally, spatial genetic patterns may diverge between cities as food accessibility, nesting site availability, and eradication policies differ. Pigeon hobbyists (people who collect, breed, trade, and race pigeons) also vary by region leading to differing degrees of public tolerance for pigeons and impacting the spatial genetic patterns. Fancy and racing pigeons display a variety of characters which are often seen in the feral population, suggesting that these breeds may partially contribute to feral populations. I found that pigeon population structure is influenced by continued introduction of racing/fancy pigeons and the local conditions including attitudes towards pigeons, management practices, and food availability. Furthermore, variation in behavioral traits is especially important in novel habitats where selection forces determine successful colonizers. Prey species must constantly balance the risk versus reward of remaining in an area with threats while gaining possible fitness benefits. Flight initiation distance, the distance at which an animal flees when approached by a human, is a common metric used to assess habituation to stressors and risk behavior. I examined the flight initiation distance of pigeons across New York City, USA. I then assessed this behavioral response across the landscape with respect to multiple urbanization factors related to human activity, the abiotic environment, and the ecological community. I found that flight initiation distance in pigeons decreased with increased human activity demonstrating that pigeon behavior varies with urbanization, human activity, and ecological attributes. Since behavioral changes are often the most rapid phenotypic response to change, this study demonstrates that pigeons are responding to anthropogenic stressors, which may set the stage for adaptive changes. Overall this research demonstrates that urban landscape heterogeneity may contribute to variable spatial genetic and behavioral responses across a single city, therefore researchers must examine patters at different spatial scales. Moreover, organisms such as pigeons that depend on humans, exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure that reflects human patterns and distributions, stressing the importance of sampling across urban areas.

AB  - Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of “natural” habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle (“old-field”), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.

AB  - BackgroundDisentangling the relative roles of environmental filtering and spatial processes in structuring ecological communities is a central topic in metacommunity ecology. Metacommunity ecology in the temperate river ecosystems has been well developed, while less attention has been paid to subtropical urban river networks. Here, we examined the ecological factors and seasonal difference in structuring macroinvertebrates metacommunity assembly in the subtropical urban river networks in Shenzhen, South China.ResultsOur results revealed that there was no significant distinction of macroinvertebrate community composition among seasons, with only the relative abundance of Mollusca and Odonata significantly differed in both wet and dry seasons. One possible explanation was that most macroinvertebrates are generally pollution-tolerant taxa characterized with nonseasonal life cycle. In addition, distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning approach revealed that metacommunity was determined equally by the environmental and dispersal-related factors. Further, our results showed that, although a slight temporal variation of relative contribution, the identity and explanation power of ecological factors were different among seasons. Specifically, stronger environmental filtering structuring community dynamics was observed in the dry than wet seasons, which might be owing to higher environmental heterogeneity under a low water-flow condition. Moreover, we detected that the influence of spatial processes was stronger in the wet than dry seasons, indicating an obvious dispersal processes due to high connectivity among sites.ConclusionOverall, our results revealed that environmental and spatial factors equally explained variations of macroinvertebrate metacommunity, implying the necessity of considering dispersal-related processes structuring ecological communities in river bioassessment programs. Moreover, degraded habitat conditions and water quality were the predominant factors that affected macroinvertebrate communities, indicating the significance and feasibility of improving local abiotic conditions to sustain local biodiversity. Further, our findings revealed the importance of seasonal dynamics of these urban river networks in structuring macroinvertebrate metacommunity. Thereby, our study improves the understanding of ecological processes governing macroinvertebrate metacommunity and underlines the idea that community ecology studies should go beyond the single snapshot survey in river networks.

TI  - Consequences of landscape change on riverine food webs and aquatic-terrestrial linkages
AU  - Kautza, Adam Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - River ecosystems are composed of a spatially and temporally heterogeneous matrix of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial elements that are highly coupled via physical, chemical, and biotic linkages. Food webs in river ecosystems reflect this complexity as they can be highly variable over space and time and are characterized by longitudinal (upstream-downstream) and lateral (aquatic-terrestrial) connectivity, which provides energetic resources (e.g., nutrients, organic matter) to consumers in adjacent habitats. Food webs relate information about diversity, community composition, and ecosystem function. However, spatially-explicit food-web data remain scarce for river ecosystems and, thus, environmental determinants of food-web structure remain largely unresolved. In particular, anthropogenic gradients relating to river regulation and land-cover change disrupt hydrogeomorphic regimes, influence water quality, and alter fundamental properties of river ecosystems with potential consequences for cross-boundary linkages and food-web dynamics. At 12 riverine landscape study sites distributed along an urban-rural gradient of the Scioto River system, Ohio, I investigated the influence of anthropogenic and natural environmental factors on (1) reciprocal aquatic-terrestrial invertebrate flux dynamics, (2) trophic structure and food-chain length (FCL) of fish food webs, and (3) the contribution of aquatically-derived energy to terrestrial food webs.Anthropogenic impacts relating to modified riparian landscape composition, water quality, and dams, as well as natural gradients in river size exerted strong influences on river food webs. A landscape composition gradient from urbanization to grassland-dominated riparian land cover explained patterns in aquatic insect emergence and terrestrial invertebrate inputs to the river. In particular, urban landscapes were positively associated with reduced emergence flux density and biomass and reduced biomass of terrestrial inputs, whereas riparian grasslands were negatively associated with these factors. Fish food webs were characterized by fewer predator species and smaller-bodied prey above dams than below while FCL was shorter above dammed reaches (3.88) than below (4.19). Fish FCL also responded positively to natural gradients in river size (e.g., channel width) ranging from 3.66 -4.13 at narrower reaches to 4.24 - 4.35 at the widest reaches. Aquatic energy represented a considerable contribution to terrestrial consumers that forage across different spatial scales ranging from sedentary shoreline tetragnathid spiders (76% from aquatic) to riparian swallows (67% from aquatic) and raccoons (59%) that forage over 100s to 1000s of meters. Moreover, terrestrial consumers relied on both benthic algae (33% reliance across all consumers) and phytoplankton (32% reliance), highlighting the importance of separate aquatic energy pathways to terrestrial food webs in mid-size river systems.Collectively, my results indicate that anthropogenic changes to rivers can have appreciable impacts on riverine food webs. Additionally, I have shown that aquatic energy, in addition to terrestrially-derived energy, can fuel terrestrial food webs in mid-sized rivers and that the aquatic energetic signature can extend further from the river than previously considered. Finally, because of the inherent relationship between food webs and ecosystem function and stability, I anticipate results from this research will contribute to the ongoing development of a more holistic and functional approach to management and conservation of river-riparian ecosystems in the face of increasing anthropogenic influences.

TI  - Can urban greenways provide high-quality avian habitat?
AU  - Hull, Jamie Rebekah
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I investigated how forested corridor width, land use context, and greenway composition and vegetation structure affected avian community composition in urban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. I surveyed breeding bird communities at 34 greenway study sites using 50-m fixed-radius point counts located at the center of 300m long greenway segments. Each greenway segment's forested corridor width and surrounding land use were determined in ArcGIS. Greenway composition (proportion of mature forest, young forest, managed area, and stream in the greenway study site) and vegetation structure were measured in the field. Landscape and urban planners can maximize native bird diversity and abundance by minimizing the width of the greenway trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, maintaining vegetative structure within the greenway, and giving priority to the protection of greenways in areas of lower development intensity. Greenways wider than 50m provide habitat for a diversity of bird species, but many species of conservation concern require much wider greenways. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Mapping Invasion Potential of the Pest from Central Asia, Trypophloeus klimeschi (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), in the Shelter Forests of Northwest China
T2  - Insects
AB  - Temperature and precipitation are the two main factors constraining the current distribution of Trypophloeus klimeschi. Currently, T. klimeschi is mainly distributed in South Xinjiang, where it occurs between the southern edge of the Tianshan Mountains and northern edge of the Tarim Basin. In addition, Dunhuang in northern Gansu also provide suitable habitats for this bark beetle. Two other potential areas for this species are in or near the cities of Alaer and Korla. Under future climate scenarios, its total suitable area is projected to increase markedly over time. Among the climate scenarios, the distribution expanded the most under the maximum greenhouse gas emission scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5). Jiuquan in Gansu is projected to become a suitable area in the 2030s. Subsequently, T. klimeschi is expected to enter western Inner Mongolia along the Hexi Corridor in the 2050s. In southeastern Xinjiang, however, the suitable area in northern Ruoqiang and most areas of Korla may decrease. By the 2050s, it is large enough to pose substantial challenges for forest managers across northern China. Our findings provide information that can be used to monitor T. klimeschi populations, host health, and the impact of climate change, shedding light on the effectiveness of management responses.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.

TI  - Genetic structure across urban and agricultural landscapes reveals evidence of resource specialization and philopatry in the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica L.
AU  - Ballare, Kimberly M
AU  - Jha, Shalene
T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Human activity continues to impact global ecosystems, often by altering the habitat suitability, persistence, and movement of native species. It is thus critical to examine the population genetic structure of key ecosystemservice providers across human‐altered landscapes to provide insight into the forces that limit wildlife persistence and movement across multiple spatial scales. While some studies have documented declines of bee pollinators as a result of human‐mediated habitat alteration, others suggest that some bee species may benefit from altered land use due to increased food or nesting resource availability; however, detailed population and dispersal studies have been lacking. We investigated the population genetic structure of the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, across 14 sites spanning more than 450 km, including dense urban areas and intensive agricultural habitat. X. virginica is a large bee which constructs nests in natural and human‐associated wooden substrates, and is hypothesized to disperse broadly across urbanizing areas. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we detected significant genetic isolation by geographic distance and significant isolation by land use, where urban and cultivated landscapes were most conducive to gene flow. This is one of the first population genetic analyses to provide evidence of enhanced insect dispersal in human‐altered areas as compared to semi‐natural landscapes. We found moderate levels of regional‐scale population structure across the study system (GʹST = 0.146) and substantial co‐ancestry between the sampling regions, where co‐ancestry patterns align with major human transportation corridors, suggesting that human‐mediated movement may be influencing regional dispersal processes. Additionally, we found a signature of strong site‐level philopatry where our analyses revealed significant levels of high genetic relatedness at very fine scales (<1 km), surprising given X. virginica's large body size. These results provide unique genetic evidence that insects can simultaneously exhibit substantial regional dispersal as well as high local nesting fidelity in landscapes dominated by human activity.

TI  - Nomadic Animal Movement and Infectious Disease in Changing Landscapes
AU  - Teitelbaum, Claire Stewart
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Animal movements are an essential component of individual fitness and population dynamics, and also affect species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.

TI  - An impact analysis of future human settlements on biological resources and greenhouse gas emissions in California, and on wildlife corridors in a Maasai group ranch in Kenya
AU  - Beardsley, Karen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Patterns of human settlement can have profound effects on the natural environment and biological resources, including direct habitat destruction, contribution to greenhouse gases, and obstruction of animal movement. Over half the world's population live in urban areas, which are experiencing tremendous growth rates. Planners and scientists are struggling to accommodate urban growth while conserving natural resources. UPlan, a spatially-explicit urban growth model, was developed to help decision-makers quantify and visualize the potential implications of land use decisions by modeling patterns of future human settlement and measuring their relative impacts.In chapter one, I apply UPlan to the San Joaquin Valley, California, to model urban growth impacts from land use policy scenarios on conservation priority lands. Results indicate that the least detrimental impacts are from the growth scenario that emphasizes higher housing densities and a smaller human settlement footprint. To better understand the relative contribution of urban growth to California's greenhouse gas emissions, in chapter two I use UPlan's greenhouse gas (GHG) calculator to estimate emissions from buildings accommodating new growth through the year 2050 in California. The GHG calculator can test alternative emission-reducing measures to help determine what actions will be needed to achieve the 2050 reduction targets. Reducing very low residential housing lowers emissions by 1%, suggesting targets cannot be met without a higher percentage of renewable energy sources and/or implementing conservation measures.Kenyan Maasai pastoralists are transitioning from communal land tenure to individual parcel ownership, leading to a sedentary, agriculture-based livelihood with more fenced land. Effects of land subdivision include landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and decreased wildlife populations. To date, there has been no systematic way of estimating longer-term impacts of differing growth scenarios on wildlife and other environmental resources in Africa. Chapter three explores whether UPlan can be adapted to the Kenyan policy framework. I test the feasibility of using UPlan in rural Kenya by applying it to the Mbirikani Group Ranch. The modeled pattern of human settlement from each policy scenario is combined with wildlife routes across Mbirikani. Findings indicate that the scenario with the highest level of fencing has the most detrimental effects on migratory corridors.

TI  - Breeding success, prey use, and mark-resight estimation of burrowing owls nesting on black-tailed prairie dog towns: Plague affects a non-susceptible raptor
AU  - Conrey, Reesa Catheline Yale
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Introduced pathogens such as the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that causes plague can have far-reaching effects on native ecosystems that go beyond the mortality of infected individuals. We investigated the effects of plague, prairie dog town dynamics, and rainfall on burrowing owls ( Athene cunicularia) nesting in black-tailed prairie dog ( Cynomys ludovicianus) burrows in the shortgrass steppe of northern Colorado. We examined effects on prey use, nest density, and breeding success, and used mark-resight methods for owl population estimation. Prairie dogs experience high mortality from plague, and their colonies are periodically extirpated by outbreaks. Plague does not make owls sick, but they may be affected as unmaintained burrows collapse, vegetation grows taller, and the anti-predator benefits of prairie dog association are lost. From 2005–2008, we monitored 322 nest attempts by 311 burrowing owl pairs on the Pawnee National Grassland and collected regurgitated pellets and prey remains. We banded owlets in 2007, and our first objective was to use a mark-resight protocol to estimate abundance, apparent survival, and temporary emigration. The Poisson-log normal mark-resight model (McClintock and White 2009) has recently been implemented in Program MARK (White and Burnham 1999). This model improves upon previous mark-resight models because individual identifications are not required 100% of the time, and individuals may die or be temporarily unobservable. Modeling showed that owlets in better condition that weighed more at first capture had higher survival throughout the summer and were more likely to be above ground. Our suggested improvements to field protocols should improve abundance estimation in the future. Our second objective was to examine the effects of precipitation, nest density, and plague on prey use and to determine whether prey composition influenced nest or fledging success. We quantified prey use and then analyzed diet composition using multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and indicator species analysis. Burrowing owls ate a huge variety of prey dominated by beetles, grasshoppers, ants, rodents, and songbirds. Insects comprised 95% of their diet by number, but only 11% by biomass. Owls in the driest year of our study and those at successful and very productive nests ate fewer birds and more mammals. Owl diet was unchanged by plague outbreaks, except that several bird species were less commonly eaten following epizootics. It appears that burrowing owls often forage outside of prairie dog towns, making town-level differences less relevant to owl diets. Our third objective was to determine the effects of plague, prairie dog town dynamics, and rainfall on nest fate, fledging success, and distances from each nest to its three nearest neighbors. Generalized linear modeling showed that rainfall was the strongest predictor of nest and fledging success, with higher rainfall associated with lower breeding success. Nests were more likely to succeed when plague events were more recent, and they produced more fledglings on towns where any extirpation was brief, and prairie dogs were otherwise resident on site for a longer time. Nests were closest together on recently plagued towns where prairie dog activity had been nearly continuous for a long time and recolonization was rapid. Although ubiquitous on active prairie dog towns, burrowing owls were nearly absent from towns that were not recolonized after plague epizootics. Both precipitation and plague influenced population dynamics of breeding burrowing owls. We found strong relationships among rainfall, prey species composition, and owl breeding success, and only half the owlets that emerged from burrows survived to fledge during the wettest July of our study. Precipitation regimes are expected to become more extreme in the future, which will likely have consequences for burrowing owls and other dryland species and may affect the size and frequency of plague outbreaks (Stapp et al. 2004). Although owls were absent from towns that were not recolonized after plague epizootics, it appears that burrowing owls can adapt to plague and even benefit in some cases. If conservation of burrowing owls is a primary goal, our results suggest that it will be more useful to preserve prairie dog habitat and connectivity between towns at a landscape scale than to intensively manage plague.

AU  - Walker, Jack R
AU  - Hassall, Christopher
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are under threat from habitat loss, partly due to urban expansion. However, some elements of urban freshwaters are already integral parts of the urban landscape and so are more resilient to loss, representing opportunities for the enhancement of freshwater resources within cities. This study investigated the biodiversity value of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Leeds, UK, in relation to its landscape context. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) biodiversity value is lowest nearest to the urban core, and (ii) the pattern of canal locks structured ecological communities. Nutrients, metals and dissolved carbon all existed at relatively low concentrations, contrary to what is often seen in urban water bodies, although concentrations were higher in the urban core. This gradient of chemical stress was associated with a decline in macroinvertebrate diversity towards the city centre, which manifested as pollution-sensitive taxa being excluded from this area. Community structures were found to vary between groups of sampling sites separated by locks, suggesting that locks may act as barriers for aquatic invertebrates by restricting dispersal. The results in this study indicate that canals in urban areas can be high-quality habitats, despite the associated anthropogenic stressors, and locks may represent a unique model for researching relationships between connectivity and community structure.

AB  - Genetic connectivity is a key factor for maintaining the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes. In highly modified landscapes such us peri-urban areas, organisms’ dispersal among fragmented habitat patches can be reduced due to the surrounding matrix, leading to subsequent decreased gene flow and increased potential extinction risk in isolated sub-populations. However, few studies have compared within species how dispersal/gene flow varies between regions and among different forms of matrix that might be encountered. In the current study, we investigated gene flow and dispersal in an endangered marsupial, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) in a heavily modified peri-urban landscape in South Australia, Australia. We used 14 microsatellite markers to genotype 254 individuals which were sampled from 15 sites. Analyses revealed significant genetic structure. Our analyses also indicated that dispersal was mostly limited to neighbouring sites. Comparisons of these results with analyses of a different population of the same species revealed that gene flow/dispersal was more limited in this peri-urban landscape than in a pine plantation landscape approximately 400 km to the south-east. These findings increase our understanding of how the nature of fragmentation can lead to profound differences in levels of genetic connectivity among populations of the same species.

AB  - We investigated habitat use of Columbian black-tailed deer in urban Vancouver, Clark County, Washington, at 3 spatial scales: (1) placement of the annual home range within the landscape mosaic, (2) annual and seasonal locations of deer within the annual home range, and (3) short-term use of critical habitats (fawning areas) within seasonal ranges. Annual home range sizes of deer were 162 ha (SD = 133; 95% minimum convex polygon; MCP) and 266 ha (SD = 228; 95% adaptive kernel; AK) for does, and 756 ha (SD = 290; MCP) and 1,235 ha (SD = 382; AK) for bucks. Home range composition of does did not differ from the study area; home ranges of bucks contained more Natural ecological land-use cover types (ELUs) than did the study area. Within home ranges, both does and bucks used Natural ELUs more often than expected by their occurrence in the home range, both annually and seasonally. During the fawning season, does were also found in Natural ELUs more often than expected. Clark County-designated habitat corridors differed from both the study area and deer home ranges in habitat composition, primarily by containing more Natural and other undeveloped ELUs. Deer were located in habitat corridors more than expected. Deer in urban areas appear to use undeveloped habitat types for security. Management that maintains Natural ELUs, such as establishment of wildlife corridors, can provide important habitat components for black-tailed deer in urban habitats.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Miombo is the most extensive ecosystem in southern Africa, being strongly driven by fire, climate, herbivory, and human activity. Soils are major regulating and supporting services, sequestering nearly 50% of the overall carbon and comprising a set of yet unexploited functions. In this study, we used next-generation Illumina sequencing to assess the patterns of bacterial soil diversity in two pioneer Miombo species, Brachystegia boehmii and Brachystegia spiciformis, along a fire gradient, in ferric lixisol and cambic arenosol soils. In total, 21 phyla, 51 classes, 98 orders, 193 families, and 520 genera were found, revealing a considerably high and multifunctional diversity with a strong potential for the production of bioactive compounds and nutrient mobilization. Four abundant genera characterized the core microbiome among plant species, type of soils, or fire regime: Streptomyces, Gaiella, Chthoniobacter, and Bacillus. Nevertheless, bacterial networks revealed a higher potential for mutualistic interactions and transmission of chemical signals among phylotypes from low fire frequency sites than those from high fire frequency sites. Ecological networks also revealed the negative effects of frequent fires on the complexity of microbial communities. Functional predictions revealed the core “house-keeping” metabolisms contributing to the high bacterial diversity found, suggesting its importance to the functionality of this ecosystem.

AB  - Street trees provide several ecosystem services in urban areas, including food for fauna. Tree species richness, composition and the relative abundance of native vs. non-native species can affect the populations of pollinators and dispersers. This work aims to evaluate the potential availability of food resources provided by street trees, in space and time, considering different pollination and seed dispersal syndromes at Santo André city (Southeastern Brazil). The georeferenced data for all catalogued tree individuals in the Urban Macrozone constituted our sampling domain. The species were categorized according to its geographical origin, pollination and seed dispersal syndromes, flowering and fruiting season. We divided the study area into cells and calculated: number of individuals, species richness, species diversity; richness and diversity of potentially flowering and fruiting individuals in each season of the year. 38,379 trees were catalogued, representing 578 trees/km2, totalizing 230 species. Most individuals (73%) were non-native. The number of individuals, species richness and diversity varied spatially. The pollination syndrome with higher potential resources availability was melittophily (pollination by bees and wasps) has during spring whereas ornithochory (seed dispersal by birds) was the dispersal syndrome with higher potential resources availability which occurred in summer. Despite the dominance of exotic individuals, the most common syndromes are in accordance with what is expected for tropical Atlantic rainforest regions. However, some pollination and dispersal syndromes presented very low potential resource availability in different seasons and no availability in some regions. These results should be taken into account by stakeholders for a better planning of planting efforts, considering the distribution, in space and time, of the potential availability of resources provided by street trees to fauna in order to improve connectivity.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The Greenspaces Habitat Restoration Program, a partnership between Metro and US Fish and Wildlife Service in Portland, Oregon was created in 1992, as a component of The Metro Greenspaces and Open Spaces Program--A Regional System of Natural Areas, Open Space, Trails and Greenspaces for Wildlife and People. The goal of the restoration grants program is to fund restoration and enhancement of urban natural areas, with emphasis on opportunities for re-establishment of corridors and consolidation of fragments.Since 1992, more than 91 small citizen or local park agency restoration projects have been funded. Projects have ranged from small replantings to large scale stream restoration or meadow enhancements.An additional objective of the program and this paper is to document true costs, resources and volunteers required to conduct a community based urban restoration project. While the enhancements of each project alone will probably not significantly increase species numbers and diversity in the urban area, each project's value may be the introduction of people to the concepts of biodiversity, landscape ecology and each participant's role as a steward.The Sandee Palisades and Mill Creek restoration projects describe goals, successes, lessons learned and costs of citizen-based restoration projects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Seminatural habitats are declining throughout the world; thus, the role of small anthropogenic habitats in the preservation of plants is becoming increasingly appreciated. Here, we surveyed the orchid flora of roadside verges in five Central European countries (Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and tested how the surrounding landscape matrix affects the overall number of species and individuals, and also different functional groups of orchids. We found more than 2,000 individuals of 27 orchid species during our surveys. According to our results, the increasing coverage of agricultural and urban areas negatively affects both the number of orchid species and individuals on roadsides. Our study further suggests that differences in the surrounding habitats affect which species are found on roadsides, since the increasing coverage of grasslands or forested areas around orchid occurrences had a significant positive effect on the number of grassland or forest‐dwelling species and individuals, respectively. Most variance in orchid numerosity and diversity was explained by the cover of the suitable habitat types of the respective taxa in the surrounding landscape of the sampling points. This highlights the importance of roadsides acting as refugia for numerous species and valuable plant communities as well as in supporting biodiversity in general.

TI  - Landscape ecology study on ditch-net system in Yangtze river delta--a case study of Yangzhong city, Jiangsu province
AU  - Fan, Jie Wen
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Based on multi-temporal images and social-economic data, a case study was carried out firstly on Dyked fields (low-lying paddy fields surrounding by dykes) landscape and ditch-net system in Yangzhong City, Yangtze River Delta, using landscape ecological approach. The major conclusions are summarized as follows: l. The landscape unit of "field----ditch--village-road" is the dominant feature of the dyked fields landscape. Ditch-net system plays an important role in this kind of landscape, which pattern determines the distribution of the paddy fields and villages. 2. At present, the ditch-net system consists mainly of three components: river reaches, ditches and ponds. As the backbone of ditch-net system, the pattern of the river reaches determines the pattern of the whole system. It has a distinguished feature of artificial river system. Under the impact of urbanization, the ditches and ponds in urban area are decreasing gradually. The widespread herbaceous is the major component of the vegetation in the ditch-net system and the riparian areas. Compared with the plants around ditches and ponds, the species abundance in river riparian is greater. 3. The ditch-net system in Yangzhong has been changed dramatically since the last one hundred years. Images from l935 to l958 indicate that Yangzhong still enjoyed a river system of natural dendritic pattern in that time. Since l980 the river net pattern began to show typical features of artificial river system with straight watercourse, low curvilinearity. The river network  was improved during l980-l994, both of the quantity and the length of the river reaches have increased remarkably The ditches and the ponds near the urban areas show a trend of decrease,. The connectivity and the fluidity of the rivers has declined, the environment of the ditch-net deteriorated, and the ecological security also decreased. 4. Economy development, particularly, industrialization is the major impetus for the reconstruction of river reaches in Yangzhong. The river network in the agricu1tural age is characterized by the dentritic river system, which has been changed to straight watercourse after l970's in the industrial age. After all, the essential cause for these transformations is the change of the relationship between human and the environment. 5. The spatial expansion pattern of Yangzhong city and its ecological reservation area is simulated by the Minimum Cumulative Resistance Model. Through scenario analysis, three scenarios, i.e., "no intervention", "current situation adjustment", and "optima1 pattern", are set up to forecast the development of ditch-net pattern in Yangzhong.

TI  - Resource Selection and Landscape Connectivity of the Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) in Southern Texas
AU  - Veals, Amanda Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wildlife species across the globe are faced with landscapes that are becoming increasingly difficult to traverse because of habitat loss and degradation. Roadway networks are widespread and significant anthropogenic influences on the landscape that can have profound impacts on wildlife populations. Understanding how organisms perceive barriers to movement, or landscape resistance, is important for the conservation and management of wildlife populations threatened by habitat fragmentation and loss. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is an endangered felid in the United States, with remnant populations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas. An estimated 95% of native Tamaulipan thornshrub had been cleared for agriculture and urban development which has led to the LRGV being classified as one of the most rapidly developing urban areas in the United States today. This development corresponded to an increase in road collisions and a decrease in available habitat for ocelots. To guide efforts to mitigate ocelot road mortalities, I have modeled probability of landscape use by ocelots as a function of environmental resources (e.g., vegetation cover) and road characteristics at the individual and population level. I modeled resource selection from animal location data collected via VHF and GPS radio collars from 1982–2017. I quantified spatio-temporal consistent habitat for ocelots compared to land ownership. I evaluated differences in individual behavior to habitat and road variables using functional response analyses. I evaluated potential movement pathways between habitat patches and across roads based on landscape resistance scenarios using spatially absorbing Markov chains. This project will inform the placement of future road crossing structures to decrease ocelot-vehicle collisions and increase landscape permeability for this endangered species. This information will assist Texas Department of Transportation with ocelot conservation objectives.

TI  - Ecological Connectivity in Agricultural Green Infrastructure: Suggested Criteria for Fine Scale Assessment and Planning
AU  - Zavattero, Laura
AU  - Capotorti, Giulia
T2  - Land
AB  - In promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service capacity, landscape connectivity is considered a critical feature to counteract the negative effects of fragmentation. Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Notwithstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requalification of transitional urban–rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions.

AU  - Thornhill, Ian
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The ecology of ponds is threatened by urbanisation and as cities expand pond habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate. Pond communities are structured by local (water quality, physical) and regional (land-use, connectivity) processes. Since ca1904 >80% of ponds in Birmingham, U.K., have been lost due to land-use intensification, resulting in an increasingly diffuse network. A survey of thirty urban ponds revealed high spatial and temporal variability in water quality, which frequently failed environmental standards. Most were eutrophic, although macrophyte-rich, well connected ponds supported macroinvertebrate assemblages of high conservation value. Statistically, local physical variables (e.g. shading) explained more variation, both in water quality and macroinvertebrate community composition than regional factors. Nonetheless, habitat availability within the wider landscape was important. Ecosystem functioning (leaf-litter breakdown) along a rural-urban gradient was confounded by habitat area, despite a decrease in functional redundancy. Ponds are identified that promote network connectivity and management of land-use within 100m may buffer against diffuse pollution with reductions in riparian shading required to improve growth conditions for oxygenating vegetation and to reduce nutrient levels. The results indicate that many urban ponds are threatened habitats that require active management to protect and restore water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The studies of spatial-temporal land use and land cover (LULC) change patterns, supported by future scenarios and simulation methods based on the assumption of natural socio-economic and territorial driving forces, allow us to go beyond an accurate diagnosis of the dynamics that have occurred so far, providing a picture of possible alternative futures, and are fundamental in assisting with the planning and policy-making in the territory. In this paper, we use LULC maps and explanatory variables aggregated in five dimensions (physical/natural, economic, sociocultural, technological, and demographic) to identify which are the main drinving forces in the evolution process and the simulation of LULC dynamics for 2036, using as a case study the Chapecó River ecological corridor (Chapecó EC) area. The Chapecó EC was created by the state government in 2010 with the goal of combining nature conservation with local and regional development. In this region, in the last two decades, the loss of areas of natural grassland and forest was on average five times higher than the average recorded in the state. Based on scenario-building methods using artificial neural networks, six predictive scenarios were elaborated, based on three socioeconomic scenarios (current conditions, growth, and socioeconomic recession) and two territorial intervention options (actions). This includes an action based on maintaining the current LULC, and another action of a conservationist nature with the recovery of forest and natural grassland areas to the proportions of areas found in 1990. The results indicate that if the current LULC is maintained, forest, pasture and agriculture areas tend to increase, while silviculture and natural grassland areas decrease, driven by economic and physical/natural driving forces. If there is a conservationist action, natural grassland and pasture areas tend to increase and silviculture and agriculture tend to lose area due to economic, technological, and physical/natural driving forces. These trends have revealed that the natural grassland preservation/restoration, the encouragement of conservationist agricultural practices combined with economic strategies, and the technological development of the rural sector seem to form the basis of economic development combined with biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Urban Rivers as Dispersal Corridors: Which Factors Are Important for the Spread of Alien Woody Species along the Danube?
AU  - Wagner, Sabrina
AU  - Moser, Dietmar
AU  - Essl, Franz
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Cities are hotspots of invasions, and this is particularly the case for urban rivers, which are known to serve as corridors for the spread of alien plant species to floodplain forests. Here, we present a case study on woody (shrubs, trees) species invasions across a gradient from a metropolis (Vienna) to rural regions along the Danube River in eastern Austria. In total, we identified 44 native and 25 alien woody species in 75 plots. Five alien woody species occur in at least 10 plots. The most wide-spread ones were species of floodplain forests (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Populus x canadensis), while Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia—which prefer dry sites—were recorded substantially less often. The average level of invasion—i.e., the relative proportion of alien to native woody species in plots—was high across all three study regions. Still, there was a moderate decline of alien woody species richness along the urban—peri-urban—rural gradient. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed that population density and the proportion of urban habitats in the environs of the plots is significantly positively correlated with the presence of Acer negundo and Ailanthus altissima. Conversely, the occurrence of Robinia pseudoacacia is negatively correlated with surrounding population density and urban habitats. Occurrence of Acer negundo is positively correlated with urban habitats. For Fraxinus pennsylvanica, we found no significant relationships. Our results confirm that gallery forests at river banks are highly susceptible to invasions. We argue that managing alien woody species in urban and peri-urban sites is not appropriate and useful, given that re-invasion is likely in most cases (from adjacent urban green spaces). We acknowledge that this recommendation entails the implicit recognition that gallery forests along urban sections of the Danube will contain a substantial—and likely further increasing—proportion of alien woody species.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a ‘renaturing’ strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - In heterogeneous landscapes, physical barriers and loss of structural connectivity have been shown to reduce gene flow and therefore lead to population structuring. In this study, we assessed the influence of landscape features on population genetic structure and gene flow of a semiaquatic species, the muskrat. A total of 97 muskrats were sampled from three watersheds near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. We estimated population genetic structure using 11 microsatellite loci and identified a single genetic cluster and no genetic differences were found among the watersheds as a result of high levels of gene flow. At finer scales, we assessed the correlation between individual pairwise genetic distances and Euclidean distance as well as different models of least cost path (LCP). We used a range of cost values for the landscape types in order to build our LCP models. We found a positive relationship between genetic distance and least cost distance when we considered roads as corridors for movements. Open landscapes and urban areas seemed to restrict but not prevent gene flow within the study area. Our study underlines the high‐dispersal ability of generalist species in their use of landscape and highlights how landscape features often considered barriers to animal movements are corridors for other species.

AU  - Carreiro, Margaret M
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - While urban ecology is an expanding field of study, some natural areas within the urban environment remain under-examined. These include naturally regenerating forest communities adjacent to urban interstates. In addition, the status of interstate soils and their relationships with the community composition of forested interstate verges has received little ecological study. The purpose of this study was to examine variation in soil conditions along forested interstate corridors in Louisville, KY and to explore the extent to which soil characteristics (e.g., bulk density, pH) and heavy metals (e.g., Pb, Zn) vary with respect to three factors: interstate (e.g., traffic density), surrounding urban environment (e.g., industrial land use), and interstate construction legacies. Additionally, we explored the relationships between several edaphic factors and woody vegetation structure in these forested verges. We found that the degree and direction of the slope of land towards the interstate and the distance to the interstate pavement were strong determinants of soil characteristics and heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the movement of de-icing salts, heavy metals, and other pollutants from the interstate was important in determining forest soil conditions along urban interstates. Since within our study area these highways did not extend into rural lands, variation in urban land uses and cover within 26 km of the city center was not large enough to explain variation in soil characteristics or heavy metals, except for a positive correlation between chromium and surrounding industrial land use. We did find that past physical soil disturbance caused by interstate construction (e.g., imported fill) left an important legacy on soil characteristics, heavy metal retention, and woody plant growth patterns in forests adjacent to urban interstates. The legacy of interstate construction on the current forest community structure (e.g., lower species richness) and the future forest (e.g., reduced tree regeneration) may further alter ecosystem productivity and ecosystem services provided by these forests and their soils.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Our analyses are based on evaluation of summary statistics, and information-theoretic support for results of simple logistic regression. Based on captures in mist nets, the city bat fauna differed from that of the adjacent mountains, and was dominated by big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Species, age, and sex composition of bats submitted for rabies testing locally and along the urbanizing Front Range Corridor were similar to those of the mist-net captures and reflected the annual cycle of reproduction and activity of big brown bats. Few submissions occurred November- March, when these bats hibernated elsewhere. In summer females roosted in buildings in colonies and dominated health samples; fledging of young corresponded to a summer peak in health submissions with no increase in rabies prevalence. Roosting ecology of big brown bats in buildings was similar to that reported for natural sites, including colony size, roost-switching behavior, fidelity to roosts in a small area, and attributes important for roost selection. Attrition in roosts occurred from structural modifications of buildings to exclude colonies by citizens, but without major effects on long-term bat reproduction or survival. Bats foraged in areas set aside for nature conservation. A pattern of lower diversity in urban bat communities with dominance by big brown bats may occur widely in the USA, and is consistent with national public health records for rabies surveillance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Dispersal patterns of insects after a major disturbance event is applied to a disturbance gradient that conformed to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in an urban ecosystem

AB  - Insects have been losing their habitats with the rapid expansion of many urban cities such as Toronto. This study aims at understanding the dispersal patterns insects take once they are placed under a heavy amount of disturbance. The use of power line corridors allows us to have a disturbance gradient within an urban city that allows us to observe the normal distribution of insects across the gradient and compare it to how their distribution patterns change once a disturbance has been applied. It is important in understanding insect dispersal patterns, because only then can we accurately create conservation strategies, and plan urban development to minimize the amount of damage done to insect populations. In this study, sweep nets, pan traps, and point counts were used to sample five areas of a disturbance gradient along a power line corridor. The experiment was conducted over three weeks and it was found that the gradient studied followed a quadratic distribution pattern predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, although with the application of disturbance, the insects diapered into an exponential type pattern in which the greatest abundance of insects were found in the area of least disturbance. The findings of this study have important implications in understanding the effects of disturbance on insects in urban ecosystems and are a step in the direction of forming a unified theory of insect/disturbance dynamics.

TI  - Essays in the Non-Separability Between Environmental Resources and Human Nutrition, and the Role of Markets in Mitigating the Linkage: Evidence from Malawi and Nepal
AU  - Kim, Kichan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In these essays, I study the soil-to-human mineral transmission and the role of markets in mitigating the linkages in the context of Nepal and Malawi in the first two chapters. And, in the last chapter I explore the adverse impact of rural connectivity on children's unhealthy dietary habits in rural Nepal.The first chapter examines the negative child health impacts of soil zinc (Zn) deficiency in Nepal. Soil Zn deficiency limits the Zn concentration in food crops, leading many to speculate that it underlies human Zn deficiency and child stunting, globally and particularly in South Asia. We find strong evidence that soil Zn deficiency does have a causal impact on child stunting in Nepal's Tarai region, the breadbasket of the country. Using conservative causal bounds, we find that a 1 part per million increase in plant-available soil Zn --- achievable with application of Zn-enriched fertilizer --- decreases child stunting by 9-10 percentage points in the long run, and 4-7 percentage points in the short run. Multiple statistical sensitivity tests indicate that these relationship are not manufactured by omitted, relevant variables. The association is strongest in the most isolated areas and in seasons where dependence on food crops is strongest, as expected if soil Zn deficiency reduces local crop Zn concentration and through that human Zn intake and status.The second chapter investigates the linkage between human selenium (Se) status and the local vs nearby market Se environment, and the role of markets in mitigating the linkage in Malawi. Using nationally representative data on human micronutrient concentration and gridded data on soil characteristics, we find that local soil type (with implications for crop Se concentration) and proximity to Lake Malawi (which holds Se-rich fish) are strongly predictive of human Se status. Furthermore, markets seem to aggregate Se from their catchment area and supply that Se to nearby families. Human Se intake and status therefore appears to depend on both the hyper-local environmental availability of Se and the availability of Se around their nearest market.The globalization of food markets is accompanied by a nutritional and epidemiological transition in developing countries — often manifest as increased dietary diversity but also increased consumption of sugars and fats and an accompanying increase in obesity and diabetes. The last chapter examines how improved rural connectivity catalyzes the nutritional transition among rural households in Nepal. Recent large-scale road and bridge construction concentrated in the urban areas has also dramatically connected rural with urban areas, historically isolated due to Nepal’s dramatic topography. Working with OpenStreetMap data, I identify plausibly exogenous reductions in travel time between rural communities and major cities due to the \textit{non-local} construction. I find that the improved rural connectivity to the closest food trading city or Kathmandu improves child dietary diversity score, mainly through increased consumption of legumes and nuts. At the same time, however, the rural connectivity to Kathmandu, the city where majority of junk foods are produced and distributed, rather increases child junk food consumption and child wasting accordingly, with no evidence on stunting. Therefore, the overall impact of the improved rural connectivity appears to be negative.

TI  - The role of green corridors for wildlife conservation in urban landscape: A literature review
AU  - Aziz, H A
AU  - Rasidi, M H
T2  - IOP Conference Series. Earth and Environmental Science
AB  - Green corridors are an attempt to mitigate negative effects of the built environment of cities and towns. The corridors act as conservation for rapidly extreme intervention and development of the urban environment. Most importantly, it enables dispersal movement of animals within city areas. Issues relate to wildlife conservation in urban areas has been studied for many years and thus, the research makes a review for how the green corridors contribute to the conservation of urban wildlife. This study reviews groups of articles in disciplines of urban landscape planning and biology conservation to discuss the relationship between elements of green corridors and urban wildlife dispersal movement behaviour in Malaysian context. Accordingly, this research is purposely studied to give understanding on how green corridors contribute to the animals' ability of moving and dispersing within the built-up areas. In advance, it is found that there are three factors contribute to the capability of colonization among urban wildlife which are individual, physical and social factor. Green corridor has been defined as one of the physical factor that influence urban wildlife behaviour movement. Consequently, safety area indicating to animals species for traversing in any time such as at night can be defined as the primary potential corridor.

AB  - Consequences of habitat fragmentation for species occurrence are amongst the most important issues in landscape and conservation ecology. Empirical and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the total amount of habitat, patch size and connectivity have nonlinear effects on species survival on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, population models need to incorporate multiple scales, which can be extremely valuable to prioritizing conservation efforts in these changing landscapes. We tested how the amount and configuration of habitat affect understory bird species occurrence using fine to broad-scale habitat features. We used playback to sample birds in 13 Atlantic Forest fragments in Southeast Brazil. Microhabitat, local and regional landscape variables were tested against bird occurrence. Our results demonstrate that different bird species respond to different habitat scales. Sclerurus scansor, Xiphorhynchus fuscus, Automolus leucophthalmus, Drymophila ochropyga, Mackenziaena leachii, and Chiroxiphia caudata were most influenced by tree height and diameter (microhabitat characteristics), S. scansor, F. serrana and Pyriglena leucoptera were most influenced by forest cover and red-edge reflectance(local-scale metrics) and S. scansor, X. fuscus, D. ochropyga, P. leucoptera, F. serrana and M. leachii had area, core area and functional connectivity index (landscape features) as stronger predictors of species occurrence. Small forest fragments acted as corridors and increased overall connectivity of the entire community. The most effective means of maintaining long-term population connectivity of understory birds involves retaining both large and small areas, including forests with different micro-habitat characteristics. No management approach based on a single-scale would benefit all species. Implementing multiscale conservation strategies are necessary for maintaining long-term viability of forest birds on tropical landscapes.

TI  - A study on urban circle: spatial scale analysis and evolution
AU  - Du, Juan
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs a complicated system, the urban spatial structure is influenced by natural, social and economic factors on its formation and development. By making use of modern information technology and the multiple-discipline-crossing method to research spatial distribution of all component elements of the urban spatial structure and interrelationship and interaction among these elements in space and time, in different spatial scales, it can provide scientific basis and technical support for building organic urban spatial structure and formulating appropriate development strategies, which is very significant to maintain sustainable urban development. Due to above-mentioned significance, this paper systematically analyzes characteristics and evolutions of the spatial structure of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales through modern information technology and by establishing effective methods to analyze the urban spatial structure, and acquires major research results as following: (1)On the basis of describing concepts, component elements and scale compositions of the urban spatial structure, commenting on urban spatial structural modes, and summing up quantitative research methods of urban spatial structure in different spatial scales, it establishes the hierarchical analytical method of urban spatial structure, which is based on remote sensing image and can be used in different spatial scales, according to the relationship between remote sensing image and geographical spatial information. This method explains distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and connectivity of areas covered by this information by extracting urban thematic information from multi-source remote sensing image, defining multiple distribution modes for thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and constructing topological structure diagram made up of areas covered by urban thematic information and ways to connect these areas. (2)On the basis of analyzing characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data and qualitative and quantitative concepts involved in applying these characteristic to urban research, it realizes extraction of urban thematic information based on remote sensing image through extraction and quantification of concepts about urban building and vegetation coverage in remote sensing image by using the cloud model, which can be used to converse qualitative concepts into quantitative expression. It proves that this method is effective to extract urban thematic information through precision comparison with the maximum likelihood method. During researching distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information, it recognizes distribution modes of thermal environment of urban thematic information through quantitative definition, and also analyzes characteristics and reasons of distribution of thermal environment of urban thematic information according to recognized results. (3)On the basis of discussing evolution rules of urban spatial structure, it analyzes application superiority and range of modern information technology in the research of evolution rules, and also describes change patterns of urban spatial structure and quantitative analytical method. Besides, it further analyzes characteristics and evolution of Wuhan urban road network by introducing into the complex network theory, mapping the urban road network, which represents the basic framework of urban spatial structure, as complex network, and using statistical characteristics parameters of complex network. (4)This paper systematically analyzes spatial structure and evolution of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales by using multi-source remote sensing image and various research methods. A number of suggestions have been proposed according to the above anaylsis results. Within the spatial scale of urban circle, it adopts models of economic relation intensity and strength to divide spatial levels of Wuhan urban circle, and also incorporates the complex network theory to analyze network characteristics of constructed economic relation network of urban circle. Besides, it uses the fractal theory to analyze spatial fractal characteristics of the urban system of Wuhan urban circle from two aspects, namely, rank-scale structure and spatial distribution. In addition, it makes use of MODIS remote sensing image and the hierarchical analytical method to research spatial structural characteristics of Wuhan urban circle. Within the city-wide spatial scale, it performs qualitative analysis to change patterns of Wuhan urban spatial structure since 1949, and also uses two-period TM/ETM+ remote sensing images and corresponding social and economic data to perform quantitative analysis to changes of time and space during 1991-2002, and further compares changes on distribution modes of thermal environment in areas covered by urban buildings and urban and rural topological structure diagrams of these two periods. Within the spatial scale of main city zone, it adopts the landscape index method to analyze composition and spatial allocation of urban greenland landscape pattern in the main city zone, and also uses ASTER image and the hierarchical analytical method to research distribution characteristics and connectivity of thermal environment through extraction of urban greenland in the Wuhan main city

AB  - As most of Europe’s metropolitan landscapes grow, a change is occurring in their surrounding rural environment. The consequences thereof mainly involve losses of traditional land uses and changes in the socioecomic structures of the local population. The lack of coupling ‘urban society-countryside’ can be considered to constitute a driving force of this process. The present paper focuses upon the rural-urban network around the metropolis of Madrid (Central Spain). We developed a quantitative model to explain the socio-ecological rural-urban linkages, taking into account the influence of the metropolis in the network of neighbouring municipalities. The results show a rural landscape gradient ranging from silvo-pastoral to agricultural land uses and maintaining different interactions with the local socioeconomy. Urban-rural polarisation of the territory and accessibility to the metropolis are the main factors influencing the landscape dynamics. Territorial cohesion among municipalities and connectivity with the metropolis are factors determining the socio-ecological structure. The agricultural area presents good social cohesion, but a weak connection with the City. The silvo-pastoral landscape, on the contrary, maintains prominent links with the metropolis, but a non-significant interconnection between the small towns. The model tested constitutes a useful tool for analysing socio-ecological connectivity and for quantifying, designing and promoting territorial cohesion policies.

AB  - Coastal lakes are subject to multiple stressors, among which land use, hydrological connectivity, and salinity have the greatest effect on their biodiversity. We studied the effects that various land cover types (CORINE) of coastal lake watersheds had on macrophyte diversity in ten coastal lakes along the southern Baltic coast as characterised by twelve phytocenotic indices: these being a number of communities, Shannon–Wiener diversity, evenness, and indices of taxonomic distinctiveness of plant communities: vegetation coverage; colonisation index; share of the phytolittoral area in the total lake area, as well as shares of nympheides, pondweeds, charophytes, marine, emerged and submerged communities in the total lake area. The effects were checked for three groups of lakes distinguished by differences in salinity–freshwater (F, 5), transitional (T, 4), and brackish (B, 1)—in which a total of 48 macrophyte communities were identified. The most abundant in aquatic phytocoenoses were lakes of T type. A partial least squares regression model (PLS-R) showed a stronger impact of land-use types in immediate vicinities and entire watersheds than the impact of physico-chemical properties of water on phytocenotic indices in the lakes. Macrophyte diversity was relatively low in urban and agricultural catchments and relatively high in forest and wetland areas. Agriculture had a negative impact on the number of macrophyte communities in F lakes and, in T lakes, on the number of macrophyte communities, biodiversity, evenness, and proportion of emerged, submerged, and marine communities. Urban areas contributed to lower values of evenness, vegetation coverage, and share of marine communities in F, but, in T, to lower the number of macrophyte communities, evenness, and proportion of submerged and marine communities. Our results confirm the significant impact of land use on macrophyte diversity in coastal aquatic ecosystems. Combined analysis of anthropogenic and natural descriptors is a prerequisite for analysing human threats to biodiversity in coastal lakes. Macrophyte community-based measures of biodiversity are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic impact on the ecological condition of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Simple SummaryRecently, the risk of tick-borne diseases (TBD) has drawn increasing attention from a public health perspective. Information about where ticks are distributed is important for the prevention of TBDs. In this study, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the potential distribution of six major tick species out of 16 tick species collected in the Kanto region, the central part of Japan, based on land-use, climate, and wildlife distribution, and to investigate the factors that contribute to each distribution of ticks. The distribution of raccoons contributed to the distribution of five tick species, and forest connectivity was a strong contributor to the distribution of all species.AbstractBackground: Tick distributions have changed rapidly with changes in human activity, land-use patterns, climate, and wildlife distributions over the last few decades. Methods: To estimate potential distributions of ticks, we conducted a tick survey at 134 locations in western Kanto, Japan. We estimated the potential distributions of six tick species (Amblyomma testudinarium Koch, 1844; Haemaphysalis flava Neumann, 1897; Haemaphysalis kitaokai Hoogstraal, 1969; Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, 1901; Haemaphysalis megaspinosa Saito, 1969; and Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899) using MaxEnt modeling based on climate patterns, land-use patterns, and the distributions of five common wildlife species: sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838), wild boar (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758), raccoon (Procyon lotor Linnaeus, 1758), Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides Gray, 1834), and masked palm civet (Paguma larvata C.E.H. Smith, 1827)). Results: We collected 24,546 individuals of four genera and 16 tick species. Our models indicated that forest connectivity contributed to the distributions of six tick species and that raccoon distribution contributed to five tick species. Other than that, sika deer distribution contributed to H. kitaokai, and wild boar distribution, bamboo forest, and warm winter climate contributed specifically to A. testudinarium. Conclusions: Based on these results, the dispersal of some tick species toward residential areas and expanded distributions can be explained by the distribution of raccoons and by forest connectivity.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of invasive plant species.

AU  - Zhang, Hao
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - In this paper, based on analysis of potential landscape safety pattern and urban greenspaces layout, Shanghai metropolitan area, one of the highly urbanized zone at the East China coast, were taken for a example to discuss how to construct and maintain the ecologically sound urban greenspaces system, which is aimed to organized and layout the self-purification components of the urban ecosystem and build up urban landscape safety pattern with the primary intention to improve the air environment. Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.

AB  - Single-function industrial parks are transforming into innovation districts which combine innovation elements with urban elements. As one of the urban elements, the urban commercial nodes (UCNs) have exhibited a co-evolution phenomenon with sci-tech enterprises (STEs) in innovation districts. However, the urban planning practice of many innovation districts still falls behind in converting industrial land to commercial land use after construction, and the problem of mismatching commercial resources with consumer demand persists. This study aimed to explore how to rationalize the planning of UCNs to make them better fulfill the mission of serving economic growth by analyzing the correlation between UCNs and the development of STEs. The Hangzhou West High-Tech Corridor was adopted as a typical research sample which represents the latest development trend occurring in China’s most innovative districts and leads China in the coordinated development of sci-tech industries and urban life. Using point-of-interest data, Internet assessment data, and corporate business information data, a spatial correlation test and partial least squares regression analysis were performed. The results show that there was a significant spatial correlation between UCNs and STEs. The scale of UCNs had a significant positive correlation with the degree of agglomeration, development scale, and comprehensive development level of the STEs. The catering; hotel; and culture, sports, and entertainment industries correlated the most with STE development. The commercial complex was one of the physical forms that were conducive to the development of surrounding STEs. This study provides references for rational planning of UCNs and STE clusters, and for optimizing the allocation of commercial resources and physical commercial forms in the urban planning process of innovation districts.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanized areas show a high proportion of non-native plants and can work as dispersal points to the surrounding areas. Ensenada is a fast growing city located in the northwestern peninsula of Baja California (Mexico). It is the southern extreme of a bi-national, coastal urban corridor that extends from Los Angeles, California south to Ensenada. This corridor is part of the biodiversity hotspot of the California Floristic Province. The aim of this study was to analyze the composition and distribution of the spontaneous flora in the city of Ensenada. We systematically sampled two differentiated urban environments, vacant lots and arroyos, in 2006 and 2007. We found a total of 158 plant species, 61% of them were non-native species. Arroyo areas showed higher non-native species richness than vacant lots (21.9 vs. 13.6 species/transect) and could be potential dispersal vectors for non-native species to natural areas outside of the city, or in the reverse direction also.

AB  - In this study, we assess the potential of ants as bioindicators of riparian ecological health in two river types (upland and lowland type) located in the Catalonian region. We proposed to understand to what extent do metrics based on ant responses provide useful information that cannot be presented by traditional biophysical assessments while attempting an approach to creating an ant-based multimetric index (ant-based MMI) of the riparian ecological health. A total of 22 ant species were identified, and 42 metrics related to ant foraging activity, species richness, and functional traits were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Riparian features and proximal land use land cover (LULC) were used to distinguish disturbed from less disturbed sites. We found that ant communities strongly responded to human disturbance. When compared with an exclusively physical-based index for the assessment of the riparian health, the ant-based MMI was more sensitive to human disturbance, by also reacting to the effects of the surrounding LULC pressure. This study provides a preliminary approach for an ant-based assessment tool to evaluate the health of riparian corridors although additional research is required to include other river types and a wider stressor gradient before a wider application.

TI  - Carbon in conurbations: Afforestation and carbon storage as consequences of urban sprawl in Colorado's Front Range
AU  - Golubiewski, Nancy Ellen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In the arid western United States, urbanization transforms landscapes from sparsely vegetated grasslands with tree-lined riparian corridors into matrices of asphalt, concrete, turf grass, and multi-strata wooded stands. This research sought to understand the consequences of urbanization upon carbon pools in the Front Range of Colorado, a metropolitan area undergoing expansive urban transformation. Vegetative and edaphic C, as well as biomass and other soil physical/chemical properties, were measured throughout the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area in 2000 and 2001. Anthropogenic activities leave clear signatures on all three C compartments measured. The comparison of C storage in the vegetated spaces of urban areas to that in grasslands and agricultural fields reveals a marked increase as well as a proportional shift in storage from belowground to aboveground. Lawn grass produces more biomass and stores more C than local prairie or agricultural fields. Introduced woody vegetation comprises a substantial C pool in urban greenspaces and represents a wholly new ecosystem feature. Established urban greenspaces harbor larger C pools than native grasslands on a per area basis. Rather than map the urban land-cover types, regional detection of the proportion of the urbanized landscape occupied by vegetated and anthropogenic components extracted biophysical information of the urban/rural matrix. Convex geometry and partial unmixing algorithms were used to extract major landscape elements from an AVIRIS image of Boulder, including six vegetation endmembers. Other scene components were also identified, including soil, water, and five impervious surfaces. The fractional abundance of urban vegetation equaled or exceeded that of vegetation in surrounding areas. In order to understand the effect of the per-area C increase in anthropogenic landscapes regionally, the distribution of carbon in land covers across the landscape was investigated. Regional C estimates were based on both fractional abundances and land-use/land-cover categories. A carbon hotspot exists in the urbanized areas where well-established urban vegetation occupies residential neighborhoods, urban greenspaces, and city streets. Other hotspots exist along riparian corridors and on vegetated foothills. Between 1930 and 1990, developed land almost quintupled in area in the Front Range of Colorado. During the same time period, estimates of the carbon pool trajectory range from −3% to +18%. The true direction, given the local context, is surmised to be neutral or positive.

AU  - McClure, Meredith L

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - This study sought to identify critical areas for puma (Puma concolor) movement across the state of Arizona in the American Southwest and to identify those most likely to be impacted by current and future human land uses, particularly expanding urban development and associated increases in traffic volume. Human populations in this region are expanding rapidly, with the potential for urban centers and busy roads to increasingly act as barriers to demographic and genetic connectivity of large‐bodied, wide‐ranging carnivores such as pumas, whose long‐distance movements are likely to bring them into contact with human land uses and whose low tolerance both for and from humans may put them at risk unless opportunities for safe passage through or around human‐modified landscapes are present. Brownian bridge movement models based on global positioning system collar data collected during bouts of active movement and linear mixed models were used to model habitat quality for puma movement; then, a wall‐to‐wall application of circuit theory models was used to produce a continuous statewide estimate of connectivity for puma movement and to identify pinch points, or bottlenecks, that may be most at risk of impacts from current and future traffic volume and expanding development. Rugged, shrub‐ and scrub‐dominated regions were highlighted as those offering high quality movement habitat for pumas, and pinch points with the greatest potential impacts from expanding development and traffic, although widely distributed, were particularly prominent to the north and east of the city of Phoenix and along interstate highways in the western portion of the state. These pinch points likely constitute important conservation opportunities, where barriers to movement may cause disproportionate loss of connectivity, but also where actions such as placement of wildlife crossing structures or conservation easements could enhance connectivity and prevent detrimental impacts before they occur.

AB  - Loss of green space habitats and landscape fragmentation are important reasons for the decline in environmental quality, degradation of ecosystem functions, and decline in biodiversity. Quantifying the spatio-temporal characteristics of landscape fragmentation of green space and its relationship with urban expansion mode is an important basis for improving urban development mode and enhancing urban ecological functions. For this paper, we took the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the research object, a typical rapidly urbanizing area. Through multi-scale landscape pattern analysis and statistical analysis, the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of green space fragmentation in the BTH urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2020 and the influence of urban expansion were analyzed, and the land-use situation in 2030 was predicted by the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The main conclusions are as follows: The BTH urban agglomeration has developed rapidly in the last 20 years, showing the characteristics of diffusion and corridor development. The intensity and pattern of urban expansion have significantly affected the pattern of green space, leading to the intensification of domestic green space fragmentation. Among them, urban expansion exerts most severe effects on the fragmentation of farmland, followed by grassland and water. The influence of urban expansion on the scale and fragmentation of forestland is limited. The forecast results in 2030 show that built-up areas may continue to occupy green space. The rate of occupation of farmland will slow down while that of grassland will intensify.

TI  - Nutrient cycling in impacted stream ecosystems: From microbes to watersheds
AU  - Van Horn, David James
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - his dissertation explores the effects of disturbance on nutrient cycling in stream ecosystems at three spatial scales: the patch scale includes localized processes and assemblages, the reach scale encompasses tens to hundreds of meters of stream length, and the watershed scale consists of the hierarchical network of stream orders found in catchments. Additionally, the gut bacterial communities of three freshwater snail species were investigated to better understand the ecology and physiology of this important group of aquatic grazers. Snails are important regulators of periphyton growth, which plays an integral role in nutrient cycling in stream ecosystems. Freshwater snails are also intermediate hosts for a variety of parasites of medical and veterinary significance. Biofilm assemblages are patch scale communities which dominate the metabolism and biogeochemical cycles in stream ecosystems. To determine the effects of eutrophication, one of the most common disturbances to stream ecosystems, on the structure and function of heterotrophic stream biofilms, we created an enrichment gradient by amending darkened stream channel mesocosms with a stochiometrically balanced solution of sucrose, NH4, and PO 4.  Biofilm community productivity and function responded exponentially to enrichment. The observed nonlinear increase in functional capacity suggests biofilms are highly responsive to resource availability likely due to the physical structures and synergistic social interactions found in biofilm assemblages. Domestic and native ungulate grazers significantly alter riparian areas, stream reaches, and catchment characteristics. We examined nutrient cycling linkages between riparian soils and adjacent streams and the impacts of ungulate grazing on these ecosystems and processes at six grazing exclosure sites in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, NM, USA.  The results suggest ungulate grazing impacts terrestrial characteristics which are linked to ecosystem services provided by adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Management plans should carefully balance the positive effect of grazing on stream nutrient processing and retention reported here with the well documented grazing related loss of other ecosystem services such as decreased fish and aquatic invertebrate habitat and effects on water quality parameters such as turbidity and water temperature.Nutrient cycling in aridland catchments and rivers is controlled by a unique set of inputs and retention mechanisms. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in the sources and sinks of nutrients in the middle Rio Grande (MRG), a 300 km reach of aridland river in the southwestern United States that drains an agro-urban catchment experiencing rapid population growth. Wastewater treatment plant inputs were the dominant source of nutrients to the MRG, increasing loads of NO3-N, SRP, and NH4-N by 1000-2000% relative to upstream loading. The total retention of NO3-N and SRP inputs in the MRG corridor ranged from 6-99% and 34-99%, respectively. Retention was strongly and positively correlated with the percentage of water diverted from the MRG for agricultural irrigation. Little is known about the microbial gut flora of freshwater snails in spite of the important role gastropod mollusks play as grazers in freshwater ecosystems. This study used culture independent methods to describe the community composition and the variability of gut microbes within and among three species of planorbid snails, Helisoma duryi (North American species),  Bulinus africanus (African species), and Biomphalaria pfeifferi  (African species). Three hundred and fourteen unique bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs, DNA sequences with <98% similarity) were found in the guts of the three snail species. The results suggest the presence of highly diverse and relatively similar gut microbial communities in the three snail species in spite of varying levels of phylogenetic and geographic separation, and highlight the need for additional study to determine the roles gut microbes play in the physiology of these important intermediate hosts for digenetic trematodes of medical and veterinary significance.

TI  - Human–River Encounter Sites: Looking for Harmony between Humans and Nature in Cities
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Human welfare depends on the health of nature. Decades of ill-conceived management practices caused a decline in the quality of human life, as well as in biological and cultural diversity. Simultaneously, they increased social and ecological risks. For instance, mismanagement of urban rivers jeopardizes their ecological health and ability to provide ecosystem services. While demands for responsible urban riverscape design that fulfill both human and ecosystem needs are increasing, explicit recommendations to achieve these ambitious goals are still lacking. We present a first attempt of a conceptualization of Human–River Encounter Sites for urban rivers that targets reconciliation between humans and nature within urban river corridors. It builds upon the River Culture Concept with literature reviews and experiences from river restoration projects. We identify six tenets that are important to develop guidelines for Human–River Encounter Sites: health, safety, functionality, accessibility, collaboration, and awareness. This paper presents how these tenets can collectively help to harmonize the needs of citizens and biota, and to mitigate the current urban river crisis. This contribution feeds the debate on sustainable socio-ecological management of urban rivers and provides guidelines for the implementation of future urban river restorations and management efforts.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at <8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - The Potential Role of Drove Roads as Connecting Corridors for Birds between Natura 2000 Sites
AU  - Malo, Juan E

T2  - Birds
AB  - Simple SummaryDrove roads (the traditional paths used to move livestock between villages and among grazing grounds, frequently with some tree cover) have been suggested to be ecological refuges and corridors of interest to complement the European Natura 2000 Network. However, their narrowness cast doubts regarding their capacity to act as connectors for vertebrates with large home ranges, such as birds. Here we show that bird communities in drove roads crossing agrarian landscapes in the Madrid Region (Spain) are a predictable subset of species in comparison to those in wooded protected sites, and that species richness declines in them with the distance from Natura 2000 sites and with the reduction in forest cover of the area. Thus, drove roads sustain nesting bird communities that depend on the wider landscape rather than on their own characteristics, and can only play a secondary role as refuges, stepping stones or corridors funneling bird movements between protected sites.AbstractEcological connectivity among protected Natura 2000 sites is a priority for conservation in Europe due to the increasing pressure on biodiversity from human activities and climate change. Drove roads, the traditional paths used to move livestock through the territory, have been proposed as potential ecological corridors due to their large extent, continuous nature and centennial protection from ploughing and urbanization, which allows the persistence of some tree cover and natural habitats in them. Bird communities were sampled during the reproductive season along 19 drove road transects in agrarian landscapes between Natura 2000 sites, all of them around the conurbation of Madrid (Madrid Region, Spain). Bird community nestedness was assessed by NODF computation followed by significance estimation by aleatorization, and factors explaining species richness and bird abundance were analyzed through General Linear Models fitted with environmental variables measured on official vegetation maps and orthophotos. Bird communities in drove roads were significantly nested, showing high predictability in the order of species loss from better preserved sites to those under stronger environmental pressures. Accordingly, Poisson regression showed bird richness to decrease strongly with distance from the closest Natura 2000 site and to increase with forest cover at the landscape and at the drove road scales. Bird abundance increased strongly with distance from urban areas and motorways, and it was slightly higher in areas with more forest cover and in transects with less bare ground. These results, and the higher relevance detected for landscape scale variables (500 m around transects) than for those at the drove road (50 m) scale, show that (i) they can only play a secondary role as habitat for nesting birds but (ii) they may add to the Green Infrastructure strategy as facilitators or stepping stones for bird communities if the surrounding landscape is favorable for them.

TI  - The study of associations between Maryland's amphibian species and habitat parameters at local and landscape scales
AU  - Walz, Anita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The relationship between amphibians and their surrounding habitat was examined at local and landscape levels. Amphibian species presence and richness information and measurements of local habitat conditions were obtained for 1000 stream segments sampled during the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Landscape metrics were determined from the National Land Cover Data set for varying extent landscapes around each sampling segment. Anura species richness was higher at typical pristine lowland streams, often in the presence of instream structures. If compact large forests were close by or if large and many wetlands were in the far reach, more anuran species were encountered. Caudata species richness was generally higher west, in small, relatively steep, pristine mountain streams with high forest proportion. Wetlands, agriculture and urban features showed negative relationships with Caudata richness. Most individual species followed these trends set by their respective richness group. Exceptions were northern two-lined salamanders and red-backed salamanders, which seemed more tolerant of lower habitat quality. For red salamanders the absence of urban areas seemed highest priority. The optimum map extents that were closely associated with species presence were species and land cover type specific. Generally, negative associations with urban cover were strongest at the smallest map extent. Multivariate linear models predicting encounter probabilities of a species from local and/or landscape parameters showed less fit for anuran species than for Caudata. More frequently encountered species were more difficult to predict, possibly because they are less specialized than others. Changes in association strength due to changes in age, resolution or processing of landuse data sets were evaluated. Fluctuations in association strength was species and/or cover type specific. Sources of fluctuations were data origin and resolution. The finest resolution was rarely the best. However, wetlands are a limiting factor when reducing the resolution, due to their small size. In order to measure landscape connectivity, a hypothetical species was released at the center of each landscape map with dispersal simulated at varying step sizes. After hypothetical riparian zones were added, connectivity increased with greater improvements in landscapes of lower initial connectivity.

AB  - Over the last 4 decades, China has undergone major economic development, resulting in considerable impacts on its wildlife populations and habitats. It is essential to quantify the conflict between development and conservation to assist with policy-making because forestry policies and market trends affected indirectly the distribution of Asian elephants. Here, we mapped the historical distribution of elephants versus human land use. Elephant distributions appear to occur in unbroken natural forests only. However, over the 40-year period, the distribution ranges have become smaller and fragmented, with natural forest area also declining by 16%. The monoculture of cash trees is encroaching on natural forests. Over the past 10 years, rubber plantations have become concentrated in the south, with extensive natural forests and scattered rubber farms being converted to tea plantations, due to changes in governmental policies and product prices. Through mapping the spatial changes in the distribution of rubber and tea plantations, our study is expected to help local managers to incorporate the needs of endangered elephants through creating space when planning plantations, especially in Xishuangbanna and the south part of Pu’er. In conclusion, restoring elephant habitat and establishing ecological corridors are critical for the survival of elephants in this region.

AB  - Urban expansion has resulted in the fragmentation of green spaces. Based on the concept of a living community that integrates mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, and grasslands, the extraction of key elements in green spaces of regional ecosystems provides core scientific support for the ecological restoration of territorial spaces. According to the ecological service function importance and ecological sensitivity, the ecological sources were identified in this study. Furthermore, we distinguished the ecological corridors using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and identified the key areas of green spaces using the circuit theory model. The result showed that (1) 62 ecological sources were present with a total area of 4696 km2, of which green space accounted for 98.19%; meanwhile, 151 ecological corridors (optimal path) were densely distributed in the southwest region around the Daimao and Bopingling mountains. (2) The key areas of ecological restoration in the study area included 17 key ecological sources and 19 key ecological corridors. The area covered by ecological pinch points was 1327 km2, among which 77.54% of green space comprised forest area. The area of ecological barriers was 9647 km2, and the forest area still accounted for the highest proportion (63.92%). (3) Based on a comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution of key areas of ecological restoration and green spaces, we formulated classified ecological restoration measures. The study findings are expected to provide a reference for planning the ecological restoration of territorial spaces.

TI  - The importance of traffic corridors as urban habitats for plants in Finland
AU  - Ranta, Pertti
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Traffic corridors have been recognized as floristically rich with endangered and rare species included. The aim of this study is to treat traffic corridors as habitats and estimate their importance for diversity of vascular plants on municipal level. The material is derived from the comprehensive studies of urban floras in the cities of Vantaa, Kerava and Järvenpää during the 1990s in southern Finland. The material consists of over 190,000 species records (704-771 species). The material was divided in two groups: the ones with occurrences in traffic corridors (TC) and the others with no occurrences (NTC). The percentage of the traffic corridor plants of the total flora is almost the same in all the three cities: two thirds in traffic corridors and one third not in traffic corridors. The explanation may be the general floristic similarity of the cities. The two groups differ ecologically from each other. The association of plants with traffic corridors varies according to the ecology of the species. About 100 plants have more than 50% of their occurrences in traffic corridors. In Järvenpää, a group of four Carex-species was intensively mapped. 46 occurrences out of 50 were found in traffic corridors. A case study showed the difficulties in management of endangered species on a roadside site. The usual extensive management techniques were not sustainable for the survival of the species. Instead, a much more intensive management was needed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - What Is the Potential to Increase Local Biodiversity in Semi-Urban Amenity Grasslands Through Meadow Constructions?
AU  - Östberg, Alexandra
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The loss of biodiversity worldwide and methods of prevention are hot subjects receiving increased interest in todays’ research. Meadow construction in urban areas has been the focus of recent studies to increase both local and global biodiversity. In my report, I address potential analyses to conduct in advance before practical meadow constructions in a landscape. The subject I chose to focus on for this report was a LONA-project aimed to construct meadows on contemporary amenity grasslands in a semi-urban municipality. I used vegetation data from an inventory executed in 2021. Patches were in advance classified based on conditions observed during the inventory with class 1 obtaining the highest meadow potential, class 2 obtaining mediocre potential, and class 3 weak or no potential. I analysed vegetation data on species richness, environmental indicator values, and composition. Additionally, I analysed the soil types and historical land uses in the study area to display credible soil characteristics. The order of Lepidoptera was used as a model taxon for pollinators and the red-listed Marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) was separately analysed for conservational purposes. To illustrate the landscapes’ ability to facilitate the dispersal of butterflies, connectivity analyses of varying meadow construction scenarios were executed. Results indicate higher species richness on average per patch and more indicator species in class 1, suggesting a better starting point and making quality assessments more credible in comparison to class 2. Underlaying soil type seems to some extent to influence the meadow potential by affecting vegetation composition and hence butterfly occurrence in terms of host plant distribution. I could however not draw any conclusions from the effect of historical land use on current patch classifications, and consequently meadow potential. To facilitate for E. aurinia to widen its distribution in the study area, and to avoid local extinction, further conservational efforts should focus on mimicking the conditions and current management of the powerline corridor, that currently yields high diversity of butterflies and abundance of E. aurinia, to other powerline corridors in the study area. To facilitate dispersal of butterflies and other pollinators, target meadow areas of both class 1 and class 2 patches should be constructed to avoid patch isolation, as illustrated in the connectivity analyses. Further research is needed to investigate other factors possibly affecting suitability of grasslands for meadow construction.

TI  - Landbird demography and community structure along an urbanization gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin
AU  - Schlesinger, Matthew Daniel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization has profound effects on biodiversity, but few studies have addressed the consequences of multiple stressors along urbanization gradients on both populations and communities. I conducted three studies of urbanization effects on landbird demography and community structure, sampling landbird abundance and diversity at 375 sample points and monitoring 494 nests of 10 focal species at 97 points along a development gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin, California and Nevada. First, I examined effects of nesting strategy and body size on some key demographic parameters: abundance, nest success, and finite growth rate. Abundance of large-bodied species and nest success of cavity nesters stayed constant or increased as urban development increased, whereas abundance of most small-bodied species and nest success of open nesters declined. For some species, the entire basin was a population sink, and for others, points along the development gradient may be ecological traps. Identifying sinks and traps along gradients rather than assuming discrete subpopulations is a superior approach for many landscapes and can highlight opportunities for habitat restoration. Second, I used model selection to determine the relative importance of development, human activity, local and landscape vegetation, topography, and location in explaining richness, abundance, and dominance. Urbanization stressors were consistently among the principal forces structuring the community, and disturbance from human activity was often the most important factor, surpassing even habitat loss from development. My results suggest likely consequences for urban ecosystem function that call for local- and landscape-scale management, focused research, and long-term monitoring to retain biodiversity in urban areas. Third, I used metacommunity theory to guide a variation-partitioning analysis of the spatial and environmental structuring of the landbird community. Environmental variation generally exceeded spatial variation, but all groups displayed a significant component of spatial variation, demonstrating a likely mix of dispersal limitation with niche-based and source-sink processes. Structuring of urban avoiders, adapters, and exploiters differed in interesting ways. Substantial roles of space, habitat, and landscape configuration illustrated the value of retaining native vegetation, the need to consider connectivity in managing biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes, and the value of a metacommunity approach for addressing urbanization's multifaceted effects on biodiversity.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) can simultaneously provide social and ecological benefits for humans. Although numerous studies have evaluated the multifunctional benefits of urban green space, few of them have determined the differentiated conservation priorities of UGS towards the tradeoff relationship of multiple UGS functions. Here, we proposed an integrated framework to explore the targeted conservation strategies of UGS patches. Specifically, the circuit theory model and gravity floating catchment area method were adopted to evaluate ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS under multiple scenarios in terms of different species dispersal distances and resident travelling modes, and Pareto ranking analysis was utilized to identify conservation priorities of UGS. Wuhan City in central China was taken as a case study. The results show that Wuhan exhibits low synergic relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS, and only approximately 7.51% of UGS patches on average rank high. Based on the frequency of UGS Pareto ranks under different scenarios, the differentiated conservation strategy was developed, which identified 10 key green areas that need to be protected and 11 green areas that need to be restored. This work is expected to provide an applicable framework to identify key UGS patches and assist in urban planning and layout optimization of multifunctional UGS in Wuhan, China.

TI  - Conservation Genetics and Ecology of the Hazel Dormouse
AU  - Combe, Fraser
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Woodland species face a challenging future because of human activity and global climate change, as such it is vital to understand the ecology of species that inhabit these habitats in order to conduct effective conservation management. I describe the phylogeographic structure of the hazel dormouse within the UK, to identify post-glacial dispersal routes and to describe population units for conservation. I provide evidence for a single post-glacial colonization coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 Kya. I also demonstrate the utility of novel occupancy modelling techniques to determine dormouse presence with high probability of detection. I provide optimal survey guidelines for ecological practitioners to conduct rigorous statistically significant surveys. This species is known to be susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation limiting dispersal and functional connectivity. I use a landscape genetics approach to characterize the genetic structure of populations of dormice from seven regions around the UK to explicitly test for the role of landscape heterogeneity and barriers to dispersal. The results suggests build-up of genetic structure amongst islands of fragmented habitat that is explained in part due to isolation-by-distance, and in part due to specific landscape features between different regions. The isolation-by-resistance analysis allows us to identify the landscape features, such as land cover, hedgerows and roads that facilitate or inhibit gene flow. Results suggest that dispersal in hazel dormice is strongly influenced by barriers in the landscape, with our main findings being that urban areas and roads are associated with decreased gene flow while habitat features such as hedgerows and forest cover are associated with increased gene flow. Finally, I investigated the effect of density dependence and climatic factors on the population demography of five marked hazel dormice populations in Europe (four in the UK and one in Lithuania). The results from the chapter have identified the environmental drivers of these population parameters on hibernating mammals whilst providing evidence that density dependence has the greatest effect on population dynamics in this species. The results provide information that variability in winter conditions can have serious consequences for individual fitness, decreasing the dormancy season and leading to an increased extinction risk in this species. I discuss the implications for hazel dormouse conservation in the UK, and make recommendations for conservation practitioners to ensure the future persistence of this species.

AU  - Valencia-Marín, Bryan Steven
AU  - Irene Duarte Gandica
AU  - Aguirre-Obando, Oscar Alexander
T2  - Parasites & Vectors
AB  - Background Mayaro virus (Togaviridae) is an endemic arbovirus of the Americas with epidemiological similarities with the agents of other more prominent diseases such as dengue (Flaviviridae), Zika (Flaviviridae), and chikungunya (Togaviridae). It is naturally transmitted in a sylvatic/rural cycle by Haemagogus spp., but, potentially, it could be incorporated and transmitted in an urban cycle by Aedes aegypti, a vector widely disseminated in the Americas.Methods The Mayaro arbovirus dynamics was simulated mathematically in the colombian population in the eight biogeographical provinces, bearing in mind the vector’s population movement between provinces through passive transport via truck cargo. The parameters involved in the virus epidemiological dynamics, as well as the vital rates of Ae. aegypti in each of the biogeographical provinces were obtained from the literature. These data were included in a meta-population model in differential equations, represented by a model structured by age for the dynamic population of Ae. aegypti combined with an epidemiological SEI/SEIR-type model. In addition, the model was incorporated with a term of migration to represent the connectivity between the biogeographical provinces.Results The vital rates and the development cycle of Ae. aegypti varied between provinces, having greater biological potential between 23 °C and 28 °C in provinces of Imerí, biogeographical Chocó, and Magdalena, with respect to the North-Andean Moorland (9.33–21.38 °C). Magdalena and Maracaibo had the highest flow of land cargo. The results of the simulations indicate that Magdalena, Imerí, and biogeographical Chocó would be the most affected regarding the number of cases of people infected by Mayaro virus over time.Conclusions The temperature in each of the provinces influences the local population dynamics of Ae. aegypti and passive migration via transport of land cargo plays an important role on how the Mayaro virus would be disseminated in the human population. Once this arbovirus begins an urban cycle, the most-affected departments would be Antioquia, Santander, Norte de Santander, Cesar (Provinces of Magdalena), and Valle del Cauca, and Chocó (biogeographical province of Chocó), which is why vector control programmes must aim their efforts at these departments and include some type of vector control to the transport of land cargo to avoid a future Mayaro epidemic.

TI  - Analyzing Vertebrate Movement in and Around Natural Areas Through Road Surveys
AU  - Freter, Victoria
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With the expansion of the human population, new roads are continually being built, leading to an increase in fragmentation or loss of natural habitats. These roads can act as corridors for vertebrates connecting natural habitats or aiding in migration, but they can also act as barriers or boundaries leading to fragmentation, isolation, and/or mortality on roadways. Research has focused mainly on larger highways, outside of the U.S., and away from larger urban areas. The Oak Openings Region, a biodiversity hot spot in northwestern Ohio, is a matrix of human dominated land use and remnant natural patches. This research focused on identifying vertebrate mortality hot spots and the spatial and temporal variables associated with vertebrate road mortality. From mid-April to the end of September 2019, we surveyed 38 road transects within and around three protected (natural) areas to record diversity, abundance, and distribution of roadkilled vertebrates and to identify influencing factors (e.g., land use, canopy cover, environmental data, road characteristics). We found an uneven spread of roadkill, with 45% of roadkill found on nine out of the 38 (24%) surveyed transects, highlighting potential areas to prioritize for mitigation. During the spring months (April 14 - June 20), nine of the transects had no roadkill, but in the summer months (June 21 - September 18), only one transect had no roadkill. This suggests that seasonality influenced the abundance and distribution of roadkill. As transects moved northward, there was a positive trend of more roadkill with increased developed land use. We found a total of 297 roadkill on or around the roads, with all vertebrate taxa included. Mammals made up 49.8% of the roadkill found. Mammal roadkill showed a significant positive trend with average canopy cover (p < 0.0001). Amphibians made up the second largest roadkill group, but showed a seasonal peak in August. These results can help land managers predict where animal dispersal is occurring, which roads negatively impact vertebrates, and identify where better connectivity of the landscape could improve conditions for vertebrate populations. This study suggests that human dominated land use increases mortality and seasonality influences roadkill abundance and distribution.

TI  - The Structure and Composition of Puerto Rico’s Urban Mangroves
AU  - Branoff, Benjamin L
AU  - Martinuzzi, Sebastián
T2  - Forests
AB  - This study characterizes the structure and composition of mangrove forests across urban gradients in Puerto Rico. It then uses a suite of hydrologic, water chemistry, and land cover variables to test for the relative importance of urban intensity alongside flooding and water chemistry in explaining observed variability in forest structure and composition. Three separate statistical tests suggest a significant but limited influence of urbanness on forest composition and structure. In the most urban sites, the diameters of the largest trees were 27% larger, but all structural measurements were best explained by surface water chemistry, primarily nitrogen concentrations. Concentrations of ammonium and total Kjeldahl nitrogen best explained stem density, tree girth and canopy height. The most urban forests also contained 5.0 more species per hectare, on average, than the least urban forests, and simple regression suggests that urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition. The most urban forests were more dominated by Laguncularia racemosa, while both Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle were found to be less abundant in the most urban sites, a trend that may be linked to the influence of precipitation and tidal connectivity on porewater salinity across the urban gradient. In multiple regression, no statistical difference was detected in the importance of surrounding land cover, flooding, or water quality in explaining the variance in either composition or structural metrics. This suggests that while a given forest metric may be strongly linked to either land cover, water quality, or flooding, all three are likely important and should be considered when characterizing these forests. With more human dependents in urban areas, the provisioning of important ecosystem services may be influenced by land use variables in addition to the more commonly measured metrics of water chemistry and flooding.

TI  - Bee Guilds’ Responses to Urbanization in Neotropics: A Case Study
AU  - Gaglianone, Maria Cristina
T2  - Diversity
AB  - The consequent deforestation of urban sprawl is one of the causes of the decline of wild bee communities. In this context, urban green areas (UGA) may play an important role and constitute refuge areas for bees. This study analyzed the influence of UGA conditions and their surroundings in bee guilds’ responses in a medium-sized Brazilian city (Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ). The bees were sampled for 12 months (2017–2018) in 12 UGAs, and bee abundance and species richness were evaluated in guilds considering: nesting behavior, nesting site, and trophic specialization. We used as explanatory variables conditions of UGAs—the number of trees (NT), diameter at breast height (DBH), flower cover (FC), plant richness (PR), percentage of paving (PV)—and of their surroundings—paving (SPV) and the number of buildings (NB). Results showed 80% of eusocial bees, 82% nest in cavities, and 99% were generalists. FC, DBH, and NB mainly explained the responses of different guilds in study areas from all explanatory variables. Thus, this study confirms different responses associated with bee guilds’ attributes. In order to conserve bee diversity, city planning must include more green areas with large flower covers and avoid long corridors of high buildings that can impact bee dispersion.

TI  - The influence of urban green spaces on declining bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
AU  - Beckham, Jessica L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are adept pollinators of countless cultivated and wild flowering plants, but many species have experienced declines in recent decades. Though urban sprawl has been implicated as a driving force of such losses, urban green spaces hold the potential to serve as habitat islands for bumble bees. As human populations continue to grow and metropolitan areas become larger, the survival of many bumble bee species will hinge on the identification and implementation of appropriate conservation measures at regional and finer scales. North Texas is home to some the fastest-growing urban areas in the country, including Denton County, as well as at least two declining bumble bee species (B. pensylvanicus and  B. fraternus). Using a combination of field, molecular DNA and GIS methods I evaluated the persistence of historic bumble bee species in Denton County, and investigated the genetic structure and connectivity of the populations in these spaces. Field sampling resulted in the discovery of both  B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus in Denton County's urban green spaces. While the relative abundance of B. fraternus in these spaces was significantly lower than historic levels gleaned from museum records, that of B. pensylvanicus was significantly higher. Statistical analyses found that both bare ground and tree cover surrounding sample sites were negatively associated with numbers of bumble bee individuals and hives detected in these green spaces. Additionally, limited genetic structuring of bumble bee populations was detected, leading to the conclusion that extensive gene flow is occurring across populations in Denton County.

TI  - Analyzing Land Cover Change and Urban Growth Trajectories of the Mega-Urban Region of Dhaka Using Remotely Sensed Data and an Ensemble Classifier
AU  - Hassan, Mohammad Mehedy
AU  - Southworth, Jane
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Forest-a non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km2 in 1972 to 378 km2 in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

AB  - This paper investigated the spatial and temporal variations of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) from 1979 to 2018. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is selected for UTCI calculation in the region and analyzed by a linear trend and correlation analysis. The results showed that (1) the UTCI of CPEC is decreased with the increase of latitude and altitude. There is obvious spatial heterogeneity in the seasonal scale and the spatial distribution of different thermal stress categories. (2) UTCI generally exhibited a positive trend of 0.33 °C/10a over the past 40 years, and the seasonal variation characteristics of UTCI show an upward trend in all four seasons, of which spring is the fastest. On the space scale, the growth trend has significant spatial variations. (3) Temperature has a positive correlation with UTCI. The influence of temperature on UTCI is greater than that of wind speed. The results of this study will be helpful for regional planning and also contribute to comprehending the characteristics of the thermal environment in CPEC.

TI  - Ecologies of the Passions in Early Modern English Tragedies
AU  - Biggie, Roya
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ecologies of the Passions recovers a neglected model for understanding early modern relationality, one that turns the seemingly inward experience of emotion outward toward the environment. Drawing on early modern medical texts, I argue that the period’s dramatists imagine bodies as humorally vulnerable to other bodies, both human and nonhuman, within dynamically affective environments. As such, my project illustrates the intimate configurations of human and nonhuman life in early modern tragedies. Building upon recent work in the emerging fields of ecocriticism and affect theory, I argue that the period’s dramatic literature exposes the porous fluidity of the Galenic body—its embeddedness within ecologies composed of material objects, plant life, and other bodies. More specifically, through readings of tragedies by Thomas Kyd, William Shakespeare, John Webster, and John Ford, I show that early modern playwrights dramatize a bodily fragility that is simultaneously dangerous and productive. While scholars have drawn attention to the disciplinary and gendered implications of Galenic theories of embodiment, I argue that the period’s tragedies depict bodies extending beyond their contours and transforming through intimate entanglements with human and nonhuman life. As bodies open unto one another, forming affective channels through which the liquid passions move, they expose themselves to the sometimes tender and sometimes risky touches of the world and its inhabitants.Each chapter focuses on a different arrangement of bodies and examines how private experience brings individuals into contact with larger social and ecological networks. At the same time, I argue that the period’s medical texts, including Helkiah Crooke’s Mikrokosmographia  and Thomas Wright’s The Passions of the Minde, present the body as precariously and productively open to the exterior world. My first chapter orbits around questions of itinerant passions and disembodied sorrow in Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy. I suggest that a disembodied understanding of sorrow inspires empathetic bonds, allowing the bereaved to merge with the deceased. In my second chapter, I argue for a conception of ecological sympathy in Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus  through a focus on the elements, sylvan life, and interpersonal relations. Through examining the play’s interspecies relationships, I consider the possibilities and limitations of feeling for and with nonhuman life. Chapter Three explores the generative effects of mobile organs and parts in Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi. While the play acknowledges the risks involved in the lovers’ exchange of bodily parts, Webster illustrates the productive fertility of such openness by suggesting that moving organs culminate in the creation of hybrid flesh. My final chapter on Ford’s  The Broken Heart focuses on the dangers of ecological invasion. I argue that Ford engages with theories of infection and emotional contagion by dramatizing the affective movement of melancholy and the threat of corporeal permeability.

AB  - Reasonable identification of the ecosystem security space and pattern restoration for the Yellow River Basin will be significant for facilitating future ecological protection and restoration projects. This study employs ecosystem services and landscape connectivity to discern ecological source areas and conducts an optimization evaluation method of resistance surfaces and the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model to identify the ecosystem security pattern of urban agglomeration. Then, restoration measures are proposed. The results indicate that: (1) There are 46 ecological source areas in the ecosystem security patterns of the Lanxi urban agglomeration, with a total area of 8199.249 km2. Moreover, in terms of spatial distribution, ecological source areas are sparse in the east while crowded in the west of the Lanxi urban agglomeration and are mainly composed of natural reserves, forest parks, and farmlands. (2) The ecosystem security patterns contain 914 ecological corridors with a total length of 62,970.181 km, most of which are short-distance corridors, being dense in the part of the northwest with a webbed feature. (3) The study adds 10 ecological source areas to restore the ecosystem security pattern and ecological corridors to improve the rationality of the ecosystem security pattern. Meanwhile, this study proposes restoration measures to protect the ecological environment by defining the levels of ecological security in order to provide a reference for the government to formulate policies and regulations.

TI  - Analyzing the pattern and connectivity of urban green spaces: A case study of Izmir, Turkey
AU  - Hepcan, Serif
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The primary concerns in this study were to quantify the connectivity and green space pattern using landscape metrics (PLAND, NP, AREA_MN and CONNECT) in the central districts of the city of Izmir. The primary research materials included thirteen 1:25,000 scale standard topographical maps and IKONOS satellite image with 1 m resolution. The PLAND scores revealed that while the urban fabric occupied almost 26 % of the study area, the urban green spaces covered only 1.45 %. This was also the lowest score in proportion to the areas of other land-use/cover classes. Furthermore, the results of NP and MPS indicated that the configuration of urban green spaces was very patchy and highly fragmented. Likewise, using CONNECT, the overall connectivity score of urban green spaces was 0.12, which was the lowest score of all areas measured the metrics. The Güzelbahçe district seemed to hold the most promise for connectivity, with a CONNECT score of 3.75. On the other hand, the Bornova district presented the least promising case in terms of connectivity, with a score of 0.59. In the study area, the correlations between the size of the districts/built-up areas and the CONNECT scores of the urban green spaces were found to be "non-significant" (P<0.01). The ultimate goals were to increase the amount of systematically planned urban green spaces and set up a green infrastructure in Izmir. In the case of Izmir, a master planning approach, which uses a systematic and comprehensive method to guide urban green spaces, is necessary to develop planning and design strategies for fully functional and multi-purpose urban green space systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Air Quality Implications of Future Scenarios for Oil and Natural Gas Production and Use in the Western United States
AU  - Nsanzineza, Rene
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Since 2005, electricity generation in the United States has shifted from coal to increasing reliance on natural gas power plants and renewable sources while the production of oil and gas has increased to satisfy the increased demand. This shift in the energy landscape has air quality implications for local and regional air quality in the U.S., especially in the Rocky Mountain (RM) region which has abundant supplies of oil and gas and a large share of electricity generation from coal. This study aims to examine the prospective impacts of energy shifts in this region on electricity generation, emissions, ozone, and human health from 2011 to 2030. We focus on the RM region since it has several areas facing challenges to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. This study builds up on a previous study by McLeod et al. (2014) who applied the MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) model and EPA’s 9-region U.S. energy system database to investigate several future scenarios, finding the least cost means of satisfying demand for energy in each scenario and the associated annual emissions in the U.S. and the RM region out to the year 2050. We adapted four scenarios from McLeod et al.’s study. The baseline scenario assumes a supply and prices of natural gas based on reference projections made in 2013 while the greenhouse gas (GHG) fees scenario assumes a supply of natural gas similar to the baseline scenario but applies fees to the emissions of CO2 and CH4. Two contrasting scenarios are the cheap gas scenario which assumes a high supply of natural gas at lower prices while the costly gas scenario assumes a low supply of natural gas at higher prices. We downscale emissions from electricity generation temporally and spatially to capture the effects of changes in the small-scale emissions on the local and regional air quality. The electricity generation mix is estimated using the PLEXOS dispatch model on an hourly basis for a one-year period. The estimated generation from coal and natural gas power plants in each scenario is combined with unit specific emissions rates to determine the future emissions from power plants. Annual oil and gas production in the RM region are downscaled to the basin level to determine basin specific scaling factors used to estimate future emissions scenarios from oil and gas production. The estimated emissions from power plants and oil and gas production as well as emissions from other energy sectors are processed with the SMOKE software package and then incorporated into the CAMx chemistry and transport model to determine the change in ozone associated with changes in emissions in the different scenarios. A health benefits analysis tool, BenMAP-CE, is used with the ozone modeling results to determine the human health impacts and their monetary value associated with the change in ozone. We find that electricity production in the western U.S. from coal and natural gas increases from 2011 to 2030 along with generation from renewable energy as electricity demand increases from population growth. Contrary, to the trend in generation, NOx emissions from electricity production decrease by 33% over the same period as a result of retirement of old inefficient coal-fired plants, power plant refueling, and emissions control application. Within the western U.S, electricity generation and emissions vary by state and time of the year. Oil and gas production increases from 2011 to 2030 corresponding to increased demand, hence NOx and VOC emissions from oil and gas production increase by 5% and 58%, respectively, despite the emissions reductions from regulations imposed on the oil and gas sector. The net tradeoffs in these emissions trends lead to reductions in the summer MDA8 ozone as high as 8 ppb from 2011 to 2030, especially downwind of power plants and oil and gas basins in the 4 km CAMx domain. However, elevated ozone persists in urban areas such as Denver and Salt Lake City during peak time periods. The reduction in ozone from 2011 to 2030 is estimated to result in 303 to 360 reductions in premature deaths per year in the 4 km CAMx domain, in addition to reductions of morbidities associated with ozone. Between scenarios, electricity generation from natural gas displaces some coal generation in the cheap gas scenario compared to the 2030 baseline scenario, while renewable energy capacity expansion, particularly wind energy, displaces generation from coal and natural gas in the costly gas and the GHG fees scenarios. A similar trend is observed in the oil and gas production with production increasing in the cheap gas scenario and decreasing in the costly gas and the GHG fees scenarios.

TI  - Survival and recruitment of semi-aquatic turtles in an urbanized region
AU  - Eskew, Evan A

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Turtles are long-lived organisms that require high survivorship to maintain stable populations. Additionally, turtles are thought to be particularly susceptible to negative effects associated with anthropogenic habitat modification such as increased presence of human-subsidized predators and increased road mortality. Recruitment may also be reduced in populations surrounded by developed landscapes because of high road densities which limits connectivity among habitats or because of limited nesting sites. To address the impacts of habitat development on turtle vital rates, we studied three species of semi-aquatic turtles, yellowbelly sliders (Trachemys scripta), eastern mud turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum), and common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), in the urbanized Charlotte-metropolitan area of North Carolina. Mark-recapture data were analyzed in Program MARK using AIC model selection methods to evaluate models analyzing the effects of pond, sex, and time on both survivorship and recruitment rates. Our results yielded high survivorship estimates for sliders and snapping turtles (73-92.5% and 91.4-99.4%, respectively), indicating that these species were likely not severely affected by habitat modification. In contrast, mud turtles exhibited lower survivorship estimates (56.8-73.6%) than have been previously documented for this species, an observation we attribute to their reliance on terrestrial habitats where they may encounter greater densities of mesopredators in developed areas. Recruitment estimates indicated that most populations were subsidized by sizable additions each year, with the notable exception of snapping turtles whose movement may be limited by increased road densities. Our results suggest that anthropogenic habitat modification has species-specific effects and could imperil certain populations in urbanized areas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon which poses both opportunity and problem for urban areas. Potential for development becomes more significant as the population grows, especially in developing countries. Various perspectives see the phenomenon differently. Economists might see that this development is preferable, while environmentalists and medical people see it is more problematic than beneficial. This paper presents research-based documents and literature regarding urban development with its implication on the urban environment and humans’ health. It also suggested efforts to mitigate the impact of the inevitable urbanization, i.e., urban planting. Abundant scientific evidence confirms the benefits of urban planting to humans’ health and well-being. The virtues of urban vegetation resulted in the rise of concept for urban development that accommodates the existence of greeneries with all its attributes. Among the two most popular are the green networks and ecological network.

AB  - Often used as a mitigation tool to landscape fragmentation, urban riparian corridors also suffered from the effects of the urban expansion. This study explored the relationships between plant riparian communities and two major environmental variables (land cover, soil characteristics) and analyzed the floristic change along an urbanization gradient. Fifteen sites were surveyed on both riverbanks of two riparian corridors characterized by contrasting water regimes in Strasbourg, North Eastern France. Data of spontaneous species abundance was collected from 180 quadrats using (i) all plant species, (ii) herbaceous stratum and (iii) ligneous stratum (bush and tree). The diversity and compositional patterns of riparian plant species were analyzed within each corridor according to three levels of urbanization (urban, suburban, peri-urban). Relationships between riparian communities, land cover and soil chemical properties (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, moisture) were established by between-class co-inertia analyses. Land cover emerged as the main factor explaining changes in riparian communities along the rural-urban gradient while soil chemical properties discriminate water stress and fluvial dynamics of the two corridors. Similar compositional patterns were found within the most urbanized sites with the establishment of ubiquitous species. The herbaceous stratum is best linked to the level of urbanization, whereas the tree stratum is primarily correlated with corridor attributes (hydrological regime, soil properties). Although riparian species and communities are mainly determined by land cover, urban riparian corridors maintain native biodiversity up to the urban center.

TI  - Studies on population ecology of badger in suburb of shanghai
AU  - Hao, Hui
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBadger (Meles meles) is a medium-size animal, it belongs to Mammalia, Carnivora, Mustelidae,Meles, only species of Meles. As the key mammal of the suburb in Shanghai, the badger plays important role in biodiversity. In history, there were relatively abundant mammals in Shanghai, but in recent decades of developing into an international city, the habitat of badger was losing and the badger was in a state of distinct. So conservation of the badger in Shanghai, and recovering the population of badger is important to protect the biodiversity of Shanghai and build a modern ecological city. Researches on the distribution pattern, population number, habitat selection, activity, food habit and behaviour of badger were carried out in March 2006 to April 2009 in Shanghai. The results showed that: 1. The activities of badgers in the suburbs of Shanghai were observed by infrared video from January 2007 to January 2008. The results showed that the badger emergences from sett were concentrated between 19∶00 and 22∶00, the activity of returns to sett were concentrated between 2∶00 and 4∶00. The average activity time of badger in the outside of sett was about 6 hours per day. There were significant differences in the seasonal duration of the activities. In fall, the activities in the outside of sett for the duration were 8. 23 hours, while the winter activities for the shortest duration was 3.11hours. Research showed that the badger lived in the suburbs of Shanghai had no hibernation. 2. The distribution and density of badger in Shanghai was estimated by gathering information about the location of badger setts with a questionnaire survey. Setts were sited preferentially in bamboo forest habitat. Badgers are separated into 6 areas of 2 counties, they are: Xidu and Zhuanghang of Fengxian, Tianma Mountain, Sheshan, Tagang, Nanmen of Songjiang County. The mean minimum group size was 4 badgers, so we estimated the population of badger in Shanghai is 28. 3. We investigated the direction, size, use or not, and shelter of the entrances, then discussed the relation between these factors and population and status of badger. 4. To investigate the agricultural damage, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 2007 to determine the extent and significance of badger damage in Fengxian. Badger damage was widespread, but its incidence was highly dependent on crop type. Results showed that the large number of crop types was damaged as follows: melons, corn, and peanut. The farthest farm was 750m away from the main sett. 5. It is the right time that some measures should be taken to conserve wild badger now. Based on the results of our research, we give some suggestion. Firstly, we should revise the local law of protecting badger. Secondly, we should protect the habitat of badger. Thirdly, we should construct the ecological corridor for the communication of population gene. At last we should reset the local nature reserve to conserve the

In the case of Triangle Communications, that seed was an industry conference on broadband and economic development that led the company earlier this year to issue a Connected Community Challenge aimed at local business leaders. The initiative was designed to generate a discussion on the role of broadband in rural Montana. Triangle Communications offered two, one-time $2,500 grants as incentive to get community partners to sit down and talk about broadband technology and its role in economic development. According to the program rules, the awards can be used to cover some of the costs associated with hosting a technology fair or conference; marketing that promotes broadband connectivity using digital media or community signage; expanded public access and computer centers; digital literacy opportunities and technology use for business and community members; or other locally identified actions.

TI  - Anthropogenic Impacts, Stormwater Runoff Dynamics and Opportunities for Upscaling Multifunctional Urban Green Spaces Using High-Frequency Sensing
AU  - Hernandez Gonzalez, Liliana Maria
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Unrestrained urban growth combined with the increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation events, due to climate change, has become a major challenge for urban green spaces. Urban sprawl increases ecosystem degradation and the vulnerability of cities to floods as a result of excess stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution. To study these challenges and potential solutions in urban green spaces, we designed and deployed a network of in situ sensors measuring surface and groundwater level, soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, electrical conductivity, and discharge at 30-min intervals. In a native prairie-wetland complex, Gensburg Markham Prairie (GMP), anthropogenic inputs are a concern given observed ecosystem degradation around the periphery of the prairie. To understand soil quality and the potential for habitat degradation in GMP, we evaluated concentrations of metals and phosphorus in soil profiles, identified possible sources of contamination, and assessed the likelihood that contamination would impact the prairie ecosystem. We observed enrichment of Pb, Cu, Zn, and P because of deposition from the urban environment, but the enrichment levels are low enough that they are not expected to negatively impact the ecosystem of GMP. The detailed soil chemistry data constitute a spatial contamination map that can be used to assess potential long-term impacts on the ecosystem, such as reduction of plant growth and species diversity, and inform site management and biodiversity conservation efforts.Inland freshwater wetlands throughout the northern U.S. are experiencing an increase in salinity due to road salt runoff during the winter months. Salinization affects soil texture, contaminant transport, microbial activity, and plant growth in wetlands. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the dynamics of road salt intrusion in these ecosystems. Two years of continuous data in GMP show periodic spikes in electrical conductivity (EC) during winter months, generally by an order-of-magnitude, due to intrusion of road salt applied on nearby roads. Traditional water quality monitoring methods, such as monthly sampling, would likely have missed these abrupt changes in EC levels caused by rapid snowmelt runoff events. Spectral analysis of EC time-series in ditches suggests that salinity dynamics are not correlated at super-annual timescales, indicating that the dynamics are event-driven, and the introduced solutes are rapidly exported from the site. This study supports the development of improved de-icing strategies by local agencies and informs site-specific management of wetland ecosystems under anthropogenic stressors.A GIS-based spatial analysis tool, named Multifunctional Urban Green Stormwater Infrastructure (MUGSI), was developed for identifying and prioritizing locations for green infrastructure investments at the parcel level. The tool was applied in two watersheds – the Lower Des Plaines and the Little Calumet – and the City of Chicago in Cook County, IL – as part of a 5-year pilot program to assess the feasibility of a regional stormwater credit trading program in Cook County, termed StormStore. A stormwater credit trading program allows developers to meet a portion of their stormwater detention requirements on their sites by purchasing credits for stormwater retention or detention from others in the same watershed who have voluntarily retrofitted their properties for increased stormwater storage. We collected multiple datasets from the region to determine the suitability and benefits of candidate sites and developed 13 metrics to represent the benefits of green infrastructure. The metrics assess the multifunctionality of green infrastructure for stormwater management, species diversity, green space connectivity, air quality, water quality, urban heat island amelioration, environmental justice, green cover increase, and public green space accessibility. The results of the local GI assessment show that priority sites for investment are primarily located near industrial corridors, major highways, minority neighborhoods, and along the banks of the Lower Des Plaines and Little Calumet Rivers. The MUGSI tool advances the capability of urban planners, property developers, stormwater agencies, and conservation groups to prioritize sites for green infrastructure in Cook County and other urban areas based on their multifunctionality, feasibility, and overall benefit. The global increase of urban impervious land cover poses a significant threat to the aquatic ecosystems. Green roofs (GR) are one approach to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems, such as thermal surges and pollution from urban runoff. We evaluated the ecohydrological behavior of two fully established GR under differing management regimes at the Chicago Botanical Gardens from July to September 2019. Drainage outflow from a managed GR (perennial native and non-native plants) and an unmanaged GR (perennial natural prairie vegetation) was monitored over a storm season (summer and early fall). Thermal dynamics dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and nitrate concentration of runoff were assessed. The managed GR runoff had a lower DOC concentration and less humic-like DOM signal (SUVA254) than the unmanaged GR. In contrast, lower concentrations of nitrate and more recalcitrant DOM (less protein-like compounds relative to humic-like compounds) were released from the unmanaged GR. The unmanaged GR also displayed a greater capacity to reduce thermal surges associated with storm events. Our study provides new information on the links between GR management and runoff water quality. Further, the impacts of GR management on the mitigation of thermal surges and DOM composition can help to improve future GR design, as these ecohydrological responses have been largely overlooked to date. Our findings are scalable and can support future urban planning, particularly for scenarios where green infrastructures are used to mitigate the impacts of climate change on urban ecosystems.

AB  - Protecting riparian corridors is a commonly applied environmental policy in urban landscapes. However, empirical data demonstrating their efficacy for biodiversity conservation outcomes is scarce. In this study we investigated whether riparian corridor width influences the diversity and community structure of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and vascular plant assemblages therein. Eighteen corridors of differing widths were selected from within the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area, Sydney Australia. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps positioned within rectangular vegetation transects (30×10 m). Both ant and plant species richness, when standardised for sampling effort, were unrelated to riparian corridor width. However, significant compositional differences between sites were evident with increased width up to ~50 m. Narrow corridors contained greater abundances of opportunistic ant species and higher proportions of exotic plants. We interpret this to be the result of the greater disturbance/edge influence derived from adjacent upland urban environments. Site beta diversity did not increase with corridor width, suggesting that the exclusion of novel upslope habitats in narrow riparian corridors is not a significant cause of community assemblage modification at these sites. To minimise the impact of deleterious edge effects on ant fauna, environmental managers should seek to retain riparian corridors wider than ~50 m. However, we observed substantial between-site variability of biotic assemblages, irrespective of corridor width. Therefore we recommend that environmental management practice needs to take a catchment-wide approach and consider other parameters that may contribute to riparian health so as to optimise the protection of riparian biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Private backgardens in cities have the capacity to enhance ecological function and connectivity. The importance of increased habitat availability was tested experimentally using microcosms with soil or with soil and vegetation added into Toronto backgardens. Local attributes of the backgardens were recorded, and within the microcosms, recruitment of seeds, plants, and winged and wingless invertebrates were recorded. Natural recruitment by all organisms was significant into the microcosms in the 20 backgardens tested. Invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment, and aboveground vegetation growth was enhanced regardless of whether only bare soil was added or soil with vegetation. The number of woody plants (non-herbaceous plants with hard lignified tissues or woody parts e.g., stems and are adapted to survive from one year to the next i.e., through winter) in the backgardens predicted seed recruitment and number of plant species predicted winged invertebrate abundance. Hence, simple augmentation of private backgardens - even at an ecologically small-scale - can enhance the capacity of urban systems to provide appropriate habitats for organisms within a difficult matrix for many species.

TI  - Water Level and Discharge Dynamics in Human-Affected Lowland Rivers
AU  - Geertsema, Tjitske  Janelle
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The current water policy aims to accelerate discharge, which is causing problems, such as eutrophication, reduced (aquatic) biodiversity, drastic decline in groundwater levels, increased water levels during floods and prolonged droughts, predominantly in urban areas and densely populated lowland areas. To address and prevent these problems, the water policy should concentrate more on water retention. Few of the existing strategies towards water retention have been evaluated regarding their functionality and quantified impacts on the regional water system. Specifically, regional water systems in lowland areas are defined as areas that freely drain in large rivers and where groundwater is an important component in the water system. In this context, the research focusses on the local and regional effects of increasing water levels and delaying discharge in regional water systems. The current practice of stream restoration involves the construction of meander bends and insertion of wood in streams, asserting local controls on stream conveyance capacity and on water level and discharge dynamics. Backwater effects resulting from sharp bends and the obstruction by wood in streams are currently poorly understood, and are considered key sources of uncertainty in predicting the effects of stream restoration and water retention measures. Regionally, streams are typically analysed in isolation from the downstream river system, with the risk of simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks in the river and its tributaries. Within a catchment, groundwater variation near rivers is rarely being analysed as a response to surface water dynamics. Progress in understanding the impacts of stream restoration on discharge dynamics requires more knowledge about simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks in a river and its tributaries, and a deeper understanding of response time dependence on open water-subsurface water exchange. This thesis discusses the topics wood in streams (chapter 2), flow in sharp bends (chapter 3), groundwater reaction as result of instant lowering of river water levels (chapter 4) and the simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks in a main river and its tributaries (chapter 5).Wood-induced backwater effects are influenced by discharge, wood configuration and channel geometry. Model simulations and field experiments in chapter 2 show that the backwater effect increases with increasing discharge up to a maximum, after which the backwater effect decreases with discharge. A sensitivity analysis of this model showed that the width of the wood patch is responsible for the peak in the backwater elevation, and the height of the wood is responsible for the discharge at which the highest backwater effect is observed. Moreover, the characteristics of this relation depend on wood configuration and channel geometry. These two components may change over time, exerting an impact on the backwater response to discharge condition. Significant morphological adjustments and wood degradation were observed within two to five years after wood placement.Horizontal recirculation zones are common flow patterns in sharp river bends. Chapter 3 shows that these recirculation zones are not stable with increasing discharge. The Essche Stroom showed similar flow patterns for similar discharge conditions. The Dommel River, on the contrary, showed two distinct flow patterns, one with and one without flow recirculation. With a simple model for bend flow and the one-dimensional depth-\\averaged momentum equation, it is shown that for the flow pattern without flow recirculation, the flow decelerates according to what may be expected from channel curvature and cross-section variation. For the flow pattern where flow recirculation is present, the model is less easily applicable. Chapter 3 discusses the delicate processes that may or may not result in flow reversal in the Dommel River, highlighting the instability of flow recirculation zones. The water surface topography substantially influences the flow patterns in bends, however, it is too small to be directly measured with standard instrumentation, and is only locally observed in the bends. Two and three dimensional effects, such as lateral redistribution of momentum and the interaction with scour holes, will influence the horizontal flow recirculation. These effects should be incorporated in future analysis to explain the unexpected transience of flow recirculation in the Dommel River.When the Maas water levels were instantaneously reduced, the groundwater levels responded immediately. Chapter 4 shows that the groundwater levels close to the river were reduced by 1.5 meters within 3 days. The groundwater level reduction was negligible at 2 km distance from the river. The rapid response of groundwater levels in the Maas area is encouraging to rapidly create additional groundwater storage. Groundwater storage can be created by lowering river water levels, and thereby lowering groundwater levels, before an intense rainfall event. When the groundwater storage is dynamically managed, the timing and height of the discharge peaks can be controlled, and water levels can be maintained at higher levels during periods without intense rainfall. In addition to groundwater storage, the scaling effects of hydraulic soil parameters were investigated in chapter 4, by comparing the hydraulic soil parameters of local pumping tests and of the regional river lowering in the Meuse. The available soil parameters of the pumping test are preferably used to understand the regional groundwater response using the physically-based Boussinesq equations. Chapter 4, however, shows that the measured specific yield from the pumping tests is not comparable with the specific yield obtained from the regional lowering of the Meuse water levels. The currently available data can therefore not be easily used to understand river-groundwater exchange. It can be concluded that the rapid response of groundwater levels to an instantaneous lowering of the river water levels is promising to store large amounts of water, but scale effects have to be taken into account for application at regional scale.Extreme discharge events at the confluence of the River Meuse and two joining lowland tributaries are studied, introducing a new analysis method based on dynamic time warping. The method offers robust means of tracing individual discharge waves in discharge time series collected throughout a catchment. Chapter 5 shows that the precipitation patterns in the catchment areas are spatially correlated. Spatial correlation of the precipitation patterns is a prerequisite for simultaneous occurrence at the confluence. From a comparison of the nine highest discharge waves in the main stream and the joining lowland tributaries, it follows that the exact timing of the discharge peaks and the probability of simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks are of little relevance to flood risk. The duration of the discharge wave in the main stream is larger compared to the time lags between discharge peaks in the main channel and the tributaries. Simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks result in the backwater effects in the tributaries. The backwater height can increase to 1.5~m over 4km from the confluence in the Dommel and Aa rivers.Water level and discharge dynamics can change as result of human intervention in lowland river systems. It is important to understand the dynamics in detail before interventions are applied in order to improve, for instance, water retention. A number of interventions have been studied in detail in this thesis. It can be concluded from these studies that: local water level increase can be created by obstruction and/or increased friction.local discharge delay cannot be achieved by creating sharp bends, despite the additional advection and diffusion resulting from a longer thalweg. regional water level increase can be obtained by preserving higher surface water and groundwater levels during conditions without severe rain events and by managing surface water levels before severe rain events.regional discharge delay has a marginal negative impact on the simultaneous occurrence of flood peaks at lowland confluences despite the locally increased water levels in the tributaries.With the help of these insights, local and regional effects on water level and discharge dynamics can be better understood, and by continuous learning from the water system, a liveable environment can be maintained for humans and other biota.

AB  - Evidence suggests that built environment characteristics affect older adults’ travel activity behaviors, e.g., walking and cycling, which have well-established health benefits. However, the relationship between urban greenery and walking behaviors remains unclear, partly due to methodological limitation. Previous studies often measured urban greenery from a bird’s eye perspective, which may mismatch with the pedestrian’s perception from the street. In this study, we measured greenery view index from eye-level streetscape photos retrieved from Baidu Street View, an online mapping service provider. Walking behaviors of 180 older adults in six neighborhoods were collected from questionnaires. We also measured land use diversity, pedestrian-oriented design (street connectivity), and population density—the three Ds of the built environment. Results show that street greenery view index contributes to walking time of older adults, suggesting street greenery should be taken into design consideration to promote walking behaviors of older adults.

AB  - Anthropogenic mortality of wildlife is typically inferred from measures of the absolute decline in population numbers. However, increasing evidence suggests that indirect demographic effects including changes to the age, sex, and social structure of populations, as well as the behavior of survivors, can profoundly impact population health and viability. Specifically, anthropogenic mortality of wildlife (especially when unsustainable) and fragmentation of the spatial distribution of individuals (home‐ranges) could disrupt natal dispersal mechanisms, with long‐term consequences to genetic structure, by compromising outbreeding behavior and gene flow. We investigate this threat in African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus), a polygynous felid with male‐biased natal dispersal. Using a combination of spatial (home‐range) and genetic (21 polymorphic microsatellites) data from 142 adult leopards, we contrast the structure of two South African populations with markedly different histories of anthropogenically linked mortality. Home‐range overlap, parentage assignment, and spatio‐genetic autocorrelation together show that historical exploitation of leopards in a recovering protected area has disrupted and reduced subadult male dispersal, thereby facilitating opportunistic male natal philopatry, with sons establishing territories closer to their mothers and sisters. The resultant kin‐clustering in males of this historically exploited population is comparable to that of females in a well‐protected reserve and has ultimately led to localized inbreeding. Our findings demonstrate novel evidence directly linking unsustainable anthropogenic mortality to inbreeding through disrupted dispersal in a large, solitary felid and expose the genetic consequences underlying this behavioral change. We therefore emphasize the importance of managing and mitigating the effects of unsustainable exploitation on local populations and increasing habitat fragmentation between contiguous protected areas by promoting in situ recovery and providing corridors of suitable habitat that maintain genetic connectivity.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitat parameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within residential areas – even if not targeted for conservation plans – can provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered in urban planning.

TI  - Understanding the Ecological Challenges in California Protected Areas Through the Lens of Remote Sensing Technologies
AU  - Jia, Shenyue
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Protected area (PA), usually built to address the potential ecological pressure from different sources, aims to sustain, protect, and maintain the wilderness of nature for ecological, economic, and scenic purposes. Establishing, maintaining, and expanding the monitor network of PAs helps to enhance the ecological and biological value of these areas, especially in the light of species decline and habitat degradation. Intensively monitored and regulated through various administrative agencies, California keeps one of the best maintained network of PAs in the world, which supports various studies to address the significant threats to the preservation of wilderness from the projected warming climate and pressure from human development, including water deficit and prolonged drought, abnormality in wildfires, urban sprawl, and light pollution.With the help of satellite remote sensing technologies and geospatial analysis, we can overcome the limitation of data availability in traditional ecological studies and expand the study of PAs to a continuous gradient both in time and space. This dissertation aims to develop a comprehensive understanding through remote sensing technologies on three significant and linked ecological disturbance in California PAs, including the change of land cover, the dynamic of wildfire, and the extent and intensity of human activity reflected by stable nighttime light. Exploiting various of remote sensing observation and its derivatives, this study investigated the three topics through trend, seasonality, abnormality, spatial distribution, and hotspot of change to provide a cost-effective and repeatable studying paradigm for PA managers to better understand the past and present situation, as well as the ecological challenges of PAs. In addition, it also supplemented the study of PAs as a case study focusing on a non-tropic ecosystem, which usually involves greater interaction with human thus faces ecological pressure at a higher level.The analysis on land cover dynamics and change from 2000 to 2015 found that many protected areas in California have experienced an increase of brownness since 2000. PAs with a higher coverage of greenness are associated with a higher temporal variability, mostly because of the more complex life cycle of green vegetation and the sensitivity to the disturbance, possibly due to a drying climate regime. Partly linked to the gradual influence from the drying climate, the change in the regime of wildfire may cause a more drastic change in land cover, through the removal of aboveground biomass and its influence on the post-wildfire regrowth. In the study focusing on California PAs from 2000 to 2013, a shift in wildfire-prone land cover and season was observed starting from 2008, while the wildfires southern California shrubland during the fall season became nearly extinct and the northern California evergreen forest wildfires in the late spring increased, partly explained by the recent loss of available fuel in biomass and the increase of potential of ignition in evergreen forest as a result of prolonged drought. Most burned areas experienced a significant weakening of the immediate growing season, although the influence from fire on local landscape decayed over time, which became irrelevant after five years on average. The lower fuel moisture and a more intensive removal of aboveground biomass makes shrubs more sensitive in time, with a shorter period for biomass removal by fire and a greater delay in the start and peak of post-fire growing season.The long-enduring and sometimes intensive disturbance from human activity, especially from the development can be even more disastrous than wildfire in damaging the aboveground biomass by interrupting the natural nutrient and mass circulation, thus brings more fundamental and sometimes irreversible consequences to ecosystems. However, after decades of protection, especially the removal of settlements in side PAs, land management strategies may have bored beneficial fruits to reduce the negative effects from historical human disturbance. As a good proxy of human activity and development, the historical records of stable nighttime light from 1992 to 2012 tracked the temporal change and spatial migration of hotspot of human activity inside California PAs. A decrease of lit area at night inside PAs occurred from 1992 to 2012, with a turning point around 2004 when the relatively sharp decrease started from became more gradual thereafter. Besides, area covered by higher stable nighttime light not only shrank, but also retreated from the area with high wilderness. If solidly confirmed by other socioeconomic variable, the above finding demonstrated the effectiveness of PA establishment and the fruits of multiple conservation strategies kept for decades.The investigation of three major disturbances to the wilderness of California PAs provided an example of exploiting the cost-effective and continuously available observation of the Earth surface at a regional level to understand the ecological challenges of PAs. The findings can help the National Park Service and other related agencies of PA administration in the review, adjustment, and proposal of regulations and policies regarding to PAs. Future work and analysis can be focused on improving the accuracy of predictive models involved the analysis, either by concentrating on the difference between categories of protection, or through a better understanding on the related ecological process and mechanisms to identify or develop better explanatory variables. In addition, when conducting analysis on PAs, the buffer area adjacent to PAs cannot be ignored, which is an important source of disturbance to PAs as well as an ecological corridor that links nearby PAs into clusters. Considering the great diversity in the landscape of PAs, the analytical results can be aggregated and interpreted by different ecoregions to derive more accessible guidance to local policy makers.

TI  - Feral pig management in southern Texas: A landscape genetics approach
AU  - Delgado-Acevedo, Johanna H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Feral pigs are the most abundant exotic ungulate in the United States, comprised of escaped domestic swine, Eurasian wild boar, and their hybrids. Feral pigs have been reported in 23 states, with Texas having the highest number of animals (about 2 million). Feral pigs predate on and compete for resources with native wildlife. In addition, feral pigs are a significant threat to agriculture (grain, peanut, soybean, cotton, and vegetable crops) and soils because of rooting and trampling. Feral pigs also transmit, and are reservoirs for, diseases such as pseudorabies, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, and foot and mouth disease that affect humans and livestock. I studied complementary ways for assessing multiple paternity, damage control effectiveness, and the influence of landscape features on genetic population structure. I found evidence of multiple paternity in 21 of 64 litters (33%) from 7 of 9 south Texas sites sampled. Sows displayed a range of conception dates, where 2 sites had a non-concurrent estrous, sows collected at a third site had a bimodal estrous, and sows had a relatively synchronous estrous at a fourth site. Males sired from 8 to 11 offspring at 3 study sites with sufficient litters to assess paternal contribution. The mean litter size was less than the best fit value for the number of offspring sired, indicating that some males sired offspring with ≥2 females. My data could improve management strategies by providing insight into mating behavior of feral pigs. For example, the frequency of multiple paternity can be used to assess sexual contact, and therefore opportunity for disease transmission. In addition, the presence of multiple mating could influence the development of fertility control strategies, specifically in the decision of which sex should be targeted. Lethal control methods are widely practiced but the effects of lethal control on the population dynamics of feral pigs have rarely been evaluated. I used a panel of genetic markers to assess the impact of common lethal control methods (trapping and aerial shooting) at 2 sites in southern Texas. I conducted 2-3 removals at each site and quantified population structure and differentiation among pigs sampled during the removal events. I found no evidence for immigrants from genetically differentiated populations. I conclude that lethal control at the spatial scale and level of intensity tested had minimal effect on feral pig populations. Control efforts should be conducted at greater spatial scales to achieve long-term impacts on populations of feral pigs in south Texas, perhaps through the formation of management cooperatives. My findings also emphasize the need for understanding how landscape features influence the movements and large-scale population structure of feral pigs in the south Texas region. I used genetic data to evaluate the effect of landscape features (e.g. waterways, roads, urban area, and agricultural fields) on the populations structure and movements of feral pigs. I generated a cost-weighted distance surface for southern Texas to model the movement of feral pigs through the landscape. I validated the cost-weighted model using genetic data from 1,258 adult feral pigs collected at 24 sites in southern Texas. First, I quantified broad-scale population structure among the 24 sites by computing an overall FST value and used different Bayesian clustering algorithms implemented in Structure 2.2 and BAPS 4.2 to group individuals into genetic clusters (K), both with and without considering the spatial location of samples. Subsequently, I overlapped the cost- weighted surface with the suggested number of clusters to identify barriers and corridors among clusters. At a broad geographic scale, pig populations displayed a moderate degree of genetic structure (FST = 0.11). The best partition for number of populations in Structure 2.2, based on 2nd order rate of change of the likelihood distribution was K = 10 discrete genetic clusters. A spatially Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in BAPS 4.2 suggested 12 genetic clusters in the region. I found evidence of past (and possibly ongoing) translocations; many populations were admixed. At finer geographic scales, it appears that predicted areas of unsuitable habitat did indeed act as barriers, while expanses of homogenous habitats may facilitate natural (not human-mediated) dispersal among sites. The cost-weighted distance surface was validated with genetic data and represents a realistic model that can be applied for other zones in Texas. Results from this study may have a significant impact feral pig control by helping define the geographic area over which control methods should be conducted to achieve long term results.

AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Urban RiversImproving our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on tropical island streams is critical as urbanization becomes a dominant feature in tropical areas. Although the "urban stream syndrome" has been successful in summarizing urban impacts on streams, the response of some island streams is different to that expected. Here we review available information on urban impacts to tropical island streams and describe unique responses to urbanization. We identified three key aspects that play particularly important or unique roles in determining tropical-island stream integrity: biotic response to water pollution, movement barriers along the stream network, and altered geomorphology that results in habitat loss. As expected, water pollution negatively impacts stream ecosystems in tropical islands and in some regions impacts can be severe, as untreated wastewaters are directly discharged into streams. While aquatic insects show the expected responses to pollution, other native fauna (e.g., shrimps and fishes) appear to be less impacted by moderate levels of pollution. Movement barriers along the stream network are especially important as much of the tropical island fauna have diadromous (either amphidromous or catadromous) life histories. Most native freshwater mollusks, shrimps, and fishes inhabiting tropical islands are diadromous and depend on unimpeded connections between freshwater and marine environments to complete their life cycles. The presence of these species in urban streams is best explained by longitudinal connectivity rather than by the degree of urban impact. Finally, in streams that remain connected to marine environments, the presence of native shrimps and fishes is strongly related to the physical habitat. Fish assemblages in channelized and severely altered stream reaches are almost completely devoid of native fauna and tend to be dominated by non-native species. In contrast, relatively diverse shrimp and fish assemblages can be found in reaches that retain their physical habitat complexity, even when they are impacted by urbanization. Our understanding of urban impacts on tropical island streams remains limited. However, the identification of key aspects can help us better understand urban impacts on streams in tropical islands, and best focus our management and research efforts to protect these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - At present, the sharp decline in urban biodiversity worldwide is severe. Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.

TI  - Associations Between Hydrogeomorphic Characteristics and Biotic Community Dynamics in Urban Streams of Columbus, Ohio, USA
AU  - Rieck, Leslie Opal
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization of watersheds leads to myriad changes to streams, including modified sediment and streamflow regimes that can result in altered fluvial geomorphic processes and channel structure. Hydrogeomorphic features have been linked to community composition of aquatic biota, as well as to stream ecosystem functioning. Biotic communities in urban stream ecosystems can be markedly different than their counterparts in more natural streams, often exhibiting reduced abundance, diversity, and shifts in assemblage composition, though the specific mechanisms through which urban land use and subsequent hydrogeomorphic modification effects these changes remain unresolved. Hydrogeomorphic modifications may impact both instream habitat as well as connectivity to the surrounding landscape, influencing both biotic assemblage composition as well as ecological connectivity between streams and their adjacent riparian zones. In 23 small urban stream reaches in the Columbus Metropolitan Area (CMA), Ohio, USA, I investigated potential linkages between urban-induced hydrogeomorphic characteristics and: (1) fish assemblage compositional changes over time (3-5 years); (2) fish assemblage trophic dynamics; (3) aquatic-to-terrestrial nutritional subsidies to a common riparian consumer (spiders of the family Tetragnathidae); and (4) downstream drift of larval macroinvertebrates in the water column.Hydrogeomorphic features related to instream habitat, the hydraulic environment (e.g., slope, shear stress, D50 [median bed sediment particle size]) and stream-floodplain connectivity (e.g., entrenchment ratio, sinuosity, incision ratio) emerged as common influences on fish assemblage composition and trophic dynamics, aquatic-terrestrial connectivity, and invertebrate drift. At a subset of 12 study reaches, several hydrogeomorphic variables showed significant changes over 3-5 years, with many decreasing (e.g., discharge [by 39%], slope [by 0.1%], and shear stress [by 29%, which decreased in concert with slope]). Fish assemblage evenness decreased over the study period in study reaches with higher incision ratio (t = 2.16, p = 0.039), accompanied by species-specific relationships with hydrogeomorphic characteristics. These findings explicitly link hydrogeomorphic and fish-community changes over time, showing that fluvial geomorphic forms in urban streams are not static, and can exert effects on fish assemblages over relatively short time periods, likely via shifts in instream habitat.In a wider suite of 23 study reaches, hydrogeomorphic characteristics – including slope and bankfull discharge – influenced fish-assemblage diversity (H’), density, and proportion of generalist foragers. Mean reliance on aquatically-derived energy (i.e., reliance on energy pathways derived from benthic algae) of Creek Chub (Semolitus atromaculatus) was 0.60, which increased with slope (Z = 2.27, p = 0.023), suggesting that channel gradient, a measure highly associated with shear stress, may moderate the relative abundance of autochthonous vs. allochthonous basal resources consumed by stream fish. Sunfish species (Lepomis cyanellus and L. macrochirus) relied on aquatically-derived energy for 0.62 of their nutrition, which was positively related to discharge (Z = 1.98, p = 0.048), suggesting an underlying mechanism of discharge-mediated bed disturbance as a control of basal resource availability. Hydrogeomorphic variables did not influence mean trophic position or food-chain length (FCL; ranging from 1.83-4.69 across all study reaches), which was more closely related to water nutrient concentrations (i.e., total N).Tetragnathid spider trophic position (x ̅ = 2.41) was negatively influenced by D50, while tetragnathid reliance on aquatically-derived energy (x ̅ = 0.43) trended positively with sinuosity (t = 2.10, p = 0.054), suggesting that tetragnathid spider trophic position is influenced by the impact of instream habitat on emergent aquatic insects, while aquatically-derived energy was more closely related to stream-floodplain connectivity. Tetragnathid density decreased with slope (t = -2.51, p = 0.023), as did the flux of emergent aquatic insects into the riparian zone (t = -2.27, p = 0.037). The relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa in emergent aquatic insect assemblages was positively associated with sinuosity (t = 6.84, p< 0.001), potentially as a result of increased habitat heterogeneity and stream-floodplain connectivity.Larval macroinvertebrate drift was characterized by very low densities (x ̅ = 0.061 individuals m-3) relative to previous studies (but note that few urban studies of drift are available), with fewer than one-third of samples containing larval macroinvertebrates. The probability of a sample containing macroinvertebrates was positively associated with incision ratio (Z = 2.29, p = 0.022), while drift density trended with many hydrogeomorphic variables (e.g., entrenchment ratio [negative trend; Z = -1.9, p = 0.059], sinuosity [positive trend; Z = 1.91, p = 0.066]). Drift density was also highly influenced by chemical water quality and nutrients (e.g., t = 1.96, p = 0.059 with a water quality principal component axis largely driven by total N, total P, and total dissolved solids). Drift assemblage attributes (e.g., diversity [H’], family richness) were not related to any physico-chemical parameters, but rather to benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics (e.g., positive relationships between family richness and H’ [R2 = 0.11, F = 4.62, p = 0.038]; family richness and %EPT [R2 = 0.20, F = 9.52, p = 0.004]. Thus, a complex suite of factors appears to drive macroinvertebrate drift in urban streams, including degrees of entrenchment and sinuosity, implicating the important role stream-riparian connectivity and the potentially strong influences of terrestrial organic matter on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, which serve as the “source pool” available to enter the drift.Collectively, these results highlight how urban-land development cascades, through hydrologic and sediment-related alterations (e.g., discharge magnitude, shear stress), to impact physical channel (geomorphic) form (e.g., sinuosity, floodplain connectivity) and, in turn, instream habitat (e.g., D50, slope) and biotic community structure and function (e.g., assemblage composition, food-web architecture, and energy flows). An ecogeomorphic approach, such as the one adopted in my research is, therefore, well supported as an avenue toward further understanding and potentially restoring critical physical-biological processes that are key to forming and maintaining resilient urban stream ecosystems. Incorporating hydrogeomorphic surveys into management and restoration activities may thus lead to a more mechanistic understanding of the underlying sources of stream impairment in cities.

AB  - The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup “weaning” period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa.

AB  - nment has been ignored for a long time. And such viewpoint is one of essential and important aspects related with ecologically sound and sustainable habitat in the 21 century.In this paper, based on analysis of potential landscape safety pattern and urban greenspaces layout, Shanghai metropolitan area, one of the highly urbanized zone at the East China coast, were taken for a example to discuss how to construct and maintain the ecologically sound urban greenspaces system, which is aimed to organized and layout the self-purification components of the urban ecosystem and build up urban landscape safety pattern with the primary intention to improve the air environment.Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density.Thirdly, based on responses of  two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the  local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level.Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings:(1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and(2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and(3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.Key words: Shanghai, urban greenspaces, air environment, potential landscape safety pattern, ecological regulation

TI  - The street greenbelt plant allocation and landscape effect analysis for wuchang, wuhan
AU  - Sun, Min
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs an important part of urban greenland system, street-greenbelts have a great influence on visual, ecological, practical function and cultural connotation. Recently, ecological environment in Wuhan city has been changing a lot during the progress of recreating the urban streetscape as a "green corridor". However, a lot of city landscapes had been impacted because of the urban development and city street alteration. In order to give some suggestion for the city street-greenbelts development direction, we investigated the green status of streets in the city. With data of 173 streets in Wuhan obtained by means of on-the-spot investigation, the characteristics of street cross section form, floristic component, application frequency, allocation method as well as plant ornamental have been studied. The results showed there were many problems in Greenland, such as few plant species application, the low diversity of street-greenbelts in forms, and single ornamental landscape. And some suggestions have been given for solving problems mentioned above. Comparing with the results of general investigation in city greenbelts in 2003, the whole green area ratio has been raised up a lot with per capita of 9.15m2 , ratio of green area in main urban area of 32.13% and green coverage to 37.46% in the year 2008. In Wuchang area, there were 2 streets over 50-meter-wide red line in Wuchang District, 1 in Hongshan District and 6 in Eastlake High-tech District. 6 streets of among above 9 came up to street-greenbelt standards, and there were 5 streets over 50-meter-wide red line in Eastlake High-tech District. There were 25 streets being red line 40~50 meters width, among 14 of 25 in Wuchang District, which none of them were up to the standards; 7 in Hongshan District and 4 in Eastlake High-tech District, which all of them came up to the standards. Street cross section form in Wuchang area mainly was"one road plate with two greenbelts", a few streets were "Four road plates with five greenbelts", and many other forms were widely used in Wuchang District. There were 195 plant species for street greening, including 54 deciduous tree species, 32 evergreen tree species, deciduous and evergreen shrubs in a fairly proportion as the first two, as well as 4 vine species and 29 species of cover plants or grasses, belongs to 66 families and 123 genera. Among all above, there were 43 tree species. Cinnamomum camphora and Platanus hispanica were the most widely ones planted in greenbelts. There were 96 flower ornamental species, 26 fruit ornamental species and 34 foliage plant species used for street greenbelts in Wuchang area. Flower or fruit ornamentals were mostly arbor and shrub trees, and foliage plants mainly were trees. Flower season was mainly in spring and summer, fruit season in autumn; foliage plants were with autumn-color, colored or green leaves. The dust holding experiment showed that there was a highly significant difference among different plant species for dust-holding capacity, and there was a highly significant dust-holding capacity difference among different days for the same plant species as well. Rhododendron simsii had the largest dust-holding capacity with 11.7885 g/m2, and Pittosporum tobira the least with 5.6626 g/m2. Selection of plant species should take many aspects into account, for instance ecological benefit, landscape effect and so on, while a street greenbelt being

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - The importance of examining multiple hierarchical levels when modeling resource use for wildlife has been acknowledged for decades. Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multi-level, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species.

TI  - Green Infrastructure and Human Health: Nature Exposure, Attention, and Well-Being
AU  - Jiang, Xiangrong
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The environments we live in play an important role in keeping us ready to face challenges in a competitive, complex, information-rich world. There is growing body of studies showing that having access to nature has positive impacts on people’s attentional functioning, capacity to recover from stressful events and the development of social ties among nearby neighbors. In spite of these findings, many of the studies examining the impact of nature on human health have focused on traditional types of green infrastructure, such as trees and parks. We know little about the effects of other newer types of green infrastructure (e.g. bio-swales) on human health and wellbeing. Moreover, we do not know the extent to which daily variations in exposure to various forms of nature are related to health outcomes. This gap in our knowledge hinders the development of green infrastructure that provides multiple benefits – to human beings and the environment. Identifying the extent to which varying densities of green infrastructure contribute to human health can provide evidence-based guidelines for designer, administrators and other stakeholders.The lack of empirical evidence regarding newer types of green infrastructure and their relationship to human health creates a risk that we missing opportunities to promote public health and protect the environment simultaneously. Green infrastructure is often introduced into urban areas as an efficient and eco-friendly way to manage stormwater and increase bio-diversity. Green spaces that include trees, bioswales, retention wetlands, rain gardens and open green spaces are defined as green infrastructure, which are promising to provide a wide variety of benefits to human living environments. However, we have not accumulated enough evidence regarding the effects of newer types of green infrastructure (e.g. rain gardens and bioswales) on human health and wellbeing. These newer green infrastructure types are important approaches for stormwater management and other ecosystem services, which should not be ignored and cannot be avoided in the development of natural resources in people’s daily living environment. Moreover, most people do not live in completely natural settings. Too many people live with too little exposure to nature on a daily basis. It can be challenging to provide decent access to nature for urban residents. Most of previous findings regarding the health benefits by exposure to green infrastructure have been achieved in laboratory settings or through semi-controlled experiments, which do not reflect the dynamic quantity of people’s exposure to nature in their daily lives. If we do not know the extent to which daily variations in exposure to nature are related to health outcomes, we may risk providing not efficient design of green infrastructure to promote public health. The lack of understanding of various types of green infrastructure and the relationship between daily variations in exposure to nature and health outcomes hinders the development of green infrastructure that can be beneficial to both human well-being and environmental sustainability.In order to fill the gap in our knowledge and promote urban green infrastructure, I have conducted studies to shed a light on the benefits people may get from exposure to different types of green infrastructure, and understand how daily variations of exposure to different forms of nature are associated with health outcomes. This dissertation includes: 1) an experiment examining impacts of different types of green infrastructure on attentional functioning; 2) a study connecting attentional benefits to functional networks in the brain; 3) a survey of the relationship between daily exposure to nature and health outcomes. The objective of the first study was to understand the extent to which three levels of exposure of green infrastructure impact recovery from attentional fatigue. I recruited 43 participants and randomly assigned them to watch one of the three videos that consist of 24 images of urban settings. The only differences among the three videos was the type of green infrastructure featured: one video had no green infrastructure, another had street trees, and the final had street trees and bioswales. I measured participants’ attentional functioning before and after they watched one of the videos and calculated the difference between the before and after attentional tests. Results show a significant difference in the improvement from the first to second attentional test between the group with no green infrastructure compared to the group with trees. The group with trees & bioswales was not significantly different than the other two treatment groups. The purpose of the second study was to clarify the mechanism underlying Attention Restoration Theory and observe the restorative process in action. In this study using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), I connect the previous attentional tests results to functional networks in the brain. I addressed the following questions: 1) What are the neural correlates in the restorative process of exposure to different green infrastructure types? 2) To what extent are the neural correlations consistent with the actual attention scores from participants who viewed different green infrastructure types? Results identify two pairs of functional connectivity. The first significant level of functional connectivity is between the right lateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) and the occipital cortex. Post hoc Tukey tests showed that the rlPFC-rMOG1 connectivity was significantly higher in the Trees group compared to the No GI group and the Trees & Bio group. The second significant level of functional connectivity is between the anterior cingular cortex (ACC) and a cluster in the right middle occipital gyrus (rMOG2). Pairwise post hoc tests revealed that the ACC-rMOG2 connectivity in the No GI group is significantly higher than that in the Trees group and in the Trees & Bio group. This is the first study to observe neural correlates associated with exposure to green infrastructure, which provides us supporting evidence for the proposed mechanism of Attention Restoration Theory. The consistency in the results of the attention tests and the observed functional connectivity is consistent with our hypothesis.The purpose of the third study was to measure the daily exposure to nature and examine the extent to which the exposures predict health outcomes. In this study, I addressed the following questions: 1) To what extent are variations in daily exposure to vegetation density (e.g., in neighborhoods, daily destinations, and routes) associated with human health? That is, do higher levels of daily exposure to nature predict better health outcomes? 2) To what extent are variations in exposure to different types of urban nature (e.g. trees, understory vegetation) associated with human health? I used Google Street View images and National Land Cover Dataset 2011 to estimate participants’ daily exposure to nature, and two standard questionnaires (e.g. SF-12 and Perceived Stress Scale) to assess health outcomes. Results show that greater exposure to nature in daily life is associated with better health outcomes. Specifically, higher neighborhood concentrations of tree canopy are related to better physical health, overall health and better capacities to control stress. In contrast, the understory vegetation has a negative relationship with stress and mental health.The most important contribution of this dissertation is to clarify the effects of newer types of green infrastructure (e.g., bioswales) on human health through studies using an experiment and a survey. By combining an experimental study in a controlled setting with a survey without any intervention, results of the three empirical studies broadened our knowledge, verified the Attention Restoration Theory and increased our confidence in the findings. A number of policy and design implications can be derived from this dissertation. Planners, designers and administrators should be aware of the intrinsic and supportive roles urban green infrastructure can play in promoting public health. We should develop policies and designs that respond to people’s needs. Policy makers and public health providers should introduce green infrastructure at every door step and offer nature-based subscription for those in needs.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife species continue to demolish humankind leaving an imprint on human history. December 2019 has marked the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-2019) originated in China in the city of Wuhan. Drastic emergence and spread of infectious disease have shown to appear in highly densified areas causing rapid spread of epidemic through population movement, transmission routes, major activity nodes, proximity, and connectivity of urban spaces. An extreme number of cases rising throughout the world caused space unavailability in healthcare facilities to serve patients infected with Covid-2019, therefore urging for innovative emergency management response from construction and architecture industry. Prefabricated modular construction has been widely utilized around the globe assembling rapid response facilities after catastrophic events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and forest fires. An increasing number of Covid-2019 cases demanded effective and compressed implementation of medical centres to provide expeditious and secure healthcare. The paper examines the potential of standardization of modular construction of hospitals as a response to current and potential pandemic outbreaks. The research provides fundamental planning requirements of isolation units and their design flexibility as a key to rapid emergency solution.

T2  - Remote Sensing
AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based identification and detection of elements in urban spaces through Earth Observation (EO) datasets have been widely researched and discussed. Such studies have developed state-of-the-art methods to map urban features like building footprint or roads in detail. This study delves deeper into combining multiple such studies to identify fine-grained urban features which define streetscapes. Specifically, the research focuses on employing object detection and semantic segmentation models and other computer vision methods to identify ten streetscape features such as movement corridors, roadways, sidewalks, bike paths, on-street parking, vehicles, trees, vegetation, road markings, and buildings. The training data for identifying and classifying all the elements except road markings are collected from open sources and finetuned to fit the study’s context. The training dataset is manually created and employed to delineate road markings. Apart from the model-specific evaluation on the test-set of the data, the study creates its own test dataset from the study area to analyze these models’ performance. The outputs from these models are further integrated to develop a geospatial dataset, which is additionally utilized to generate 3D views and street cross-sections for the city. The trained models and data sources are discussed in the research and are made available for urban researchers to exploit.

TI  - A Review of the Impacts and Opportunities for African Urban Dragonflies
T2  - Insects
AB  - Urban settlements range from small villages in rural areas to large metropoles with densely packed infrastructures. Urbanization presents many challenges to the maintenance of freshwater quality and conservation of freshwater biota, especially in Africa. There are many opportunities as well, particularly by fostering contributions from citizen scientists. We review the relationships between dragonflies and urbanization in southern Africa. Shifts in dragonfly assemblages indicate environmental change, as different species are variously sensitive to abiotic and biotic water and bank conditions. They are also conservation umbrellas for many other co-occurring species. Major threats to southern African dragonflies include increasing infrastructure densification, frequent droughts, habitat loss, pollution, and invasive alien vegetation. Mitigation measures include implementation of conservation corridors, maintenance of healthy permanent ponds, pollution reduction, and removal of invasive alien trees. Citizen science is now an important approach for supplementing and supporting professional scientific research.

TI  - Coupling Agent-Based Models with Bayesian Belief Networks in Social-Ecological Systems Modeling: The Role of Uncertainty in the Resilience of Semi-arid Riparian Corridors in the Sonoran Desert

AB  - Resiliency, or the ability of ecosystems to absorb change, is a particularly challenging goal for systems with a high interconnectivity of their social and ecological sub-systems, dubbed social-ecological systems. Exploring potential effects of policy decisions and/or changes in climate are difficult to study under traditional research methods; however, social-ecological system modeling approaches have overcome many of these difficulties. Uncertainty, particularly in regards to human decision-making, remains a challenge. I developed a series of models to test the use of Bayesian modeling techniques in addressing human-based sources of uncertainty. The models were developed in two semi-arid river basins in the Sonoran Desert to represent model social-ecological systems with three sub-systems: social—urban and agricultural water demand, hydrological—pumping groundwater from the aquifer, and ecological—changes in riparian vegetation communities. The rancher decision-model, developed in the Rio San Miguel basin, used cognitive mapping and Bayesian modeling to express key decisions as a series of probabilities under a variety of environmental conditions. The social-ecological system model of the Rio San Miguel basin, which utilized the rancher decision-model to incorporate real-world uncertainty of the human decision-making process, exposed trade-offs between scenarios that benefited riparian vegetation versus rancher well-being. The Upper San Pedro River Watershed social-ecological system model tested the effects of policy decision-making, specifically on population growth and water conservation, on the spatial distribution of riparian vegetation. The model predicted degradation of the riparian corridor under all population growth/water conservation scenarios, particularly for marsh vegetation and in a specific stretch of the river. Additionally, the model demonstrated how changing the likelihood of adopting new water conservation programs could alter the probability distribution of varying levels of deterioration in the riparian corridor. Since many of the social-ecological systems models are created to aid in decision-making for natural resource managers, we believe that the outputs from models that incorporate Bayesian techniques will have a more accurate representation of the range of possible outcomes of management decisions.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation is one of the main threats to South American temperate forests due to population growth, conversion of native forests to plantations of exotic species and non-sustainable timber harvesting. The lack of forest connectivity can interfere with pollination, seed dispersal, biodiversity and landscape quality. Species with relatively limited seed dispersal are potentially more sensitive to the landscape fragmentation. Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch is a long-lived, slow-growing, relict conifer in South America’s temperate forests with large seeds possessing a limited dispersal range. The objective of the study was to identify priority areas for Araucaria conservation based on fragmentation quantification and correlation with structural variables and regeneration conditions. Results from the FRAGSTATS® and CONEFOR® software indicated that Araucaria connectivity has increased in sites located in the central Andean Range in comparison to other sites, because of reduced human and livestock pressure as well as the relative absence of commercial plantations. The proximity index ranged from 6.01 m to 34834.2 m, and the probability of connectivity has significantly increased (175663 ha) in the central Andean Range. Significant relationships were found between the Simpson’s index (or the probability of connectivity) and basal area, and between the mean largest patch index and crown diameter. The largest patch index (r = 0.6; p < 0.05) and the area-weighted mean proximity index (r = 0.767; p < 0.05) were the most important landscape metrics influencing Araucaria regeneration. Furthermore, the integration of spatial pattern analysis obtained from satellite images and aerial photographs with forest and regeneration characterization from field sampling allowed to identify the most vulnerable areas. The methodology presented here can assist in the identification of target areas for spatial conservation, including management needs under the current budget restrictions.

TI  - Southeastern Fox Squirrel (Sciurus Niger Niger) Occurrence Throughout the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of North Carolina
AU  - Voorhis, Moriah Van
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Once widely distributed, the southeastern fox squirrel’s (Sciurus niger niger) populations have been gradually declining over the past 100 years (Amspacher et al. 2019, Carraway et al. 2017, Wiegel et al. 1989). These declining populations raise conservation concern as southeastern fox squirrels are an ecologically important disperser of longleaf pine seeds and beneficial fungi (Greene and McCleery 2017). Remaining populations of southeastern fox squirrels are suspected to be disconnected from one another as there are isolated patches of suitable habitat containing no southeastern fox squirrels (Carraway et al. 2017). This raises concerns for population resiliency. Habitat fragments that are connected by dispersal will possess a greater overall population and exhibit more resilience to habitat disturbance (Opdam 1991). Hence, the uninhabited patches are indicative of the population decline and indicate uncertainty regarding southeastern fox squirrel habitat range and connectivity in the region (Carraway et al. 2017). The southeastern fox squirrel is a subspecies of fox squirrel that occurs throughout the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States and has historically been tied to a habitat of firemaintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest (Amspacher et al. 2019, Carraway et al. 2017) (Figure 1). Pine species appear to be a necessary component of their habitat as pine seeds account for 27.6% of the southeastern fox squirrels’ diet in the fall and 39.4% of their diet in the winter (Lee et al. 2001). Further, the large size of the southeastern fox squirrel is advantageous in the longleaf pine due to the aide the size provides in handling pinecones (Weigel et al. 1989, Prince et al. 2016). Evidence for declining southeastern fox squirrel populations consists of decreasing estimates of population densities, decreases in hunter harvest reports, and anecdotal observations (Green and McCleery 2017, Wiegel et al.1989). The reason for the widespread population declines of southeastern fox squirrels is believed to be the destruction and fragmentation of habitat through fire suppression and land conversion (Lee et al. 2008, Koprowski 2005, Brudvig et al. 2015). Habitat loss and fragmentation has caused population decline in multiple species associated with the longleaf pine ecosystem (Carraway et al. 2017, Frost 1993, Weigel et al. 1989, Perkins and Conner 2004). Destruction and fragmentation of habitat through fire suppression and land conversion reduces overall quantity of habitat on the landscape and decreases connectivity by increasing isolation and distances over which southeastern fox squirrels must travel in search of resources (Winiarski et al. 2017).The longleaf pine ecosystem evolved a characteristic open canopy with a shifting mosaic of woodlands and grassy savannah understory that is maintained through frequent fire originated by lightning and intentional fires started by Native Americans (Engstrom 1993, Van Lear et al. 2005). This frequent fire regime of one-to-three-year burns is critical to sustain the biodiversity of the longleaf pine ecosystem (Mitchell et al. 2006, Van Lear 2005). Additionally, the frequent fire regimes prevent invasion and replacement of less fire-adapted species (Ware et al. 1993, Engstrom et al. 2001, Carroll et al. 2002, Van Lear et al. 2005). In areas of fire suppression or exclusion, hardwood encroachment and secondary regeneration create a dense understory, depriving the southeastern fox squirrel of resources and maneuverability, rendering former habitat no longer suitable (Florida FW, Wiegel 1989). Forest fragmentation and changes in land use have contributed to fire suppression throughout the southeast, with fire often excluded for decades (Frost 1993, Van Lear et al. 2005, Obrien et al. 2010).

TI  - Seeds, Hands and Lands: Maize Genetic Resources of Highland Guatemala in Space and Time
AU  - van Etten, Jacob
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Crop genetic resources are an important aspect of agricultural production. Agricultural innovation through plant breeding is generally seen as an efficient means to support food security and economic development in poor areas. Modern varieties of maize, a major cereal and the subject of this study, are at present used on roughly half of the tropical acreage of this crop. Several strategies are being developed to reach the other half, which involve farmers being more active in the innovation process. Field studies of farmers’ seed and crop management aim to support the design of farmer-participatory plant breeding activities. In these approaches and studies there is a tendency to focus on seed selection as the core process of plant genetic innovation. The present study concentrates on the gene pool of maize in the western highlands of Guatemala, as shaped by seed exchange and replacement by farmers. Maize is traditional in this area, and the main food crop.Chapter 1 gives a conceptual critique of existing models in participatory plant breeding. There is a tendency to focus on seed selection as the core process of plant genetic innovation. The present study argues that this model should be broadened and sees gene flow as a part of the creative process of crop evolution. This conceptual change implies that more attention should be paid to seed exchange, as seeds are a main vehicle for gene flow in cereals. Also, attention should not be paid only to individual decision making but also to the connections and structures which provide the conditions under which exchange takes place. Over longer periods, individual seed exchange transactions add up to a collective gene pool structure, with ‘emergent’ properties beyond the scope of individual farmers, but nevertheless important for the design of management strategies for crop genetic resources. The goal of this research is to gain insight into the shaping of the gene pool as a collective entity in the case of highland Guatemala. To reach this goal, this study combines different research methods in an interdisciplinary way to reconstruct historical change and explain the current geographical structure in the maize gene pool.Chapter 2 explores the historiographic and ethnographic literature on highland Guatemala to sketch five centuries of change in social connectivity and technological needs and identifying disasters with consequences for maize seed. It suggests that events like human disease epidemics of the colonial period, resulting in demographic decline, have had an important influence on the continuity and spatial distribution of maize genetic resources. Also it is pointed out that the twentieth century brought both regional social integration and local fragmentation, and that this, together with demographic recuperation, is important in relation to the maize biodiversity and farmers’ knowledge about it. Concerns about diversity conservation should not lead to attempts to resist economic integration; the formerly closed character of communities is largely a colonial product and historical connections between communities are perhaps deeper than often thought. The same may go for maize genetic resources. Instead, maize agriculture should confront the challenges of modernity in ways that support collaboration between communities.Chapter 3 elaborates a more detailed study on historical change in farmer knowledge about maize diversity between 1927/1937 and 2004. In 1927 and 1937, two lists with local cultivars and their characteristics were drawn up by ethnographers for the township of Jacaltenango. Close inspection made clear that these two lists were rather consistent, and that a useful comparison with data on farmer knowledge in 2004 could thus be made. By using a sample of informants spread across several communities and ecologies in the township, an unequal spatial distribution of farmer knowledge was anticipated. A technique from cognitive anthropology, consensus analysis, was used to assess the likelihood of consensus about the presence of each cultivar. The current study found that absolute diversity losses were few, and involved cultivars that are probably not genetically unique, since they were introduced before 1937 as a result of labour migration to coffee farms. Many newly introduced maize types were reported by farmers. Seed introductions corresponded to different forms of regional mobility, including forced migration and maize trade. This chapter further highlights the importance of taking into account spatial differences in knowledge between communities in the same township. A previous study in the same area, based on interviews in several township head towns, concluded, incorrectly, according to the present study, that substantial cultivar losses had occurred.Chapter 4 investigates contemporary farmer seed exchange and replacement based on 257 formal interviews in the highland townships of Chimaltenango. The study focuses on (1) the spatial distribution of cultivar names, (2) seed sources and flows, (3) reasons to discard seeds and (4) variables explaining choices between different seed sources. The fourth element was based on the application of classification trees to the interview data, supplemented with spatial data from another source. The distribution of cultivar names suggested that regional exchange of seeds of traditional and modern varieties occurs, but is constrained by altitudinal differences in the landscape. The data also indicate that most seed flows are local, and that regional seed flows are mostly taking place within the administrative department. Regional seed flows originate often in cities. When farmers discarded seed lots they were mainly motivated by their disadvantages (high plants and long growing cycles). This result was consistent with the finding that regional seed introductions were associated with seed lots with short plants and short growing seasons. This confirms that regional seed exchange is an important source of innovations. It is argued that farmers are dependent on regional sources to counteract the local tendency of cultivars to become taller and tardier. This tendency is probably the result of unintended selection for more competitive plants.Chapter 5 is a study of the spatial distribution of maize populations. By investigating a collection of 80 samples of maize seed from the department of Chimaltenango, and five modern varieties, it attempts to infer the seed exchange processes shaping the current spatial structure of the maize gene pool. Location, altitude, morphological, phenological, and molecular marker (SSR) data were analysed. The analysis identified altitudinal differences in the landscape as an important constraining factor in seed exchange, which is related to adaptation as measured by yield. Locally it found evidence for an isolation-by-distance effect, which points to a falling intensity of seed exchange over longer distances. However, over longer ranges (>8 km), this effect disappears. This was interpreted as evidence for the existence of different mechanisms for local and regional seed exchange. In this chapter, evidence for the influence of modern varieties is also presented. This influence was detected for the lower areas only.Chapter 6 argues on the basis of the findings in the preceding chapters that farmers in highland Guatemala maintain maize genetic resources in open systems. Although local seed exchange is common and is an important shaping force for the maize gene pool, occasional regional seed exchange is important in both past and present. The present spatial distribution of maize populations reflects dynamic processes and should not be conserved as such. To innovate, farmers take direct advantage of the differences between crop populations evolving in different places, in order to achieve phenotypic changes in their own fields. It is not artificial selection that is the main creative force in local innovation – the dominant view among advocates of participatory plant breeding – but the flow of seed lots in the landscape. Consequently, efforts to support seed-based innovation should not only focus on selection or local adaptation, but strengthen the capacities of innovation through seed exchange between locales. Innovation should seek to further exploit ecological complementarities between areas (and not only the representation of broader zones of ecological adaptation). For this end, new regional infrastructures to handle seeds and information may need to be created.

TI  - Quantifying the Landscape’s Ecological Benefits—An Analysis of the Effect of Land Cover Change on Ecosystem Services
T2  - Land
AB  - The increasing pressure from land cover change exacerbates the negative effect on ecosystems and ecosystem services (ES). One approach to inform holistic and sustainable management is to quantify the ES provided by the landscape. Using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, this study quantified the sediment retention capacity and water yield potential of different land cover in the Santee River Basin Network in South Carolina, USA. Results showed that vegetated areas provided the highest sediment retention capacity and lowest water yield potential. Also, the simulations demonstrated that keeping the offseason crop areas vegetated by planting cover crops improves the monthly ES provision of the landscape. Retaining the soil within the land area prevents possible contamination and siltation of rivers and streams. On the other hand, low water yield potential translates to low occurrence of surface runoff, which indicates better soil erosion control, regulated soil nutrient absorption and gradual infiltration. The results of this study can be used for landscape sustainability management to assess the possible tradeoffs between ecological conservation and economic development. Furthermore, the generated map of ES can be used to pinpoint the areas where ES are best provided within the landscape.

TI  - The effect of urbanisation on plant diversity: Comparative case studies in Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria
AU  - Terziyski, Georgi Dimitrov
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - In the last few decades the importance of urban green space in terms of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development has been widely recognised. The planning decisions about urban green space, however, have been based mostly on two factors. Green areas that are perceived as more natural are generally seen as more valuable than those, like playing fields, which are heavily managed. The second factor is the degree of isolation; green spaces, which link together to form 'green corridors', are expected to be more valuable. One might also expect green spaces located within less built-up residential areas to be of higher quality than those within dense housing. This study investigated the relative importance of three factors on the plant diversity of urban green spaces in two case study areas: Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria. These were the position of the green spaces relative to housing of different densities; the type of green spaces, and level of management to which they had been subjected; and the effects of the size of the green space and whether they were connected to others. First, three residential morphology types (high, medium and low density) were delineated from maps and high-quality aerial photographs using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software. The interpretation of aerial photographs showed that high density housing covers 18.0%, medium density 60% and low density 22% of the overall residential areas in Bolton. In Sofia the largest proportion was made up of low density housing (46%), followed by medium density (43%) and high density (11%). A set of 24 sampling plots positioned within the residential green spaces were selected in each of the case study areas. The focus of the study was the herbaceous component of grasslands. The four studied green space types were: parks and recreational gardens, playing fields (in Sofia substituted by roadside verges), derelict areas, and remnants of semi-natural vegetation. These green spaces could be grouped into two categories of management: managed and unmanaged. Overall 174 species of herbaceous angiosperms were identified in Bolton and 246 in Sofia. There were significant differences between the mean species numbers identified in the three housing densities in both case study areas. Least species rich were the green spaces within the high density residential areas. Most species were found in the medium density in Bolton and within the low density in Sofia. There were also differences between the types of green spaces. The most species were found in semi-natural remnants of vegetation and derelict areas. The managed green spaces were less species rich compared with unmanaged ones in both case study areas. A positive correlation was observed between the size of the green space and number of species in Bolton, but in Sofia, the lack of aerial photographs made this test impossible. The connectivity between the green spaces did not, however, correlate with their species richness. In conclusion, these results suggest that the size, management method, type and position within particular residential type are the important factors which determine plant diversity in urban areas. Connectivity between green spaces does not seem to affect diversity. Therefore, the negative effects of urbanisation may best be mitigated by better management of existing urban green space. The results also suggest, albeit tentatively, that the concept of the green corridor may not be that important for maintaining urban plant diversity. Further studies will continue to determine the effect of patch size and isolation on plant diversity.

TI  - Informing Landscape-Scale Management of the Greater Horseshoe Bat Rhinolophus Ferrumequinum
AU  - Finch, Domhnall
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Global land use is changing at an unprecedented rate and has been identified as a key driver of habitat loss, fragmentation and species decline in the natural environment. Understanding how land use influences spatial patterns in species abundance, and habitat connectivity at a landscape scale is critical for the survival of wildlife populations. The focal species of my research is the rare greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), which was once widespread across southern England and Wales. However, owing to changes in agricultural land management and the expansion of urban areas, its range has contracted considerably over the last century. Using a series of ecological techniques, including a novel predictive modelling approach, field experiments and social network analysis, this thesis aims to identify which ecological factors affect their activity and movement at a landscape scale. The work also provides conservation practitioners the ability to identify the locations of these impacts, pinch-points, in the wider environment; where strategic planning and mitigation measures can be applied to increase their overall occurrence and abundance in the wider environment. Using a field experiment, I examined how traffic noise can influence the relative activity levels of free-living bats. Overall, I showed that traffic noise can significantly reduce the activity levels of R. ferrumequinum, as well as other bat species, along linear feature. Using a separate field experiment, I determined that the sonic spectrum had a greater negative effect on bat activity than the ultrasonic spectrum. These results therefore suggest that the mode of action is likely to be through general deterrence and avoidance rather than through the masking of echolocation calls. R. ferrumequinum are widely considered to be dependent on linear landscape features such as woodland edges and hedgerows. My research supported this view, and highlighted the particular importance of treelines, which were associated with greater activity than even sympathetically managed hedgerows. However, an important novel finding from my research was that about a third of all activity recorded at paired detectors was derived from the middle of fields. It is therefore important to consider these more open habitats, as well as hedgerows, treelines and woodland edges, when designing and conducting ecological impact assessments for future developments. Bats use the landscape at a large spatial scale, and responses to any particular challenge (such as a new lighting scheme or urban development) are likely to depend on their context within a landscape. For example, the disruption of a commuting route is likely to have a greater impact where only one suitable route exists, compared with scenarios where there are numerous alternatives. To understand better how R. ferrumequinum interacts with the British landscape, I therefore created models of predicted functional connectivity around four maternity roosts using Circuitscape software. Using non-invasive static bat detectors as a method of ground validation, I created robust models predicting R. ferrumequinum movement; which allowed the identification of pinch-points in the landscape, either those areas limiting species movement or highly important for the species conservation. While most research, and the work of ecological practitioners, focuses on the maternity season, hibernation ecology has received much less attention. Yet given that horseshoe bats are known to move roost location frequently during the hibernation period, it is important to understand more about this behaviour. Using social network analysis, I demonstrate that adult males are significantly more central (connected to a higher number of individual bats) in the network during the hibernation period. I found that movements between hibernacula were associated with both age and degree centrality of individual bats, with those more geographically isolated hibernacula playing an important role for the movement of certain individuals at a landscape scale. This highlights that despite low activity in some of these smaller roost locations, they are a conservation priority to decrease the risk of fragmentation and loss of connectivity within the wider landscape. The results of my meta-analysis, which was based on 22 studies, demonstrated the significant negative effects endectocides on Aphodiinae dung beetles. My results suggest that ivermectin has the highest negative effect on the abundance of both adult and large Aphodiinae dung beetles. However, contrasting results were observed for dung beetle occurrence, with adult beetles showing an attraction to dung with endectocides and larvae showing the complete opposite, with poor survival rates and impaired development. Over time this could have significant negative effects on dung beetle populations. The results of this thesis indicate that the landscape-scale conservation of R. ferrumequinum is complex. Considerations need to be given to a suite of factors ranging from the prey items they consume to the physical habitat structures which they utilise. From this research, specific locations and features which have impacts on their movement and activity can be identified, allowing the outputs to be used by decision-makers as a tool to inform local management strategies. The prioritisation of conservation activity for the species can be aided by spatially-explicit models, such as the one I developed using Circuitscape, which bring together multiple input layers to create outputs readily interpretable to practitioners. However, to achieve a successful outcome for this priority species, collaborative efforts from many stakeholders, across boundaries, are required.

AB  - The Big East Lake water network (BELWN), located in Wuhan city, China, is mainly composed of six lakes and isolated from the Yangtze river. At the background of restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, four season investigations were conducted during 2014–2015 to study the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities, explore their relationships with environmental factors, and forecast the change trends in assemblages in a long period after restoration measures. A total of 40 species were recorded, oligochaetes and chironomids dominated the communities. Season variation in density and biomass were distinct and the community differences in lakes related to the degrees of organic pollution. In comparison with the historical data, the species richness of mollusks in Donghu lake sharply decreased due to water pollution and the loss of diverse habitat. Concerning on the whole BELWN, the whole taxa recorded in our study was slightly fewer than the previous study. A new recorded species polychaete Nephtys sp. was first collected with an important ecological interest. As an urban lake system dominated by eutrophication, the water nutrients significantly affected the distribution of macroinvertebrates. According to the GAM models, the dominant species responded to environmental gradients with different response curves. After restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, the macroinvertebrate communities would change and the biodiversity would steadily increase with time. Additionally, the new recorded species Nephtys sp. would spread into the whole BELWN in the foresee future.Le réseau du Grand lac Est (BELWN), situé dans la ville de Wuhan, en Chine, est principalement composé de six lacs isolés du fleuve Yangtze. Dans le cadre du rétablissement de la connectivité hydrologique entre les rivières et les lacs, quatre études ont été menées pendant la période 2014-2015 pour étudier la répartition spatiale et la dynamique saisonnière des communautés de macroinvertébrés, explorer leurs relations avec les facteurs environnementaux et prévoir les tendances des changements dans les assemblages à long terme après les mesures de restauration. Un total de 40 espèces a été enregistré. Les oligochètes et les chironomides ont dominé les communautés. La variation saisonnière de la densité et de la biomasse était nette et les différences entre lacs dans les communautés étaient liées au degré de pollution organique. Par rapport aux données historiques, la richesse en espèces de mollusques du lac Donghu a fortement diminué en raison de la pollution de l'eau et de la perte de divers habitats. En ce qui concerne l'ensemble du BELWN, le total des taxons rencontrés dans notre étude était légèrement inférieur à celui de l'étude précédente. Une nouvelle espèce polychète Nephtys sp., d'un intérêt écologique important, a été échantillonnée. En tant que système lacustre urbain dominé par l'eutrophisation, les nutriments ont affecté de façon significative la répartition des macroinvertébrés. Selon les modèles GAM, les espèces dominantes ont répondu à des gradients environnementaux avec des courbes de réponse différentes. Après la restauration de la connectivité hydrologique entre les rivières et les lacs, les communautés de macroinvertébrés changeront et la biodiversité augmentera avec le temps. De plus, les nouvelles espèces comme Nephtys sp. se répandront dans tout le BELWN dans l'avenir.

AB  - The spatial morphology of waterfront green spaces helps generate cooling effects to mitigate the urban heat island effect (UHI) in metropolis cities. To explore the contribution and influence of multi-dimensional spatial indices on the mitigation of UHIs, the green space of the riparian buffer along 18 river channels in Shanghai was considered as a case study. The spatial distribution data of the land surface temperature (LST) in the study area were obtained by using remote sensing images. By selecting the related spatial structure morphological factors of the waterfront green space as the quantitative description index, the growth regression tree model (BRT) was adapted to analyze the contribution of various indexes of the waterfront green space on the distribution of the LST and the marginal effect of blue–green synergistic cooling. In addition, mathematical statistical analysis and spatial analysis methods were used to study the influence of the morphological group (MG) types of riparian green spaces with different morphological characteristics on the LST. The results showed that in terms of the spatial structure variables between blue and green spaces, the contribution of river widths larger than 30 m was more notable in decreasing the LST. In the case of a larger river width, the marginal effect of synergistic cooling could be observed in farther regions. The green space that had the highest connectivity degree and was located in the leeward direction of the river exhibited the lowest LST. In terms of the spatial morphology, the fractional cover values of the vegetation (Fv) and area (A) of the green space were the main factors affecting the cooling effect of the green space. For all MG types, a large green patch that had a high green coverage and connectivity degree, as well as was distributed in the leeward direction of the river, corresponded to the lowest LST. The research presented herein can provide methods and development suggestions for optimizing spatial thermal comfort in climate adaptive cities.

AB  - Earthquakes not only cause the destruction of surface buildings and a large number of casualties, but also have an important impact on regional land-use change. Timely understanding of land cover and its changes before and after earthquakes is of great scientific significance for studying the restoration and reconstruction of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy in disaster areas. At present, there are few studies on land cover changes before and after earthquakes in the earthquake-stricken areas, especially the quantitative assessment of land cover changes before and after earthquakes at the micro scale of landscape spatial distribution. Therefore, this article is based on remote sensing data and uses an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, as an example. By calculating the land-use degree comprehensive index and its rate of change, the transfer matrix of land-use, quantitative expression methods of the landscape via the landscape pattern index are analyzed from the points of view of the spatial–temporal evolution law of the landscape pattern of land cover before and after the earthquake. The experimental results showed that the area of forest, cropland, shrub. and grassland types in the study area changed greatly, and the area of grassland types in Shuanghe Township changed most obviously, as they increased from 6.57 km2 in 2015 to 7.43 km2, and then decreased to 6.21 km2 in 2020. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land-use degree for most towns in the study area showed an upward trend, and the land cover types were improved. After 2017, the PD and LSI of the study area showed a downward trend, among which the bare land type changed greatly, with the PD value decreasing from 0.38 in 2017 to 0.21 in 2020, and the LSI value decreasing from 58.29 in 2017 to 40.69 in 2020. This indicates that the degree of landscape fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface in the study area are reduced in the later stage of earthquake recovery. After 2017, the AI value of the study area showed an upward trend, and the AI value of the bare land type increased from 63.97 in 2017 to 78.25 in 2020, indicating that the connectivity between landscape patches in the study area was enhanced in the later stage of the earthquake. This also reflects that the ecological environment of the study area gradually showed a good trend in the later stage of the earthquake. The results of this paper not only reveal the spatial–temporal evolution of land cover in Jiuzhaigou County before and after the earthquake, but also help the relevant national decision-making departments to formulate corresponding policies and measures.

AB  - Mobile animals that traverse ecosystem boundaries can fundamentally reshape environments by providing critical nutrient and energy inputs to the ecosystems they inhabit. In particular, aggregations of seabirds often transform coastal and island ecosystems through large amounts of nutrient-rich guano deposition. Anthropogenically driven losses of these subsidies can occur through changes in abundance of mobile species, including seabirds, and have been shown to drive whole-scale ecosystem state change on islands. However, even though many species that forage on anthropogenic food sources are highly mobile and may thus play important roles in moving nutrients from urban systems to otherwise conserved ecosystems, the impacts of anthropogenic supplements on spatial subsidies have been largely ignored. Here we examine the effects of large nesting colonies of Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis), a generalist carnivore known to forage on human refuse, on the Channel Islands of California. Specifically, we explore how their foraging on human subsidies may change nutrient deposition patterns at their relatively remote and protected breeding islands. We equipped gulls with GPS loggers to assess the frequency of urban foraging, and we partnered this tracking data with bird density data to estimate the rate of wild and urban-derived guano deposition on two different islands. Consistent with research on other gull species, we found high (up to 40%) but island-specific rates of urban foraging, resulting between 66 and 93 kg ha−1 of guano in these two sites during the breeding season, a level greater than half the amount of fertilizer applied annually in typical commercial agricultural settings and likely the primary source of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to this system. Specifically, we estimate that 27 kg ha−1 year−1 of nutrient-rich guano is shuttled to these otherwise isolated islands from anthropogenic sources. This research highlights the large shadow (i.e., footprint) that human activity can cast on even remote ecosystems by driving significant nutrient enrichment through impacts on animal behavior and connectivity.

AB  - Shiyang River Catchment locates in the eastern part of Hexi Corridor. It suffers from the most profound human interaction, and the relationship of nature and human in there is intensive. Due to irrational human interaction as well as absence of effective catchment management, the environment in down reaches degraded continuingly in the past. The research on geography construction in this region is significative both in theoretics and practics.Based on the field vegetation surveying in marginal areas of oasis in the down reaches of Shiyang River, and by analyzing the physiological features and spatial distribution diversity of the key and directive plants, it is found that there are spatial diversity in the causations of the environmental degradation in the down reaches of Shiyang River: excessive decreasing of groundwater table in the region of southward from Datan Township and irrational development in the marginal areas of northward from there. The further studies indicate that the main threaten to continuing environmental degradation in the down reaches comes from over-exploiting of groundwater. To find out the origin of groundwater over-exploitation, the analysis of hydrological processes of Shiyang River and actuality water requirement and actual water consumption in the Minqin County, which locates in the down reaches of the river, are carried out. The results show that water resources over-consumption in the Wuwei City, which locates in the middle reaches of the river, and irrational development model on the basis of agriculture, especially on farming system in the down reaches of the river are the underlying reasons. Finally, according to physical geography principle, on the basis of priority of ecological water requirement(2.58 x 108 m3, at least 1.59 x 108 m3) and equality of development right in the all catchemt, the water resources distribution framework in the Shiyang River catchment is putting forwards, considering that 4.06 x 108 m3 (at least 3.26 x 108 m3) water should enter down reaches (Minqin) from Wuwei. Furthermore, considering the rational utilization of water resources, 3 x 104 hm2 farmlands should be set back to grassland. The position of these farmlands and succedent constructing measures are proposed. Based on all mentioned above, theories and practices of social and economic construction in Minqin are discussed.

AB  - Dengue is hyperendemic in Brazil, with outbreaks affecting all regions. Previous studies identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in Brazil, beyond which certain areas, such as South Brazil and the Amazon rainforest, were relatively protected from outbreaks. Recent data shows these barriers are being eroded. In this study, we explore the drivers of this expansion and identify the current limits to the dengue transmission zone. We used a spatio-temporal additive model to explore the associations between dengue outbreaks and temperature suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity to the Brazilian urban network. The model was applied to a binary outbreak indicator, assuming the official threshold value of 300 cases per 100,000 residents, for Brazil’s municipalities between 2001 and 2020. We found a nonlinear relationship between higher levels of connectivity to the Brazilian urban network and the odds of an outbreak, with lower odds in metropoles compared to regional capitals. The number of months per year with suitable temperature conditions for Aedes mosquitoes was positively associated with the dengue outbreak occurrence. Temperature suitability explained most interannual and spatial variation in South Brazil, confirming this geographical barrier is influenced by lower seasonal temperatures. Municipalities that had experienced an outbreak previously had double the odds of subsequent outbreaks. We identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in South Brazil, western Amazon, and along the northern coast of Brazil. Although a southern barrier still exists, it has shifted south, and the Amazon no longer has a clear boundary. Few areas of Brazil remain protected from dengue outbreaks. Communities living on the edge of previous barriers are particularly susceptible to future outbreaks as they lack immunity. Control strategies should target regions at risk of future outbreaks as well as those currently within the dengue transmission zone.

AB  - Grassland biomass is the embodiment of grassland productivity, and the material basis for the maintenance of the grassland ecosystem. Grassland is the main vegetation type in the Mongolian Plateau. Grassland changes in the core region of the China–Mongolia–Russia Economic Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative have an important impact on regional ecology, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. This study established three types of models for estimating grassland production through statistical analysis methods using NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, and PsnNet remote sensing indices retrieved from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. This was combined with ground-measured grassland data and meteorological data. Based on model evaluation, the spatial and temporal distribution and variation characteristics of grassland along the Mongolia part of the China–Mongolia Railway were obtained through inversion for the period from 2006 to 2015. The results showed that all the models had good simulation effects. The optimal model was an exponential model based on MSAVI—with its simulation accuracy reaching 78%. Grassland production in the study area has increased slightly in the past ten years, with little change in the first five years and a fluctuating increase in the next five years. The average grassland production (per unit production) in the past ten years was 3400.39 kg/ha and the average total production was 9707.88 × 104 t. Grassland production increased slightly in most areas along the railway, and in some areas it continued to decline. The regional spatial distribution of increased and decreased grassland production was significantly different. With better grassland resources in the northeastern part of the study area—the area around Chinggis City and the capital of Hentiy Province—had the most significant growth. However, the southern Gobi area—with its trend towards land degradation in the area where the southern Gobi and desert steppe transitions to steppe and dry steppe—had a significant decrease. This meant that the risk of grassland degradation still existed. There were also quantitative and spatial differences in the areas where grassland production decreased on both sides of the railway. The decrease in grassland production on the western side of the railway was more obvious than on the eastern side, and the reduction area was dispersed on the western side and relatively concentrated on the eastern side. In future research, the identification of key areas of grassland degradation along the China–Mongolia Railway as well as its driving forces should be investigated further.

T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Urbanization has recently emerged as an exciting new direction for evolutionary research founded on our growing understanding of rapid evolution paired with the expansion of novel urban habitats. Urbanization can influence adaptive and nonadaptive evolution in urban‐dwelling species, but generalized patterns and the predictability of urban evolutionary responses within populations remain unclear. This editorial introduces the special feature “Evolution in Urban Environments” and addresses four major emerging themes, which include: (a) adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity via physiological responses to urban climate, (b) adaptive evolution via phenotype–environment relationships in urban habitats, (c) population connectivity and genetic drift in urban landscapes, and (d) human–wildlife interactions in urban spaces. Here, we present the 16 articles (12 empirical, 3 review, 1 capstone) within this issue and how they represent each of these four emerging themes in urban evolutionary biology. Finally, we discuss how these articles address previous questions and have now raised new ones, highlighting important new directions for the field.

TI  - Study on the Frameworks, the Functions and the Landscape Ecology Planning Methods of Urban Green Corridors―A Case Study of Wuhan
AU  - Cai, Jing Chan
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - As an important aspect of landscape ecology, the studies on corridors are permeating urban ecology and urban landscape planning. Green corridor is a key landscape type. This paper communicates clearly about the definition and the classification of green corridor. Additionally, it analyses urban green corridor’s structure, pattern and function. Applying the method for landscape ecology planning to urban green corridor planning, this study notes five steps of green corridor planning, which are as follows, first, investigating basic data, secondly confirming targets and functions, thirdly ecology planning, fourthly implementing plans and designs and last, managing planning projects, and the former three stages are analyzed clearly. The four scales of green corridor planning and the methods for data analyzing, confirming functions, targets, width of various kinds of urban green corridors are studied.  This paper notes that according to the model of vehicle emission dispersion and the model of noises dispersion, the width of green road-side corridor can be confirmed exactly. The results show that when downwind distance is   meters, the surface pollution concentration is the max. Arranging green road-side corridor before this distance can effectively decrease the max concentration and the concentrations at different distance. When there isn’t enough room to arrange dividing strips, we can assume the pollution origin as the midline of road. If the half width of road is shorter than   meters, the sum of green road-side corridor width and half road width ought to be equal to or greater than   meters, and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If the half width of road is greater than   meters, green road-side corridor should be arranged from roadside and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If roads have dividing strips, and there is enough room to arrange diving strips, green road-side corridor should be arranged according to the above principles regarding each slab as a road. Considering its function of reducing traffic noises, green road-side corridor should cling to the roadside, and the wider the green road-side corridor is, the better effect is.The environments along the roads comprise six categories. The first category is shopping center, the second one is culture and education, habitation, the third one is heavy industry, the fourth is water area, the fifth is farmland and the last one is natural vegetation, mountain and park. The methods for planning green road-side corridors along different roads with different environments are studied exhaustively.This paper applies the above principles and methods to Wuhan’s green corridor planning, points out the problems of its green corridors by analyzing its corridors’ form, network, the relationship between green focuses and green corridors, the relationship between heat island effects and green corridors. The results show that Wuhan’s all kind of green corridors in each district, especially the green belts, are very scanty. The connectivity of green corridor network is so low, the width is so narrow, and inside environments can not be formed. Some of green focuses don’t be connected each other by green corridors. Considering Wuhan’s natural resources, regional status and the problems of its green corridors, the targets and the functions of Wuhan’s green corridors planning are pointed out and confirmed, which are as follows, building ecological network connecting each urban green focuses, urban and rural green focuses; conserving and improving the diversity of species and habitats, the quality of atmosphere, the productivity of agricultural and horticultural acts adjacent to green corridors; development controlling and urban containment; improving urban microclimate, reducing heat island effects.Lastly, this paper plans and confirms the width, the direction and the pattern of Wuhan’s green corridors. It points out that green network should be uninterrupted on the region scale, the urban scale and the district scale. When green corridors go through the thermal area, and their trends parallel the dominant wind direction, heat island effects can be alleviated greatly.

AU  - Read, Kaitlyn D

T2  - Conservation Science and Practice
AB  - Although the negative impacts of roads on herpetiles are well documented, broad‐scale implementation of effective mitigation measures to address these impacts remains limited. Here, we evaluated whether a novel, cost‐effective, retrofit ecopassage design can reduce road mortality of herpetiles in the Lake Simcoe Watershed, using a before‐after‐control‐impact study. We also examined whether the ecopassages impacted the movement of turtles across the landscape using wildlife cameras. Our study indicated that the ecopassages significantly reduced turtle road mortality at the treatment sites but were not effective at mitigating road mortality of other herpetiles. Most turtle road‐kill at the ecopassages sites occurred at fence ends, highlighting the need for solutions to address fence‐end effects for herpetiles. There was no evidence that the ecopassages reduced turtles' ability to move between habitats as individuals were observed crossing through the ecopassages. Our results suggest that inexpensive solutions can effectively mitigate road mortality for turtles and taller fencing could improve the design for other species. Ecopassages, such as the ones tested in this study, should be widely implemented in road‐kill hotspots across all regions, especially in habitats of rare or at‐risk species, in order to protect turtles and other wildlife from the increasing threat of roads.

AB  - This research implements a GIS framework model aimed at evaluating the ecological efficiency of urban green areas. The model classifies urban green areas by identifying those that can provide ecosystem services to sustain green infrastructure at an urban district level. This model can also guide decision makers in the proper placement of the green infrastructure. The model works on the interrelation of four indicators of size, shape, vegetation structure and vegetation diversity, and it was tested in the case study of the Western Urban Districts of Naples (Italy). The selection of this study area is because it presents four urban districts that are different for physiography, urban patterns, land use, land cover and for the existing building stock. The proposed GIS-based framework can be a useful tool for planning actions and measures to protect, implement and restore existing green areas through integration into urban green infrastructure.

AB  - Impervious surfaces (IPS) are the major source of urban heat island effect (UHI), and the relationships between IPS and land surface temperature (LST) have been widely studied. However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran’s I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI), Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran’s I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces.

AB  - We carried out 10 field expeditions between 2010 and 2015 in the lowland part of the Congo River network in the eastern part of the basin (Democratic Republic of the Congo), to describe the spatial variations in fluvial dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations. We investigate the possible drivers of the spatial variations in dissolved CO2, CH4and N2Oconcentrations by analyzing covariations with several other biogeochemical variables, aquatic metabolic processes (primary production and respiration), catchment characteristics (land cover) and wetland spatial distributions. We test the hypothesis that spatial patterns of CO2, CH4and N2Oare partly due to the connectivity with wetlands, in particular with a giant wetland of flooded forest in the core of the Congo basin, the “Cuvette Centrale Congolaise” (CCC). Two transects of 1650 km were carried out from the city of Kisangani to the city of Kinshasa, along the longest possible navigable section of the river and corresponding to 41 % of the total length of the main stem. Additionally, three time series of CH4andN2Owere obtained at fixed points in the main stem of the middle Congo (2013–2018, biweekly sampling), in the main stem of the lower Kasaï (2015–2017, monthly sampling) and in the main stem of the middle Oubangui (2010–2012, biweekly sampling). The variations in dissolved N2Oconcentrations were modest, with values oscillating around the concentration corresponding to saturation with the atmosphere, with N2Osaturation level (%N2O, where atmospheric equilibrium corresponds to 100 %) ranging between 0 % and 561 % (average 142 %). The relatively narrow range of %N2Ovariations was consistent with low NH4+(2.3±1.3µmol L-1) and NO3-(5.6±5.1µmol L-1) levels in these near pristine rivers and streams, with low agriculture pressure on the catchment (croplands correspond to 0.1 % of catchment land cover of sampled rivers), dominated by forests (∼70% of land cover). The covariations in %N2O,NH4+, NO3-and dissolved oxygen saturation level (%O2) indicate N2Oremoval by soil or sedimentary denitrification in low O2, high NH4+and low NO3-environments (typically small and organic matter rich streams) and N2Oproduction by nitrification in high O2, low NH4+and highNO3-(typical of larger rivers that are poor in organic matter). Surface waters were very strongly oversaturated in CO2and CH4with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, with values of the partial pressure of CO2(pCO2) ranging between 1087 and 22 899 ppm (equilibrium∼400ppm) and dissolved CH4concentrations ranging between 22 and 71 428 nmol L-1(equilibrium ∼2nmol L-1). Spatial variations were overwhelmingly more important than seasonal variations for pCO2, CH4and %N2Oas well as day–night variations for pCO2. The wide range of pCO2and CH4variations was consistent with the equally wide range of %O2(0.3 %–122.8 %) and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (1.8–67.8 mg L-1), indicative of generation of these two greenhouse gases from intense processing of organic matter either in “terra firme” soils, wetlands or in-stream. However, the emission rate of CO2to the atmosphere from riverine surface waters was on average about 10 times higher than the flux of CO2produced by aquatic net heterotrophy (as evaluated from measurements of pelagic respiration and primary production). This indicates that the CO2emissions from the river network were sustained by lateral inputs of CO2(either from terra firme or from wetlands). The pCO2andCH4values decreased and %O2increased with increasing Strahler order, showing that stream size explains part of the spatial variability of these quantities. In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that lateral inputs of carbon from wetlands (flooded forest and aquatic macrophytes) were of paramount importance in sustaining high CO2andCH4concentrations in the Congo river network, as well as driving spatial variations: the rivers draining the CCC were characterized by significantly higher pCO2and CH4and significantly lower %O2and %N2Ovalues than those not draining the CCC;pCO2and %O2values were correlated to the coverage of flooded forest on the catchment. The flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs) between rivers and the atmosphere averaged 2469 mmol m-2d-1for CO2(range 86 and 7110 mmol m-2d-1), 12 553 µmol m-2d-1for CH4(range 65 and 597 260 µmol m-2d-1) and 22 µmol m-2d-1for N2O(range -52 and 319 µmol m-2d-1). The estimate of integrated CO2emission from the Congo River network (251±46TgC (1012gC) yr-1), corresponding to nearly half theCO2emissions from tropical oceans globally (565 TgC yr-1) and was nearly 2 times the CO2emissions from the tropical Atlantic Ocean (137 TgC yr-1). Moreover, the integrated CO2emission from the Congo River network is more than 3 times higher than the estimate of terrestrial net ecosystem exchange (NEE) on the whole catchment (77 TgC yr-1). This shows that it is unlikely that the CO2emissions from the river network were sustained by the hydrological carbon export from terra firme soils (typically very small compared to terrestrial NEE) but most likely, to a large extent, they were sustained by wetlands (with a much higher hydrological connectivity with rivers and streams).

AB  - Ecosystems are changing in complex and unpredictable ways, and analysis of these changes is facilitated by coordinated, long‐term research. Meeting diverse societal needs requires an understanding of what populations and communities will be dominant in 20, 50, and 100 yr. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of populations and communities. This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling story about what their site would look like in 50 or 100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were grouped into papers along five themes for this special issue: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the resilience theme and includes stories from the Baltimore (urban), Hubbard Brook (northern hardwood forest), Andrews (temperate rain forest), Moorea (coral reef), Cedar Creek (grassland), and North Temperate Lakes (lakes) sites. The concept of resilience (the capacity of a system to maintain structure and processes in the face of disturbance) is an old topic that has seen a resurgence of interest as the nature and extent of global environmental change have intensified. The stories we present here show the power of long‐term manipulation experiments (Cedar Creek), the value of long‐term monitoring of forests in both natural (Andrews, Hubbard Brook) and urban settings (Baltimore), and insights that can be gained from modeling and/or experimental approaches paired with long‐term observations (North Temperate Lakes, Moorea). Three main conclusions emerge from the analysis: (1) Resilience research has matured over the past 40 yr of the LTER program; (2) there are many examples of high resilience among the ecosystems in the LTER network; (3) there are also many warning signs of declining resilience of the ecosystems we study. These stories highlight the need for long‐term studies to address this complex topic and show how the diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about this important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.

AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001–2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

T2  - Remote Sensing
AB  - The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran’s I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran’s I| < 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran’s I value, and high–high and low–high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.

AU  - Watson, Charles
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Land surface temperature is a significant parameter for identifying micro-climatic changes and their spatial distributions relative to the urban environment. This paper examined and identified the urban heat islands and their spatial and temporal variability along the I-85/I-40 corridor in central North Carolina between 1990 and 2002. More specifically, the study focused on: (1) understanding the behavior of the spectral and thermal signatures of various land cover and land use types and their relationships with UHI development, and (2) applying digital remote sensing techniques to observe and measure the temporal and spatial variability of these surface heat islands. An assemblage of remotely sensed imagery (Landsat data), land surface temperature data, land cover and land use classifications, vegetation indices, and archived weather data was used to create maps, charts and statistical models to indicate and display the magnitude and spatial extent of these thermal climates. The data revealed that urbanization in the I-85/I-40 corridor region increased significantly between 1990 and 2002. Quantitative results from the satellite imagery also indicated that differences in land cover/ land use types, anthropogenic heat sources, and land surface temperature variability likely contributed to a temperature rise in the corridor study area thus thermal climate development.

TI  - Stormwater basins of the New Jersey coastal plain: Subsidies or sinks for frogs and toads?
AU  - Mccarthy, Kathleen

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Urban landscape relationships with song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population structure and connectivity and human health and behavior
AU  - Unfried, Thomas Mitchell
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization converts native vegetation to novel land cover types, which may affect population connectivity. I studied this relationship in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at 18 sites in the Seattle, WA, metropolitan region. Genetic differentiation was best predicted by resistance distances in which resistance to dispersal was linearly related to age of development and a second set of resistance distances in which high and medium urbanization were 100 times more resistant than vegetation land covers. My results suggest that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. The relation to development age suggests that genetic differentiation in the urban system has not yet reached equilibrium, so the effects of connectivity loss will increase. Urbanization can decrease habitat quality that can result in source-sink population dynamics I combined a study of demographic rates with genetic methods to study source-sink population dynamics in Song Sparrows. I estimated juvenile and adult survival from mark-recapture analysis and fecundity from territory success and fledgling counts. Directional gene flow was investigated by several genetic methods. The trend in Song Sparrow relative abundance revealed an intrinsic rate of increase of −7.8% annually, and four of 15 sampled populations had finite rates of increase (λ) significantly less than one. Net immigration estimated from genetic assignments was negatively correlated with λ. Net immigration or λ were not correlated with landscape or local habitat metrics. Genetic methods suggest that gene flow is common throughout the region, and Song Sparrows exhibit source-sink population dynamics. I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team to examine the influence of destinations within walking distance and vegetation on walking trips and body mass index (BMI) for residents of Seattle, WA. We measured accessibility and greenness, and self-reported destinations, natural features, walking trips, BMI were measured through a postal survey. Objective accessibility was related to walking trips per month, as was subjective greenness. In areas with high accessibility, BMI was lower in areas that had more greenness. Objective and subjective measurements of accessibility and greenness led to an understanding of variation among walking trips and BMI in different neighborhoods.

TI  - Influence of stormwater control measures on watershed hydrology and biogeochemical cycling
AU  - Bell, Colin D.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban development replaces vegetation with impervious surfaces and natural drainage channels with pipe networks that quicken flow paths and alter hydrologic regimes. Additionally, the import of food, application of fertilizer to lawns and gardens, and heightened atmospheric deposition increases nutrient availability in urban landscapes. These excess nutrients are ultimately routed to streams through the pipe networks before it can be processed by the vegetation and microorganisms of the landscape. This combination of physical and chemical disturbances impacts stream ecosystems and degrades their ability to perform valuable services such as removal of nutrients, degradation of pollutants, and provision of recreational and aesthetic value. Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are a management strategy that can mitigate these impacts urbanization, ultimately preserving those valuable stream ecosystems. While the effects of urban development and individual SCMs on water quantity and quality have been well documented independently, studies examining the cumulative influence of SCMs on water quantity and nitrogen cycling throughout entire developed watersheds are lacking. First, this work addresses this gap in knowledge by empirically relating hydrologic regimes at sixteen urban watersheds in Charlotte, NC, USA to a series of metrics that describe the extent of urban development and mitigation with SCMs. Next, water quality data were collected at four of the sixteen sites to determine how SCMs affect stream nutrient and carbon concentrations during storms, and how the extent and distribution of urban development modulates the effects of SCMs. Because of the limited ability for monitoring approaches to capture variability along a continuum of development and mitigation, a modeling approach was used to further understand the role of SCMs on hydrology and water quality. A new model was developed, calibrated, validated, and used to assess uncertainty of the hydrologic and ecological processes that occur in SCMs. Finally, these SCM routines were incorporated into an existing spatially-distributed watershed model to test how varying levels of impervious surface connectivity to SCMs changed hydrologic and water quality regimes in a watershed in Charlotte, NC.The results of the study indicate that the degree of urbanization, as measured by a watershed metric total imperviousness, controlled hydrologic behavior at the storm event time scale across the 16 sites monitored. There is evidence that SCMs are able to effect the hydrologic record flashiness at an annual time scale by temporarily storing runoff and extending hydrograph recession. An analysis of water quality data indicates that SCMs are able to reduce N, phosphorous and dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the stream in watersheds with a homogeneous urban land use. However, in newly developing watersheds (e.g., suburban), the presence of SCMs coincides with the addition of urban impervious surfaces and SCMs are not sufficient to return water quality to pre-development conditions, as reflected in increased in nutrient concentrations. To understand how SCMs are able to affect nutrient concentrations along a continuum of development and mitigation intensity, we explored a hydrologic and water quality model of SCMs. Through calibration, the model was able to match the distribution of outflow water and both nitrate and ammonium concentrations of a single SCM monitored in Charlotte, NC. SCM inorganic N removal and retention increased with temperature and SCM water depth. When the SCM routines were used at the watershed scale, results showed that increased mitigation of urban impervious surfaces with SCMs led to proportional reductions in total runoff volumes, and annual loads of both nitrate and ammonium. These results have implications for watershed managers looking to protect stream ecosystems through the use of SCMs. Treating urban impervious areas with SCMs can reduce hydrologic record flashiness, which is correlated to stream invertebrate health. Mitigating impervious surfaces with SCMs may be able to reduce nitrogen loads by both reducing total water yield and reducing in-stream N concentrations, although the change in concentrations is likely to be dependent on climatic forcing, the distribution of land use, and design of the SCM. Finally, a management strategy as simple as planting trees may also produce similar reductions in runoff and loads, as results showed lower runoff volumes and lower N concentrations in watersheds with greater tree coverage.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - The effect of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) is becoming increasingly serious in cities. Research on the adaptive planning policies for microthermal environments at the residential block level of cities is thus becoming of greater significance. Based on the cooling effect of planning control elements in residential block areas, the element effects characteristics of water bodies and vegetation distribution on the thermal environment of residential blocks were analyzed by using ENVI-met software. The simulation data analysis showed that the combination of water bodies and vegetation had a synergistic cooling effect. Based on these results, simulations of five effective adaptive measures were carried out step by step in planning scenarios, that is, improving the water bodies with vegetation corridors, the application of high-albedo material on streets, and increasing the number of green patches, east-west green corridors, and north-south green corridors. The results were as follows. First, although each of the five optimization strategies have a certain degree of cooling effect on the entire block, the superposition of each factor had a synergistic effect. Second, different spatial optimization strategies had different cooling ranges for each subzone. The optimization of the north-south green corridor, green patches, and water features corridors were particularly significant for microclimate cooling. The east-west green corridor has a certain influence on a certain range of downwind zones and had an auxiliary cooling effect. The high-albedo material also had a weak overall decrease function for the thermal environment. Finally, the downwind area of the urban creek network had a great impact on cooling intensity, with distance attenuation characteristics; it was also proposed that the comprehensive cooling effect of the green space network with optimized layout was greater than that of any single green space element. The optimization scenario planning research provided a method for improving the scientific distribution of adaptation measures in urban residential blocks.

AB  - Landscape changes can result in habitat fragmentation and reduced landscape connectivity, limiting the ability of animals to move across space and altering infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. In this study, we develop and implement an agent‐based model to assess the impacts of animal movement behavior and landscape structure on disease dynamics. We model a susceptible/infective disease state system applicable to the transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats in the urbanized landscape of coastal southern California. Our agent‐based model incorporates animal movement behavior, pathogen prevalence, transmission probability, and habitat fragmentation to evaluate how these variables influence disease spread in urbanizing landscapes. We performed a sensitivity analysis by simulating the system under 4200 different combinations of model parameters and evaluating disease transmission outcomes. Our model reveals that host movement behavior and response to landscape features play a pivotal role in determining how habitat fragmentation influences disease dynamics. Importantly, interactions among habitat fragmentation and movement had non‐linear and counter‐intuitive effects on disease transmission. For example, the model predicts that an intermediate level of non‐habitat permeability and directionality will result in the highest rates of between‐patch disease transmission. Agent‐based models serve as computational laboratories that provide a powerful approach for quantitatively and visually exploring the role of animal behavior and anthropogenic landscape change on contacts among agents and the spread of disease. Such questions are challenging to study empirically given that it is difficult or impossible to experimentally manipulate actual landscapes and the animals and pathogens that move through them. Modeling the relationship between habitat fragmentation, animal movement behavior, and disease spread will improve understanding of the spread of potentially destructive pathogens through wildlife populations, as well as domestic animals and humans.

TI  - Extent of Alabama's Terrestrial Nature Reserve system in representing ecosystem diversity: A coarse–filter gap analysis
AU  - Billue, Anna Keelin
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Numerous studies reveal that existing nature reserves do not effectively represent ecosystem diversity and biodiversity. In this study, Alabama's public and private reserve lands were analyzed to see how representative they were of biodiversity. The spatial distribution and characteristics of Alabama's nature reserves were examined using gap analysis, a technique used to assess the distribution of nature reserves. In Alabama, a gap analysis that includes public (including Department of Defense) and private nature reserves has not been conducted. This analysis had two objectives: 1) to examine the distribution and characteristics of nature reserves across ecoregions; and 2) to analyze where gaps in the Alabama nature reserve system existed and to characterize the drivers of the identified gaps in nature reserve coverage. GIS shapefiles of reserves were collected. A database featuring the total number of reserves, reserve ecoregion, reserve size, owner type (federal, state, local, landtrust), property type (public, private), and connectivity (distance between reserves) was created. Public property was comprised the majority of all nature reserve land area. However, private parcels were the most common land parcels in the four northeasternmost ecoregions (Interior Plateau, Southwestern Appalachians, Ridge and Valley, Piedmont). The two southernmost ecoregions (Southeastern Plains, Southern Coastal Plain) were predominantly comprised of public parcels. The results indicated that reserve lands cover the Southern Coastal Plain most effectively and Southeastern Plains and Interior Plateau the least. I hypothesized that the distribution of nature reserves based on property and owner type was influenced by race, socioeconomic status, and presence of cities. This study will fill a dearth in research and help researchers, private, state, and federal agencies to make well-informed decisions to set and meet conservation goals and policy.

AB  - The evaluation index system of urban aquatic ecosystem health is of great significance for the assessment and management of urban river networks, and for urban development planning. In this paper, the concept of urban aquatic ecosystem health was analyzed by the relationship between human, city and aquatic ecosystem, and its evaluation index system was established from environmental conditions, ecological construction, and social service. In addition, the weight value of each index was calculated by the analytic hierarchy process, and the grading standard of each index was set. Jiading New City, a typical city of the river network plain area in Yangtze River delta, was selected as the aquatic ecosystem health evaluation sample. The fuzzy comprehensive method was used to evaluate the aquatic ecosystem health of Jiading New City. The results indicated that the water ecosystem health of Jiading New City reached the “good” level. For the criterion level, environmental conditions and ecological construction reached the “good” level, and social services reached the “excellent” level. For the indicator level, most indicators reached “good” and “excellent” levels, but the river complexity and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity are still in the “poor” state, which indicates that the aquatic environment has greatly improved, but the aquatic ecosystem has not been fully restored. Results suggested that river complexity and biodiversity should be increased in urban construction planning. The evaluation index system established in this paper can be used to reflect the urban aquatic ecosystem health conditions in river network plain areas.

AB  - In the urban environment, wildlife faces novel human disturbances in unique temporal patterns. The weekend effect describes that human activities on weekends trigger changes in the environment and impact wildlife negatively. Reduced occurrence, altered behaviors, and/or reduced fitness have been found in birds, ungulates, and meso-carnivores due to the weekend effect. We aimed to investigate if urban bat activity would differ on weekends from weekdays. We analyzed year-round bat acoustic monitoring data collected from two sites near the city center and two sites in the residential area/park complex in the city periphery. We constructed generalized linear models and found that bat activity was significantly lower on weekends as compared to weekdays during spring and summer at the site in the open space near the city center. In contrast, during the same seasons, the sites in the city periphery showed increased bat activity on weekends. Hourly bat activity overnight suggested that bats might move from the city center to the periphery on weekends. We demonstrated the behavioral adaptability in urban wildlife for co-existing with human. We recommend that urban planning should implement practices such as adding new greenspaces and/or preserving old-growth vegetation to form continuous greenways from the city center to the city periphery as corridors to facilitate bat movements and reduce possible human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - In order to integrate urban microclimatic pattern, heat island intensity, land cover and cooling effect of vegetation corridors in a more comprehensive way, both fixed and mobile observations at two types of scale have been made simultaneously in different weather conditions during hot weather in Nanjing, China. Then the air temperature distribution of Nanjing and its impact factor were detected and quantified, and vegetation cooling models were developed in this paper. There was a significant day-to-day variation of urban heat island (UHI), and the average intensity of UHI during the measurement period was 2.0°C. The strong UHI usually occurred around midnight; however, a peak UHI was frequently observed 2-3h after sunset. During daytime, several isolated hot areas were observed next to cooler ones, indicating a negative UHI. The air temperature distributions of the vegetation corridors at mesoscale in the evening were similar to those at micro-scale at noon. The influence of the Purple Mountain was very obvious with the maximum cooling effect up to 3.0°C/100m at microscale and 0.4°C/km at mesoscale. This research indicated that the pattern of the UHI in Nanjing is a function of the climatic conditions, the local topography, the effect of the Purple Mountain and the Yangtze River and the urban characteristics such as land uses, vegetation, building density, traffic loads, construction materials and anthropogenic heat sources, which should be taken into account for urban planning and ecologically comfortable residence. The results have further relevance for environmental implications in a subtropical city on the Yangtze River. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The European Union is significantly investing in the Green Deal that introduces measures to guide Member States to face sustainability and health challenges, especially employing Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban contexts. National governments need to develop appropriate strategies to coordinate local projects, face multiple challenges, and maximize NBS effectiveness. This paper aims to introduce a replicable methodology to integrate NBS into a multi-scale planning process to maximize their cost–benefits. Using Italy as a case study, we mapped three environmental challenges nationwide related to climate change and air pollution, identifying spatial groups of their co-occurrences. These groups serve as functional areas where 24 NBS were ranked for their ecosystem services supply and land cover. The results show eight different spatial groups, with 6% of the national territory showing no challenge, with 42% showing multiple challenges combined simultaneously. Seven NBS were high-performing in all groups: five implementable in permeable land covers (urban forests, infiltration basins, green corridors, large parks, heritage gardens), and two in impervious ones (intensive, semi-intensive green roofs). This work provides a strategic vision at the national scale to quantify and orient budget allocation, while on a municipal scale, the NBS ranking acts as a guideline for specific planning activities based on local issues.

TI  - Social Network Interaction and Behaviors on Recreational Greenways and Their Role in Enhancing Greenway Potential
AU  - Pippi, Luis G.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The urban sprawl, landscape transformation and fragmentation, spatial inequality, gentrification, social fragmentation and isolation have contributed to societal changes in terms of social contact, physical activity and contact with nature. The crux of the problem lies either in the lack of landscape and urban planning which takes into consideration both environmental and social issues, or in the non-implementation of such planning. Recreational greenways have the potential to mitigate these problems, because they connect the landscape systems with human society. They represent a resilient, new and effective democratic space in the urban and suburban areas that provide a myriad of functions: environmental, social, leisure, recreation and tourism. The greenway characteristics can connect people, landscapes and places thus enabling physical environment conditions that allow the occurrence of social ties, bridges and interactions among users and actors. However, many scholars have confirmed the necessity of more greenway studies that deal with social factors such as interaction, social ties and bridges and behavior. To understand the recreational greenways it is important to recognize the social life linked to them by understanding the relationship between greenway characteristics, social interactions and behaviors. These aspects are crucial to enhance the efficacy of such ecological networks. The main purpose of this study is to describe the social interaction that arises from the greenway environments, by analyzing the different types of social tie and bridge interactions that take place on the recreational greenways. The study hypothesized that recreational greenways create an environment that fosters social networks within the community, which affect and are affected by social interaction, behavior, ties/bridges and cohesion. The type of greenway characteristics may influence the type of user, type of actor, pattern of use and behavior, promoting social integration to differing degrees and among different types of people. Two greenway case studies with the highest volume of use in Cary, NC, were selected in an attempt to provide vital information regarding the capacity of recreational greenways to create and promote social interaction. Multi-methods were utilized, including greenway characteristics audit, social characteristic audit, behavior mapping, standardized survey questionnaire and mapping exercise. This protocol was effective for analyzing interaction, behavior and social ties and bridges on recreational greenways and to understand the relationship between the social network aspects and the greenway characteristics. The data were analyzed with GIS and the use of descriptive statistics and data mining analysis, including decision tree, clustering and regression for complex and large data sets, to present the quantitative and qualitative data that were analyzed to test the research hypotheses and assumptions. The results provided positive insights in terms of correlation of different greenway characteristics and different social network features. The greenway has the potential to bring people together as it provides a matrix of inner and intra interactions between users and actors. The study revealed that people tend to utilize the greenways for socialization pursuits with different types and levels, and may contribute to the development of successful greenway physical environments to promote the positive social network interaction and behaviors. The greenway structural network connection and features when well-designed contribute to social events and contacts, enhancing the quality of life and well-being of its residents. The findings provided useful knowledge for the development of new design norms and to find alternatives that encourage and support social integration and have an impact on social networks and connections, promoting the essential conditions for the establishment of social capital, gathering, lingering and social tie/bridge interactions. The results of this study provided some useful directions for the design guidelines of successful greenways with more functional and efficient characteristics.

AB  - Alba is a town of over 30 000 inhabitants located along the Tanaro River (Piedmont, northwestern Italy) and is famous for its wine and white truffles. Many important industries and companies are based in Alba, including the famous confectionery group Ferrero.The town suffered considerably from a flood that occurred on 5-6 November 1994. Forty-eight percent of the urban area was inundated, causing severe damage and killing nine people. After the flood, the Alba area was analysed in detail to determine the reasons for its vulnerability.Information on serious floods in this area since 1800 was gathered from official records, state technical office reports, unpublished documents in the municipal archives, and articles published in local and national newspapers. Maps, plans and aerial photographs (since 1954) were examined to reconstruct Alba's urban development over the last two centuries and the planform changes of the Tanaro River.The results were compared with the effects of the November 1994 flood, which was mapped from aerial photographs taken immediately after the flood, field surveys and eyewitness reports.The territory of Alba was subdivided into six categories: residential; public service; industrial, commercial and hotels; sports areas, utilities and standards (public gardens, parks, athletics grounds, private and public sport clubs); aggregate plants and dumps; and agriculture and riverine strip. The six categories were then grouped into three classes with different flooding-vulnerability levels according to various parameters. Using GIS, the three river corridors along the Tanaro identified by the Autorità di Bacino del Fiume Po were overlaid on the three classes to produce a final map of the risk areas.This study shows that the historic floods and their dynamics have not been duly considered in the land-use planning of Alba. The zones that were most heavily damaged in the 1994 flood were those that were frequently affected in the past and sites of more recent urbanisation. Despite recurrent severe flooding of the Tanaro River and its tributaries, areas along the riverbed and its paleochannels have been increasingly used for infrastructure and building (e.g., roads, a municipal dump, a prison, natural aggregate plants, a nomad camp), which has often interfered with the natural spread of the floodwaters. Since the 1994 flood, many remedial projects have been completed along the Tanaro and its tributaries, including levees, bank protection, concrete walls and floodway channels. In spite of these costly projects, some areas remain at high risk for flooding.The method used, which considered historical data, river corridors identified by hydraulic calculations, geomorphological aspects and land-use planning, can indicate with good accuracy flood-prone areas and in consequence to be an useful tool for the coherent planning of urban expansion and the mitigation of flood risk.

TI  - Grassland communities of urban open spaces in Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa
AU  - Dingaan, Mamokete N V
AU  - du Preez, Pieter J
T2  - Koedoe
AB  - Natural vegetation in urban environments is greatly impacted by human activities and it is in constant threat of degradation and destruction as a result of urbanisation. This vegetation, although fragmented, serves an important ecological function and needs to be properly managed and conserved. Studies on urban vegetation are lacking in South Africa, with only a handful having been carried out since the end of the last century. This study was initiated to identify, classify and describe the grassland communities of the urban open spaces in Bloemfontein. Relevés were compiled in 61 sample plots, where species present and habitat information were recorded. Care was taken to restrict sample plots to vegetation in pristine condition, wherever possible, and severely degraded stands were avoided. A two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed two distinct major communities, seven communities and four sub-communities. Both detrended and canonical correspondence analyses indicated the vegetation units to be associated with soil texture and pH, although biotic factors such as overgrazing, burning and mowing also influence the composition of the vegetation. The proper management and conservation of urban open spaces requires in-depth knowledge of the spatial distribution, floristic, structural and functional compositions within the major vegetation types in this environment. The present study further contributed towards formulating ways for the proper management, utilisation and functioning of the open spaces within the Bloemfontein area. Conservation implications: The Grassland Biome of South Africa is poorly conserved, mainly because of its status as an agricultural hub of the country. The preservation of natural and semi-natural forms of urban vegetation is important because such vegetation, although often disturbed and degraded, could form dispersal corridors between peri-urban and rural vegetation.

AB  - Humans have been dominating the urban areas with their abilities and unfavourably tend to have affected other living creatures. This paper directed how to acquire a place in the cities for creating opportunities for birds that live in the cities to live together with us. Several methods were applied emphasizing on Urban Rapid Biodiversity Assessment (RBA) which was adjusted for tropical environments. Vegetation structure, Domain value and the diversity of vascular plants are components determining the quality preference for birds. Results indicated that stream corridors were the best accommodating spaces with an average number of vascular plants was 27; the average number of existing vegetation structures amounted up to 7.00; the average of the total Domain values of all vegetation structures excluding buildings was 24.00 and the average of the total Domain value of all trees was 11.00. Furthermore there were as well empty fields, road corridors, institutional space, green spaces for the public, urban farms and wetlands. The quality of spaces for city birds could be more specific by adding additional filtering of size, ownership, and a development plan. Networking with natural areas would be more feasible if more space were included. Available spaces would be greater when the state of ownership was not limited, despite public spaces were much easier to manage.

TI  - Non-Governmental Organizations and the Sustainability of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Peru: An Analysis of Networks and Discourses
AU  - Aponte, Walter V. Castro
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of employment and income generation has been recognized worldwide. In Peru, SMEs are responsible for 85% of the employment at the national level and they represent 98% of the total companies registered. Around 12% of SMEs, organized in associations, clusters, and cooperatives or as single companies, are dedicated to productive actives; the others are engaged in commercial and services activities. However, next to their positive economic role, SMEs are also responsible for significant disturbances of nature, environmental degradation and threats to human health. Environmental pollution related to the increase of productive activities has become evident in Peru and the entire region of Latin America.The thesis aims to provide a better understanding of the changing roles of NGOs in promoting sustainability of SMEs in Peru, using the perspectives of networks and discourses. It focuses on three domains, which together are characteristic for promoting of SME sustainability in Peru: organic production (the first case study), business social responsibility (the second cases study) and sustainable production (the third case study). Three research questions have been outlined for this research: First, what are the networks of NGOs promoting sustainability of SMEs involved in the domains of organic production, business social responsibility and sustainable production in Peru, and what are the main changes in time in these networks? Second, what are the main discourses fostering sustainability that prevail and are articulated in these networks of NGOs and what are the main changes in time in these discourses? And finally, how to understand and assess the actual, new and potential roles of NGOs in promoting sustainability of SMEs in terms of network society theory and ecological modernization theory?In this study the universe of NGOs is narrowed to NGOs operating in Peru that provide support (a) to medium and small scale producers and producer associations to bring organic products to local and global markets, (b) to urban and rural small scale enterprises to adopt cleaner production and appropriate technologies, and/or (c) to SMEs to upgrade social and environmental standards within value chains involving large companies. Some SMEs are concentrated in the main cities of Peru such as Trujillo, Arequipa and Lima, while other SMEs, such as organic food producers, are spread all over the country. In any case, SMEs under this research have collaboration ties with the NGOs to be studied. The research questions were investigated by means of more than 28 interviews with representatives of local NGOs, international NGOs, local SMEs and the national government, carried out in the period of 2006 to 2010. Additionally, documents and internet sources were consulted.The networks involved in promoting the sustainability of SMEs are: the agro-ecological network, the organic market network and the ecological farming network in the first case study; the social justice network and the business network in the second case study; and the eco-efficiency network, the appropriate technology network, the cleaner technology network, the technological innovation network and the urban cleaner production network in the third case study.The main actors identified in the networks of the organic production domain are: the Ecological Agriculture Network of Peru (RAE Peru), Grupo Ecologica Peru and the National Ecological Producers Association (ANPE). RAE Peru consists of 16 individual NGOs operating throughout Peru and has led several initiatives (e.g. Biocanastas, Bioferias, Biostores) to develop the organic market in Peru. Grupo Ecologica Peru consists of 5 NGOs and 24 producers, including associations and individual producers, and it commercializes organic products at local competitive markets (e.g. the Bioferia Miraflores farmers’ market) and provides the supply of organic food to supermarkets. ANPE Peru consists of 22 organic small scale producer associations (including small food processers and family small-scale enterprises). ANPE’s constituencies produce and commercialize organic food in 13 farmers’ markets throughout the country.The main actors identified in the business social responsibility networks are: the Labor Advisory Council of Peru (CEDAL), the Center of Studies for Development and Participation (CEDEP) and Peru 2021. CEDAL and CEDEP promote business social responsibility for urban and rural small enterprises in Peru in order to meet national regulation and international standards on labor rights and good environmental practices. CEDAL has been collaborating with 60 small enterprises of garment and handy craft makers, organized in clusters, who commercialize their products directly to consumers or business intermediaries oriented at domestic and foreign markets. CEDEP collaborates with small and medium-sized agri-industries, small garment workshops, shoemakers, metal workshops and bakeries to adopt business social responsibility principles by improving working conditions for their employees and sustainable production practices. Peru 2021 collaborates only with SMEs that are providers of larger companies in value chains promoting social and environmental standards.The main actors involved in the sustainable production networks are: the Eco-efficiency and Social Responsibility Center (CER), the Institute for the Transfer of Technology for Marginal Sectors (ITACAB), the National Council of Science and Technology (CONCYTEC), the Centers of Technological Innovation (CITEs) and the Peruvian Institute of Social Economy (IPES). While CER, IPES and most of CITEs are NGOs, ITACAB and CONCYTEC are (inter)governmental agencies. CER provides consultancy for small scale suppliers of larger domestic companies and single SMEs exporting to international markets. Through the projects EcoADEX, EcoHotels and EcoParks CER aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase eco-efficiency, optimize production and services processes and reduce operation costs in SMEs. ITACAB promotes technological transfer to small scale rural enterprises through the Center for Technological Transferring Resources. CONCYTEC promotes technological transfer for SMEs but it is currently dispersed into several institutional programmes. CITEs provide production technologies services to SMEs. In total there are 13 CITEs throughout Peru, each one specialized in particular type of products (e.g. leather and shoemaking, wood and furniture, wine and horticulture, tropical fruits and medicinal plants, garment, agro-industry, textile, logistic and tracing, software and forest wood). Finally, IPES promotes cleaner technologies in small scale industries and workshops located in urban areas. During the last year, IPES is focusing on the establishing of recycling SMEs of electronic waste. As this overview shows, in the sustainable production domain, not only NGOs perform central roles but also governmental agencies. In some cases, quite close cooperation occurs between NGOs and governmental agencies.In all three cases, networks of sustainability of SMEs are structured as interlinked platforms operating at local, national, Latin American and global level. For instance, in the organic production networks the Bioferias are at the local level, the Peruvian Agroecological Consortium at the national level, MAELA and GALCI at Latin American level and IFOAM at global level. Platforms include civil society, market and state actors. For instance, in the business social responsibility networks the civil society actors are CEDEP and CEDAL, in the organic production networks the market actors are the small scale enterprises affiliated with ANPE and Grupo Ecologica Peru, and in the sustainable production networks the state actors are CONCYTEC (governmental agency), ITACAB (inter-governmental agency) and the CITEs central office (OTCIT). Coordination and channeling of resources in the network platforms are performed by key actors, such as RAE Peru, Grupo Ecologica Peru, ANPE, Peru 2021, CEDAL, CEDEP, CER, CONCYTEC, ITACAB, OTCIT and IPES.The ten networks are composed by diverse types of NGOs. Next to conventional NGOs as key actors, producer NGOs, market NGOs, business NGOs, technocratic NGOs and government organized NGOs (GONGOs) have emerged. Although NGOs are central in most networks, (inter)governmental agencies (GONGOs) are also central in the cleaner technology network, the appropriate technology network and the technological innovation network. CONCYTEC, ITACAB and the CITES’ central office (OTCIT) are agencies that are part of the governmental structure, but they operate in practice pretty much as NGOs. Hence, NGOs and these (inter) governmental agencies perform similar roles in the networks, compete for funding and operate projects funded by international cooperation agencies. Therefore, the (inter)governmental agencies (GONGOs) that are part of these networks of sustainability of SMEs has been found out to be less effective in promoting sustainability of SMEs than more typical NGOs. As a result of this diversification of NGOs the struggle for leading positions in the network platforms and the competition for scarce funding and operate projects of international cooperation agencies have also intensified. This diversification of NGOs and, above all, the increasing of service-like NGOs aim to fulfill the business growth and market demands of SMEs in collaborating with market actors. Hence, new types of NGOs emerge to fulfill market demands.The discourses that NGOs and SMEs endorse in the networks of sustainability of SMEs are: market adaptation, market access or market democratization in the first case study; business upgrading and corporate responsibility in the second case study; and cleaner production and appropriate technology in the third case study. NGOs and SMEs involved in the networks of organic production endorse one of the following three discourses: market adaptation, market access or market democratization. The main storyline of the first discourse is that NGOs and small scale producers are forced to get new capacities and to adapt to the free market. Small scale producers do not have the competences to adapt to the free market by themselves, and NGOs play a crucial role in assisting them. The main storyline of the second discourse is that small scale producers are eager to move to competitive markets. Support is needed from specialized agents in managerial and technological issues to organize supply to competitive local and international organic markets. The main storyline of the last discourse is the prioritization of making the organic market also interesting for low and medium income consumers. Rather than adapt or access to the free market, small scale producers intend to build up a fair relationship with the market by making organic products available to all income groups.NGOs and SMEs in the business social responsibility networks endorse one of the following two discourses: business upgrading or corporate responsibility. In the first discourse, business social responsibility is seen as a strategy to match economic and social rights with sustainability of small scale enterprises. Connecting small scale enterprises with larger companies and influencing them to become sustainable is central in the discourse. In the second discourse, business social responsibility is seen as a business strategy that contributes to sustainability of larger companies and their supply value chains. Only small providers of large profitable value chains have the capacity to adopt social and environmental standards.NGOs and SMEs involved in the networks of sustainable production endorse one of the following two discourses: cleaner production or appropriate technology. In the first discourse, cleaner production is seen as a business strategy to make SME production more efficient and sustainable. Allocating the most up-to-date modern technology is considered as the best way to reduce environmental impacts and increase competitiveness. The discourse focuses on SMEs that are well established in the local market and have the capacities to reach international markets. In the second discourse, appropriate technology is seen as tailor-made technology adjusted to the needs of SMEs, particularly of micro and small enterprises. Low capital, small scale and suitable technology for the local social, economic and cultural setting are central in the discourse. The discourse highlights the use of renewable energy, development of local markets and poverty fighting.The seven discourses emphasize either market justice or sustainable market. This means that the discourses are different in their position towards social movement and the market. The discourses of sustainability of SMEs have evolved from long-standing antagonist discourses: the liberal market discourse on one hand and the social movement discourse on the other hand, which can be considered as the ‘mother’ discourses of the discourses of sustainability of SMEs. While the cleaner production discourse and the corporate responsibility discourse have their origins in the liberal market discourse, the market democratization discourse, the market adaptation discourse, the market access discourse, the business upgrading discourse and the appropriate technology discourse have their origins in the social movement discourse. Hence, the discourses of sustainability of SMEs share views with their mother discourses. Only, the market access discourse strongly diverges from its origins. The difference between market justice discourses and sustainable market discourses has to do with their interpretation of environmental reform and sustainability.In sum, the identified changes are expressed in new roles for NGOs. Next to the usual ‘watchdog’ roles, NGOs are developing roles of ‘helper’ in order to answer to the market needs of SMEs. The new roles are performed not only by new types of NGOs but also by ‘reoriented’ conventional NGOs. Consequently, NGOs have become market agents as a result of their new roles. Finally, the findings contribute to the theoretical debates on network society theory and ecological modernization theory. The analysis of networks promoting sustainability of SMEs helps to understand more deeply the way non-state actors cooperate, and challenges Castells’ scheme of space of flows versus space of place. Both spaces are connected and integrated in aiming for sustainability. Actors use rationalities, logics and power resources related to both spaces. Amending ecological modernization theory, the analysis suggests that it is needed to consider both ecological rationality and social rationality in order to advance environmental reform of SMEs in developing countries. The research also sheds light of issues of power. NGOs are becoming more collaborative and less confrontational, more conciliatory and less dogmatic towards market actors, but they remain rather conflictive and competitive towards fellow NGOs. Power of SMEs is not acknowledged in most discourses. However, SMEs show their power either by accepting or denying engage to the networks, either by collaborating or pressuring key actors and either by subscribing or being indifferent to the discourses. This power of SMEs pushes the networks to become more inclusive, participatory and valuable for SMEs. It rests on the capacity to be anchored within local social networks.

TI  - A study on the landscape characters of the vegetation in Baiyunshan scenic sports
AU  - Wang, Hua Yong
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Baiyunshan, the biggest urban forest in Guangzhou, plays an important role in pro-moting urban sustainabIe development, and in improving urban environment. Based on the digitized map of vegetation in Baiyunshan scenic spots, the vegetational landscape charac-teristics in Baiyunshan including landscape pattern and spatial heterogeneity were studied systematically after achieving the perimeters and areas of the patches of all the landscape elements by using graphics interchange software.According to the physiognomy of the vegetationaI communities, five landscape ele-ment types, i.e. evergreen coniferous forest, evergreen coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, meadows with sparse trees and orchard were classi-fied by using vegetional approach of land attribute classification in landscape ecology then on basis of the upper layer tree's life form of vegetionaI landscape, 29 patch types were di-vided. The total area in Baiyunshan is 32.2658 km~2, and the total perimeter is 428.9047 km,There were 200 patches in the studied region, and the largest one was 3.3250 km~2, which was 1583 times of the smallest one (0.0021km~2), and the longest one was 26.8472km,which was 118 times of the shortest one (0.2269km). This showed that the difference of patch areas and perimeters were very large. Vegetaional landscape dominates in the vegeta tional landscape of Baiyunshan absolutely, the total areas and total perimeters of the vegeta-tional landscape patches are 77.58 percent and 75.02 percent of the whole landscape of Baiyunshan, respectively, with the biggest patch number (64) and the largest total patch area (12.7l97km~2). Shape indices, including fractal dimension (1.34), shape index (21.30) and elongation index (75.51) of the Baiyunshan landscape were higher than those of all the landscape elements and all the patch types. The shapes of all the patches were regular in the area, and the difference of patches in the same types was very small, and selfsimilarity was obvious. The vegetational landscape in the area studied is grain landscape now; the grain structure indicated the pattern of more small patches and less big ones in number, and the pattern of evenness in area. Shannon-Wiener index of evergreen coniferous forest, evergreen coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, others and total landscape were 0.771, 0.654, 4.085, 0.484, 4.019, respectively; Simpson index were 0.350, 0.269, 0.923, 0.188, 0.904, ecological dominance were 0.229, 0.346, 0.439, 0.5l6,0.835. The landscape diversity index of the evergreen broad-leaved forest type was highest,whose patch types were rich, and the differences in patch area were distinct. The intensity of human activities was even in the studied region and the degree of the landscape frag-mentation is little. The evergreen broad-leaved forest type had the smallest fragmentation.Its patch density is 5.032 .km~(-2), the patch area per area is 0.394km~2 .km~(-2), the patch number in landscape total area is 1.984 .km~(-2). The landscape heterogeneity of the landscape element types in Baiyunshan was analyzed using linear sampling method of informatics. Resultsshowed that the whole landscape heterogeneity was rich, and had close affinity with the spatial distribution of the landscape elements and patch types. Evergreen broad-leaved for-est type was characterized by highest relative frequency and even information content,showing a highest heterogeneous spatial pattern, which is the matrix of the whole landscape,and plays a decisive role in improving the landscape structures and ecological changes in Baiyunshan. The effect and function of the corridor, the relation between landscape and scale, and the dynamics of the vegetational patches in Baiyunshan were also discussed. This study can provide systematic information and a theoretical basis for the sustainable utiliza-tion and exploitation of the vegetational landscape resources in Baiyunshan scenic spots.

TI  - The importance of biodiversity in private gardens relative to public green spaces and the synergistic effects of garden connectivity
AU  - Sperling, Corinne D.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban ecology, or the study of relationships among plants, animals and humans in cities, is an interdisciplinary science. It integrates issues of environmental concern, for example, biodiversity and ecological health, with the practices of a sample of urban dwellers. Private backgardens and public urban green spaces (parkettes) in the Greater Toronto Area were sampled and compared with respect to plant diversity and environmental heterogeneity. With a greater number of microhabitats and higher plant species richness than public parkettes, private backgardens were found to be remarkable hotspots of biodiversity and environmental heterogeneity. A backgarden microcosm experiment looked at the interaction of structural features of backgardens and the incidental recruitment of invertebrates, seeds, and plants. These small supplements of space served as habitats for recruitment of plants and seeds as it was determined that invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment and above-ground vegetation growth were enhanced regardless of soil or grass substrate treatment in microcosms. Backgarden characteristics, specifically the number of woody plants (trees and shrubs) and the number of plant species significantly predicted seed recruitment and winged invertebrate visitation, respectively, to microcosms. Lastly, a spatial analysis evaluated local and regional green space composition and heterogeneity of the urban landscape. Nearly 74% of the Greater Toronto Area is comprised of green space, however, more than 50% is made up of low vegetation (i.e., grass and herbaceous ground cover). Approximately 8% of the urban landscape was appraised as private backgardens; 6% of the urban landscape, conservatively, was estimated as backgarden green space. The percent green space composition of backgardens differed between neighbourhoods, and based on different human population densities, while neighbours were found to be statistically similar in their backgarden percent green space composition. This research study thus promotes citizen science and ecological practices within backgardens to enhance urban biodiversity and regional green space connectivity.

TI  - The distribution and habitat preferences of bats in a temperate urban landscape
AU  - Lintott, P. R.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Urbanisation is a key driver in the loss, fragmentation and modification of natural habitats resulting in the global loss of biodiversity. As the human population, and consequently the rate of urbanisation, continues to increase exponentially it is important to understand how to sustain and enhance biodiversity within the built environment. Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet relatively little is known of how its composition and spatial configuration can influence species presence or foraging activities. It is therefore necessary to examine habitat use and biodiversity patterns at multiple spatial scales to fully understand how species are responding to the urban matrix. There are few other orders of animals that are as strongly associated with people as bats (Chiroptera); for some bat species human habitations provide roosts and adaptations of the environment provide food sources. However bat species richness generally declines with increasing urbanisation indicating that many species are not able to persist in highly urbanised areas. In this thesis, I show that the behaviour, habitat preferences, and distribution of bats are strongly influenced by the built environment at both a local and landscape scale. Although many animal species are known to exhibit sex differences in habitat use, adaptability to the urban landscape is commonly examined at the species level without consideration of potential intraspecific differences. I found that female Pipistrellus pygmaeus show greater selectivity in foraging locations within urban woodland in comparison to males at both a local and landscape scale. There was a lower probability of finding females within woodlands which were poorly connected, highly cluttered, with a high edge: interior ratio and fewer mature trees. The results have important implications for our understanding of how to manage areas for breeding females and highlight the need to supplement acoustic monitoring with trapping data to assess sex differences in habitat use. Determining how morphological or behavioural traits can influence species adaptability to the built environment may enable us to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The morphological similarities between P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus suggest that both species should respond similarly to the urban matrix, however I found differential habitat use occurring within a variety of urban habitats (e.g. woodland and waterways) and at a landscape scale. In urban woodland there was a higher probability of P. pygmaeus activity relative to P. pipistrellus in woodlands with low clutter and understory cover which were surrounded by low levels of built environment. Many bat species are strongly associated with aquatic or adjacent riparian habitats yet we know little about the utilisation of urban waterways by bats. After surveying urban waterways throughout the UK, I was able to show that the built environment can negatively affect a variety of bat species from the riparian zone up to 3km from a waterway. This indicates that beneficial urban waterway rehabilitation schemes for bats require management at multiple spatial scales, from retaining a vegetated riparian zone at the local scale to highlighting the necessity for conservation funding to be spent on the implementation of landscape scale environmental improvement schemes that encompass the entire urban matrix. Undertaking surveys to confirm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difficult, particularly for elusive species such as bats. I was able to demonstrate a variety of ways to increase surveying efficiency (e.g. the use of an acoustic lure to increase bat-capture rate) and a significant relationship between bat activity and the relative abundance of certain species of bat which can maximise the knowledge of diversity in an area whilst minimising wildlife disturbances. Urbanisation has also had strong negative effects on many insect groups, such as moths, which are important components of the diets of many bat species. I found that woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscapes in determining the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages within urban woodland. This indicates that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be more beneficial for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. The findings presented in this thesis have important implications for our understanding of the adaptability of species to the built environment and for the management and monitoring of bat populations. It also highlights that even common bat species are negatively affected by urbanisation and much greater attention should be paid to securing their future within the urban landscape.

TI  - Urban Ecology; Its Nature and Challenges
T2  - Urban Ecology
AB  - Today, 55% of the world's human population lives in urban areas. By 2030, up to 90% of the global human population will live in cities and the global population is expected to increase by 68% by 2050. Although land cover categorized as "urban" is a relatively small fraction of the total surface of the Earth, urban areas are major driving forces in global environmental change, habitat loss, threats to biodiversity, and the loss of terrestrial carbon stored in vegetation biomass. These and many other factors highlight the need to understand the broad-scale impacts of urban expansion as it effects the ecological interactions between humans, wildlife and plant communities. In a series of essays by leading experts this book defines urban ecology, and provides much-needed focus on the main issues of this increasingly important subdiscipline such as the impacts of invasive species, protecting pollinators in urban environments, the green cities movement and ecological corridors. The book stresses the importance of understanding ecological forces and ecosystem services in urban areas and the integration of ecological concepts in urban planning and design. The creation of urban green spaces is critical to the future of urban areas, enhancing human social organization, human health and quality of life. Urban ecology is becoming a foundational component of many degree programs in universities worldwide and this book will be of great interest to students and researchers in ecology and conservation science, and those involved in urban planning and urban environmental management.

TI  - Best management practices for amphibians and reptiles in urban and rural environments in British Columbia
T2  - Canadian Research Index
AB  - Amphibians & reptiles are an ecologically important group of animals that require additional protection in British Columbia, especially in rural & urban environments. This report describes best management practices (BMPs) designed to help maintain the viability of native amphibian & reptile populations in areas subject to land development activities in rural & urban areas of the province. It begins with background on the rationale & needs for protecting amphibians & reptiles, public perceptions of those species, factors affecting population viability, compatibility of amphibians & reptiles with urban environments, and opportunities for protection & management. Section 3 is a literature review of habitat protection practices, habitat restoration & enhancement, habitat connectivity & barriers to movement (including road crossing structures), management practices for pollution control & hydrology, controlling access to habitats, and management of non-native species. Section 4 presents a concise description of the status, distribution, & important life history traits of species in the province and their compatibility with urban & rural environments. The BMPs for amphibians & reptiles are presented in sections 5 & 6 and include guidelines specific to various regions of the province. Finally, strategies for monitoring BMP effectiveness and for public education & stewardship are presented. Includes glossary. The appendix contains detailed species accounts with information on provincial status & distribution, life history & habitat requirements, and their compatibility with urban & rural environments.

TI  - The river in the urban landscape: Landscape ecological principles for the design of riverfronts
AU  - Penteado, Homero M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - River corridors have become important resources for the preservation of nature and habitat restoration of because they remain a continuous natural feature within urban landscapes. This study develops riverfront design principles to enhance habitats and species diversity, restore hydrological processes, and provide opportunities for human activities. The design principles are developed from an assessment of literature on waterfront design and landscape ecology, and a case study that integrates ecological and human concerns. The resulting principles were applied to a riverfront in Guelph, Ontario, to illustrate and understand their usefulness. Mitigation and restoration measures could be applied to enhance the ecological function of the riverfront. The principles were applied to re-establish the lost connectivity by enhancing vegetation on the riverbanks and part of the floodplain, and by removing barriers. In some sites, the principles could not be applied because of the presence of buildings. Their removal would represent a costly initiative and a loss of cultural landmarks. The design principles are considered useful for designers and planners because they have the potential to equip professionals with tools to establish and create healthier natural systems, while addressing human needs in riverfront environments.

TI  - Dispersal behavior and connectivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers in the North Carolina sandhills
AU  - Trainor, Anne Maura
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Human activities are degrading natural ecosystems globally, thus eroding biological diversity and reducing wildlife populations. One prominent example is the Red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) which is a federally endangered, cooperative breeding species endemic to highly-fragmented longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests in the southeastern United States. The persistence of P. borealis is dependent upon managing longleaf pine forests to facilitate prospecting and dispersal movements and thus connecting populations.My overall research objective was to interrelate spatial environmental data and animal movement behaviors in order to evaluate P. borealis  habitat connectivity. First, I developed a novel method to empirically estimate and validate landscape resistance surfaces using mark-recapture and radio-telemetry data. I then applied this method to determine how prospecting movements were influenced by both environmental and conspecific cues during forays. The detail prospecting and dispersal data was then combined with detailed data on forest structure to estimate habitat connectivity across the landscape. Finally, I evaluate if P. borealis connectivity is positively impacted by private landowners involvement in a voluntary incentive-based agreement. My results illustrated with an empirically-derived resistance surface that P. borealis are influenced by subtle changes in vegetation structure and land-use activities. The resistance surface successfully predicted most of the short-distance dispersal events. In addition, prospecting individuals’ are cueing into environmental characteristics between breeding sites and complex social dynamics at potential breeding sites. When the network model was correlated with observed dispersal events, the abrupt transition from highly connected to disconnected territories provides insight into habitat connectivity within and between habitat patches. This approach showed that highly connected territories reside within managed areas of continuous forest but territories on private properties are isolated from managed lands and each other by agriculture or development. However, voluntary incentive-based conservation programs on private land are increasing the connectivity of P. borealis populations by managing and restoring habitat on private property.

TI  - Ecological and Epidemiological Consequences of Rapid Urbanisation at Wildlife-Livestock-Human Interfaces
AU  - Hassell, James Mark
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Urbanization is characterized by rapid intensification of agriculture, socioeconomic change, and ecological fragmentation, which can have profound impacts on the distributional ecology of host populations and epidemiology of infectious disease within them. In this thesis, results from a large-scale field study conducted in Nairobi, Kenya are used to explore how anthropogenic and ecological changes associated with urbanisation influence the structure of sympatric wildlife, livestock and human host populations, and dictate bacterial epidemiology in wildlife hosts. As likely points of contact (and thus parasite transmission) between vertebrate wildlife, livestock, and humans, household ‘interfaces’ were chosen as sampling units. The ecological and sociological status of households was characterised through ecological surveys, questionnaire data and geospatial mapping, and faecal samples were collected from wildlife occurring within the household compound, and livestock and human inhabitants. Escherichia coli was isolated from faecal samples, and characterised both phenotypically (through antimicrobial sensitivity testing) and genetically (through whole genome sequencing). In the first part of this thesis I consider the influence of urban land-use change on the structure of host populations at household interfaces. Using unsupervised machine learning I describe variation in the host composition of wildlife-livestock human interfaces and, through multivariate regression analysis, demonstrate that citywide variation in ecological and anthropogenic factors (such as biotic habitat diversity and wealth) drive structural changes in wildlife, livestock and human populations across the urban landscape of Nairobi. Utilising commensal E. coli as an exemplar organism, I proceed to explore epidemiological connectivity between wildlife, livestock and humans at household interfaces, and link epidemiological processes in urban wildlife to their drivers across the urban landscape. Firstly, I explore the epidemiology of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistant (AMR)-E. coli in urban wildlife in Nairobi. Comparing E. coli isolates in wildlife to livestock, humans and the environment, I find that E. coli isolated from wildlife have a lower diversity of resistance phenotypes, and are thus an unlikely source of AMR. At household interfaces, I find evidence of AMR-E. coli exchange between rodents/seed-eating birds, and cattle and humans, and demonstrate that transmission is facilitated through anthropogenic resource provision in households. Next, utilising high resolution sequencing data, I explore the response of microbial communities in wildlife hosts to urban land-use change. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that communities of bacterial mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are deterministically structured, according to changes in host community structure. I show that the diversity of genes encoding virulence and AMR in avian-borne E. coli is determined by variation in the distribution and density of birds, livestock and humans at household interfaces, and that this varies along gradients of urbanisation. To conclude, I relate the findings in this thesis across multiple scales, linking the influence of abiotic factors such as habitat alteration and socioeconomics to host community structure at household interfaces and the epidemiology of wildlife-borne E. coli. Using this framework, I suggest future directions for research on urban disease emergence, and discuss implications of my findings for public health and urban planning.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Management on Ecosystem Services
AU  - Van Oudenhoven, Alexander P.E.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Mensen hebben een groot deel van het aardoppervlak veranderd om in de groeiende vraag naar leefruimte en voedsel, drinkwater en andere natuurlijke hulpbronnen te voorzien. Mijn proefschrift onderzoekt de effecten van landbeheer op ecosysteemdiensten. Landbeheer betreft de menselijke activiteiten die landgebruik ondersteunen. Enkele voorbeelden zijn het toepassen van bestrijdingsmiddelen of irrigatie om de voedselproductie te verhogen, de aanleg van infrastructuur om ecotoerisme te bevorderen en het verwijderen van ongewenste plantensoorten om inheemse biodiversiteit te beschermen. Ecosysteemdiensten zijn de bijdragen van ecosystemen aan het menselijk welzijn. Ze zijn uitgegroeid tot een populair concept om de gevolgen aan te tonen van biodiversiteitsverlies en landdegradatie. Echter, de wereldwijde aantasting en transformatie van ecosystemen ten behoeve van monofunctioneel landgebruik suggereren dat beheerders en beleidsmakers beperkt inzicht hebben in de economische en sociale gevolgen van landgebruik. Inzicht in de effecten van beheer op ecosysteemdiensten draagt bij aan beter begrip van de gevolgen van beleidsvorming en landgebruiksbeslissingen. Huidig beheer is grotendeels gebaseerd op slecht geverifieerde veronderstellingen. Derhalve heeft mijn proefschrift tot doel om de effecten van beheer op de levering van ecosysteemdiensten te kwantificeren.Om dit onderzoeksdoel te bereiken, heb ik een op indicatoren gestoelde methodologie ontwikkeld. Een nieuw ontwikkeld raamwerk voor systematische indicatorselectie staat centraal in de studie (Hoofdstuk 2). Het raamwerk beschouwt ‘beheer’ als de belangrijkste drijvende kracht en onderscheidt verder ecologische eigenschappen, ecosysteemfuncties en -diensten. Ecologische eigenschappen zijn bijvoorbeeld bodemkenmerken, nutriëntenkringlopen en biologische diversiteit. Deze eigenschappen ondersteunen de ecosysteemfunctie, oftewel de capaciteit van het ecosysteem om ecosysteemdiensten te bieden. Deze capaciteit geeft de potentiele levering van ecosysteemdiensten aan en wordt geanalyseerd met zogenaamde 'state-indicatoren'. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn de beschikbare visstand, potentiele koolstofopslag en bezoekerscapaciteit. Of deze capaciteit daadwerkelijk wordt benut, oftewel wordt ‘omgezet’ in een ecosysteemdienst, hangt af van vele factoren, zoals toegankelijkheid van een gebied, de vraag naar ecosysteemdiensten en besluitvorming omtrent beheer. 'Performance-indicatoren' worden gebruikt om de feitelijke levering van ecosysteemdiensten te kwantificeren. Hoofdstuk 2 identificeert criteria om de ecosysteemdienstindicatoren en het selectieproces te evalueren. Het selectieproces moet flexibel en consistent te zijn, terwijl de indicatoren veelomvattend, meetbaar in relatie tot tijd en ruimte, schaalbaar en kwantificeerbaar dienen te zijn. De bruikbaarheid van een indicator hangt tevens af van databeschikbaarheid, de geloofwaardigheid en toepasbaarheid op meerdere gebieden. Het raamwerk werd toegepast in drie case studies, variërend van landschap- tot bioomniveau: in Nationaal Landschap 'Het Groene Woud' in Noord Brabant (Hoofdstuk 3), mangrovesystemen in Java, Indonesië (Hoofdstuk 4), en voor ‘rangelands’ op globale schaal (Hoofdstuk 5). De doelstelling van de case study in Hoofdstuk 3 is het kwantificeren, karteren en modelleren van het effect van beheer op acht ecosysteemdiensten, waarbij expliciet onderscheid wordt gemaakt tussen potentiële en feitelijke diensten. 'Het Groene Woud' is een typisch Nederlands multifunctioneel landelijk gebied. Lokale beleidsplannen zijn gericht op het combineren van landbouw, natuurbescherming en natuurrecreatie. Het raamwerk werd hier toegepast om te bepalen welke ecologische eigenschappen de levering van ecosysteemdiensten ondersteunen en welke indicatoren geschikt zijn voor het kwantificeren van de ‘state-’ en ‘performance-indicatoren’. De meeste ecosysteemdiensten in ‘Het Groene Woud’ zijn sterk afhankelijk van de omvang en connectiviteit van natuurgebieden. Voorts spelen zogenaamde 'groene landschapselementen' (bijvoorbeeld hagen, bomenrijen en bermen) een cruciale rol voor diensten als bestuiving, biologische plaagbestrijding, fijnstofinvang en bescherming van leefgebied voor dieren. De geïdentificeerde indicatoren helpen om de interactie tussen verschillende ecosysteemdiensten te begrijpen, en de resulterende ruimtelijke modellen helpen om de gebieden te identificeren die het meest belangrijk zijn voor het leveren van meerdere ecosysteemdiensten. Tevens werden twee scenario’s, ‘landbouwintensivering’ en ‘grootschalige natuurbescherming’, onderzocht om de gevolgen te bepalen op zuivelproductie, fijnstofinvang en natuurrecreatie. De scenarioanalyse onderstreept dat groene landschapselementen en natuurgebieden van belang zijn voor recreatie en regulerende ecosysteemdiensten. Intensiverende zuivelproductie gaat ten koste van alle onderzochte ecosysteemdiensten. De vastgestelde ecosysteemdienstindicatoren en relaties daartussen kunnen bijdragen tot het kwantificeren van ecosysteemdiensten in andere landschappen.In Hoofdstuk 4 ga ik verder in op de beleids- en ecologische aspecten van beheer, welke zijn bestudeerd in de mangrovekustgebieden van Java, Indonesië. Sinds de jaren ’80 is meer dan de helft van de Indonesische mangroven gedegradeerd of omgezet in aquacultuur, landbouw en stedelijk gebied. Java is gekozen als studiegebied omdat het eiland het sterkst is veranderd door ontwikkeling van aquacultuur en omdat overheidsbeslissingen hier veelal voor het eerst worden geïmplementeerd. De consequenties van landgebruiksbeslissingen zijn beoordeeld door de gevolgen van verschillende ‘regimes’ op mangrove ecosysteemdiensten te onderzoeken. Regimes zijn menselijke activiteiten die gezamenlijk het landgebruik bepalen. Ik onderscheid vijf brede categorieën: natuurlijke mangroven, lage intensiteit gebruikte mangroven en hoge intensiteit gebruikte mangroven, mangroven omgezet ten behoeve van aquacultuur en, tot slot, niet langer gebruikte verlaten aquacultuursystemen. Natuurlijke mangroven worden slechts op zeer kleine schaal gebruikt, zonder het ecosysteem nadelig te beïnvloeden. De brede regime-categorieën zijn verder onderverdeeld in elf specifieke regimes, op basis van wettelijke status, beheerindicatoren en ecologische kenmerken. Zeven ecosysteemdiensten zijn geanalyseerd: voedsel (vis en garnalen), hout en andere bosproducten, kustbescherming, koolstofvastlegging, waterzuivering, habitat voor vis en garnalen, en natuurrecreatie. Deze ecosysteemdiensten zijn geselecteerd in samenspraak met lokale beleidsmakers. Vervolgens zijn de belangrijkste ecologische eigenschappen die ten grondslag liggen aan de ecosysteemdiensten bepaald, en ‘state-’ en ‘performance-indicatoren’ geïdentificeerd. De levering van ecosysteemdiensten is geschat en vervolgens gescoord voor elk regime door ecologische en beheerkenmerken van de regimes te relateren aan ecosysteemdienstindicatoren. Belangrijke indicatoren voor de meeste diensten zijn maximale boomleeftijd, soortenrijkdom en structurele diversiteit. Natuurlijke mangroven scoorden het hoogst voor de meeste diensten, behalve voor voedsel. De hoge voedselproductie van de aquacultuur regimes gaat ten koste van alle andere ecosysteemdiensten. Aquacultuur levert zelfs 'negatieve diensten' op, in de vorm van koolstofemissie, watervervuiling en verhoogd risico op overstromingen. Transities tussen regimes zijn tevens geïllustreerd in een diagram dat de gevolgen van landgebruiksbeslissingen laat zien. Zo kan het aanleggen van plantages en silvo-aquacultuur op locaties van voormalige aquacultuurvijvers de ‘negatieve diensten’ tegengaan, terwijl aanzienlijke hoeveelheden voedsel en hout geleverd kunnen worden. Bevindingen van deze studie zijn door lokale beleidsmakers verwerkt in nieuwe plannen met betrekking tot duurzame aquacultuur en mangroverehabilitatie. Hoofdstuk 5 onderzoekt de effecten van verschillende regimes op bodemerosie en run-off van oppervlaktewater in door waterschaarste gekenmerkte ‘rangelands’. Wereldwijd zijn meer dan één miljard mensen afhankelijk van rangelands voor hun levensonderhoud, omdat ze er hun vee laten grazen en landbouw bedrijven. Elf nieuwe regimes zijn geanalyseerd voor deze rangelands. Elk regime is gebaseerd op tien kwalitatieve indicatoren die verschillende begrazingsintensiteiten en natuurbeschermingsstrategieën weerspiegelen. Belangrijke indicatoren voor het kwantificeren van bodemerosie en run-off zijn de helling, bodemtextuur en –bedekkingsgraad en het organisch stofgehalte. Zowel gemiddeld jaarlijks bodemverlies als run-off nemen toe in de reeks van de regimes onbegraasde natuurlijke rangelands, lage intensiteit begraasde rangelands, hoge intensiteit begraasde rangelands en aangelegde weilanden. Bodemverlies bedroeg, respectievelijk, 717 (SF (standaardfout) = 388), 1370 (SF = 648), 4048 (SF = 1.517) en 4249 (SF = 1.529) kg ha-1 jaar-1 . Run-off bedroeg voor dezelfde regimes 98 (SF = 42), 170 (SF = 43), 505 (SF = 113) en 919 (SF = 267) m3 ha-1 jaar-1 . Verder bleek dat het beëindigen van begrazing alsmede het combineren van begrazing en bosaanplanting bodemverlies en run-off kunnen verminderen. De bevindingen onderstrepen dat bodemerosie en run-off sterk verschillen per regime en dat het behoud en herstel van kwetsbare rangelands deze risico’s kan verminderen. Mijn proefschrift toont aan dat beheer en landgebruik ecosysteemdiensten sterk beïnvloeden. Natuurbescherming in natuurlijke regimes behoudt biodiversiteit maar ondersteunt bovendien cruciale regulerende en habitatdiensten, recreatiemogelijkheden en zelfs voedsel en bosproducten. Lage intensiteit gebruikte regimes kunnen veel ecosysteemdiensten leveren, maar trade-offs tussen de productie- en regulerende diensten kunnen optreden. Beheer ter ondersteuning van intensieve voedsel- en grondstoffenproductie heeft meestal negatieve effecten op recreatiemogelijkheden en cruciale regulerende diensten. De combinatie van intensieve productie met actief natuurherstel kan deze negatieve effecten gedeeltelijk verzachten. Ik maak expliciet onderscheid tussen natuurlijke en omgezette regimes, die worden gebruikt voor intensieve voedsel of grondstoffenproductie. Deze intensive productie gaat meestal ten koste van alle andere ecosysteemdiensten en kan zelfs leiden tot 'negatieve diensten'. Niet langer gebruikte en verlaten systemen leveren onbeheerd weinig ecosysteemdiensten maar zijn potentieel waardevol voor natuurherstel, afhankelijk van de oorspronkelijke ecosystemen. Bevindingen in dit proefschrift zijn gebaseerd op een raamwerk voor indicatorenselectie en een combinatie van verschillende informatiebronnen en onderzoeksmethodes, zoals een indicatorinteractiediagram, een typologie van regimes en een aanpak om de resultaten te integreren. In Hoofdstuk 6 stel ik voor hoe deze aanpak kan worden geïntegreerd in een 'toolbox'. Dit proefschrift presenteert een zeer volledige set van kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve indicatoren voor het kwantificeren van beheereffecten op de levering van ecosysteemdiensten. De genoemde stappen in ‘toolbox’ kunnen worden gebruikt om beheerders en beleidsmakers te informeren over de gevolgen van beslissingen met betrekking tot natuurbehoud, landgebruiksintensivering, het omzetten van natuur ten behoeve van intensieve voedselproductie, en het herstel van verlaten, onbeheerd land. Dit proefschrift biedt een handvat voor het voorkomen van verdere aantasting van het aardoppervlak en het verlies van ecosysteemdiensten.

TI  - Different Shades of Green : Reflections on the Legitimacy of Dutch Nature Policy and Practices
AU  - Leistra, Gilbert R.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - It is the purpose of this study to understand and explain the concept and problem of legitimacy in relation to Dutch nature policy and practices. Further, this study aims to support the realization of legitimate nature policy and practices, by characterizing legitimacy in relation to the theoretical and empirical insights that are elaborated in this research.Many conceptions of nature are valued. These different shades of green compete with each other and with other land-use for space. It is therefore understandable that decisions regarding what to favour can be controversial and will meet public and political resistance. Legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices, the main subject of this study, is therefore important. However, legitimacy is a rather elusive concept that is seldom defined. Nevertheless, most of us are aware of the normative connotation that is enclosed in its meaning. The normative character is focused on the exercise of power or, better said, the just or unjust exercise of power. In our western society, legitimacy is equated with democratic governance and the principles on which it is founded. However, democracy comes in different guises, both in theory and in practice. Nevertheless, there is a call for 'more' or 'better' democracy that is exemplified by two connected shifts. The first is a shift from government to governance, which expresses a decline in top-down planning by state agents in favour of more participatory and interactive policymaking; the second is a shift from normal science to post-normal science, which emphasizes the need to acknowledge nature conservation as a field in which facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high, and decisions urgent. Both shifts ask for more 'democratization' by means of more stakeholder involvement. However, how much involvement is right or enough? 'More' participation might increase the level of direct democracy; it might, at the same time, hinder the representative power of democracy. A critical reflection on legitimacy is thus warranted. To reach the objective of this study the following questions are addressed:(1) What is legitimacy? Or, how should we understand the concept of legitimacy?(2) What are the issues or problems with regard to legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices?(3) What characterizes legitimate nature policy and practices?The approach to the concept and problem of legitimacy is inspired by the philosophical pragmatist tradition. Instead of approaching legitimacy as a philosophical artefact, it is understood and explained within the context in which it appears relevant. This is necessary as no theory of legitimacy is offered idly or accidentally. All theories have a pragmatic or expediential element and appear when the uses of power are matters of controversy.The first question – What is legitimacy? Or how should we understand the concept of legitimacy? – is dealt with in chapter 5. Because context is important, this chapter 5 is preceded by three contextual chapters that discuss the character of Dutch nature conservation (chapter 2), the governance shift (chapter 3) and international examples (chapter 4). These chapters provide the necessary context for the development of the theoretical account of legitimacy in chapter 5 and for answering the first research question. With the insights of chapter 5, the second question – What are the issues or problems with regard to legitimacy in Dutch nature conservation policy and practices? – is tackled. The theoretical framework is used to analyze four case studies in chapters 6, 7 and 8. These case studies represent different shades of green within diverse governance contexts. The case studies first of all have an explorative character and will illustrate the problem of legitimacy in different contexts. The case studies studied are:(1) Future Amstelland: central in this case study is the tension between local input and regional challenges that need to be addressed in the future developments of a rural area south of Amsterdam.(2) Wintering geese: growing populations of wintering geese resulted in increasing costs of indemnification. The implementation of a national plan that foresees in a solution is discussed.(3) Gaasterland vs. the Oostvaardersplassen: in order to reflect upon long-term goals a comparison is made between two well-known cases in Dutch nature policy and practices.The case studies are based on desk research, interviews and participant observation.Chapter 2 discusses the context in which legitimacy is an issue of concern by tackling four questions: who are we; where do we come from; where ought we to go; and how can we get there? The answers to these questions reveal something about the identity of Dutch nature conservation, or more correctly, about the identity of the Dutch regarding nature conservation. The answers to the first and the second question show that the Dutch are an ambitious people regarding land use and nature conservation, but that this ambition is multifaceted and reflects a dynamic past with different actors that have different interests. Given this characterization, the third and fourth questions were not answered with resolution; they remain open to debate. Given the post-normal condition, in which facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, the stakes are high and decisions are deemed urgent, it seems difficult or even impossible to formulate the best solution, policy or approach to tackle a certain problem. I argue that this does not mean that any approach will do, or that we cannot make a distinction between different shades of green. On the contrary, the lack of a shared perspective on what is necessary or valuable, albeit on a more abstract level, does not make decisions easier; rather, they are more complex and difficult. Moreover, the prerequisites provided by our democratic society create a challenging situation: we ought to consider the many different conceptions of the common good, whatever that may be or however that may be formulated. As such, an effective policy, and consequently a legitimate policy, should take this diversity into account.Chapter 3 discusses the shift from government to governance. A closer look at this phenomenon warranted, because this shift implies a transition from hierarchical government control to a system of governance that is characterized by multiple parties at different levels of administration. Governance, seen as an analytical model or as a steering theory, provides us with a perspective that allows us to be sensitive to the many actors that are involved, at different levels, in the realization and alteration of policy. The replacement of government by governance is not per definition something new, but refers to the conceptual need to decouple state and government, as non-state agents are increasingly seen to function as 'government' in the more traditional sense. Furthermore, the demystification of human rationality and actual changes in the levels and places of policy making provide the concept of governance with a relevant perspective to be sensitive to issues of legitimacy.Legitimacy is characteristically a problem when the prevailing power and authority structures change. A change in authority confronts people with that authority; it might change the underlying conventions, which might trigger close scrutiny of that authority, or it may make people aware of initial implicit acceptance. The governance of Dutch nature shows us exactly that. Shifts in governance require shifts in legitimacy.In chapter 4 the Dutch situation is placed in an international perspective. This chapter provides an extensive summary of a volume on legitimacy in EU nature policy. The volume is the result of an international workshop that the Applied Philosophy Group from Wageningen University organized in November 2005. The findings of this workshop have aided the search for understanding legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices.What the international case studies nicely illustrate is that what is considered legitimate at one level of governance is not automatically considered legitimate at another. Good arguments can be given that Natura 2000 and the Birds and Habitats Directives that provide its legal basis are legitimate; they are products that were developed by means of negotiation between the member states that ultimately have to live up to the directives themselves. At the same time, we see that their content is contested, not only on the ground where the diverse constituencies are responsible for the actual implementation, but also at the level of the nation state where directives are the cause of political controversy. As a result, the importance for policy makers of enhancing the democratic legitimacy of their policy plans has increased. However, this shift does not seem automatically to result in a more legitimate nature protection as it has specific drawbacks, such as a representation deficit and contested results. Because of this process character of democracy, a conception of legitimacy is therefore best framed as one of activity, focusing on both results and processes.In chapter 5 an answer to the first research question is provided by presenting a conceptual framework of legitimacy. This framework combines Beetham's three dimensions of legitimate power (rules, justifications and consent) and three modes of democratic legitimacy production (input, throughput and output). The framework is developed to facilitate an examination of legitimacy. With the framework, different and tangled problems can be described. Furthermore, the framework facilitates the identification of ways to strengthen the legitimacy of nature policy and practices.Beetham's three dimensions of legitimate power proved to be helpful in understanding the different building blocks of the normative 'quality' or 'characteristic' of legitimacy. An informed statement regarding legitimacy requires an inquiry into all three dimensions of legitimate power. Strong statements whether power is, or is not legitimate, are therefore best nuanced within this framework. Rules or laws might be breached and supporting beliefs might alter or evolve and consent might be withdrawn, but it is rarely the case that legitimacy fails in all three dimensions to such an extent that the label 'non-legitimate' fits unconditionally.The three modes of democratic legitimacy production provided the structure and content of Beetham's three dimensions. Input legitimacy emphasizes 'government by the people' and is rooted in the tradition of direct democracy; it facilitates the intrinsic value of democracy and relies on active participation, which emphasizes the third dimension of legitimacy. Output legitimacy emphasizes 'government for the people' as in the representative tradition. Political choices are legitimate if and because they effectively promote the common welfare of the constituency in question. Because representative democracy relies on the rule of some over many, it is especially important that power is acquired and exercised in accordance with the 'rules' in order to claim legitimacy. Throughput legitimacy is based on the constructive power of democracy. Not the predetermined will of individuals or their representatives but rather the process of its formation is valued. Power is legitimate in that it facilitates deliberation in order to clarify disputes and possible solutions. It emphasizes the second dimension of legitimacy: legitimacy on the basis of shared beliefs or, better, legitimation through a search for shared beliefs.Although the presented conceptual framework emphasizes legitimacy as an activity, it does not automatically imply a fixed protocol for legitimacy production. The three different modes of production − input, throughput and output − all play their part in producing legitimacy, but their relation is not prearranged.Chapter 6 opens the second part of this study in which the theoretical account of chapter 5 is used to analyze four case studies. In this chapter the legitimacy of a participative process in Amstelland is explored. This process was part of the Future Amstelland project, the purpose of which was to develop a shared vision and action plan for the rural green wedge that penetrates the city of Amsterdam from the south. However, the outcome was criticized by international partners because of limited representation of interests and a rather conservative vision that failed to incorporate pressing issues. Nevertheless, emphasis on input and throughput legitimacy, rather than output legitimacy seems necessary with respect to the governance dimension of FA. More and more responsibility for the realization of spatial objectives is placed with provincial and municipal authorities. However, spatial challenges transcend municipal boundaries. Aware of its limited authority, the initiating municipality of Amsterdam considered a procedural approach necessary. Next to the constructive reasons that legitimate a procedural effort ‒ as participation can facilitate the clarification of problems and possible solutions ‒ the FA case shows that a procedural approach also can serve the instrumental goal of securing a certain outcome and impact.Chapter 7 discusses the implementation of the 2003 Policy Framework Fauna Management (PFFM) in three different provinces. This policy represents a new phase in almost half a century of managing wild geese populations in the Netherlands. In contrast to earlier initiatives, this policy does not address threatened populations but thriving populations of wild geese. Due to international and national initiatives taken from the 1970s onwards, Dutch wild-geese populations have increased by a factor of ten, which has dramatically increased damage to local agricultural crops. The mounting costs of indemnification and the growing distress of the agricultural community confronted with wintering geese populations led to the development of the PFFM, which foresees in the establishment of special foraging sites. The sites are the responsibility of the residing farmers, for which they receive remuneration. Analyzes of the implementation process in the provinces of Limburg, Noord-Brabant and Friesland exemplify the need for tailormade solutions if local support is of essence in policy implementation. Furthermore, these tailor made solutions depend on sound throughput procedures that allow for a process of discovery. Additionally, the evolution of the problem of wintering geese into that of summering gees, exemplify the post-normal character of Dutch nature policy and practices, in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to formulate an ultimate decision. The case of wintering geese illustrates the need to perceive legitimacy as activity, rather than evaluative concept. However, this also means that the contingent and post-normal condition needs to be taken seriously.Chapter 8 presents a diptych of two very different shades of green: the Oostvaardersplassen and Gaasterland. Both areas are part of the National Ecological Network but, where the Oostvaardersplassen is assumed to provide for 'real' nature, Gaasterland is an example of agricultural-orientated nature management. Both cases have led to controversy and have influenced the course of Dutch nature conservation policy and practices. The comparison of both cases is used to reflect on how legitimacy relates to long-term goals that are often at the foundation of conservation policies and practices. Both cases demonstrate that the need to produce legitimacy is a 'colour-blind' and ongoing necessity. In both the darker and lighter shades of green, input, throughput and output legitimacy are necessary to ultimately justify an authority's actions, and the results that it foresees.Chapter 5 provided an answer to the first research question. In chapter 9 - the final chapter of this study - I reflect upon the second and third research questions in relation to the theoretical and empirical findings of this study and conclude with recommendations that aim to further support the realization of legitimate nature policy and practices. An answer to the second research questions is given by comparing the different insights from the four case-studies. The case-studies have illustrated that legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices, regardless of the specific shade of green, is questioned. All observed problems are output related, but the context in which the output became contested differs from case to case. In all cases in this study the policies and practices build forth on non-contested policies and practices. Nevertheless, the case studies have shown that legitimacy problems can develop and that they do so at different stages of policy formulation or implementation. Although the Amstelland case shows that producing legitimacy is preferably done as a conscious act, rather than a forced reaction to surfacing legitimacy problems, the Amstelland case also shows that this does not guarantee legitimacy. The post-normal condition thus asks for a conscious ongoing effort in the production of legitimacy in both 'action' and 'reaction'. The case studies furthermore exemplify the governance condition in which official mandates of different authorities may conflict. Moreover, the case of the Oostvaardersplassen illustrates that if official authority is uncontested, it can still be challenged on moral grounds.The third research question 'what characterizes legitimate nature policy and practices?' has guided the more practical aim of this research to ultimately contribute to legitimate nature policy and practices. An answer is formulated by summarizing the findings of this study in six major insights. These are:(1) Legitimacy is work in progress(2) Producing legitimacy implies control over input, throughput and output(3) One size does not fit all(4) Take throughput legitimacy seriously(5) Take control and let it go(6) A high level of reflexivity is requiredThe conceptual framing of legitimacy in this study, the analyses of the legitimacy problems in different case studies, and the six major insights that follow from these analyses can aid in producing legitimacy. Nevertheless, this knowledge based contribution is modest and limited in scope. Although a contribution to knowledge is what is expected of an academic work, the real-life challenge asks for reflective action. In the final reflection I conclude that philosophy can make a further contribution to this challenge of reflective action. Although further academic and applied academic research may aid this real-life challenge, philosophy is of most use when it is practical. Because practical philosophy is focused on skill and virtue, rather than knowledge and wisdom, it has a capacity building property. By doing so, philosophy does not only succeed in making a contribution to the legitimacy of Dutch nature policy and practices, but it also succeeds in strengthening the legitimacy of philosophy itself.

TI  - Aquatic Insects; Behavior and Ecology
T2  - Aquatic Insects
AB  - This book presents a broad view of the ecology and behavior of aquatic insects, raising awareness of this conspicuous and yet little known fauna that inhabits inland waterbodies such as rivers, lakes and streams, and is particularly abundant and diverse in tropical ecosystems. The chapters address topics such as distribution, dispersal, territoriality, mating behavior, parental care and the role of sensory systems in the response to external and internal cues. In the context of ecology, it discusses aquatic insects as bio indicators that may be used to assess environmental disturbances, either in protected or urban areas, and provides insights into how genetic connectivity can support the development of novel conservation strategies. It also explores how aquatic insects can inspire solutions for various problems faced by modern society, presenting examples in the fields of material science, optics, sensorics and robotics.

TI  - Classes of protection in urban forest fragments are effectiveless in structuring butterfly assemblages: landscape and forest structure are far better predictors
AU  - Orlandin Elton

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanization is a major cause of biodiversity loss and disconnection between people and nature. For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness. These results reinforce the importance of implementing public policies that prioritize the conservation of the quality of forest fragments in every class of protection, as well as the conservation of forest fragments throughout the urban landscape.

TI  - The Impact of Urban Forest Corridors on the Richness of Urban Bird Populations in Baltimore Forest Patches
AU  - Shobe, Beatriz Bridget Manon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Chapter one reviews what is known about animal movement patterns in an urban ecology context and how that knowledge is obtained. Several of the analytical programs used to assess movement are examined as well as strategies and technologies on gathering empirical movement data. Dominant paradigms used in understanding movement patterns across heterogenous urban habitat patches are also examined and evaluated. Chapter two then examines movement directly by assessing fragmented urban forested areas, including urban forested corridors, connected forested patches, and isolated forested patches. We attempt to assess connectivity from a species perspective and document the way in which species interact with heterogeneous urban landscape matrices. Urban corridors across Baltimore City are closely examined throughout the Summer of 2020. Using point counts and vegetation data, the effects of corridors on bird species richness are analyzed. I found that corridors contribute to urban biodiversity by providing habitat as well as mitigating the effects of nearby impervious surfaces associated with urban development.

AU  - Volker, C. M.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Until recently, rural landscapes used to be largely the unintentional and self-evident by-products of agriculture, of farm-based labour. This situation has changed dramatically. Now recognized as public spaces, rural landscapes and the nature they include are expected to fulfil important functions for society as a whole. Farmers' management of such areas is increasingly being seen as necessary for non-agrarian functions such as recreation and tourism, the development of new nature areas and the preservation of the cultural heritage.In this dissertation, the transformation process is studied from a sociological perspective. Chapter 1 ascertains that the management of a landscape occurs in a very complex social environment. The various claims on rural landscapes mark them as contested areas. Valuable rural landscapes that combine several supralocal collective qualities depend on state intervention for their survival. At the same time, state intervention needs support, notably from farmers, who are the owners and users of agricultural land. Farmers are expected to incorporate politically expedient management measures in their social and agricultural practices. They have not yet done so. Taking care of the environment as a collective good in an affluent urban society is very different from controlling nature for the market-driven production of food and raw materials in advanced land-based agricultural systems.The aim of the study was to contribute to the debate on the future management of valuable rural landscapes, by achieving insights into the opportunities for sustainable management of landscapes by farmers. The study focused on management that accommodates the need for more features of nature in rural landscapes. Three facets are presented:1. A historical outline of the supralocal urban interest in nature-based rural landscapes in the Netherlands. This is followed by an outline of the modernization process in the agrarian domain paying particular attention to transformations in the system of agricultural production.2. Perceptions and practices in farm management, derived from a social survey of farmers in Northeast Twente, in Overijssel province, the Netherlands. In order to predict the strategic preferences of these farmers regarding the place of nature and landscape in their professional skills and market orientation, a model is developed and applied, using empirical data from the social survey.3. Finally, several strategies for achieving the support and participation of farmers are suggested, with the aim of increasing the likelihood that both valuable landscapes and farmers will survive.Chapter 2 discusses the views on nature and on landscape characteristics within three socio-political discourses. Rural landscapes in the Netherlands fit in a centuries-old tradition of planned land use, based on collective intervention in nature and in the physical environment. The discourses stress different opinions about functions of the countryside, nature and urban-rural interactions. Part of the growing public awareness of rural landscapes in the Netherlands is a new attitude to nature that is able to emerge in urban environments. This attitude is to do with admiring and enjoying nature rather than with taming and exploiting it. The rise of modern industrialized society brought with it a new function for rural areas: that of being a green and pleasant land. The twentieth century has seen the emergence of a new institutional field in which nature and landscape organizations have evolved to meet the growing demand for nature reserves and landscape parks. Late twentieth century Dutch public opinion is greatly in favour of nature, but less in favour of on-farm nature conservation and has a poor opinion of farmers as managers of nature.Chapter 3 discusses developments in Dutch agriculture, and state intervention in the conservation of valuable features of nature and landscape related to the agrarian domain. Parallel to the social movements that aimed to emancipate the urban working class, a process of emancipation of farmers emerged, followed by the modernization of the system of producing food by farming. Whereas small-scale farming assured a stable and rich semi-natural landscape that could be enjoyed by city dwellers, the agricultural production system developed in the opposite direction, of mechanization and industrialization. The post-war revolution in agriculture resulted in deruralization: that is, in agricultural production shifting from a territorial basis to a sectoral basis. Small-scale region-based mixed farms were replaced by modern specialized farms. This process was supported by land consolidation projects, that had enormous repercussions in terms of the loss of biodiversity, of valuable nature elements, of characteristic landscape features and of multiple land use.From the 1960s onwards, vehement conflicts emerged because of the claims articulated by the agriculture and nature conservation lobbies and the separated prospects for urban and rural development brought about by the distinctive planning systems. At the political level, a compromise was reached with the Policy Document on the Relationship between Nature and Agriculture (1975), which featured a zoning of agricultural land. Under this Policy Document, two types of valuable rural landscapes were to be protected against further optimalization of agricultural land use. The Nature Policy Plan of 1990 launched a more pro-active strategy for nature: a National Ecological Network was proposed, in which existing woodland, nature reserves and valuable rural landscapes were to be preserved and rehabilitated. In addition, transition zones and new areas designated for large-scale nature development were to be established on agricultural land. To meet these targets, the policy-making process had to be adjusted. Additional support was needed. In recent years therefore, policy making focusing on subsidizing the traditional state and non-governmental organizations for nature management has been replaced or complemented with result-oriented measures, open to more land users in rural areas.Meanwhile, Dutch agriculture has reached a cross-roads. The choice is between the transformation process continuing towards knowledge-based, capital-intensive, technologically advanced food production systems that have a narrow perspective on the sustainability of farms and the environment ('traditional modernization'), and the features of an impending second wave of modernization, comprising agrarian and structural diversification of rural areas ('rural renewal'). The result is the occurrence of two different and partly contradictory development patterns, making the future of Dutch rural landscapes more unpredictable.Chapter 4 outlines the prospects for Dutch farmers. Three processes of integration have entered their domain. In agriculture, farmers face a process of increased regulation and techno-economic commercialization of the production system. In nature and landscape conservation, they face the claims made by the social movement industries advocating the development of 'new nature' as a new mission and a new market. Finally, a process of increased state intervention and state support entails taking the environment into account as a collective good (the quality of nature, soil, water and landscape). This latter process is accompanied by new style regulation, in which farmers are challenged to assume more responsibility and to achieve more self-regulation to bring about rural development.The consequence of this is that the world of farmers has become much more complex. Now farmers have to learn how to deal with their shrinking freedom of action in conventional agriculture and how to manage the diversity of new claims made on their land. Large areas of the Dutch countryside have already been designated for de-intensified agricultural production. But how likely and inspiring do recent developments seem to Dutch farmers? Dutch farmers seem to be facing difficult choices and much uncertainty.Chapter 5 outlines to what extent Dutch farmers are willing to choose in favour of modified, sustainable practices to benefit nature and landscape in their farm management. It includes the results of a social survey conducted in Northeast Twente, covering 81 randomly selected respondents farming 5 ha land or more. These farmers contend that there are still considerable amounts of nature and landscape elements on their farms. With few exceptions, the perceived annoyance caused by such elements is low. In most cases the protective measures are restricted to promoting the conservation of meadow birds and small animals. The farmers are familiar with most initiatives for protecting and promoting the development of nature and landscape elements, but their interest in participating in such initiatives varies. It turns out that their stewardship of nature and landscape elements as part of their farm labour is modest. They prefer the skills needed for optimizing agricultural production. When questioned about preferred combinations of income, they give priority to income from conventional agricultural production. Many farmers are unimpressed by the incentives offered to steward nature and landscape. Questioned about the level of farm management, half of the respondents replied that they prefer the tasks of the skilled labourer, followed by organizational tasks. Only a few favour the true entrepreneur, capable of responding adequately to off-farm developments. Their plans for future development focus on enlarging the farm rather than on specializing or diversifying the farm business. They display considerable enthusiasm for new captial investments and personal improvement of knowledge and skills in agricultural production. Many respondents voice concrete objections to having more nature and landscape elements on the farm, basing their motives on economics and loss of freedom. When asked to range the actors in the networks important to ensure that their plans would be achieved, the respondents reported that stakeholders in the production network and the family were the most essential. Stakeholders for the management of nature and landscape occupy a marginal position in their networks.In order to construct a predictive model, chapter 6 explores some theoretical insights relating to farmers' preferences. Theories in rural sociology and the literature on strategic management yielded elements for this model. Chapter 7 discusses the entire model and its constituents, both conceptually and operationally. Strategic preferences, operationalized as a two-dimensional construct covering the interest of farmers in nature and landscape in their professional skills and in their market orientation, result in three groups of farmers. One group has no interest in nature and landscape (33%), the second group prefers the current balance (status quo) between production and nature on the farm (44%) and the smallest group (23%) shows interest in having more features of nature and landscape value on the farm. As a consequence, change-oriented farmers dominate over continuity-oriented farmers, but opinions about the likely prospects vary. The first group opts for traditional modernization paying attention to environmental problems rather than to nature and landscape. The smallest group prefers nature and landscape-included rural renewal.Regression analysis was used to determine predictive variables for these preferences. The number of variables with statistically significant influence on preferences is found to be limited. Perception variables prove to be much more important than structure and farm characteristics in agriculture, including the presence of nature and landscape elements. The external orientation of farmers, that is their interests in external initiatives and economic activities in nature and landscape, has by far the most predictive value. The internal orientation, covering the preferred level of farm management and the hindrance experienced from stewarding nature and landscape elements, is not decisive at all. The predictive value of the internal orientation, the farm characteristics and the presence of elements of nature and landscape are overshadowed by the external orientation of farmers.Chapter 8 focuses on how the contribution of Dutch farmers to the management of nature and landscape can be improved, making both the quality of the environment and the livelihood of farmers more sustainable. It is concluded that there is still a considerable cultural gap between the persons who have interests in one and the same valuable rural landscape. To the urban population, nature is part of a hedonistic value orientation. To farmers, nature is part of a rural way of life. As a consequence, state policy measures intended to do justice to dominant visions of nature in a highly urbanized society meet considerable resistence in local rural situations. This is particularly striking if measures are placed in the perspective of creating new nature ('nature development') in that situation. Though some Dutch farmers display interest in urban visions on nature and landscape, little of this interest is incorporated into modified farming systems and practices. For most farmers these urban visions are a 'narrow' farm target.It is recommended to integrate the communication and participation of farmers into an innovative policy-making process. So far, Dutch farmers have not provided the landscape that urban people desire. The latter would like to have a more natural landscape. The strategy for achieving a more sustainable future for valuable rural landscapes in which farmers perform as knowledgeable participants in the social process has four strategic elements:• First, a break-through of the status quo can be achieved by retaining external actors as innovators in the region.• Second, the relationship between demand and supply of valuable rural landscapes should be established. There are three feasible options. One option excludes farmers as future managers, devolving their contributions to a variety of other actors involved in the landscape. The two other options include opportunities for farmers, provided they are ready to adapt a more open and flexible attitude to the products and services urban people want. The first deals with the preservation and reproduction of traditional valuable features of nature and landscape. It implies development in favour of the cultural heritage. However, this option does not offer a structural solution for each valuable rural landscape and all farmers (the landscape as open-air museum). In the alternative option, the stewardship of landscapes should be based on 'normal' economic activities and services. In contrast to conventional agriculture, however, the alternative option means a wider and more flexible orientation to the environment as a natural resource and a more demand-driven economy (the landscape as part of rural renewal). The best prospect is offered by organic farming, if possible with profitable side-activities. In addition, stewardship continues to be necessary for non-marketable qualities such as the preservation of features of nature and landscape in the light of the cultural heritage and biodiversity. These stewardship activities are dependent on political decisions and government commitment rather than the mechanism of the market competition.• The third element is improved network management. At present, Dutch farmers qualify themselves as a group of outsiders in the network for nature and landscape management. Additional networks at the local and regional level could achieve the connection of the networks for agricultural production and nature conservation, featuring intermediary functions. Better network management should also improve the coherence of the conditioning, stimulative and challenging measures in the policy-making process.• Finally, more attention should be paid to incorporating measures in farm management. Dutch farmers do not lack information but they do lack instrumental knowledge about initiatives for nature and landscape management. This could be remedied by setting up regional centres for communication and innovation that bridge the gap between a programme of action at the institutional level and the implementation of measures at farm level.

TI  - Life cycle assessment in support of sustainable transportation
T2  - Environmental Research Letters
AB  - In our rapidly urbanizing world, sustainable transportation presents a major challenge. Transportation decisions have considerable direct impacts on urban society, both positive and negative, for example through changes in transit times and economic productivity, urban connectivity, tailpipe emissions and attendant air quality concerns, traffic accidents, and noise pollution. Much research has been dedicated to quantifying these direct impacts for various transportation modes. Transportation planning decisions also result in a variety of indirect environmental and human health impacts, a portion of which can accrue outside of the transit service area and so outside of the local decision-making process. Integrated modeling of direct and indirect impacts over the life cycle of different transportation modes provides decision support that is more comprehensive and less prone to triggering unintended consequences than a sole focus on direct tailpipe emissions.The recent work of Chester etal (2013) in this journal makes important contributions to this research by examining the environmental implications of introducing bus rapid transit and light rail in Los Angeles using life cycle assessment (LCA). Transport in the LA region is dominated by automobile trips, and the authors show that potential shifts to either bus or train modes would reduce energy use and emissions of criteria air pollutants, on an average passenger mile travelled basis. This work compares not just the use of each vehicle, but also upstream impacts from its manufacturing and maintenance, as well as the construction and maintenance of the entire infrastructure required for each mode. Previous work by the lead author (Chester and Horvath 2009), has shown that these non-operational sources and largely non-local can dominate life cycle impacts from transportation, again on an average (or attributional) basis, for example increasing rail-related GHG emissions by >150% over just operational emissions.While average results are valuable in comparing transport modes generally, they are less representative of local planning decisions, where the focus is on understanding the consequences of new infrastructure and how it might affect traffic, community impacts, and environmental aspects going forward. Chester etal (2013) also present their results using consequential LCA, which provides more detailed insights about the marginal effects of the specific rapid bus and light rail lines under study. The trade-offs between the additional resources required to install the public transit infrastructure (the ‘resource debt’) and the environmental advantages during the operation of these modes can be considered explicitly in terms of environmental impact payback periods, which vary with the type of environmental impact being considered. For example, bus rapid transit incurs a relatively small carbon debt associated with the GHG emissions of manufacturing new buses and installing transit infrastructure and pays this debt off almost immediately, while it takes half a century for the light rail line to pay off the ‘smog debt’ of its required infrastructure. This payback period approach, ubiquitous in life cycle costing, has been useful for communicating the magnitude of unintended environmental consequences from other resource and land management decisions, e.g., the release of soil carbon from land conversion to bioenergy crops (Fargione etal 2008),  and will likely grow in prevalence as consequential LCA is used for decision support.The locations of projected emissions is just as important to decision-making as their magnitudes, as policy-making bodies seek to understand effects in their jurisdictions; however, life cycle impact assessment methods typically aggregate results by impact category rather than by source or sink location. Chester etal (2013) address this issue by providing both local (within Los Angeles) and total emissions results, with accompanying local-only payback periods. Much more challenging is the geographic mapping of impacts that these emissions will cause, given the many point and mobile sources of air pollutants over the entire transportation life cycle. Integration of LCA with high-resolution data sets is an active area of model development (Mutel and Hellweg 2009) and will provide site- and population-specific information for impacts ranging from water quality to biodiversity to human respiratory health.Another complex challenge in modeling environmental impacts of transportation (and cities in general) is the long run, interdependent relationship between transportation technologies and urban form. LCA modeling has tended to assume a fixed pattern of settlements and demand for mobility and then examined changes to a particular technology or practice within the transportation system, such as electric or hybrid vehicles or improved pavement materials. New transit options or other travel demand management strategies might induce mode switching or reduced trips, but the overall pattern of where people live and work is generally assumed in these models to be constant in the short run. In contrast, the automobile has been influencing land-use patterns for a century, and it is the resulting geographic structure that determines the baseline need for transportation, and thus drives the use of material and energy resources used in transportation systems (Kunstler 1994).We have seen that cities with high population densities tend to have lower tailpipe emissions from transportation (Kennedy etal 2009). Recent studies have modeled how changes in urban land-use or zoning changes the geographic structure of transportation demand and then used LCA to determine the environmental benefits of such policies. For example, Mashayekh etal (2012) summarized travel demand reductions projected from several studies of compact, smart growth, and brownfield in-fill development strategies to find benefits ranging up to 75% reductions in life cycle GHG and air pollutant emissions. A related study in Toronto on life cycle energy use and GHG emissions for high- and low-density development strategies found a ~60% difference in GHG emissions, largely due to transportation (Norman etal 2006). System dynamics and agent-based models may complement LCA in capturing long-term effects of transportation strategies as they are inherently dynamic (Stepp etal 2009), and can internalize spatially resolved decisions about where to settle and work (Waddell 2002).Transportation planning decisions have both direct and indirect, spatially distributed, often long-term effects on our health and our environment. The accompanying work by Chester etal (2013) provides a well-documented case study that highlights the potential of LCA as a rich source of decision support.ReferencesChester M, Pincetl S, Elizabeth Z, Eisenstein W and Matute J 2013 Infrastructure and automobile shifts: positioning transit to reduce life-cycle environmental impacts for urban sustainability goals Environ.

TI  - Garden life: the influence of garden age and area on the biodiversity of ground active arthropods
AU  - Brown, Grant R.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Urbanisation is a global issue, and rapidly gaining attention from researchers as a major cause of biodiversity loss. Gardens represent a considerable proportion of the urban landscape in the UK and have significant potential to promote urban biodiversity and reduce species loss providing they can be designed and managed appropriately. This research focused on gardens in St Andrews, Scotland, and investigated the influence of environmental variables such as age and area on arachnid and beetle biodiversity with the aim of identifying key predictors of arthropod species richness in urban environments. The key result of this research was that the age and area of individual gardens was not a strong predictor of ground active arthropod biodiversity. This suggests that more recently developed or smaller gardens can contribute to the overall urban region species richness pool as well as larger or more ancient gardens. The most important predictor of ground active arachnid and beetle species richness was the proportion of porous (or 'green') habitat surrounding each garden, and suggested that urban density and habitat connectivity at the regional scale are of key importance. In general, variables measured within gardens (e.g. the provision of microhabitats such as leaf litter, non-managed vegetation, etc.) did not exert any measurable effect on the biodiversity of arachnids or beetles. The findings of this research suggest that the regional availability of heterogeneous greenspace habitat is of high importance for promoting and maintaining urban arthropod biodiversity.

TI  - Park size and prey density limit occurrence of Eurasian Sparrowhawks in urban parks during winter
AU  - Schütz, Claudia
AU  - Schulze, Christian H
T2  - Avian Research
AB  - Background Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) increasingly represent successful city-dwellers. Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating raptor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes.Methods To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered.Results Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species. Canopy heterogeneity didn’t affect city park occupancy by Eurasian Sparrowhawks.Conclusions Our results suggest that large city parks, particularly when characterized by high prey densities, substantially contribute to protect and preserve ecologically important bird species such as raptors within the urban environment—a landscape already struggling with biodiversity losses and functional homogenization.

TI  - Effects of Landscape Spatial Heterogeneity on Host-Parasite Ecology
AU  - Watts, Alexander Gordon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Landscape spatial heterogeneity interacts with ecological processes that influence pathogen emergence and infectious disease spread. Modification of landscape composition and configuration is hypothesized to alter host densities, frequency of host-parasite interactions, host community assembly processes, and dispersal processes of host, vector, and parasite populations. Understanding the spatial and environmental dependence on host-parasite interactions is, therefore, critical in predicting the response of disease dynamics to widespread habitat modification. I combine wildlife disease ecology with landscape ecological concepts and varied modeling techniques (i.e., multivariate redundancy analyses, network connectivity models, bipartite mutualistic networks, beta diversity analyses) to test the mediating role of landscape spatial heterogeneity on the spread of a vector-borne disease system (chapter 2), and the effect of urban landscape spatial heterogeneity on host exposure to parasitism (chapter 3), host-parasite interaction structure (chapter 4), and host-parasite beta diversity (chapter 5). My results demonstrate that landscape spatial heterogeneity has a differential influence on tick dispersal than pathogen dispersal by the movement of a host community, most critically mediated by stepping-stone habitat. I also provide evidence that urban landscape spatial heterogeneity affects the exposure likelihood of a single host population, the structure of host-parasite interactions in multiple host populations, and the spatial contributions of host and parasite beta diversity. My work demonstrates that landscape spatial heterogeneity has a mediating role in multiple disease systems whereby spatial and environmental factors play a critical role in the likelihood of short- and long-distance pathogen invasion, the persistence of environmentally-mediated parasites, and the selection of generalist host and parasite species in urbanized habitat. Overall my research contributes to our theoretical understanding of the multi-scalar ecological interactions between landscape change and disease dynamics and our applied understanding of the role of landscape in the emergence of infectious diseases.

AB  - Urban agglomerations have become a new geographical unit in China, breaking the administrative fortresses between cities, which means that the population and economic activities between cities will become more intensive in the future. Constructing and optimizing the ecological security pattern of urban agglomerations is important for promoting harmonious social-economic development and ecological protection. Using the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration as a case study, we have identified ecological sources based on the evaluation of ecosystem functions. Based on the resistance surface modified by nighttime light (NTL) data, the potential ecological corridors were identified using the least-cost path method, and key ecological corridors were extracted using the gravity model. By combining 15 ecological sources, 119 corridors, 3 buffer zones, and 77 ecological nodes, the ecological security pattern (ESP) was constructed. The main land-use types composed of ecological sources and corridors are forest land, cultivated land, grassland, and water areas. Some ecological sources are occupied by construction, while unused land has the potential for ecological development. The ecological corridors in the central region are distributed circularly and extend to southeast side in the form of tree branches with the Songhua River as the central axis. Finally, this study proposes an optimizing pattern with “four belts, four zones, one axis, nine corridors, ten clusters and multi-centers” to provide decision makers with spatial strategies with respect to the conflicts between urban development and ecological protection during rapid urbanization.

TI  - Urban Street Stormwater Guide
AU  - National Association of City Transportation Officials
T2  - Urban Street Stormwater Guide
AB  - Streets make up more than 80 percent of all public space in cities, yet street space is often underutilized or disproportionately allocated to the movement of private motor vehicles. Excess impervious surface contributes to stormwater runoff, posing a threat to the environment and human health, and often overwhelming sewer systems. This excess asphalt also poses a threat to public safety, encouraging faster speeds and dangerous conditions for people walking and biking. This volume begins from the principle that street design can support--or degrade--the urban area's overall environmental health. By incorporating Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) into the right-of-way, cities can manage stormwater and reap the public health, environmental, and aesthetic benefits of street trees, planters, and greenery in the public realm. With thoughtful design, GSI can bolster strategies to provide a safe and pleasant walking and biking experience, efficient and reliable transit service, and safer streets for all users.Building on the successful NACTO urban street guides, this book provides the best practices for the design of GSI along transportation corridors. The authors consider context-sensitive design elements related to street design, character and use, zoning, posted speed, traffic volumes, and impacts to non-motorized and vehicular access. The Guide documents and synthesizes current practices being developed by individual agencies and recommends design guidance for implementation, as well as explores innovative new strategies being tested in cities nationwide. The guidance will focus on providing safe, functioning and maintainable infrastructure that meets the unique needs and requirements of the transportation corridors and its various uses and users.The state-of-the-art solutions in this guide will assist urban planners and designers, transportation engineers, city officials, ecologists, public works officials, and others interested in the role of the built urban landscape in protecting the climate, water quality, and natural environment.

TI  - Delineating an Integrated Ecological and Cultural Corridor Network: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - This study shows that an integrated ecological and cultural corridor network can help guide city development strategies to better preserve ecological and cultural assets. Traditionally, protection zones and suitable development areas are often identified by separately considering natural elements of the ecosystem and elements of cultural significance. To achieve the purpose of cohesively protecting areas of ecological and/or cultural significance, we have developed a corridor-based spatial framework by integrating ecological and cultural assets. Ecological sources are identified by combining protection prioritization, nature reserves, and water bodies. Ecological corridors are delineated by using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model on a resistance surface constructed from land-use data to connect ecological sources. Ecologically important areas are then delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from ecological sources and ecological corridors. Cultural corridors are historical routes and rivers surrounded by abundant cultural nodes. Like ecologically important areas, culturally important areas are delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from cultural corridors. Comprehensive regions are the overlap of ecologically and culturally important areas. Finally, the integrated network connects all comprehensive regions following ecological corridors and cultural corridors in such a way that the largest number of ecological sources and cultural nodes are reached. We applied this framework in Beijing, China, and the results show that there are 2011 km2 of ecological sources, 30 ecological corridors, 423 cultural nodes, seven cultural corridors, and 10 comprehensive regions covering 2916 km2 in the integrated network. The framework adds new insights to the methodology of considering ecological and cultural assets together in developing protection and development strategies.

AU  - Choquette, Jonathan Daniel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In an urbanizing region of Southwestern Ontario, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) persists in taligrass prairie remnants. Maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is a recommended strategy to encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of this genetically and ecologically distinct population. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost model and to evaluate the outputs with road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat patches which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. A subset of pathways requires further study. This research will guide the location of interventions aimed at increasing connectivity for this species, provide a basis for connectivity design for other species within the study landscape, and inform the use of a modelling approach to connectivity analysis in urban landscapes.

AU  - MacFarlane, Stephen Sohier
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Road propagation has led to landscape level threats due to habitat destruction, pollution, and mortality. Road mortality risk prediction converges on three drivers: habitat availability, landscape connectivity, and traffic volume. This study assessed the relative importance of mortality drivers in a peri-urban landscape at different taxonomic levels. Road mortality data and land cover data were provided by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, and traffic data from governmental sources were used. I modelled landscape connectivity using circuit theory algorithms. Driver significance was assessed using univariate multiple regression models and multivariate redundancy analyses, using total road mortality, taxa-based road mortality, and species level road mortality for American toads and grey treefrogs. Local scale drivers such as wetland patchiness and amount had the greatest effects on road mortality. Greater divergence occurred at the species scale, though conserved patterns were seen across multiple taxonomic levels.

AB  - The study of plants and animals on islands, both artificial and natural, has produced a body of generalizations immediately useful to land use planners concerned with minimizing the effects of habitat destruction on the environment.  A case study of 37 isolated chaparral fragments in San Diego, California, demonstrates the consequences of habitat fragmentation, including rapid and predictable extinctions of native birds in isolated canyons.  Important measures for the prevention of such disappearances include: 1.  the consolidation of open space set-asides, and 2.  the provision of corridors linking habitat patches.  Corridors can mitigate some of the negative effects of development on wildlife, particularly where they facilitate the movement of large predators.  Where both landscape linkages and juxtaposition of open space elements are impractical, mitigation banking is suggested.  Here, the developer, instead of setting aside tiny parcels that will deteriorate rapidly, deposits money into an account for future open space acquisition.

AU  - Diniz, Ugo M

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Pollen dispersal in tropical seed plants is established mainly by biotic vectors, both in intact and fragmented environments. In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats’ territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant’s year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.

AB  - The sustainability of wetlands is threatened by the past and present land use practices. Hydrological connectivity is one of the most important aspects to consider for wetland rehabilitation planning purposes. Circuit theory and connectivity indices can be used to model and assess hydrological connectivity. The aim of this study was to assess spatiotemporal variation in the hydrological connectivity of the Zoigê area from 2000–2019 using both methods. The study area contains a Ramsar wetland of international importance, namely the Sichuan Ruoergai Wetland National Nature Reserve. We used a global surface water observation product as the major input for both methods, and then analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics, in terms of important components and patches. We found that the overall connectivity has increased slightly in the last 20 years, while the probability of connection between patches of surface water has increased significantly. Important components and patches represent steppingstone habitat for the dispersal of organisms in the landscape. The main determinants of hydrological connectivity are mostly human oriented, predominantly a decrease in large livestock population size and population increase.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - A wide body of research in recent years has studied either green infrastructures as providers of multiple ecosystem services, especially at the urban level, or ecological corridors and the issue of connectivity between landscape patches in the face of growing fragmentation. However, not many studies have analyzed how the two concepts can be combined to ground evidence-based policy and planning recommendations. In this study, a methodological approach for such a combination is proposed: after mapping a regional green infrastructure building upon the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and a network of ecological corridors through the resistance to movement of species, the two spatial layouts are combined so as to analyze correlations between the potential provision of ecosystem services and the resistance to movement. The methodology is applied in the case of the island of Sardinia, whose self-containment makes it possible to discard potential effects from surrounding areas, hence facilitating the implementation of the model. The outcomes of the regression model point out three ecosystem services as the most important factors that should be targeted by appropriate spatial policies if connectivity is to be increased: regulation of micro and local climate, forestry productivity, and cultural identity and heritage values.

AB  - Ecological theory suggests that intermediate connectivity between protected areas will increase their resilience by facilitating dispersal, recolonisation, and genetic mixing. Conversely, over‐connectivity may make areas less resilient to contagious perturbations such as pathogen outbreaks. In a similar manner, socioeconomic connectivity should enhance the spread of effective management strategies and the sharing of scarce resources, but over‐connectivity carries the risks associated with one‐size‐fits‐all strategies. We used network analysis to examine the topology of management collaborations and related exchanges of information and equipment in two protected area networks in South Africa using the Eastern and Western Cape Provinces as study sites. National protected areas displayed the highest degree of centrality in the Western Cape, while provincial protected areas occupied the central role in the Eastern Cape. Managers in the Western Cape were more concerned about establishing ecological connectivity between protected areas whereas tourism emerged as an important driver in the Eastern Cape protected area network. Our results support the argument that both location and network membership are important for the socioeconomic resilience of protected areas. As with ecological corridors, deliberate fostering of particular socioeconomic corridors may make the protected areas more resilient to perturbations.

TI  - Reproductive and Migration Ecology of Breeding and Wintering Northern Harriers (Circus hudsonius) in Suisun Marsh, California
AU  - Skalos, Shannon Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Management and conservation plans often lack adequate data about population estimates, habitat selection, reproductive ecology, and even migration ecology of migratory species. Migratory and understudied birds, like Northern Harriers (Circus hudsonius), are no exception. The Northern Harrier is a widespread but declining North American raptor species that specializes in wetland and grassland habitats. They are a secretive raptor species with a unique combination of behavioral adaptations, like ground nesting, avoidance of urban development and human disturbance, and avoidance of traditional raptor trapping techniques, that make them challenging to study. Recent advances in technology, like the miniaturization of GPS/GSM transmitters, can greatly improve management and conservation of Northern Harriers and help fill knowledge gaps about their ecology and behavior across their range.The first challenge to studying Northern Harriers was finding efficient trapping techniques to capture an adequate sample size of individuals for transmitter deployment. In Chapter 1, we developed modified and novel trapping techniques for wintering and breeding Northern Harriers. First, we reviewed and tested successful trapping techniques from other Northern Harrier breeding populations. The most widely used technique in other populations was the use of a live or taxidermy mounted owl near a nest surrounded by mistnets or dho-gazas, which facilitates capture by eliciting an aggressive response by the breeding pair. Surprisingly, none of the published techniques were successful in our population, leading to the development of a new technique. We had the highest success flushing adult females into two dho-gazas placed in a “V” formation around the nest, a method that was modified from capturing nesting American Bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus). Most females did not show behavioral responses to net placement at the nest and continued provisioning nestlings without visible stress or alarm calling. Unlike the use of an owl lure, our technique allows for passive capture with minimal disturbance to nesting birds. However, because this technique does not elicit an aggressive response, adult males are not amenable to capture with this technique. Winter trapping is typically not attempted for Northern Harriers because they rarely respond to traditional methods like bal-chatri traps baited with live lure birds or small mammals. Noose carpets can work well, but also result in incidental capture of multiple birds or different raptor species simultaneously, leading to potential injuries of captured birds. Knowing that Northern Harriers are scavengers of dead waterbirds in winter wetland habitats, we used remote-triggered bow nets baited with waterbird carcasses to capture wintering birds. This novel trapping technique was overwhelmingly successful, with nearly 80 individual birds captured across three winter trapping seasons. This technique also allows for targeted capture of individual birds, eliminating the risk of capturing multiple birds or non-target species. Our research suggests that trapping techniques are not necessarily universal across populations, and careful consideration of behavior and life history traits can improve targeted research for species like Northern Harriers.Equipped with the trapping techniques developed in Chapter 1, we studied the habitat selection of breeding adult female Northern Harriers across multiple spatial scales in Suisun Marsh, California, in Chapter 2. We measured fine-scale microhabitat characteristics at nests, extracted macrohabitat characteristics across the landscape, and examined breeding home range habitat selection in adult female Northern Harriers captured at the nest and equipped with GPS/GSM transmitters. At the microhabitat scale we found that Northern Harriers select tall emergent and terrestrial vegetation, which is consistent with habitat selection studies in populations across their range. This result also suggests a selection for both marsh habitat and upland habitat for nest sites. Specific to Suisun Marsh, we found that Northern Harriers also have a high probability of selecting nest sites with California Rose (Rosa californicus). Macrohabitat selection consisted of nest placement ~ 100 m from water and revealed an avoidance of shrub vegetation. These results combined indicate a selection for vegetation structure and nest placement in vegetation that provides protection from mammalian predators. A subset of nests on the Grizzly Island Wildlife area avoided nest placement near all-terrain vehicle (ATV) tracks, and spatially clustered nests revealing additional adaptations for predator and disturbance avoidance as well as semicolonial nesting behavior. Small mammal densities had no effect on nest site selection, despite the known importance of small mammals, particularly voles, on Northern Harrier reproductive success. Lastly, we found that adult females had a significantly higher probability of wetland habitat use over any other habitat type even as home ranges expanded, and females foraged farther from nest sites across the nesting season. Our results inform habitat managers to maintain tall, undisturbed vegetation in both upland and marsh habitats while ensuring dry areas for nest sites are available with complex vegetation and habitat structure, like California Rose and nearby water, to provide protection from mammalian predators.Chapter 3 builds on the research from Chapter 2 and examines the effects of multi-scale habitat characteristics on nest survival using logistic-exposure models. We found apparent nest success was relatively low (40%) compared to nest survival in populations across the Northern Harrier range, but Mayfield’s nest survival was similar to nests in Suisun Marsh three decades ago. Despite similar survival rates, the number of nests and nest density has declined over the past three decades, revealing a declining population with already low nest success. High spring small mammal densities had a positive effect on nest survival, and high summer small mammal density increased the number of fledglings. However, the California Vole (Microtus californicus) population is alarmingly low in Suisun Marsh compared to historical observations. Voles are an important prey species and improving their abundance could improve harrier nest survival and increase the breeding population in Suisun Marsh. Our results also show that a high proportion of live vegetation and the presence of residual vegetation at the nest are important microhabitat characteristics that influenced nest survival. Further, nests closer to California Rose also had higher nest survival, which is consistent with nest site selection determined in Chapter 2. Lastly, nest survival was highest in managed marsh habitat, despite potential selection for tidal marsh habitat. Lower nest survival in tidal marsh habitat may result from inappropriate habitat structure and extreme flooding events that could be exacerbated by sea level rise in the future. Restoring tidal marsh to large, contiguous habitat patches with numerous smaller channels to better diffuse the effects of high tides across the tidal plane could reduce nest flooding for harriers and other sensitive tidal marsh species in Suisun Marsh. Chapter 4 focuses on migration ecology of Northern Harriers wintering in Suisun Marsh. Using the winter trapping techniques developed in Chapter 1, we marked adult females with GPS/GSM transmitters in this first study of Northern Harrier migration ecology and habitat selection across their annual cycle. We recorded a total of 18 spring and 11 fall complete (round-trip) and partial (one-way) migrations for 14 individual Northern Harriers and identified nest sites across five Western United States (AK, CA, ID, OR, WA). We also recorded the three longest-distance migrations for any Northern Harriers to date across two individuals breeding in Alaska, ranging from 13,000 to nearly 20,000 km traveled roundtrip. Of the 11 fall migrations recorded, all birds returned to Suisun Marsh, highlighting its importance in Northern Harrier wintering ecology in Western North America. Mean spring migration was shorter than mean fall migration by nearly two months, with fewer stopovers and a faster migration speed (~ 200 km d-1) suggesting strong selection pressure to reach the breeding grounds early to secure a mate and territory, and to increase reproductive success. Migration timing is generally consistent with known timing for this species from raptor migration monitoring stations across North America. Migration routes were primarily along central and eastern corridors through California, Washington, and Oregon, and generally continued along inland intermountain regions through British Columbia and into Alaska for long-distance migrants. Wetland habitat was the most consistently selected habitat type across the annual cycle, with grassland and shrubland habitat also selected at stopover locations, and cultivated habitat also selected during the winter. Though habitat selection varied across the annual cycle, many breeding areas and stopover locations occurred on protected state and federal lands, which provide a unique opportunity for focused management and conservation efforts for migratory Northern Harriers. Raptor migration monitoring and banding stations located throughout Western North America may be misaligned with Northern Harrier migration, leading to low detections and population estimates because migration occurred along corridors where migration monitoring and banding stations are not located. Focusing migration monitoring along wetland habitat corridors and increasing breeding population research could improve Northern Harrier management and conservation efforts.

TI  - Pond -breeding amphibians in a highly modified landscape: Habitat modeling, landscape genetics, and predictions of landscape change
AU  - Goldberg, Caren S.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In the second half of the 20th century, landscape change on the terrestrial surface of the Earth occurred at an unprecedented rate, leading to habitat loss and degradation for thousands of species. Amphibians are currently the most imperiled of all vertebrate taxa and are often considered good indicators of ecosystem function because of their vulnerability to habitat degradation Despite this, several native amphibian species currently persist in the highly modified Palouse Prairie ecoregion of North America. We modeled the landscape associations of the most common of these species at a home range and population connectivity scale, predicted how this landscape is likely to change in the future, and assessed what the impacts of those changes would be on the persistence of these amphibian populations. First, we developed a novel survey-based method for predicting landscape change, compared it to a standard trend-based model, and found that rural housing units were predicted to increase by 31%, forests to decrease by 11%, agricultural lands by 7%, and grasslands by 4% over the following decade. We then developed habitat models for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) which indicated that forest practices will likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs, and that Columbia spotted frogs had a high level of vulnerability to predicted development patterns. Next, we used an empirical example from this area to show how removing full siblings from larval population genetic could reduce bias. Finally, we used a comparative landscape genetic approach to model the connectivity of Columbia spotted frogs and long-toed salamanders. For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient, with forest providing the lowest resistance. For Columbia spotted frogs, however, agriculture provided the least resistance, with grassland and forest associated with much higher resistance values. These results emphasize the need for species-specific data to inform management and conservation planning, and also contribute to a growing body of work on the landscape associations and multiple dispersal strategies of pond-breeding amphibians globally.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development.

T2  - Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group)
AB  - The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services.

TI  - Engaging in social interaction: relationships between the accessibility of path structure and intensity of passive social interaction in urban parks
AU  - Faezeh Mohammadi Tahroodi
AU  - Ujang, Norsidah
T2  - ArchNet-IJAR : International Journal of Architectural Research
AB  - PurposeFunctioning as space connectors, path structures in urban parks may rarely present social interaction opportunities, although centralized activity spaces are available. This paper investigated the interrelationships between the visual and physical accessibility attributes of path structure and their impacts on passive social interaction intensity across urban parks in Kuala Lumpur.Design/methodology/approachThe concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier. The experiential landscape method was applied to determine visual accessibility by interpreting experiential landscape maps. The space syntax method based on quantitative analysis is considered to measure physical accessibilities and vigorous activities along the designated paths by conducting integration analysis and gate observation. The data were crossed-analyzed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) classification technique, correlation analysis and Microsoft combo-charts to generate the relationship between patterns of activities and their accessibilities.FindingsThe results suggested that designated paths with higher accessibility attributes, impressively more elevated than other tracks, could influence the intensity of passive social interactions. The findings supported the understanding that activity nodes and active areas adjoining designated routes could make accessibility attribute areas more critical. These findings verify that visually enriching the spaces along the path structure toward activities is a pivotal contributor to urban planners and designers to enhance the paths’ local integration (LI) and visual accessibility to predict more passive eye contact among park visitors.Research limitations/implicationsThe proposed interrelationship among variables in this study has limitations because of not considering other qualitative methods and techniques like cognitive maps and interview simultaneously. These techniques could discover why some paths generate more passive eye contact among park users (Mohammadi Tahroodi, 2018).Practical implicationsKuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 emphasizes Kuala Lumpur’s unique image as a tropical garden city via preserving and developing the iconic historical urban parks in the city center (CHKL, 2004, pp. 3–3). The latest Draft Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040 has outlined the strategy to achieve a conducive, good-quality neighborhood that encourages social interaction. The findings could assist urban planners and designers better public parks by considering accessibility and permeability aspects of design. This research endorses the appropriateness of interrelationship between accessibility attributes of path structure and social interaction in urban design research, which local urban designers have not fully considered until now. Evaluating the visual convenience of designated paths and assessing LI of the axial lines constructing each designated route of urban parks during the primary stage could enable urban designers to estimate to what extent the paths are accessible and respond to passive social interaction. Then they could enrich with salient landmarks, views and activity nodes to make them attractive. The considerable number of designated paths connections, specifically while they shape the sides of activity nodes, could increase the connectivity and integration of spaces within the parks. These patterns of positioning the activity nodes make the designated routes more legible and provide ease of movement. As a result, it will give urban park users more information about the activities. Allowing people to use the paths will increase people’s presence and, subsequently, passive social interaction. One way is to locate accessible lands that provide social activities at direct visual access paths within urban parks for legibility.Social implicationsThe socially responsive urban design enhances the quality of life and provides life satisfaction, happiness and society’s overall health. Being in urban social parks in any passive and active situations has psychological benefits. It facilitates relief and rests from a stressful modern lifestyle that significantly impacts their mental health and well-being. The framework applied in this research integrates the social, spatial and physical aspects of parks design. With this regard, principles and indicators facilitate physically and socially attractive urban parks for Kuala Lumpur city center and applicable to similar contexts elsewhere.Originality/valueThe concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of Bobcats (Lynx rufus) and Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) in a Fragmented Landscape Using Noninvasive Sampling
AU  - Taylor, Daniel Raab
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are highly mobile, occupy diverse habitat types, and are well-suited for adaptation in response to anthropogenic changes on the landscape. These abilities make bobcats valuable indicators of landscape connectivity, which is essential for the viability of wildlife populations. Understanding patterns of gene flow among bobcat populations can help evaluate habitat corridors through urban environments, such as the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. I used scat sampling and landscape-genetic methods to determine the impact of habitat fragmentation on genetic connectivity of bobcats in South Texas. The noninvasive scat sampling strategy was an efficient method for collecting genetic samples of bobcats, but appears unsuccessful for monitoring ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) populations. I found evidence for restricted dispersal of bobcats in fragmented habitat patches through analysis of spatial autocorrelation and contemporary gene flow. Bobcat populations in contiguous rangeland habitats appeared panmictic, while fine-scale spatial autocorrelation in fragmented areas indicated restricted dispersal. Estimates of migration rates and direction of gene flow indicated that bobcats within the fragmented areas are likely to remain or disperse to rangeland if possible, but dispersal rarely occurred into the fragmented areas from the rangeland. Monitoring connectivity of habitat corridors will be important for the long-term conservation of wildlife in the region, including the two remaining U.S. ocelot populations.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAbstract The fast urbanization in our country has drastically in the need of community construction, and dissects many important ecological corridors, shrinks Lake Wetland, losses ecological diversity. Even though, community ecological planning has been paid widespread attention, we can't get rid of traditional thinking mode of "figure-ground" relation in our community planning and design, buildings are often refined finely as "figure", just then natural ecological landscape patch, such as Greenland is designed as "ground" as buildings collateral "filling stuff", so community natural ecosystem can't refined and screening finely. Constructing community eco-network is to change tradition ways of planning and design, using landscape ecology principle, natural ecosystem and landscape patch should be brought into community general planning design. We could use ecological corridor as a tie to link those relatively independent landscape patch into a continuous and integrated eco-network which is also viewed as the skeleton of community. Such the structure has the functions of natural ecological service, life-form variety protection, stroll about or rest of sight, and directing the development of community space into a rational way. The thesis contains five parts: Section one introduces the research background, points out three deficiencies on wholeness of ecosystem, regional characters of eco-elements and diversity of eco-composition, which are ubiquitous in community ecological planning, meanwhile, the development of community eco-network planning study of both internal and international communities are described, and the research frame is established. Section two introduces the theory and method, it specifies the definition of some relative concepts, discusses the connotation of community eco-network, takes some principles as the supports of the research by introducing landscape ecology, and meanwhile translates the pattern "patch, corridor, matrix" into "node, route, ace", which is fit for community ecosystem, then lays out the mechanism, "joint, choroid, structure" for the constructing community ecosystem. Section three is the core part of thesis, starting form community ecosystem character, this paper expounds three important eco-components constructing "virgin, symbiotic, regenerated" and put them into studying on the construction and space structure of community eco-network all though, bases on the analysis about problems of community ecological planning and components of community ecosystem. Then, based on conversion platform and research mechanism, this part studies on the construction of community eco-network "joint, choroid" from the "node, route" of landscape patch and corridor, studies on the space structure of community eco-network "structure" from the "face" of landscape matrix. At this time, it also classifies community eco-nodes into intersection nodes, attached nodes, unattached nodes; classifies eco-routes into water routes, plant routes; classifies eco-construction into core, axis and complexness, and then couples of ecosystem and community space. Section four takes the community ecological planning of Longxiang villa Huludao city as an example. This work introduces three aspects (i.e. node, route, face) to link ecosystem to community space, further leading to a rational community planning and development. Conclusions are in section five with constraints discussed, and a summery of directions for future work.   Key words: Landscape ecology principle, Community eco-network, Conversion platform, Research

AB  - Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation.

TI  - Relative Habitat Use, Occupancy, and Species Richness of Bats across the Gradient of Urbanization in an Arid Region
AU  - Dwyer, Jessie M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is a primary driver of ecological change and occurs across a gradient from low- to high- density development. Wildlife species can exhibit different responses to urbanization, with some species being more sensitive than others. Further, wildlife communities can exhibit varying patterns of species richness across the gradient of urbanization, where species richness can either decrease linearly or peak at intermediate levels of urbanization, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). For chapter one, the objective was to evaluate the response of bats to urbanization across seasons. It was predicted that bat species would exhibit different responses to urbanization and that bats would increase use of urbanized areas in the summer season, where food and water resources were assumed to be greater. For chapter two, the objective was to evaluate species richness of bats across the gradient of urbanization in the summer season. Species richness of bats was predicted to either decrease linearly or peak at moderate levels of urban intensity. To test these hypotheses, 50 sites across the gradient of urbanization were sampled during four seasons using stationary acoustic bat monitors. Fourteen bat species were identified during 1000 nightly occasions. Consistent with chapter one predictions, bat species exhibited different responses to urbanization, with most bats being sensitive to urbanization. Counter to predictions, most bats did not appear to shift their response to urbanization across seasons. However, two bats (i.e., big brown bat and Yuma myotis) exhibited higher use of urbanized areas in the summer compared to other seasons. Consistent with chapter two predictions, species richness of bats decreased with increasing urban intensity. Results from this study demonstrate that most bats in the community were sensitive to urbanization, which is potentially related to species traits and has important conservation implications. First, it is likely important to maintain high-quality undeveloped habitat with low anthropogenic disturbance in wildland areas for species that are sensitive to urbanization and to maximize species richness. In addition, for bats that are tolerant of urbanization and to increase species richness in urbanized areas, it is likely important to preserve resources in urbanized areas and increase landscape connectivity.

TI  - Response of waterbird communities to habitat and landscape structure along an urban gradient in Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Burnette, Riley
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of abundance and biodiversity. Additionally, urban rivers also offer environmental amenities and can be catalysts for social and economic revitalization in human communities. Despite its importance for both humans and wildlife, blue space in cities used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. My principal objective was to determine how urbanization and water availability affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. I surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a LTER long-term study system located in Phoenix, Arizona. Water physiognomy (shape and size) was the largest factor in shaping the bird community. Connectivity was an important element for waterbird diversity, but not abundance. Urbanization had guild-specific effects on abundance but was not important for waterbird diversity. Habitat-level environmental characteristics were more important than land use on waterbird abundance, as well as diversity. Diving and fish-eating birds were positively associated with large open bodies of water, whereas dabbling ducks, wading birds, and marsh species favored areas with large amounts of shoreline and emergent vegetation. My study supports that Phoenix blue space offers an important subsidy to migrating waterbird communities; while alternative habitat is not a replacement, it is important to consider as part of the larger conservation picture as traditional wetlands decline. Additionally, arid cities have the potential to support high levels of waterbird biodiversity, heterogeneous land use matrix can be advantageous in supporting regional diversity, and waterbirds are tolerant of urbanization if proper resources are provided via the habitat. The implications of this study are particularly relevant to urban planning in arid cities; Phoenix alone contains over 1,400 bodies of water, offering the opportunity to design and improve urban blue space to optimize potential habitat while providing public amenities.

AB  - Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species.Nick Fountain-Jones et al. use genomic and spatial data to examine how urbanization affects the spread of the pathogen feline immunodeficiency virus in pumas from areas of varying anthropogenic development. Their results show that landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation in virus spread in a region bounded by urban development but did not in a more wild landscape, demonstrating how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread.

AB  - Why do planners need to look beyond protecting particular species and their habitats? Why it is important to plan for the natural environment at a whole landscape scale and to connect wildlife habitats together? Why should planners help nature to recolonize towns and cities—and how best can they do this? In seeking the answers to such questions, this book provides a foundation for planners and other related professionals in the areas of biodiversity, the natural environment, and how to apply them in practice. The book looks at how natural environment policy has shifted from the protection of rare species and nature reserves to a more holistic approach, based on biodiversity. Beginning with a brief history of environmental movements, the guide then focuses on changing approaches to conserving the natural environment. It explains environmental sustainability approaches as well as techniques for planners, using ideas such as environmental capacity and natural capital and, more recently, ecosystem services and multi-functional solutions. It addresses issues of spatial scale, connectivity, and ecological networks, recognizing that small nature reserves are vulnerable and lack the resilience to substantially change. Other key topics include rebuilding biodiversity through habitat creation, enhancement, and restoration, along with the "re-naturing" of cities. The tools and policy are laid out before identifying key lessons and implications for future policy development and planning practice.

AB  - Background: The KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZN SS) is a grassland ecosystem categorised as endangered by the terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). Pressure from urbanisation has led to the remaining areas of the KZN SS being physically fragmented, causing low connectivity levels which have diminished the biological persistence of this ecosystem.Objectives: This study aimed to quantify the overall level of habitat fragmentation of the KZN SS and determine the level of connectivity within the ecosystem, and patches of the KZN SS occurring in the eThekwini Municipal area. Using graph theory, we compared the effectiveness of broad-scale and fine-scale data sets in quantifying habitat fragmentation.Methods: The Conefor Sensinode software, which employs the bases of graph theory, was chosen to aid in assessing fragmentation levels. The integral index of connectivity (IIC) (values range from 0 to 1, with 1 highlighting optimal connectivity) was chosen as the best index to determine landscape connectivity.Results: The KZN SS was shown to be highly fragmented, especially at dispersal distances less than 500 m. This resulted in very low connectivity levels, with the highest IIC value recorded at 0.0063. Moreover, the use of either fine-scale or broad-scale data to measure connectivity differed substantially at 1000 m.Conclusion: Broad-scale data were shown to overestimate habitat fragmentation and underestimate landscape connectivity. A more apt description of KZN SS connectivity levels was realised with fine-scale data. This study recommends that crucial KZN SS patches be prioritised to safeguard this endangered ecosystem.

AB  - Habitat degradation can reduce or even prevent the reproduction of previously abundant plant species. To develop appropriate management strategies, we need to understand the reasons for reduced recruitment in degraded ecosystems. The dioecious coco de mer palm (Lodoicea maldivica) produces by far the largest seeds of any plant. It is a keystone species in an ancient palm forest that occurs only on two small islands in the Seychelles, yet contemporary rates of seed production are low, especially in fragmented populations. We developed a method to infer the recent reproductive history of female trees from morphological evidence present on their inflorescences. We then applied this method to investigate the effects of habitat disturbance and soil nutrient conditions on flower and fruit production. The 57 female trees in our sample showed a 19.5‐fold variation in flower production among individuals over a seven‐year period. Only 77.2% of trees bore developing fruits (or had recently shed fruits), with the number per tree ranging from zero to 43. Flower production was positively correlated with concentrations of available soil nitrogen and potassium and did not differ significantly between closed and degraded habitat. Fruiting success was positively correlated with pollen availability, as measured by numbers and distance of neighboring male trees. Fruit set was lower in degraded habitat than in closed forest, while the proportion of abnormal fruits that failed to develop was higher in degraded habitat. Seed size recorded for a large sample of seeds collected by forest wardens varied widely, with fresh weights ranging from 1 to 18 kg. Synthesis: Shortages of both nutrients and pollen appear to limit seed production of Lodoicea in its natural habitat, with these factors affecting different stages of the reproductive process. Flower production varies widely amongst trees, while seed production is especially low in degraded habitat. The size of seeds is also very variable. We discuss the implications of these findings for managing this ecologically and economically important species.

AU  - Zhang, Yuan Si
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - As one of the most important ecological corridor, river has deep influence on bio-diversity, energy transferring, water recycle, etc. The urbanization undertaking in many cities in China has caused serious ecological crisis, especially in water ecology and water environment security. City lakes and rivers, polluted by large-scale manmade construction, are facing problems such as eutrophication, loss of wildlife habitats, and excessive reclamation, etc. On the other hand, the urban space, devoured by commerce, residence, office buildings, etc., is lack of public open space. With living standard improving, green space in city is needed more and more. Based on such background, the project is due to study the river ecological restoration and recreational development. According to the general urban planning of Wuhan in 2020 and the East Lake water system restoration planning, this project chooses the site between East Lake and Yangchun Lake. The site is in the urban-rural ecotone and is now facing the problem of urbanization. It has serious contradiction between ecological security and urban construction. The project is focused on dealing with the contradiction and combining ecological restoration and recreation together.Among the many elements influencing eco-system in the site, I focus on transportation because large traffic not only has very deep influence on wildlife habitats, physical environment and vegetation distribution, but also brings with manmade construction and urban development. So take control of transportation is to some extent limit the urbanization of this site. The project plans a wetland system to control the impact of traffic and turns the adjacent area of freeway into a recreational wetland park.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are imposing barriers for wildlife, and the additive effect of urban and agricultural development that dominates the lower Great Lakes region likely further reduces functional connectivity for many terrestrial species. As the climate warms, species will need to track climate across these barriers. It is important therefore to investigate land cover and bioclimatic hypotheses that may explain the northward expansion of species through the Great Lakes. We investigated the functional connectivity of a vagile generalist, the bobcat, as a representative generalist forest species common to the region. We genotyped tissue samples collected across the region at 14 microsatellite loci and compared different landscape hypotheses that might explain the observed gene flow or functional connectivity. We found that the Great Lakes and the additive influence of forest stands with either low or high canopy cover and deep lake‐effect snow have disrupted gene flow, whereas intermediate forest cover has facilitated gene flow. Functional connectivity in southern Ontario is relatively low and was limited in part by the low amount of forest cover. Pathways across the Great Lakes were through the Niagara region and through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan over the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Marys River. These pathways are important routes for bobcat range expansion north of the Great Lakes and are also likely pathways that many other mobile habitat generalists must navigate to track the changing climate. The extent to which species can navigate these routes will be important for determining the future biodiversity of areas north of the Great Lakes.

TI  - Mapping the Flow of Forest Migration through the City under Climate Change
AU  - Han, Qiyao
AU  - Keeffe, Greg
T2  - Urban Planning
AB  - Rapid climate change will create extreme problems for the biota of the planet. Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on “where tree species should be in the future” and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The resulting maps identify areas with high probability of climate-driven migration of trees.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - High-volume hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) for natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (underlying about 24 mil ha in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, and Virginia) has become a politically charged issue, primarily because of concerns about drinking water safety and human health. This paper examines fracking in the Marcellus region, and the tradeoffs between the energy and economic potential of natural gas extraction and the environmental impacts on wildlife. Therefore, we introduce a new E3 analysis that combines the costs and benefits as regards energy, economics, and the environment. The Marcellus Shale has the most proven reserves of natural gas of any basin in the United States, at 129 trillion cubic feet. Income from natural gas development comes primarily from direct and indirect jobs, and induced jobs (those created when direct workers spend their earnings in a community), taxes and fees, and royalty and lease payments to rights holders. Fracking, however, has detrimental effects on wildlife and wildlife habitats. Terrestrial habitat effects are primarily due to landscape fragmentation from the clearing of land for pipeline and well pad development, which often removes mature forest and creates open corridors and edge habitats. An increase in forest edge and open corridors is associated with shifts in the bird community, as generalist species that do well around people increase in abundance, while forest specialists decline. Invasive plants associated with disturbance further degrade forest habitats. Aquatic habitats are also affected, both directly and indirectly. Hydraulic fracturing requires up to 20 mil L of water per well fracture, most of which comes from surface water sources in the Marcellus region. The removal of water, especially in smaller headwaters, can increase sedimentation, alter water temperature and change its chemistry, resulting in reductions in aquatic biodiversity. Given the reality that hydraulic fracturing will continue, there is a need to develop practices that best minimize negative impacts on terrestrial and aquatic habitats, as well as policies and the resolve to enforce these practices. To achieve a more sustainable balance between economic, energy, and environmental costs and benefits, we recommend that industry, scientists, non-governmental organizations, mineral rights holders, landowners, and regulators work together to develop a set of best management practices that represent the best knowledge available.

T2  - IOP Conference Series. Earth and Environmental Science
AB  - Lacus Creek is one of the important tributaries of the Laonong River upstream of the Gaoping River, which is an important river in southern Taiwan. After Typhoon Morakot in 2009, severe sediment disasters occurred, which affected the security of local revitalization, and the government has since invested in numerous projects to reduce the impact of sediment and flood disasters. In 2017, the Kaohsiung City government built a sabo type dam upstream of Fuxing Bridge in Lacus Creek; however, it was severely damaged by a heavy rain less than a year later. To investigate the cause of the damage, site investigations, concrete sampling tests, hydrology analysis, and reviews of the planning and design methods, construction process, etc. have been conducted, in order to understand the cause of the problem, avoid repeating mistakes, and clarify the responsibility of the administrative agency. The investigation and research found that many recent cases of torrent management have considered the transverse structures as isolated wildlife corridors, reduce the height of the transverse structures, create gentle slopes of the downstream surfaces, add fish passages, cut (openings) export slits, etc.; however, after setting up these environmentally friendly facilities, their effect and impact have not been explored in depth. This research survey found that, although the frequency of heavy rain events is not high in recent years, the current iterative impact of continuous rainfall may exceed the original design requirements. If the overflow mode with a single export opening is added, the scouring energy will be concentrated, and this additive effect is likely to cause the foundation of the sabo dam to lose bare space, and finally, the dam will be damaged. Therefore, it is recommended that when designing these torrent transverse structures, try to avoid using the method of a single narrow opening: it is better to increase the number of export openings (like a slit dam), expand the size of a single export opening, or adopt a fully enclosed dam design.

AB  - Protected areas are considered the cornerstone of endangered wildlife conservation. However, quantified conservation potentials and limitations of large carnivores in protected areas are lacking. In the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park (NTLNP) in China, our camera trap survey in 2019 found 26–27 adult Amur tigers and 49–59 adult Amur leopards occurring in the park. Based on spatial area, current prey populations, and environmental carrying capacity of prey, we estimated the supportable number of tigers to be 55, 90, and 101 individuals, respectively. For leopard, these values were 95, 356, and 572, respectively. Further simulations indicated that human land use change scenarios did not contribute much to increasing the potential prey‐supportable populations of Amur tiger and leopard. Our results showed that the number of tigers and leopards in NTLNP is currently low and has a high recovery potential. However, even the highest supportable population is not enough to support the sustainable existence of an Amur tiger population. Therefore, we suggest that, in addition to further restoration and improvement of the prey population and habitat quality in NTLNP, managers should strengthen the connectivity between NTLNP and other habitat patches to form a well‐connected network of protected areas. Promoting the spread of tigers and leopards outwards from this source population in NTLNP through ecological corridor construction would enlarge the area of habitat and is a crucial measure for realizing the sustainable survival of an Amur tiger population in Northeast China.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the agents that contribute most to habitat fragmentation and is therefore a threat to biodiversity conservation. Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment. Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units. In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality. The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard. This can be used to support conservation plans based on habitat connectivity.

AB  - Researchers and managers of natural resource conservation have increasingly emphasized the importance of maintaining a connected network of important ecological patches to mitigate landscape fragmentation, reduce the decline of biodiversity, and sustain ecological services. This research aimed to guide landscape management and decision-making by developing an evaluation framework to construct ecological security patterns. Taking the Jianghan Plain as the study area, we identified key ecological sources by overlaying the spatial patterns of ecological quality (biodiversity, carbon storage, and water yield) and ecological sensitivity (habitat sensitivity, soil erosion sensitivity, and water sensitivity) using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and the Chinese Soil Loss Equation Function. Ecological corridors were obtained by the least-cost path analysis method and circuit theory. A total of 48 ecological sources (3812.95 km2), primarily consisting of water area, forestland, and cropland, were identified. Ninety-one ecological corridors were derived, with a total length of 2036.28 km. Forty barriers and 40 pinch points with the highest improvement coefficient scores or priority scores were selected. There were 11 priority corridors with very high levels of connectivity improvement potential and conservation priority, occupying 16.15% of the total length of corridors. The overall potential for ecological connectivity is high on the Jianghan Plain. Our framework offers a valuable reference for constructing ecological security patterns and identifying sites for ecological restoration at the regional scale.

AB  - Organismos internacionales recomiendan un mínimo de área verde por persona en el equipamiento de las ciudades, así como el que dichas áreas estén a no más de 15min caminado desde los domicilios. La ciudad de Puebla, México, no cumple estas recomendaciones, presentando tan solo 2,8m2 per cápita de área verde y una distribución altamente heterogénea. Dentro de la mancha urbana no hay espacio para habilitar áreas verdes ya que todo está ocupado por edificaciones. Sin embargo, existe un sistema de barrancas que entrecruza la ciudad y que si se le revalora y recupera, puede contribuir a abatir dicha deficiencia. Las barrancas son depresiones geográficas originadas por actividad volcánica y erosión hídrica de los escurrimientos pluviales de la montaña La Malinche. Actualmente son usadas como cloacas a cielo abierto, tiraderos de basura, sitios de asentamientos humanos irregulares y algunas de ellas han sido rellenadas. Sin embargo, tales espacios proporcionan servicios ecosistémicos a la ciudad, como el de ser corredores ecológicos donde flora y fauna nativa encuentran refugio. De ahí la necesidad de desarrollar líneas de investigación y una política integral de recuperación y manejo de barrancas, a fin de potencializar sus servicios como el de constituirse en nuevas áreas verdes.

TI  - A multi-scale exploration into the spatial patterns of a three dimensional urban tree infrastructure (uti): integrating landscape connectivity, network resilience, and social deprivation
AU  - Bishop, O. J.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - A functionally connected urban tree infrastructure (UTI) contributes to ecosystem function, resilience, and the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Variation in tree height is an important attribute influencing movement of passerines, habitat quality and landscape patterns. UTI provided ES are particularly beneficial in the most deprived areas of a city. Presented in this thesis is an exploration into the social-ecological shape of a UTI using a holistic, multi-scale and dimensional, landscape approach. The potential landscape connectivity of a UTI in the City of Salford, UK was quantified and compared using the integral index of connectivity (IIC) across vertically stratified canopies existing in 2005, 2009, and 2013. System resilience was assessed through landscape graph network analysis and by the identification of canopies critical in maintaining connectivity (dIIC). The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was related to UTI landscape composition and configuration through a series of statistical tests. The connectivity of Salford’s vertically stratified UTI was low (IIC = <0.000001 – 0.0045), besides this the temporal change in connectivity was complex with no discernible overall pattern. The rate of connectivity increase decreased after a 90-120m gap-crossing threshold. The resilience of Salford’s UTI relies on the connectivity of canopies within 4 to 5 sub-connected regions, depending on passerine perception, increasing to 10 -16 smaller regions for canopies above 17.1m. The resilience and stability of these sub-connected regions were often reliant on a central canopy patch. UTI composition is related negatively with deprivation, UTI configuration is related positively, while structural diversity of canopy heights revealed no correlation with deprivation. The research in this thesis contributes to the debates on how to best manage the UTI for both people and nature. The findings of this thesis have a number of important implications for future urban landscape management, especially as previously unknown landscape patterns have been identified.

AB  - Humans have created an accelerating, increasingly connected, globalized economy, resulting in a more globalized, shared flora. The prevention of new, establishing species is less costly, both economically and ecologically, and is more manageable than eradicating nonnative invasive species once they are widespread and negatively impactful. We ask if international trade hubs and points-of-entry with high-volume trade, constant disturbance, and propagule rain have a higher number of nonnative species compared to surrounding areas and if they may serve as initial establishment sites and refugia of nonnative, invasive populations. Therefore, we partnered with various federal, state, and private interests to evaluate the floristic composition at the Garden City Terminal of the Port of Savannah, Georgia, USA. We conducted the following study to demonstrate the collaborative relationship-building between researchers and industry and to develop a framework for biodiversity conservation. In our study, we collected all reproductive vascular plants in the secured areas of the Garden City Terminal during four major seasonal time points over two years. The percent of nonnative species and number of nonnative plant species per hectare at this industrial location exceeded all other comparison floras. The mean coefficient of conservatism was lowest among the comparison floras, indicating a highly disturbed habitat with nonnative, weedy native, and other native species tolerant of disturbance. Our study represents one of the first inventories of an Industrialized Flora and indicates that such areas are hot-spots of nonnative plant diversity and possible sources of emergent plant invasions. We posit that industrial sites and international points-of-entry should be considered laboratories for research on species transport and introduction, adaptability, and taxonomic delineation to better understand the mechanisms and consequences of biotic homogenization due to the volume and frequency of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The rapid expansion of the global human footprint is forcing humans and wildlife to share more space. There is rising concern over human wildlife conflict and its effects on human and animal wellbeing. Investigation into the biophysical and social landscape features that shape conflict or how spatial patterns in conflict ultimately affect species’ movement or survival is limited. Characterizing landscape connectivity and identifying potential movement corridors is a key conservation strategy, but is challenged by the fact that many wildlife species navigate a mosaic of infrastructure, available habitat, land uses, and political boundaries. In this thesis, I investigated the social and biophysical factors that contribute to conflict with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and how this conflict may impact connectivity for bears across southern British Columbia and northern Washington. I selected this system due to its rich cultural history with grizzly bear biological and social complexity. The region has current grizzly bear populations, extirpated areas, state/provincial and international boundaries, diverse land uses, and a variety of social values towards wildlife. I used two resource selection approaches to first determine the probability of conflict reporting across all wildlife species, and then to determine the probability of bear conflict specifically. First, I used presence and background sampling in combination with Bayesian logistic regression to identify important predictors of conflict across species using 5,606 reported instances of conflict and 8,703 background points. Then, I fit a second regression treating 2,062 bear conflict occurrences as presence points and 3,544 instances of other conflict as absences to characterize how bear conflict might differ from wildlife conflict in general.I found that predictors of conflict differed between species and that the probability of general wildlife conflict was substantially different than the probability of bear conflict across the study system. The strongest predictors of conflict for all species were human population density and both livestock and row-crop operation density. The strongest predictors of bear conflict were public opinion of bears, proximity to existing grizzly bear populations, and suitable bear habitat. Generating spatial predictions on these models indicates that the urban centers of the Okanagan (e.g., Kelowna, Vernon) are hotspots for general wildlife conflict while the semi-urban and rural agriculture landscapes (e.g., outside Penticton and along the US and Canada border) are hotspots for bear conflict (Chapter 1). I then incorporated spatial predictions of the probability of bear conflict into the resistance surface for a connectivity model across the traditional territory of the Sylix people to investigate how spatial patterns of conflict may impact bear movement and the ability to recolonize the traditional Sylix territory. I used Omniscape to model connectivity as a function of biophysical variables to identify the most likely available movement pathways and compared this to model outputs that incorporated the probability of conflict into the resistance surface to determine the effects of conflict on grizzly bear connectivity. My research highlights the role that social and institutional variables play in conflict and how these effects may differ between species. Further, my results illustrate the potential for conflict to constrain wildlife movement and highlight the need to treat connectivity conservation as a socio-ecological issue rather than just an ecological one.

AB  - Estuaries are essential to the continued existence of five million waterfowl that migrate through the 'Pacific Flyway' moving from estuary to estuary along the entire coast of British Columbia. These birds require intact estuaries to survive. This is recognized by Ducks Unlimited, the Nature Conservancy of Canada and all of their donors as well as the federal and provincial governments as evidenced by the creation of the Pacific Estuary Conservation Program (PECP) to acquire and protect estuaries along the coast of B.C. PECP has spent over $25 million to acquire estuarine lands on the B.C. coast.Official Community Plan, Appendix B Section 4.3.2 Campbell River and Abutting Lands. 4.3.2 'The Campbell River Estuary Development Permit Area' - this key location provides the opportunity to protect the fragile environment of the estuary, and assist with the creation of a 'gateway' to Campbell River from the north via Highway 19. Planning for the potential development is important to ensure efficient use of this land, ensure the least impact possible to the natural environment and seek to redevelop this area as a gateway to Campbell River. The estuary and its adjacent lands provide essential habitat corridors for fish, birds, and other wildlife. They also act as natural water storage, drainage, and purifying systems. Riparian areas need to remain in a largely undisturbed state in order to protect habitat, prevent flooding, control erosion, reduce sedimentation, and recharge groundwater.In September, 2003, a Small Communities Workshop on Smart Growth was held in council chambers. Mr. Nash, Mr. Cornfield, Mr. Stanton and I heard how small B.C. communities have dealt with the challenges of growth. The communities that have failed to build beautiful cities were those that lack vision. I believe that message was clear to those present; perhaps it was not a new message, because only a few weeks later a press release from City Hall described a vision building session held by council. I know council will continue these visioning sessions in the summer, due to your leadership on this issue. This vision includes acquisition of waterfront property, restoration of the Campbell River estuary, and providing economic diversity for Campbell River. This vision is clear. This vision does not include rezoning this parcel for this type of development.

AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and invasive species. The fruit‐eating red‐vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red‐vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S. terebinthifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio‐tagged red‐vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M. rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15–41 min), corresponding to short‐distance seed transportation (77–92 m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S. terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M. rufopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high‐concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non‐native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

AB  - Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) is a global concern that requires geospatial data collection, analysis and geovisualization for decision support and mitigation. Bull African elephants, (Loxodonata africana), are often responsible for breaking fences, raiding crops and causing economic hardship in local communities in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Methods for monitoring and understanding elephant movements are needed to mitigate conflict, find ways for coexistence and secure the future of Africa’s elephant populations. Researchers from academia and conservation organizations are partnering with decision makers and scientists of the Zimbabwe Department of National Park and Wild Life Management (PWMA) to track the movement of 15 bull elephants in the general area of Victoria Falls to analyse spatio-temporal patterns of elephant behaviour related to climatic factors, habitat conditions and changing land uses. Spatial decision support for local famers, resource managers and planners will assist in avoiding agricultural expansion and urban development that coincides with elephant corridors and access to water resources.

AB  - This study shows that an integrated ecological and cultural corridor network can help guide city development strategies to better preserve ecological and cultural assets. Traditionally, protection zones and suitable development areas are often identified by separately considering natural elements of the ecosystem and elements of cultural significance. To achieve the purpose of cohesively protecting areas of ecological and/or cultural significance, we have developed a corridor-based spatial framework by integrating ecological and cultural assets. Ecological sources are identified by combining protection prioritization, nature reserves, and water bodies. Ecological corridors are delineated by using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model on a resistance surface constructed from land-use data to connect ecological sources. Ecologically important areas are then delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from ecological sources and ecological corridors. Cultural corridors are historical routes and rivers surrounded by abundant cultural nodes. Like ecologically important areas, culturally important areas are delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from cultural corridors. Comprehensive regions are the overlap of ecologically and culturally important areas. Finally, the integrated network connects all comprehensive regions following ecological corridors and cultural corridors in such a way that the largest number of ecological sources and cultural nodes are reached. We applied this framework in Beijing, China, and the results show that there are 2011 km2 of ecological sources, 30 ecological corridors, 423 cultural nodes, seven cultural corridors, and 10 comprehensive regions covering 2916 km2 in the integrated network. The framework adds new insights to the methodology of considering ecological and cultural assets together in developing protection and development strategies.

AB  - The predominant approach in visual studies, explicitly focusing on how vision is socioculturally constructed, tends to neglect the physiological substrate for vision. Images, and our visual surroundings, are often considered from the premise that those dealing with them specifically see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. I set out to question this premise and the normalisation of vision it implies, by drawing on accounts of seeing by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. His well-articulated verbal description of the requirements involved in his seeing makes it clear that our vision is tightly intertwined with visuality. Our visual surroundings are the way they are partially on account of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, "they are designed for average eyesight." I posit that the concept of activated affordances is useful for taking into account that vision is socially constructed, as suggested in important works in visual studies, and that physiological substrates for vision exhibit variation. I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area for Conrad in which visuality is lived out differently in accordance with how this eyesight happens to manifest itself. Conrad's use of "social hacks" provides a case in point for discussing how Conrad activates affordances in unforeseen ways, in order to fulfil desires for socially meaningful action that does not reduce him to stereotypical behaviour when being treated as visually impaired. Maintaining that vision and visuality remain difficult to disentangle, I will argue that we all see with special requirements, even if we might not notice this. For studies of visuality, I suggest reflecting on presumed understandings of vision. The argument in textual form is complemented with a brief video that features an edited interview focusing on Conrad's account of seeing with special requirements. It is supported with visualisations representing an attempt to render aspects of his seeing. Instead of purporting to visualise exactly how he sees, I intend the imagery to provoke reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via our ability to see and by the social construction of what to see.28228_UF0001.jpgDr. Asko Lehmuskallio is a researcher at the School of Communication, Media and Theatre at the University of Tampere and at Locating Media at the University of Siegen.

Studies both of images and of our visual surroundings often proceed from an implicit premise that those dealing with them see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses.Here, I question this premise and the normalisation of vision implied, by drawing on accounts of seeing offered by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. As his eloquent verbalisation of the requirements for seeing makes clear, our vision is closely intertwined with visuality.1 In part, our visual surroundings are the way they are because of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, "they are designed for average eyesight."In the discussion that follows, I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area where visuality is lived out differently depending on the kind of eyesight one happens to have. I wish to argue that we all see with special requirements, and that our requirements linked to seeing differ, depending on our physiological substrate for vision. When attending to designed environments, we situationally adapt to prescribed ways of seeing that are culturally and ideologically formed. I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is helpful for taking into account both the physiological substrate for vision needed for seeing and the cultural and ideological formations that suggest which affordances get activated instead of others.2The argument in textual form is complemented by a brief video that includes an edited interview focusing on an account of seeing with special requirements. The interview is supported with visualisations intended to render aspects of Conrad's seeing. Instead of claiming to visualise exactly how Conrad sees, I use the imagery to stimulate reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via both our ability to see and the social construction of what to see.3A PARADOX IN VISUAL STUDIES: THE NORMALISATION OF VISIONIn a well-regarded preface to an edited work on vision and visuality, Hal Foster explains how scopic regimes seek to essentialise vision, naturalising and normalising a certain way to see. He maintains that although vision is based on physiological processes, it is also very much culturally and socially informed. Sight and its techniques intertwine in ways that make them difficult to disentangle, whereas vision and visuality remain woven together.4Much of the important and influential work published in visual culture studies tends to focus on the latter, the social construction of practices related to vision and visuality, emphasising ways in which power structures, visual orders, scopic regimes, and various gazes direct our attention, our ways of looking, and the meanings that we give to what we see. In doing so, they situate observers, subjects, or bodies within nuanced patterns of power-laden and structured visual interactions.5These studies explicitly work with the social construction of vision and constitute attempts to uncover asymmetric power structures and to counter them. While doing so, much of this work takes implicitly a particular physiological substrate of vision for granted, although influential figures such as Foster or Mitchell warn against doing so.6 In many of these studies, pictures and the mental images they occasion are deemed so powerful because people can see them. Studies on visual culture seldom reflect from this perspective the premises behind their work; paradoxically, it seems that much of the work explicitly questioning a normalised visuality as socially constructed normalises the physiological substrate of vision.7I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is useful for understanding the intertwinement of vision and visuality, of how bodies and their environments merge within seeing, helping to point both towards affordances as a relation needed for seeing in the first place and to their activation as a particular cultural form of attention and meaning-making.James J. Gibson coined the term affordance to discuss the complementarity of animals and persons with their environments.8 Affordances, in Gibson's understanding, always describe relations between living beings and their particular environments, and these relations depend both on the living beings and on the environments in question. For example, a small mobile phone screen is perceivable, readable, and therefore usable for text messaging by those with sufficiently good eyesight (for perception and reading) and adequate motor skills (for texting) but not, for example, by many elderly individuals with poor eyesight. The latter can perceive the mobile phone's screen but, because of both poor eyesight and the limited screen size, cannot read it. The mobile phone does not afford them the same kinds of uses it affords others. Gibson's use of the notion of affordance is of assistance for pointing towards the relationality and variety of affordances, but he does not give culturally sensitive explanations addressing why some affordances are preferred over others.For accounting for cultural contextualisations, it is useful to think of activated affordances if one wishes to comprehend the actual use of particular objects, and how their use is embedded in social meanings, as Gillian Rose has proposed in her work on everyday photography.9 The focus on the activation of affordances is useful for pointing to culturally meaningful ways of interacting in visual environments. In Conrad's case, as will be shown later, there is, for example, an explicit activation of coarse-level visual features of friends and colleagues for purposes of identifying them (among these are hair type/style, colour of clothing, and ways of walking), because this kind of activation of affordances is socially meaningful. Being able to identify someone as an individual person is very much encouraged, at least in the so-called Western societies, and, for doing so, some affordances have to be activated rather than others. The affordances available depend, again, not only on the social construction of seeing but also, just as much, on the particular ways in which we are able to see.Conrad's account of the visual frictions encountered in his everyday life is useful for a discussion on how the affordances activated depend both on socially meaningful action and on the physical opportunities for action available to each of us. Mitchell has importantly pointed out that "[i]t is not just that we see the way we do because we are social animals, but also that our social arrangements take the forms they do because we are seeing animals."10 Unfortunately for those seeing with special requirements, many social environments continue to be designed with average eyesight in mind.SEEING WITH SPECIAL REQUIREMENTSConrad provides a good example for a discussion on this possible normalisation of vision and the way in which it rests on particular assumptions about visualities, especially regarding designed environments. Many do not necessarily recognise that Conrad is visually impaired, because he tends to act and talk in ways that do not distinguish him from most others. Although he wears thick eyeglasses, it is not clear to many people that he actually sees very differently than many others do. Whereas he is thus able to "blend in" in diverse situations, he does so by activating other affordances than most people with average eyesight do. Where this possibility is not available, he finds that many have a hard time even believing him to need help when he expresses this need.I have many situations in which people don't really realize how much I see, because I have so many tricks, and I hack myself through life somehow. So a lot of times when I tell them I am visually impaired, they sort of don't believe me, and that is a really big problem for me when I try to achieve accessibility or equal behavior, or something like that.11Conrad has created social hacks, particular activations of affordances that enable him to interact such that his special requirements in seeing are not that readily noticed. These social hacks provide him with a way of rendering his behaviour in front of others so that his actions are not constrained beforehand for reason of his vision. When acting as yet another person who sees as everyone else does, and thereby as someone who is able to navigate built environments and social situations as those with average eyesight do, Conrad allows himself to be drawn into situations that he might not enter if others made judgements in keeping with his impairments in vision.Conrad would not differ from most other people if his visual system were more commonplace. His use of the concept of seeing with special requirements implies that all human beings have particular requirements for their sensory perception and action upon the environment, and that these requirements differ from person to person, just as Gibson suggests with the notion of affordance.As the examples Conrad cites from his life experience make clear, many designed environments are geared towards those with average eyesight, disrupting their use by people with different visual systems. Even everyday utility articles and artefacts such as computers, houses, or cars are often designed for people with normalised, average vision. Conrad points out:[I]f they would be just slightly changed in their designs to meet my requirements, I wouldn't have so many problems actually getting around in the world. If I use the term 'people with special requirements', it always implies that it's not my fault that I can't do this thing at the moment or can't operate this machine or that it takes much longer, but it's actually the fault of the design, because [the problematic element or item] wasn't designed for my requirements but was designed for someone else's requirements.Here, vision and visuality intertwine in ways that show how a variety of designed environments rely on an assumption of average eyesight, a necessary condition for taking up a relation, an affordance, in the first place. Thus, designed artefacts are socially constructed to fit the requirements of particular kinds of people.12 Slight changes in designed environments could enable a better fit between Conrad's body and the material artefacts around him, but designed environments tend to be oriented towards normalised vision rather than allowing for other kinds of activations, such as Conrad's social hacks discussed below.13 Whereas, as Gibson suggests, these differences between individuals may vary significantly, too often there is the tendency to think in discreet binaries, such as normal and special, leading to design decisions that do not take variety into account.14 Acknowledging we all have special requirements in seeing is helpful for deconstructing this binary opposition.FLUID BOUNDARIES OF THE BODYWe need a particular physiological substrate for vision if we are to act in environments designed for average eyesight.15 Perhaps, because of the need to adapt to these environments in order to participate in the diverse social interactions presented, devices that allow eyesight that is closer to average eyesight can be felt to be almost as necessary as parts of the body, as is the case with Conrad. Devices modifying our bodies can afford seeing and acting in environments designed for average eyesight: One's body has to be moulded if it is to fit these designed environments. Conrad makes this relation explicit by stating that "my glasses are not really an object for me; they are more a part of my body like an arm or something like that." His eyeglasses enable him to partake in meaningful social relations, to activate affordances he would not be able to activate without them.The boundaries of his body are described as not neatly contained but, rather, fluid, such that some material artefacts can be felt to be, in essence, body parts, not that different from an arm or fingers, for example. This understanding provides an example suitable for advancing the thesis of relationality of affordances, particularly addressing how the designed environments we act upon might mould and modify both our bodies and our understandings of them. This fluidity of bodily boundaries becomes understandable when the role of our bodies as a medium for action is underscored, as done in theories of media put forth by John Durham Peters and Hans Belting, among others.16 Our bodies, once moulded, afford novel relations to our environments, a novel fit, and this novel fit might be achieved through glasses, mobile phones, and/or other kinds of artefacts, effectively enabling the distribution and mediation of our selves.17Action in environments designed for the requirements of average eyesight necessitates media that facilitate it. For some, the physical body itself provides a sufficient medium for doing so, being capable of adapting to the requirements of average eyesight in various environments; however, ever more people need specially fabricated eyewear in order to achieve fit with their environments. There is constant need for spectacles, contact lenses, and other media for being able to see in environments designed for average eyesight.SOCIAL HACKSAlthough Conrad's glasses feel more like a part of the body for him, he continues to see differently than those who by wearing spectacles approximate normal vision. When using eyeglasses, he must still rely on more prominent features of the people and objects he perceives, thereby explicitly activating affordances that he can rely upon in order to act in a socially meaningful way.Normally, I can't recognise people by their face when they are decently far away, so I use a lot of rough features, like what their body structure looks like, what kind of hairstyle they have, and how they walk. I even try to remember what clothes they wear. It's easy to recognise people by how they walk, because a lot of people walk very distinctively. When they move their upper torso, or even how the body proportions are, how long the legs are and so forth. It all influences how people walk, so this makes it very easy for me to recognise people. [...] I'm very conscious about that.Body movements, colour of clothing, and hairstyle become particularly important since they remain recognisable cues for Conrad. Although those with average eyesight too notice these aspects of those they interact with, this often remains implicit and has to be brought up directly before it is considered, as has been discussed with regard to habitus.18This friction in fitting within designed environments and social situations whose assumptions rely on average eyesight calls particularly in unfamiliar situations for Conrad's so-called social hacking, a particular way of activating affordances, allowing him to explore novel kinds of relations that enable him to circumvent his special requirements. In social hacking, Conrad activates other affordances than people with average eyesight do, with the intention to approximate a socially accepted behaviour that does not reveal his visual impairment.When I go through the world, one technique that I use is that I always ask people a lot of things if I can't see it or get that information at the moment. So I would even ask indirectly whether something is going on in the street. If I don't see what's going on, I ask people what it is.Ordering food at a restaurant might be such a situation. If it is Conrad's first time at the restaurant and its offerings are not known to him beforehand, Conrad has to rely on a variety of techniques that those with average eyesight do not need. Since he is often unable to read the menu, which where we met (in San Francisco's Bay Area) was often behind the counter, Conrad has to socially hack. Because he cannot identify what is on offer, he has to ask for recommendations, order what someone else is eating or has ordered, just point at some food, or ask about food for special diets (such as vegetarian food). These social hacks circumvent the problem that designed environments do not always afford him the same information that these environments do for those with average eyesight. Many of these social hacks might be used by those with average eyesight as well, but then for other reasons than not being able to read the menu behind the counter.Also, computation devices allow Conrad to gather information about upcoming situations, helping him navigate in environments he cannot see. These devices allow Conrad to plan some of his actions in advance, so that he knows how to act in social situations that entail partial reliance on average eyesight. One of his situational social hacks is to look up the menu of a restaurant on that venue's Web site before going there, so that he knows what is available.The role that these devices receive in Conrad's day-to-day life has become very intimate, since they help him to expand his experiences of the environment, affording him relations he might not engage in without them. As Conrad points out, these devices become a bit like friends, in that they facilitate his every day.They help me a lot, I give an input and the machine replies. All of them actually have a name: my computer, my phone, my Kindle. I name them. They are active, they reply to what I say.Whereas, for Conrad, eyeglasses feel like a part of the body, computation devices end up taking on social roles, since they are even more integral to the many social situations he can navigate with their aid. Both glasses and computation devices enable him to activate affordances in designed environments that otherwise do not fit his requirements.CONCLUSIONSConrad's account of visual frictions in the course of his everyday life provides a case in point for considering how the physiological substrate for vision and the social construction of visuality are intertwined. The notion of activated affordances is helpful for stressing the relationality between these two with regard to the particular environments under discussion, by enabling particular attention to be paid to why some affordances are activated instead of others. Conrad's use of social hacking is a way to circumvent some of the restrictions he has for activating affordances in environments designed for those with average eyesight. In social hacking, Conrad seeks to activate other affordances in order to act in socially acceptable and meaningful ways, without having to take up the role of being visually impaired. Instead, he can act along with others taking other primary social roles, such as that of a student, an employee, or a young man, for example.For studies in visual culture, this case provides examples for considering both the role of embodied practices and that of material environments for grasping vision and visuality. Presentation of this material in textual form and also as a multimedia narrative allows for the depiction of slightly different readings, which get experienced differently. In line with who the reader or viewer is, this text and the accompanying video afford different kinds of relations, and perhaps some of these might get activated in unforeseen ways.With his eloquent descriptions of how he experiences his surroundings, Conrad reminds me of how we all deal with special requirements, all the time. Vision tests might prove that I see in a manner conforming to the ideals behind these tests, but the test results say little about the variance in seeing that we all experience. Aching, sore eyes after a day at a monitor or when out in the wind; the eyelids closing when one is trying to remain awake; and the assault of brightness after a night in the dark woods all are ways of seeing that entail a need to adapt to designed environments if one wants to take up a relation with them, thus activating an affordance.AcknowledgementsThis work would not have been possible without Conrad, who patiently and articulately told me about his ways of seeing and let me use his story originally as part of the attached video. In addition, Nancy Van House was particularly helpful in encouraging work on multimedia narrations and gave me the opportunity to follow and take part in the course she was leading at UC Berkeley. I am grateful also for the encouragement I received from friends and colleagues who have seen the video, particularly John Scott and Anna Shefl. Karin Becker was very helpful when I decided to complement the original video with the above text, and various colleagues within the Nordic Network for Digital Visuality have assisted greatly by showing me ways of combining textual and visual work within an academic framework. I would also like to thank colleagues at Locating Media for thoughtful discussions.Notes1. See also Hal Foster, "Preface," in Vision and Visuality, ed.

This article will specifically scrutinise how mobile phone cameras, digital photographing and the use of web-based photo-sharing sites and communities become part of the meaning-making practices through which the everyday is lived and understood. In doing so, I advance the concept of "mundane friction" through which to discuss the experience, meaning-making and pedagogy generated through operating screen-based technologies. Indeed, media participates in everyday worlds beyond its role as a provider of content and for communication. The question that will be addressed here is how this media presence can be understood from an embodied and sensory perspective, and is based in a study of sensory aspects of teenagers use of web-based photo-diaries. Further, this discussion leads to questions of how an appreciation of digital visuality as more than representational acknowledges the meaning of mundane friction caused by habitually touching, rubbing, clicking, pinching through media technologies as part of the sensory emplacement process that establish people as situated learners. In turn, problematising this tangible friction as pivotal for understanding digital visuality gives reason to argue for research methods that acknowledge digital visual material as more-than-visual and theory that moves toward the unspoken, tacit and sensory elements of learning in everyday practices. Thus, the aim of this article is to elaborate on the embodied, the methodological and the pedagogical dimensions of "mundane friction" in meaning-making activities, and its pedagogical implications.28237_UF0001.jpgVaike Fors is a teacher and researcher at Halmstad University in Sweden.

Email: vaike.fors@hh.seThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netThis article will advance the concept of "mundane friction" through which to discuss the experience, meaning-making and pedagogy generated through operating touchscreens and computer screens. The presented empirical examples originate from ethnographic work together with seven teenagers who showed us around on their favourite website, a web-based photo-diary. These examples are part of a larger study of how teenagers' use of image-based social networking sites becomes part of how teenagers learn and make sense in their everyday life, and the implications for this in museums.1 In doing so, this article will elaborate on how a sensory approach to touchscreens can contribute to the study of digital visuality. Visuality, in its own term, derives from Hal Fosters distinction between vision and visuality, and denotes the aspects of the visual that is socially and culturally constructed in various ways: "how we see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing and the unseeing therein."2 Through a sensory approach, this article will push the notion of visuality one step further, and not only discuss how the visual is socially constructed but also how visuality is in itself culturally constructed as distinctive from and in competition with other senses. Indeed, as media scholars like Elizabeth Edwards and Laura U Marks has convincingly suggested, vision is not purely visual, but a multisensory embodied experience, closely linked to touch and haptic perception. As Marks points out, in what she calls haptic visuality (as opposed to optical visuality), "the eyes themselves function as organs of touch" which leads to that "the viewer's body is more obviously involved in the process of seeing than in the case with optical visuality."3 Marks is concerned with what the focus on the optical brings with it in terms of how we might lose contact with the materiality of images; the tacit, sensory and embodied relationships between the viewer and the image. In line with this argument, but with an ethnographic approach that deviates from Marks' focus on spectatorship of moving images, I will here argue that digital visuality is inherently embodied since the digital invites people to touch, stroke, pinch, push, click touchscreens and other devices in daily routines and habits of taking, sharing and showing photos with camera phones. Even though large software and smartphone companies work hard and innovatively with creating "smooth" human-machine interfaces, there is an obvious, however not articulated, physical friction caused between the fingers/hands and the hardware in the daily use of these technologies. This daily and mundane friction between the hand/s and technologies plays a tangible role in the everyday learning strategies that develop through frequent use of digital visual media. Thus, "mundane frictions" is here used as a concept that might help us to move beyond simplified understandings of digital media practices as mainly actions of vision.The reason for doing so is not only to, on a methodological level, problematise digital visuality through a multisensory perspective, but also to discuss implications on a pedagogical level. It seems to be clear that the conditions for learning have changed through the emergence of ubiquitous digital media technologies. This insight has had major implications in educational settings on all levels, in the way educators try to adapt the learning situation accordingly with what affordances these technologies might be considered to offer.4 Research in this area is often occupied with understanding the technological interface between the user and digital educational tools and what the hardware and software enables from a didactic point of view. What is scarcely examined is how use of media technologies has an impact on people's everyday learning strategies, strategies that they bring with them into different, both informal and institutional, learning contexts.5 Ellsworth suggests that investigations in this neglected field actually can move learning theory further to acknowledge the embodied experience of change and motion.6 These routes to knowing might be hard to articulate since peoples life-world based learning resources cannot be treated as content; it consists of knowing that is "more-than-representational."7 This implies that it is a field within pedagogical studies in need of further development. How can a multisensory approach to digital media studies deepen our understandings of how media is part of our experiential ways of making sense of everyday life? This question will be elaborated on both a theoretical and pedagogical level in this article; however, the methodological implications of a multisensory approach toward studies of the use of digital media will be discussed first.SENSORY METHODOLOGIESThis article draws on an ethnographic study undertaken with a group of teenagers about their learning habits that emerged through their everyday use of digital media,8 and the pedagogical implications of this for museums. Following Gillian Rose's model of different sites and modalities for interpreting visual materials,9 this research focused on the social modalities of why and how the web-based visual materials were produced and how they were interpreted when viewed, thus leaving the compositional and technological modalities of the digital media aside. Furthermore, the aim was to investigate the ways in which teenagers are using digital photography in relation to the materialities of their environments alongside their use of web platforms and computing devices. Visual ethnographic methods were used to pay attention to the relationship between online and offline practices and the pedagogical implications of these practices in informal learning settings.10The study was exploratory in its design and probed teenagers' contemporary use of image-based digital media as emergent learning resources. The chosen research participants were specifically targeted as accustomed users of web-based media. All of them studied within a media-oriented program in a Swedish high school. This article draws on one specific part of the study in which the research participants showed me around on their favourite websites. These "computer-tours" showed that their favourite social media web page at the time was Bilddagboken.se (a web-based photo-diary). Bildagboken.se was then, according to the web site, one of the largest Swedish image-based social network sites. By the time of the study, it was primarily used by teenagers, and the interface allowed the user to upload images in a calendar and get comments from friends (see Picture 1).Fig 1Picture 1.  The web-based photo-diary Bilddagboken.se. The picture is made of a screen dump from the research material. Short descriptions of the features of the web page are marked in speech bubbles. Bilddagboken.se has now changed name to dayviews.comThe same year Bilddagboken.se was developed into Dayviews.com, it included 250,827,087 images and 100,000-500,000 pictures were uploaded everyday. Through interviews with teenage users, Lundmark and Normark noticed that the images were uploaded with a specific purpose; to be interesting for a broader group of friends,11 which makes the web page a typical site for contemporary digital self-representation (see Picture 2).Fig 2Picture 2.  Bilddagboken.se (and its successor dayviews.com) is characterised by high-frequent uploads of images, not seldom with two to three uploads by the same photographer within 1-2 minutes. The picture shows a search on images uploaded by 16-18 year-olds on dayviews.com and what time they were uploaded (29 May 2015).The computer-tours with the participants were designed with inspiration from visual research that aims at using the camera as a tool for the researcher to learn to see and perceive as others do, in a directed way.12 By asking the teenagers to guide me through their favourite sites and to describe their practices both verbally and through embodied performance, as a researcher I got the opportunity to learn more about how to both scroll, click and browse through the websites, and how and what to pay attention to in the web content. Instead of using an external video camera, the computer-tours with the research participants were recorded through the software "Screenflow." Screenflow records not only show what happens in front of the computer by using the computer camera and microphone, but also record what happens on the screen itself. This procedure provided more detailed information on how the cursor moved on the screen in relation to what the research participants showed and talked about, than could be assessed by filming with an external video camera. In turn, this detailed information provided opportunities for me to go back into the material and re-call what happened and what the research participant talked about in terms of what was worth paying attention to in the showed images, and how I should pay attention to these details. That is, how the browsing, pointing and looking through the photo-diary became part of the description of what the diary meant to them and the embodied experiences of moving through it.Subsequently, a specific research interest laid in analysing how visual experience is part of the multisensory and material process of moving through the digital,13 paying attention to "the ways the body is engaged in imagining and remembering" the localities and persons that Internet content represent and thereby "move beyond the notion of 'looking at' images on a screen."14 Thus, the research material was analysed in ways that made it possible to explore the theoretical and methodological implications of approaching "audio-visual" media not only through the visual, but also as an embodied practice and elaborating on the relation between the digital images and the sensory practices in which they were embedded.In order to make it possible to re-call what happened in particular sequences of the computer-tours from an embodied and multisensory perspective, these sequences were transcribed into a similar format as is used in comics. Inspired by Scott McCloud's discussions about how comics are visual media that tries to embrace all the senses within it,15 the comic-book-like transcription below is organised to show both what happened on the screen, what the research participant focused on, what s/he said while this happened and how the mouse and cursor moved during this episode. Altogether, this information creates a translation of the situation into words and images that readers and researchers can empathise with. As McCloud argues, as much as there is something to see in the panels, there are also things to imagine between the panels that call all the senses into action. This imaginative dimension of the in-betweeness of images organised in a series of panels resembles the way the teenagers used Bilddagboken.se to upload snapshots from their everyday life, both in series of three to four photos or as single photos. As shown in the example below, the imaginative, non-representational aspect of the photo-diary was crucial in understanding the meaning of it from the teenager's point of view. The following sequence is taken from a computer-tour with Frida, one of the research participants.The episode above shows how media practises that involved posting photo entries on the web were deeply embedded in these teenagers routines and habits, documenting what Villi calls "visual chit-chat--the capturing and sharing of fleeting feelings, moods, and mundane moments of the everyday and commonplace."16 The experience of the photo-entry came through the computer-tours structured around aspects of the situations that were not visible in the photos, but still very concretely articulated through an interplay between what was seen, said, anticipated, imagined and touched (on the mouse and screen). By clicking the mouse and moving the cursor over the pictures, these invisible, tacit and embodied aspects came to be articulated and part of creating place. Thus, the results showed among other things that frequent use of Bilddagboken.se by taking uploading and sharing digital photographs incorporates learning to perceive through a sensorium that is characterised by giving form to experiences and places through a combination of vision, touch, motion and imagination, unifying rather than disassociating the senses through calling imagination into action. In the next section, a theoretical framework that helps us to understand media use from a sensory and embodied perspective will be clarified.MEDIA AND THE SENSESIn this article, digital visuality is approached through the senses. This "sensory turn" is part of an emerging body of literature across humanities and social sciences that focus on sensory perception, and its role in the process through which people experience and make their everyday environments. The anthropologist Tim Ingold, whose mission is to bring together social/cultural and biological understandings of how people perceive the environment into one coherent approach, developed a theory of perception mainly based on the writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and James Gibson. In his approach, Ingold insisted on looking at perception as something other than a mechanism that provides the mind with raw material of experience through the body's sensorial channels, that will be organised into an internal model of the world inside the brain. Instead, Ingold defines perception as an achievement "of the organism as a whole in its environment, and is tantamount to the organism's own exploratory movement through the world. If mind is anywhere then, it is not 'inside the head' rather than 'out there' in the world. To the contrary, it is immanent in the network of sensory pathways that are set up by virtue of the perceiver's immersion in his or her environment."17 This way of reasoning turns the analytical attention toward how we perceive the world not as a ready-made surface to appropriate or internalise, but as emerging as we move through it. It also questions the notion of the perceptual system as constituted of five sensory channels that register different kinds of input from the environment in differentiated ways. On the contrary, Ingold argues that everything we perceive is subsumed under a total system of bodily orientation, thus implying that "looking, listening and touching, therefore, are not separate activities, they are just different facets of the same activity: that of the whole organism in its environment."18From this perspective, it becomes evident that the Western categories of sight, sound, touch and smell are not biologically given sensorial channels that register differentiated sensory data, but are culturally constructed sensory categories that we use when we try to explain what we experience both in everyday life as well as when we, as researchers, discuss research methods and findings. It also implies that people learn how to use and describe their senses, rather than merely deploying the natural capabilities of the body.19 Gibson suggests that key to such understandings of everyday environments is about perception and an "education of attention."20 Building on Gibson's theories of the interrelatedness between the organism and its environment, Ingold argues that "one learns to perceive in the manner appropriate to a culture--by hands-on training in everyday tasks whose successful fulfilments requires a practical ability to notice and to respond fluently to salient aspects of the environment."21 Even though Gibson's and Ingold's scholarship doesn't concern media studies in particular, this body of work becomes useful in research that takes on a sensory approach to digital media. That is particularly evident in studies that focus on how new ways of touching, looking and moving with digital media raise questions of the sensorality of embodied engagements with media, how it feels to engage physically with these technologies and how media is part of a fuller sensory emplaced experience of being part of an environment.Previous approaches to media analysis of the relationships between media and its users have tended to be concerned with the content of media messages and how it is interpreted and received by its audiences. Tony Bennett indicates that these tendencies also include a view of the audiences as "essentially disembodied,"22 as if relations to media take place without eyes, ears and fingers being particularly involved. In contrast, media scholars like Shaun Moores prescribe media theory that considers media as practice, or more specifically, part of practice. It is media theory that appreciates media use as place-constituting activity, among "the myriad ways subjects inhabit the world before they represent that world to themselves and others,"23 and how media becomes part of people's ways of exploring and continually contextualising the material environment through their movements and multisensory experiences. Pink calls our attention to how the uses of Internet websites have multisensory implications. Even though you could think of screen- and web-based media as mainly a visual sensation, Pink argues that an understanding of place as a relationality in which the local and global is mutually constituted, then we could be invited to "understand the Internet as a field of potential forms of relatedness" and that different elements of the Internet "always have the potential to be interwoven into particular intensities of place that also involve, interactivity, material localities, and technologies."24 Indeed, with today's mobile technologies, the use of the Internet is not only circumscribed to gazing into a domestic computer monitor, but a whole bodily orientation.25 Subsequently, web pages, applications and other platforms we might engage with online "are not simply bounded visual landscapes that can be sensed as virtual places. Rather they are experienced inevitable as part of places that straddle the different environments we engage in and perceive multi-sensorially and memorially."26 This approach is part of a trajectory within so-called "non-media-centric media studies" that focus on the embodied and emplaced dimensions of media that have grown in reaction to more semiotic, representational and culturalist research traditions within the field.MBODIED AND NON-MEDIA CENTRIC APPROACHES TO MEDIA STUDIESRichardsson argues that the shift from analogue to digital technologies in the past 50 years has changed how we relate to and make meaning of the world.27 Some media scholars, like Laura Marks, are concerned with if this tendency marks a shift away from the experiential embodied ways of knowing.I worry that the information age is making us very good as symbolization, at the expense of bringing us into contact with that which we do not know and for which we have no categories. Surfing most Web sites, or playing most video games confirms our ability to execute certain tasks but I am not sure how it opens us to the unknown--except perhaps for those moments when, waiting for a download, we notice the shape of our fingernails for the first time.28In the same vein, Moores instead insists on regarding media as inherently embodied and argue for a joint consideration of physical and media environments as lived spaces,29 Richardsson makes a similar argument when she describes the development of mobile media devices and wearable screens (like smart phones) as a development that only further disrupts distinctions between place and space, actual and virtual environment.30 Thus, media scholars like Moores, Richardsson and Marks urge for an appreciation of the materiality of media practices that "pulls us away from a symbolic understanding and toward a shared physical existence."31 For example, Moores draws our attention to embodied parts of media practices, like the use of keyboards and manoeuvring of a mouse device, and how this "direct link between bodily know-how and technologically mediated mobility leads me to doubt any grand claims about the disembodied character of online existence, and to insist that issues of embodiment should be much more central to media theory and research they currently are."32 As Nick Crossley points out, the use of media technologies in everyday life offers a lot of opportunities to develop embodied forms of knowledge. He discusses for example how his own experience of using computer keyboards has made him experience a "bodily know-how" that made him know how to type without being able to give a reflective account of the keyboard layout. This "pre-reflective" knowledge is placed in his hands relation to the keyboard in a way that if he had to say where the keys were "I have to imagine that I am typing and watch where my fingers head for."33 Indeed, everyday use of media participates in the mundane ways people make sense of the world far beyond its role as a provider of content and for communication. Obviously, the embodied dimensions of media practices are very much part of the "education of attention" suggested by Gibson34; however, further research is needed. To understand the role of media today in relation to other aspects of everyday life (like learning) the media scholars mentioned above call for a "non-media centric" approach to media studies where social practice is the primary generative phenomenon, and where media use is appreciated as an embodied and emplaced part of practice embedded in habitual, pre-reflective, experiential ways of knowing the material environment. In the next section, the empirical material presented above will be approached from such a perspective, in order to scrutinise digital visuality from a multisensory perspective.MULTISENSORY DIMENSIONS OF DIGITAL VISUALITYFollowing the first example (shown in Picture 3), the next example will further elaborate on how a multisensory approach gives reason to understand digital visuality as not only a visual endeavour, but also incorporating touch and other sensory imaginations. In the following example, the research participant Sanne shows a sequence from her photo-diary that tells about a visit to a so-called "street race," an illegal car racing event that usually happens at night in abandoned industrial areas. She excitedly told about the different activities and showed a large amount of photos that were mostly blurred and hard to understand without explanations. A recurring description was that she wasn't interested in showing specific things when posting the photos; instead the main feature of the pictures was to convey the "feeling" Sanne had experienced when participating in this event. She wanted to show these photos when asked to show any entry in her photo-diary that she often went back to when she browsed through the web page. First she clicked on the date of the street race and got to a page where there were rows of blurred photos. She described that "most of the pictures are dark, well here [pointing with the cursor on two completely black photos] it is because I forgot to move my finger from the flash ... however they mean a lot!" [She moves on clicking and scrolling down in the feed until she reaches a bit lighter, but still blurred, photo that makes her smile]. Pointing at the photo with her index finger, she said: "Here also you see a lot of people it is a bad photo, but you see the car go and you understand the feeling." After saying this, she moved the cursor back and forth over the picture at a fast pace (see Picture 4 below). She sits and looks at the picture and clicks on it so it becomes larger and talks about how she wants it there as a memory, and as an opportunity to relive that moment and distribute the feeling to her friends by posting it in her diary. The reason is that "this was the first time I was on a street race and everyone was all excited and the adrenaline was on 220. It was awesome!" We continued discussing how that feeling could be captured through a photo and she showed a dark photo with traces of white clouds. The clouds were traces of smoke from when the cars made "burnouts" and Sanne wanted to describe through her photo "that smoky feeling." Again, Sanne used both the mouse and cursor, and also by touching the screen directly with her fingers, to give form to the experience the photos evoked when she scrolled through her feed.Fig 3Picture 3.  During this episode, Frida, the research participant, showed what to focus on by pointing with the cursor at different things by moving the mouse back and forth and clicking on different features on the web page. During the whole episode, she was active with her right hand that held the mouse, creating both a scraping sound against the table and a clicking sound when Frida's index finger pressed the left button on the mouse. Frida never turned her eyes toward her right hand while she was performing the pointing and clicking, and she never hesitated when browsing through the web page. Much of what was going on in this photo-entry did not show in the photo itself, but in the situation in which the photo was taken. This became visible in the way she guided us through this particular web page. In fact, the things she pointed out as invisible aspects of the photo-entry were where she stood outside of the photo, what she did and felt like, and the hoped-for comments that were not there yet. By doing this, Frida was re-enacting what she experienced that day and how it felt to stand there watching the others play football.Fig 4Picture 4.  One example of how touch and vision was used by the research participant to emplace the image into the interview context and give form to the feelings the photos evoked in her, feelings she wanted to share. Through pointing on the photo with the cursor in different ways, unarticulated and tacit aspects of the captured situation unfolded and called more-than-visual senses into action.The multisensory approach deployed in the analysis made it possible to understand these teenagers' sensory enskillment and incorporated routes to knowing as characterised by a common ground of looking, touching, sensory imaginations and movement through the Internet. The touching was concretely performed, through the tapping of the hand over the keyboard and on the mouse (and handling the mobile phone camera in the situation that was photographed), and by the way it was embedded in the participants demonstrations of what the photo-diary tacitly and experientially consisted of and what you could do with it. Throughout the video-tours, the teenagers were asked both to verbally describe and show through embodied performance what and how to pay attention to the website content. This ethnographic approach provided opportunities for us as researchers to learn to experience the image-based web site the way they did, a route to knowing that was permeated by the physical experience of touch in combination with imaginations of fleeting and ephemeral place-events.DIGITAL VISUALITY--A MATTER OF TOUCHThis analysis of the multisensoriality of Bilddagboken.se highlighted touch, together with vision, as being a crucial component of the studied sensory emplaced learning process. Touching is so obvious a condition for participation in social network sites that it is easily over-looked. However, as mentioned above, within media studies there is a recent turn toward the materialities of media use, focusing on issues of embodiment and emplacement,35 and haptic visuality.36 Vision has a long tradition of being connected with touch; well-known philosophers who have dealt with this issue are among others Descartes and later on Merleau-Ponty. More recent discussions about how touch is related to visuality include Elisabeth Edwards' work on photography. Edwards discusses how photographs are closely connected to touch since they have from its earliest days demanded physical engagement--"photo-objects exist in relationship to the human body, making photographs as objects intrinsically active in the way they are handled, touched, caressed."37The following example brings to the fore how the sense of touch is deployed in the digital setting, not only as part of a body-image relationship, but also in the creation and re-enactment of place. The example emanates from the computer-tour with Sanne and shows a sequence in which Sanne introduces how she would capture the places she is moving through during a day in her photo-diary. The speech bubble stretches over a couple of photos, which indicates the pace at which Sanne moved through her photos. She browsed swiftly through the first three photos and then stopped at the fourth photo that showed her friends sitting on a train. When looking at the fifth photo, she started to click and zoom while discussing this photo and what it meant to her. Her use of the click-and-zoom function followed her way of reasoning, a process that also could be understood the other way around. Both the handling of the computer and the line of thoughts she articulated were coordinated so that one and the other feed into a whole of re-creating the place in which these photos were part of and at the same time creating the meaning of place.In Picture 4 in the previous section, the research participant demonstrates the photograph by using the computer mouse in an attempt to invoke the feeling of being there and experience the cars moving by at a fast pace; the smell, sound and heat from the engines, all the people watching and so on. In Picture 5, above the routinely performed clicking and double-clicking of the mouse both provided the narrative with a rhythm and pace, and at the same time changed the perspective of the image by sometimes zooming in and out. These are part of many examples that showed how the touching of the keyboard, computer mouse and touchscreens occurred frequently when participants were discussing the images in the photo-diary. According to Ingold's ideas of perception as something that is learned "in a manner appropriate to a culture--by hands-on training in everyday tasks,"38 digital visuality implies--according to these examples--to educate the attention through touch. It also suggests that the feeling of touching is part of the articulation and orientation of attention toward tacit and embodied experiences, creating place as moving through the feed of photos in different places and from different positions. These findings will be elaborated on in the following section, and the use of "touch" as a sensory category that describes the experience of digital photos will be problematised.Fig 5Picture 5.  The research participant clicks the mouse to move through the images published during a Friday night. With a double-click, the perspective of the images is altered and coordinated with the research participant's re-creation of the situation and what it meant to her.MUNDANE FRICTIONS: RE-THINKING TOUCH/VISIONAs shown in the empirical examples described above, the use of an image-based social network site as Bilddagboken.se affords a lot of physically handling of technological devices (what is here called "mundane frictions") both when taking snapshots of fleeting moments, and when uploading and later viewing, browsing and commenting on the snapshots on the website. In this study, the teenagers also demonstrated the ways the different images on the website should be viewed and understood which in itself included some extra pointing and scrolling that they probably would not be doing when looking through the website alone. In this way, they used the technology at hand to articulate and re-enact what they usually do not need to say and do when participating in their own communities, thus creating a rich context for investigating what is meaningful to the people who participate in youth cultures that are otherwise inaccessible and invisible for studying for researchers of another generation or community. Even though the exploratory design of this study concludes that it is hard to claim any general knowledge about emerging youth cultures in relation to image-based social network sites, the results provide insights into how digital visuality can be understood from an embodied and multisensory perspective. Bilddagboken.se was not cultural-specific in relation to Swedish culture, but instead featured commonly used tools and interfaces for uploading images in social media and has now continued to develop in an international format (dayviews.com). Therefore, it might not be farfetched to think about the findings as transferable to other image-based social networks as well.With the empirical findings presented in previous sections in mind, one could question the existence of pure "visual media." Indeed, there has been a scholarly move away from visual media for some time. One example is Mitchell's article with the title "There are no Visual Media" in which he argues that "all media are mixed media."39 With reference to Oliver Sacks, Mitchell suggests that there is no pure visual perception since "natural vision is braiding and nesting of the optical and the tactile."40 The problem here, as pinpointed by Pink, is that "braiding" can only be possible if we think of the senses as differentiated channels.41 However, if we take the argument that the sensory categories are themselves culturally constructs42 seriously, these categories cannot be mapped directly onto processes of human perception.43 Perception does not necessarily happen in categories at all. As Pink points out, we do not experience through these categories themselves, but when we talk about our sensory experiences, both in everyday life or as researchers, we might use these categories as a way of communicating.44 This perspective on the senses calls for a reflexive awareness of what analytical categories we use and what they mean in relation to the experiential realities we want to describe.It is obvious that what the research participants in the examples above actually did, here analysed as touching, is that they move their hands and fingers habitually and routinely when stroking, pointing, clicking, pinching, tapping the different media technologies with the purpose of taking and publishing photos, write comments, browse through the images, "relive certain happenings," explaining invisible and embodied feelings and content. However, from a multisensory perspective, the participants might not conceive this dexterity as a matter of touch/vision/imaginations at all, even though they might use these categories if they were asked what they were doing with their bodies in front of the computer. These examples show the importance of awareness that touch in this sense is established analytically as a constructed category interrelated with vision and sensory imaginations. Therefore, it can't be reduced to stand for anything by itself, but has always been understood in relation to the experience it is said to represent. Subsequently, suggesting "mundane frictions" as a multisensorial category that captures the experience of the digital photo-diary practices moves away from the culturally constructed five-sense categories as a basis for explanations. In turn, these "mundane frictions" plays a crucial part in calling the sensory imaginations into action and give form to the experiential, non-representational and tacit aspects of the events or places the photos were part of when they were produced.To elaborate theoretically on the concept of "mundane friction," it is fruitful to relate it to Laura Marks' use of the concept haptics,45 a concept she uses to develop our understandings of how we perceive images and film. Marks uses Deleuze and Guattari's theories on smooth (haptic) and striated (optic) space to nuance visuality, not as dichotomies but instead as properties of space that slide into one another. She describes this urge to theoretically construct sensory categories that communicates embodied experiences as both a critic of the social and societal implications of the constructed five-sense categories for communicating experience and as a tool to deepen our understandings of alternative ways to think about how to capture experience. This perspective on vision as material and embodied goes in line with what this article outlines as the experience of "mundane friction." However, when Marks is concerned with how embodied spectatorship of moving images is informed by detailed analysis of aesthetic experience of how cinematic sound-images affect and provoke the perception and understandings of the viewer, this research aims instead at an ethnographic approach contributing to a deeper understanding of how audio-visual digital media becomes embodied through practice. Following Pink's argument that visual ethnographic methods offer routes to understand a contemporary technological and social world, "given that mobile and visual computing technologies are ubiquitous and moreover central to everyday socialities among some groups of people,"46 this research aims at contributing to understandings of experience of media as embodied and emplaced in people's worlds beyond these media. The multisensory approach in the presented study highlights the crucial fact that the body, and the concrete "mundane friction" between bodies and technologies, plays a role in the process of everyday sensory emplacement in contemporary media practices, quite the opposite to what is sometimes claimed about the "disembodied" electronic age.PEDAGOGICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONSThe interdisciplinary theoretical framework outlined above urges scholars interested in how and why people engage in digital media to move beyond culturalist, representational and disembodied approaches into the experiential, non-representational, emplaced and sensory realm of everyday life. As suggested throughout this article, the "mundane frictions" caused by the handling of digital media in the everyday media practices plays a crucial part in highlighting the tacit and embodied aspects of learning through media. Theoretically, "mundane frictions," and how the senses are united through motion and imaginations in relation to these frictions, suggests that digital visuality is inherently embodied and can hardly be conceptualised exclusively as visuality distinctive from other senses according to the Western construct of five sensorial categories.The trajectory multisensory, non-media-centric media studies run in the same vein as theoretical perspectives on learning as non-representational, situated, embodied, part of practice and constitutive of place. This emplaced perspective on learning is advocated for in scholarships based in anthropological approaches to knowledge such as Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger's perspective on situated learning.47 This perspective on learning insists on focusing on the whole persons involvement in social practice including non-representational aspects of everyday life, which make it a viable point of departure in studies of how media becomes part of peoples everyday practices and how both these social and material practices are part of and constitutive of wider environments. These perspectives on learning in combination with non-media centric media studies provide a coherent theoretical framework for understandings of how media becomes part of people's life-world based learning resources. As argued elsewhere,48 a notion of multisensoriality offers a viable route for developing situated perspectives on learning with media through the process of sensory emplacement. Therefore, it becomes relevant to understand what people do with their bodies in relation to media technologies and its content if we want to find new ways to understand media that acknowledge the continuities between mind, body, environment and the ongoingness of everyday worlds. New insights into how experience, meaning-making and pedagogy are generated through operating touchscreens, computer mouses and computers emanating from this research indicate that the clicking, tapping, stroking is not only part of, but is enhancing the tacit, embodied and material aspects of viewing images.For pedagogical reasons, the insights provided through the presented research tell us to move beyond the simple assumption that teenagers have become multimodal, multitaskers, used to state-of-the-art technologies and visual media, and will therefore only engage in pedagogical contexts that seek to create such environments on a superficial level. However, through a multisensory perspective on digital visuality and its pedagogical implications, it might be reasonable to think about how the "mundane frictions" that is obviously part of contemporary digital photo-sharing is enhancing and developing not only observable behaviours such as clicking and stroking, but more so, tacit, experiential and non-representational aspects of learning.Notes1.

We juxtapose analyses from both media and child studies to look at the ways in which preferred images and notions of the "good" and idyllic childhood are re-edited into a possible critique of the prescribed Swedish childhood. Also, we look at ways in which these media-literate actors use YouTube to display their skills in both media editing and social media "savvy." We discuss how "lay" professional competence in digital culture can be inherent in a friction between popular (children's) culture and social media production, where simultaneous prowess in both is important for how a mediatised social and cultural critique can emerge.28953_UF0001.jpgKonstantin Economou is a senior lecturer in Media and Cultural Production at Linköping University.

Email: konstantin.economou@liu.seThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netThis article addresses YouTube culture as an arena for its members to use mainstream and sub-cultural media content to create new meanings and narratives. Our interdisciplinary approach is to juxtapose analyses from the perspectives of both media and child studies to understand how content is derived from social and cultural commentary. We present and analyse ways in which images of childhood or preferred notions of the good childhood in idyllic rural or historic settings are re-edited by YouTube video makers into a possible critique of the perceived prescribed childhood. More specifically, we focus on storytelling through visual and auditory means, where content can range from compilations and mash-ups of different images from films, TV, and a wide variety of internet content, to more complex forms where content is elaborately re-edited into a new "film" with, in addition to the original story, a coherent counter narrative, and elaborate special effects (visual and auditory). We also discuss how the producers can display "lay professional" competence in participatory media culture, pointing towards how young social media producers display competence that used to belong to an advanced professional skill set.1 It is a position that combines knowledge of popular (children's) culture with professional media production, where prowess in both is important for how social and cultural critiques surface. We are using re-makes of children's cultural material, deeply embedded in Swedish culture, to address broader cultural issues regarding how visual frictions can be used as a means of communication, both of content production and of young producers developing competence. Although Swedish in language and content, the frictions they create also rely on hegemonic notions of childhood as idyllic state that are easily recognised and acknowledged elsewhere.In this initial survey, we analyse the form and content of a strategic sample of videos uploaded onto YouTube. It is a case study carving out directions for further research rather than coming up with final conclusions. All the videos are re-models of the famous Swedish author Astrid Lindgren's novels and their film adaptations. Lindgren is an acknowledged author and regarded as good culture and good children's literature in (adult) society.2 Her work is heavily invested with notions of proper and romanticised childhoods in historical time with active, competent, and protected children at the centre.3 It is in accordance with a traditional Western childhood, where children are dependent on adults who know and translate what children's best interest are. Adults are, as Karen Smith has argued, the providers of children's worlds and perspectives.4 Children need protection in order to be or become innocent--to experience a "romantic childhood," the most valued childhood in Western societies, where children are innocent, angelic, and free to play and learn, as several Child Studies scholars have pointed out.5The YouTube videos we analyse in this article, however, challenge these notions of good childhoods. They produce friction with established norms about a good childhood by including the not idyllic in the videos, that is, sexuality, drugs, violence, desire, and evil, thus making visible a normalised (and thus usually invisible) adult-child divide.TOWARDS ANALYSING YOUTUBE'S VISUAL FRICTIONSThe analysis is based on a virtual ethnography approach, which is limited to YouTube and online practices.6 Our interest in these particular videos was triggered while we were exploring theme and amusement park websites as part of a larger ethnographic study of child culture.7 In Lindgren's hometown of Vimmerby, there is a theme park dedicated to her characters that is one of the largest tourist destinations in Sweden. This theme park also reproduces idyllic notions of the secure and free child, at the same time as it contains a particular imperative for users; visitors and their children have to subscribe to reproducing this image by, literally, playing along.8 It is also a place of media use and production. Parents upload their own versions of Astrid Lindgren's childhoods as YouTube videos and blogs, casting their own children in the roles of the famous story book characters. New personalised versions of the stories become created and published on the internet.9 However, videos on YouTube produced by young people (approximately 12-20 years of age), stand out in stark contrast to how adults blog about visits to theme and amusement parks. Adults' blogs are heavily invested with romanticised notions of protected and competent children with adults as creators of good, middle-class, ethnically homogeneous (western) childhoods, both when performing actual visits to parks and when creating the blogs afterwards. We found it interesting to further study the meanings that young people produce and communicate when they relate to a particular sphere of Swedish children's culture: Astrid Lindgren's work.Limor Shifman calls YouTube an "emblem of participatory culture" and uses the term memes to denote "popular clips that generate extensive user engagement by way of creative derivatives," where one clip generates commentary clips and new re-edits.10 We have identified the same kind of user-generated content in our material. Shifman identifies six common traits of these memes: a "focus on ordinary people, flawed masculinity, humour, simplicity, repetitiveness, and whimsical content," and she goes on to argue that the clips are inherently "incomplete or flawed, thereby invoking further creative dialogue."11 Shifman's study is commendable for its attempt to list clips in a more quantifiable content analysis, and we find some of the broader categories that she suggests useful in this article. Our approach, though, is to focus on the frictions that become visible when cultural content--created by destabilising memetic elements--is used as a tool for social communication and commentary. We want, as Shifman also suggests for further research, to: "highlight the ways in which practices of re-creating videos blur the lines between private and public, professional and amateur, market and non-market driven activities"12 and, following Jean Burgess and Joshua Green, to see "YouTube as a multifaceted cultural system."13Thus, we are interested in the use of memes as a form of participatory digital culture, described by Bradley E. Wiggins and G. Bret Bowers as important parts of activities "that guide and alter the dynamics of human culture."14 In addition, we add a generational perspective, that is, theories of childhood, to the use of memes as participatory culture. We understand the memes to be part of an initiative within user-driven content sharing and production to challenge and change dominant generational power relations in society. The memes are used as a structure in a digital community, aiming to change a system that lies outside the digital logic, namely, societal notions or norms of childhood and, consequently, adulthood. We interpret these memes as having been identified by the video producers as a new way to "challenge all forms of outspoken paternalism" using YouTube as their forum.15 We study how YouTube videos challenge, or rehash, visual storytelling, and traditional formats via new combinations of memes from child culture and other popular culture contexts; and how YouTube production fractures media content, thus working in conjunction with social commentary and social media production.The actual memes we have identified include different visual and textual elements and strategies, what Shifman refers to as "dynamic entities,"16 which can be described as the result of a process of re-editing, rather than re-making. By re-editing we mean that a more profound artistic process has been invested in the editing process than in uploading a traditional viral meme. We analyse the entities that are put into use in memes picked up from child and popular culture; what happens when they are combined and how do the new, unexpected compositions produce frictions? In this sense, we like to describe memes as cultural signifiers and building blocks in a contextualised visual discourse on childhood and everyday media production, following what some other authors are arguing (e.g. Shifman) in their attempt to study the multitude and multiplicity of YouTube content; the attempt to make theoretical and methodological sense of the constantly and quickly growing content and form developed by users. We study how memes are used by young YouTube videographers as building blocks in complex forms of narrative communication as well as in the creation of knowledge and social perspective. This means that we interpret memes as something beyond the notion of a mere unit of sharing; we regard them as aspects of the production of ideology and critique, and emphasise the relation between a user's creation of content and form, outside of institutional control, regardless of whether the controlling agents are parents, child-culture institutions or professional media producers--thus becoming an important arena for visual frictions.YouTube as participatory (child) cultureYouTube has become part of everyday digital and social media life; it is used for education, information, entertainment, and production. YouTube also provides children and young people with a new forum for consumption and production that is out of reach of traditional "media panics," in which adults' anxieties about children's upbringing are key features.17 These panics reflect adults' concerns about children's vulnerability to moral corruption and their interest in forming children's characters for the future. In an interview study with 158 children and young people (aged 6-17 years) in Portugal, de Almeida and colleagues conclude that 98.1% of the children have an internet connection at home and 65.2% claim that they use YouTube.18 In 2012, the European average for households with children having access to the internet at home was 89%.19 The researchers claim that this hitherto unparalleled internet access--in which YouTube plays a significant role--and its potential for interactivity transforms adult-child relations in terms of parental control and authority. They suggest that "the erosion of generational territory markers is underway through children's intense and ubiquitous use of the Internet" and that assumptions about childhood characteristics are being undermined.20 In addition to highlighting how use of the internet creates new understandings of adult versus childhood characteristics, we will investigate some examples of young people's productions published on YouTube, and how they can be part of these transformations. Children and young people can thus be seen as forerunners of the formation of the next media culture, where one important factor may be the merging of everyday, lay and subcultural practices with professional and even industrial ones.Selection of YouTube videos for the analysis: The adult-child divideA search on YouTube using the fictional characters from Astrid Lindgren's novels results in thousands of hits. A search on the two main characters chosen for this article, Emil i Lönneberga and Lotta på Bråkmakargatan, get over 19,000 hits and over 2,800 hits, respectively. If "re-make" is added to the search, the results reduce to 495 and 2,720 hits, respectively. Hence, there seem to be more re-makes of the character Lotta than Emil in this forum. Among the results there are some very different videos; scenes from the original movies, videos with young people performing as the characters in the original movies, videos from visits to Astrid Lindgren's World, videos from people's homes with children acting as the fictional character, and also the ironic and critical videos we selected to analyse in this article. We made a strategic selection among the ironic and critical videos for the analysis, to search for overtly visible tensions and frictions depicting the adult-child divide. Since we are interested in performing a detailed analysis of the specific use of memes in the re-editing of the videos, we choose to focus on five videos made by three male creators with a particular focus on the fictive characters Emil and Lotta. We refer to the makers and users of the videos as young people and this is based on their own self-presentations. In fact, we cannot know for certain that the makers and users are young people, only that they present themselves as such.The videos selected for analysis are, according to Shifman's definition, "memetic videos," in which the user engagement is triggered by parody, pastiche, and mash-ups.21 In addition, these memetic videos derive user engagement by taking children's culture as a starting point. Hence, it is not only what Wiggins and Bowers describe as the "spreading media" per se that is of importance.22 In addition, the specific children's culture content is of major importance. One of the videos chosen for analysis makes this particularly obvious. It is a video that starts with a meta-comment that signals a manifest awareness of what kind of genre (child culture) these memetic videos are playing with. The meta-comment, in the form of an image macro of big white letters on a black screen, is formulated as an explicit warning usually associated with 18-rated films (see Illustration 1), "Warning: this video may contain scenes some people may feel abused by. If you are sensitive, DO NOT WATCH!"23 These image macro meta-comments are also edited into the actual videos, for example, "Censored for your own good ... <3."24Fig 1Illustration 1. Meta-comment in the form of a warning text or disclaimer being used ironically in the video "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" (Snedvriden [n.d]). (Accessed 15 May 2014).To put an 18-rated warning on a video supposedly produced in the genre of children's culture and, additionally, to censor scenes with reference to what is in someone else's best interests, mimics how adult culture treats children's culture, and how adults engage with children. These text-based visuals--the image macros combining text and other visual elements like smileys--make the frictions between children's culture and adults' culture observable. For an adult watching the video, the message is that they should be aware of children's awareness of adult protective strategies that, according to childhood theories, also produce dependence.25 In addition, adults watching such videos may experience how it feels to be in the position of being protected. Children, or followers of the clip producers, on the other hand, can shake off the feeling of exclusion from "adult content" they might be accustomed to having imposed on them, and note the reversal of that message.ANALYSIS: RE-EDITS PRODUCING VISUAL FRICTIONSThe empirical investigation in this article concerns YouTube re-edits of two well-known fictional characters created by Astrid Lindgren: Emil i Lönneberga [Emil of Lönneberga], adapted for film in 197126 and Lotta på Bråkmakargatan [Lotta on Trouble-Maker Street], adapted for film in 1992.27 Emil is an 8-year-old boy who, because of his curiosity and urge to take his own actions, runs into problems evoking his father's anger. Emil is allied with a farm-worker employed by his father. Lotta is a 3 to 5-year-old girl who, because of her stubbornness and specific child perspective on what she experiences, gets into conflicts, mainly with the adult world. Her ally is an elderly woman living next door. Lindgren thus created fiction featuring agentive child characters involved in transgenerational relations with persons not belonging to their biological family. In the fictive worlds, these relations--or any other adult-child relations--never posed a threat to adult power or the adult-child divide.28There is an abundance of adaptations for television, film, games, and gadgets about Lindgren's fictional characters. Here Wiggins and Bowers' understanding of the "progression of meme as a genre," where a meme is a starting point in "spreadable media," is productive. In the present article, spreadable media are the novels of Astrid Lindgren plus the child-culture films and television series based on them. The "emergent memes" that we study are characterised by a desire to challenge notions of a romantic childhood--of children and adults as always being good.29 Spreadable media mediate a popular imagery of children's culture produced by adults for children. Even though the main characters are active children, these children never challenge the adult-child divide or the adult norm.We will now present two examples of how the young videographers use memes to challenge the childhood innocence that permeates Lindgren's work, that is, the invocation of a romantic childhood. These examples highlight how the re-edits mingle 1) the romantic angelic child with the evil/horrific and 2) a "good" child with violence and abusiveness. We will now move on with the empirical analysis of how these re-edits work, starting with the angel-like girl child.The romantic, angel-like girl child mingles with the horrific/evilOur first example is drawn from the YouTube video "Lotta på Bråkmakargatan--Horror Parody Trailer" by raeven2, published in 2008. The video is based on the novel Lotta på Bråkmakargatan, first published in 1961. The video has received 152,450 views and a long list of cheerful supporting comments. The producer explains that the video is "homemade" and that he is "quite happy with it." Elements from the original film have been re-made, new music has been added and text-filled image macros create the counter narrative.The visuals--texts and film clips--blend with the music to create a counter-narrative to the original idyllic narrative of Lotta på Bråkmakargatan. This is signalled in the opening when an image macro says, "They were the perfect family ..." (our emphasis) followed by short clips of the parents happy and laughing in the sunshine, Lotta's brother and sister laughing, and Lotta laughing outdoors in the sunshine.30 The memes are here film clips portraying supposedly happy and idyllic family moments according to a hegemonic image-culture about children.31 In the re-edit, these original, supposedly idyllic, images become part of a counter narrative about betrayal, poisoning, threat, and monsters. By the end, an image macro explicitly states that this is "a story for children ... gone bad!"32 As this summary highlights, this YouTube video uses the common feature defined by Shifman as humour, combined with the horrific to create a narrative of a kind of anti-child culture. The humorous effect--and affect33--is produced by challenging notions of a good romantic childhood and the idea that children--and adults--are always good.Another video based on the same spreadable media film as the example above is the video "Lotta på Bråkmakargatan Parodi" made by zZMangoZz's Channel, which has been viewed almost 188,000 times. The video uses recurring cuts from the films The Exorcist34 and Silence of the Lambs35 inserted into a Lotta movie. The character Lotta, with attributes like blonde hair, blue eyes, and red dress signalling her angel-like status (Illustration 2), is positioned next to the haunted girl-child Regan from The Exorcist (Illustration 3). Lotta's visualised angelic appearance is juxtaposed with a dark-haired, dark-eyed girl with twisted limbs dressed in a nightgown. This girl epitomises the evil child of horror movies36; a direct contrast to the angel-like girl in children's culture.Fig 2Illustration 2. Lotta the angel-like child in Lotta på Bråkmakargatan (Hald 1992) (zZMangoZz's Channel, 2008) (Accessed 15 May 2014).Fig 3Illustration 3. Regan the horrific girl in The Exorcist (Friedkin 1973) (zZMangoZz's Channel, 2008) (Accessed 15 May 2014).The video starts with an image of Regan when she is not possessed. The next scene positions the action inside Lotta's home, with her mother on her way to Lotta's room. She enters the room and says "What is it Lotta, how are you, what's happened?" This is said with the mother's voice from the original film. As she is speaking, a scene from The Exorcist in which the main character, the girl Regan, is possessed is edited into the video. Although the mother is addressing Lotta verbally, the possessed girl is inserted instead of Lotta. This evokes no reaction from the mother, implying that she is innocent and naïve, a representation attributed to Lotta in the original films. Moreover, in the YouTube video the mother becomes an adult embedded in cultural norms about romantic childhoods peopled with innocent adults and children, who refuses to see, or admit, that children (and adults) can be evil, behave incorrectly and not according to established norms.This re-edit mingles visual images and voices with different origins--a children's culture film and a horror movie--making them converge into one video with a divergent message. A story about the idyllic, angelic child, common in commercials,37 becomes a narrative about an evil child. The producer uses memes that are all recognisable--but they are from different genres: the gothic tradition38 and mainstream children's culture. The re-editing causes these different recognisable memes to converge, producing a different meaning than the original one within children's culture.The video obviously requires further cultural and production knowledge to make it successful extending the video to encompass both particular Swedish as well as broader transnational popular culture. Cultural knowledge of the emblematic, almost iconic status of the two horror movies used is required, as well as the technical ability to find the images and edit them into the new narrative. Also, it is well worth noting that this clip retains its dramaturgical flow in the editing, so that the inserted images can at the same time be part of the storyline and stand out as free units or cuts that emphasise its quality of making a strong visual statement about the angel child turned evil. As the soundtrack continues with the mother "unaware" in the original film, it underscores the difference between the preferred, idyllic image, and the critical position that can be created by the inserts. The knowledge of film outtakes made into memes is thus combined with the technical and dramaturgical ability to make new meaning in the video, displaying a particular competence, maybe even a kind of "director's gaze."Furthermore, the critique produced in and by the re-edits uses and produces visual frictions to critique the adult-child divide in complex ways by playing with the expected and unexpected. Images of "evil" children are a recurring feature in popular media. They are, as Patricia Holland claims, produced by adults and they reflect adults' anxieties about children's "potential for uncontrolled viciousness."39 The videos we analyse in this article play with these adult fears--and hence challenge them. The re-edits explore a critique of the adult-child divide and simultaneously express young people's anxieties about adults' potential--and actual--evilness, which is also demonstrated in the following examples.The good-hearted boy child becomes violentAlthough the videos analysed so far garnered a lot of appreciation from commenting viewers, we will now analyse the work of one particular producer who received an overwhelming number of comments about his quality and professionalism in editing videos. The producer Snedvriden (Snedvriden means Twisted, in the sense of having a twisted mind) has made more than 10 re-edits of most of Astrid Lindgren's films, starting with short clips and re-edits and leading up to a coherent, scripted 12-minute "movie" that becomes more of a held-together work. We focus on two of the more lengthy "movies": "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" and "Vi på Saltgurkan."When we found "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" by Snedvriden in May 2014, it had more than 157,000 viewings. Now, it has been taken down by YouTube, who cited copyright issues. Whether this is the only argument is disputable. It could also be that the content is regarded as too challenging, producing too many frictions between adults' "pure" versions of child culture and the "dangerous" versions produced by Snedvriden. It could also be that the quality of the videos triggered copyright concerns--perhaps they become seen as threats rather than pranks? In any case, Snedvriden's YouTube videos seem to have become more and more closely monitored by the industry. The video "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" re-emerged, however. Someone who had obviously saved and stored the video uploaded it again on 24 January 2015. His argument for doing this is that it is so "enjoyable and wonderful" that it deserves to be available to others. Three days later, 68 people had viewed the video and one commenter thanked the person who re-loaded it.The title "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" is a wordplay in which the idyllic village of "Lönneberga" from the book about Emil and the film based on the novel, is renamed as "Lönnmördarberga"--"Assassinville" would be a fair translation. In the video, we see Emil climbing fences, playing and aiming his toy gun around (Illustration 4), images from the original film but with inserted gunshot sound effects, gun-flash visual effects (Illustration 5), and inserted images from other movies of people being hit, falling off roofs, and heads being blown off.Fig 4Illustration 4. The blond and blue-eyed goodhearted boy Emil is playing with his toy rifle made of wood (Hellbom 1971). "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" (Snedvriden [n.d.]) (Accessed 15 May 2014).Fig 5Illustration 5. The imaginative play results in gunfire "Emil i Lönnmördarberga" (Snedvriden [n.d.]) (Accessed 15 May 2014).Illustration 4 shows the blond blue-eyed boy, Emil, with the two material objects signifying his identity in the context of Swedish child culture, his cap (Sw. "Mysse") and his homemade toy rifle (Sw. "Bysse"). Emil has performed one of his (innocent) pranks and locked himself into a small shed to keep himself away from his father's tantrum (this is a recurring theme in the stories about Emil). In illustration 5, Snedvriden has added memes in the shape of a gun, visual effects, and also sound effects to create a counter narrative in which the imagined innocent child play turns into something less innocent. Through these overlaid visual and audio memes, Emil's original innocent play becomes real with real negative effects. In the video this is elaborated upon several times; clips from the original film of Emil aiming his gun are combined with edited memes in which adults' heads are hit and the whole scene (EV: image) becomes covered in blood. Snedvriden here merges memes into the original storyline to create a new coherent narrative that becomes "twisted" by these inserts.Hence, the "good" boy from the original books and films is made to shoot and kill other protagonists, mainly adults, in the videos. The image of a child actually shooting, blowing up or burning other people is a particularly strong statement, even more so since the cultural understanding of the Lindgren stories is centred around the innocent and good-hearted child. The innocent homemade toy turns into a real deadly weapon and when this is used by the child it becomes an instant friction when you see it on screen, showing how the selection of memetic content can make a strong, instant statement by being immediate and short. Snedvriden puts this format to use in many videos featuring the gun-toting, murderous child. To see an image of a child shooting and killing, and furthermore, to immediately recognise it as an Astrid Lindgren character, can be a powerful instance of media exposure.The notion of Emil's innocence is also challenged in several instances where the homosocial male adult-child relationship is questioned. Scenes from the original film, located in pristine nature in summertime, are mashed-up with elements such as snuff, hashish (leaves and cigarettes), mobile phones, and sexual references. The narrative of sexuality is invoked by combining image macros of happy smileys, dialogues from the original films, music and sound effects of huffing and breathing. Most striking and challenging is that Emil is not made a victim or shown as wanting to avoid the adult male sexuality. On the contrary, he seems to take part of his own free will. Thus, Snedvriden uses several memes to re-edit the original story of a good-hearted boy who is active, but in ways prescribed by adults and hence reinforcing his child-like status, into a counter narrative where the child is sexually active, that is, engaging in an activity that generates other reactions among adults than innocence and proper childishness. It becomes an "in your face" inversion of the preferred image of childhood that many (adults) take for granted. This is not, however, the only possible interpretation of child activity in Snedvriden's videos.Emil's shooting and killing might also be interpreted as a way to get back at an adult society where children's needs are not met. Another example, "Vi på Saltgurkan", plays with another classic Lindgren story about an idyllic Swedish summer vacation in the archipelago. In this example, various narrative strands are laid out at the beginning, particularly where the children are treated as less knowledgeable, as being in the way, or treated as objects of sexual intercourse and victims of rape and incest. The "good" father, supposedly meeting the children's interests and needs in the original child culture discourses, is re-edited into a father who scorns his children. Two scenes in particular are constructed through elaborate editing of the soundtrack from the original film set to images that are made up of texts and subtitles insinuating an act of sexual intercourse between adults and children. This counter narrative is juxtaposed with sections where the children get back at the adults, often by shooting or burning them. The counter stories of children's actions, in addition to being just a general critique aimed at adults, may also be interpreted as a form of rebellious child behaviour. This is similar to Kirsten Drotner's analysis of how young people used aesthetics to transform and comment upon established genres during the early 1990s.40 What is new here is that children's culture is used both as source and end product in the videos, obviously attracting people to participate as audience and in making engaged user comments. In relation to Drotner's work, the memes in these re-edits may be regarded as advanced digital developments of young people's non-digital video practices in earlier decades. In this article we emphasise the importance of paying attention not only to the technical competence displayed in the use of memes, but also to the ideological implications the frictions put in motion by visual and audio cues.CONCLUSION: CULTURAL CRITIQUE AS SOCIO-TECHNICAL PRACTICEThe YouTube videos we have analysed in this article begin with the classic Swedish film adaptations of original novels and add memes in the form of textual comments, clips from other films, pictures from the internet, visual effects, image macros, audio effects and music to create friction between what is preferred child culture and a new form of challenging child culture. YouTube videos can be seen as works, or even "movies" of considerable length, with very complex and dramaturgically coherent counter narratives that retain the memes and put them together in technically accomplished ways, where high levels of skill in editing, special effects and narrative are displayed, as well as knowledge of other visual media formats, such as, for example, music and music videos, which are commonly used. There are many examples of similar memes in YouTube re-edits of Astrid Lindgren films; images that are used by many producers in making their own versions, thus using the viral meme as a template but creating an original version rather than sharing the exact same clip. Furthermore, although originating in a Swedish cultural context, the videos create frictions that can be similarly identified and recognised in the eyes of a larger (western) notion of the idyllic state of childhood, that thus becomes more widely challenged.The videos stand out due to the quality of their editing and effects and because of a level of production professionalism that is also commented on by viewers, who want to know "how it could be done so professionally." We see here a mingling of cultural critique and expert production that has thus far not been acknowledged in the (adult) cultural or academic sphere. The critique is multi-layered; it produces counter images of, and narratives about, notions of childhood and adulthood, about what is and is not accepted as mainstream culture, and what and who decides what a good production is. The re-edits point to how cultural productions targeting children--Lindgren's novels and film adaptations--use and re-inscribe idyllic, nostalgic and traditional Western notions of childhood innocence. The effect of the mingling of memes from popular culture and contemporary image cultures with the canonised children's culture becomes a critique of the adult-child divide in which childhood signifies an underdog position.In several ways, the re-edits are more complex and multifaceted than the "original" films in terms of both form and content and these producers display a more professional and contemporary media prowess, bringing together a rich and complex array of content. As we would like to conclude, this is a form of cultural and socio-technical performance in which the visual and aesthetic production and the internet's viral and global properties work simultaneously with the social and cultural commentary. We have emphasised how singular elements of memes generate culturally situated and contextual content in the videos, rather than the merely viral. The memes are used as building blocks in more coherent narratives to convey a cultural and social commentary that can represent a statement on contemporary culture. Here, it is the Swedish childhood story that is turned upside down by the contemporary image-editing and mash-up production skills that are put together to create this particular viewpoint. Young YouTube video makers have, here, used a re-editing strategy based on mingling incongruent elements to re-model the original message about childhood innocence and naïveté. Simultaneously this becomes a critique of how adults abuse and misuse their position as adults.These productions use more knowledge than that provided by visuality, but at the same time the visual is essential. As shown in this article, YouTube "memetic videos" are being used in new ways that have so far not been acknowledged for the way in which they enter into dialogue with the content of children's culture (films and novels) as a remediating process of cultural re-editing. In this process, children's culture and other (adult) cultural genres merge in new ways. Memes can thus be used as an intricate part of re-editing, using and reworking individual snippets and bringing them into a more complex whole. This can be seen as the creation of a counter narrative that functions referentially and, thus, works to remake the original story, making it more multi-vocal, working in a more non-linear way, in a form of simultaneity, bringing forward several more narratives at once--as well as invoking and displaying the producers' multiple skills and knowledge. Thus, a video clip can be understood variously as a re-edit, satire and comeback on the idyllic Swedish image of childhood, a wannabe show reel directed towards obtaining a position in the media or special-effects industry, as well as a way of becoming a cool guy with a YouTube channel following. Here, to return to a core Erving Goffman notion,41 the backstage properties of being part of a viral subculture of reusing internet memes at home on one's personal computer work simultaneously with the frontstage properties of making a public visual statement for an audience of thousands.If we widen our gaze to encompass the much broader development across the whole of popular culture for at least 20 years, we can see that the refashioning of old content into new has become commonplace and, obviously, creating content from varied sources is the format young people grow up with, at least those who have access to modern media equipment. Furthermore, the culture of mixing and mash-ups can now move across genres and formats,42 so it can be said to be convergent in a developed sense: as the starting point of production, rather than a convergence between new media forms and old, going beyond the metaphors of convergence and suggesting a way of understanding them as simultaneous.There is, thus, another kind of friction involved here, of how young people can be forerunners in media development; of how knowledge is gained by self-organised cultural producers, lay professionals, or lay directors even, who draw on professional production forms, styles, and techniques. But, seemingly, they are daring to break taboos in their choice of content. Their skills can be used in the professional media production system, even though they have been gained outside of media education and surpass those gained in vocational or academic institutions--just like the music scene or the hacker culture purported to do before, as cultural studies researchers have observed for decades. In order to also study the inherent friction in this article, between young social media users' cultural critique and their possible move into jobs in professional media production, we will need further analysis and examples. An analytical point here, though, is that there would be no point in separating out which of these traits might be the right one. Instead, this kind of intersectional understanding is a form of simultaneity, a concept that effectively describes this perspective.Notes1.

D'Aoust*Comparative Literature, Institute for Cultural Inquiry (ICON), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The NetherlandsAbstractThis article explores the visual friction between the concealment of technology and the need to stage mimetic scenes in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. The article relies on the critical reception of the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk in musicology, as well as in media, performance, and theatre studies. Drawing on productions and commentaries critical of the iconic Gesamtkunstwerk's attempted retrieval of a lost natural state, the article examines correlations between phantasmagoria, special effects, movement detection technology, and the interactive devices of multimedia and digital scenography. These correlations are framed within a theoretical methodology of historical discourse and media archaeologies. Three specific productions of the Ring are discussed, namely the inaugural and centenary productions at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, as well as Robert Lepage's production for the Metropolitan Opera of New York in 2010-2012.28238_UF0001.jpgDr. Jason R. D'Aoust is a guest researcher at the Department of Comparative Literature and at the Institute for Cultural Inquiry (ICON) of Utrecht University.

Email: jrdaoust3@gmail.comThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netIn the last decade, an increasing number of opera productions have not only relied on digital technology to transmit content outside the hall but also to create (parts of) sets and decors. While the involvement of digital media in scenography varies from one opera house and from one production to the next, the practice has developed to the point that critics have shown concern with opera's saturation with Hollywood-style special effects. Such equations fail to consider, however, the theatrical conditions in which this media technology is deployed. Perhaps the most controversial debate over these problems in the last five years converged around Robert Lepage's production of Richard Wagner's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen for the Metropolitan Opera of New York, premiered between 2010 and 2012.1 Of course, Lepage does not stand apart: productions of Wagner's music dramas have long been associated with developments in stage technology and media, visual elements of which have caused considerable friction over the past century and a half. This article first examines this theatrical tradition of technological innovation in regards to Wagner's works. The arguments presented here draw upon discourse analysis in Michel Foucault's The Order of Things, the scenographic history of Wagner's Ring, insights from media archaeology, and the critique of the Gesamtkunstwerk as phantasmagoria, before turning to Lepage's production. In conclusion, it compares the rendering visible of sonic gestures through the interactive digital technology of his production with analogue technology described in Sean Michael's novel, Us Conductors.THE RING'S MIMETIC APORIAIn comparison with the ever-present Ring and the crucial importance of the sword Nothung to the plot, the Tarnhelm is not as conspicuous in the Ring Cycle.2 Yet the magic helmet at once protects the Ring and brings about its end, both in the sense of the ring as a material object in the narrative and of the cycle's plot. It only briefly makes an appearance--or rather, disappearance--in the third scene of Das Rheingold, vanishes in Die Walküre, then returns to play a cameo role in Siegfried, before finally instigating a series of mistaken identities and double-entendres in Götterdämmerung. The helmet drives the plot because its apparitions coincide with transfers of power. Indeed, Alberich orders his brother Mime to wield the helmet in order to protect his ownership of the Ring, as the means to mine and transform more gold. Under the helmet, Alberich can disappear, immediately travel to distant places, and change into any human or animal form. The helmet's potential for omnipresence is the prototype of a mass-surveillance device, which enforces mass labour and makes its owner omnipotent. When Wotan travels to Nibelheim with Loge to steal the hoard of gold in order to pay the giants for building Valhalla, he only has a vague idea of the Ring's power and even less knowledge of the Tarnhelm. He quickly realizes, however, the threat they pose to the order over which he presides. In order to contain this threat, Wotan and Loge trick Alberich into using the Tarnhelm to their advantage. Appealing to Alberich's pride, they make him demonstrate his newly gained powers by turning into a dragon and then into a toad. This last metamorphosis allows the cunning pair to capture Alberich and rob him of his treasures.Beyond facilitating the transfer of the gold and its means of production, there is definitely a poetic boast about the Tarnhelm. The capacity to present the immense and the minuscule should, after all, be a fundamental possibility of Wagner's pretensions to a total work of art. And yet, the appearance of the dragon, and its return in the second act of Siegfried, has always defied the limits of scenography. One of Wagner's collaborators on the first staging of The Ring had unsuccessfully advised him to keep the battle with the dragon off-stage, and its lack of verisimilitude has been a problem ever since.3 Part of the problem with the staging of the Tarnhelm's special effects comes from the difficulty of realizing the helmet's mimetic potential to a convincing degree of realism. This is made all the more difficult as the affects these transformations inspire are abundantly suggested to the imagination through the music. The problem of realistic transformations under the Tarnhelm recedes later in the Cycle, when it is used to transform heroes into humans instead of anthropomorphic gods and goblins into animals.The last (dis)appearance of the Tarnhelm occurs at the cusps of the first and second acts of Götterdämmerung. As these scenes tend to overindulge in deceit and mistaken identities for purposes of quid pro quos, a quick summary of the action should help steer the reader through this confusion. Gunther, king of the Gibichung, is wealthy and powerful, but does not have a wife. Hagen (his half-brother through their mother, but whose father is Alberich) convinces Gunther that Brünnhilde (Siegfried's true love) would make the perfect trophy. To realize this scheme, Gunther's sister, Gutrune, gives Siegfried a magic potion that makes him forget previous loves and fall in love with her:Träte nun Siegfried ein,Genöss' er des würzigen Trank's,daß vor dir en Weib er ersah,daß je ein Weib ihm genaht -vergessen müßt' er dess' ganz. -(If Siegfried were to enter nowand taste the herbal drink,he'd be forced to forgetthat he'd seen a woman before you,that a woman had ever come near him.)Incidentally, when Hagen speaks of the potion, Wagner also evokes the Tarnhelm motif.4 To gain Gunther's consent to marry Gutrune, Siegfried agrees to fetch Brünnhilde for him. He uses the magic helmet to take Gunther's form after passing through the fire surrounding her rock. Once Brünnhilde is on the boat back to the land of the Gibichung, Siegfried leaves her with the real Gunther using the Tarnhelm to instantly travel back to Gutrune. Hagen's scheme relies on Gunther's natural lust and on Siegfried's potion-induced lust to transfer their desire for ownership into the imaginary world of sexual relations, which would leave Hagen with real ownership of the Ring. In other words, nothing is what it appears to be in Götterdämmerung until Brünnhilde steps in to put things right. The Tarnhelm therefore opens a space of disappearances and apparitions that blur the boundaries of knowledge and ignorance, and ultimately enable revolutions in the distribution of power and wealth.Fig 1Photo 1.All of these points recall Michel Foucault's early work on the archaeology of knowledge in The Order of Things. Although the reader might have in mind Foucault's later work on the panopticon,5 especially in regards to the Nibelheim scene, I want to further build upon this comparison through Foucault's reading of Velazquez's painting, Las Meninas (Photo 1). After many pages of description in which he follows the lines and the gazes of the painting's protagonists, Foucault finally comes to the conclusion that its composition, its ordering of things and people, is organized according to an almost absent focus, a nearly blind spot, which is only revealed through a reflection in a small blurry mirror. Through this visual subterfuge, Velazquez discretely makes known how the sovereigns' absence makes them the keystone of the design; their gaze orders the arrangement of things and the movements of people, as well as their (in)visibility. One finds a similar vanishing yet ordering point within the tetralogy: the displacement of this unseen gaze, as figured by the Tarnhelm, leads to the confrontation of different orders of knowledge (or episteme), to ethical dilemmas, and tragic outcomes.Take, for example, the trick Wotan and Loge play on Alberich. They must first conceal from him their intentions in order to steal the seat of his power. Within the aesthetics of the Gesamtkunstwerk, however, this transfer also affects the means of representation. In order to accomplish this dual transition, Wagner strictly limits the range of Alberich's metamorphoses to slimy underground animals, which, in passing, recalls Adorno's criticism about the essentialist racism of the characterization. Indeed, why not have him change into an eagle or a deer? The convenient proximity of Alberich's dwelling to those of the serpent and the toad in the "natural world" frame the semantic space of the mimetic[...] that becomes double as soon as one attempts to unravel it: a resemblance of the place, the site upon which nature has placed the two things, and thus a similitude of properties; for in this natural container, the world, adjacency is not an exterior relation between things, but the sign of a relationship, obscure though it may be.6Indeed, in the mimetic order, or the space of resemblance, knowledge is predicated upon interpretation as the rendering visible of the Creator's mark on animals and things. Moral judgements of every kind proliferate in this way of seeing the world. Yet, as in the painting by Velazquez, The Ring also offers us a (not so) discreet presentation of power relations. Albeit inconspicuous, the Tarnhelm (dis)embodies this visible yet hidden place that limits our way of seeing and knowing, and, in turn, subverts what presents itself as the unquestionable knowledge of reality compounded by the self-evidence of a preordained natural world.In an attempt to conciliate the visual split of resemblance and representation Alberich has unleashed upon the world in Das Rheingold, Wagner first attempts its redemption in Die Walküre through a pair of Wotan's illegitimate children. The Valvater's godly staff symbolizes treaties, as its runes inaugurate the historical time of writing. He cannot, therefore, directly partake in the freedom of mimetic transformation without forsaking his duty to enforce semantic stability. His children, the Wälsungen, would be free from his obligation to uphold the binding contract of representation, as the fantasy goes. They could therefore redeem the mimetic liberty of the primeval world that has been corrupted by greed and power. When Siegmund and Sieglinde fall in love, they act according to sympathetic recognition (the fourth type of resemblance according to Foucault) and therefore reject the moral interpretation of the matrimonial contract that binds Sieglinde to Hunding. Wotan's desire for the golden age of his dominance over the mimetic world (or his ignorance of it) later resurfaces when the son of the Wälsungen, Siegfried, kills the dragon--a metamorphosis of Fafner, a giant who helped build Valhalla--and retrieves the Ring and Tarnhelm. Siegfried then unknowingly confronts his immortal grandfather and shatters the rune-laden spear with which Wotan ruled the world. In Wagner's mythopoeia of humanity's divine origins, the constant struggle between mimetic and representational regimes finally lands in the hands of the humans when the semi-divine hero, Siegfried, meets the Gibichung clan. The return of the Tarnhelm at this point of the Cycle's plot certainly contributes to the constant confusion between what is seen and what is known.WAGNER AND SCENOGRAPHYWriters often turn to theatrical innovations at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in order to emphasize the importance of the visual aspects of Wagnerian music drama. As in Greek theatres, the seats are laid out in a semi-circle and on a steep incline, so that the stage remains visible to everyone at all time. The double proscenium gives the illusion of the stage being framed and farther away, thereby drawing one's gaze inward. This effect is further reinforced by a sunken orchestra pit, which removes it from the spectator's view of the proscenium. Wagner's critical misgivings about the state of opera in the mid-19th century further underline the importance of the visual aspects of Wagnerian music drama. Beyond the problem of having adequate rehearsal time in repertory theatres, Wagner was dismayed by their lack of scenographic resources.7 In perusing Wagner's correspondence, Patrick Carnegy has singled out a number of occasions on which makeshift or stock sets could not visually match the intensity of his music. Either the prop boats in Der fliegende Holländer were too small to evoke the eerie grandeur of the ghost ship, or the wave machine failed to work, or created a feeble splash instead of a crash against the hull of the boats. Imitating the Paris Opera, Wagner even had guides printed that explained the scenographic requirements of his operas, demands that scared off some theatre directors and went completely ignored by others. This is the state of affairs of musical theatre in Wagner's time, which led him to dream, plan, and build a theatre where the utmost care would be taken to understand and realize his artistic vision.8Yet the undertaking of this gigantic building project does not imply that it instantly achieved the ideal it was meant to fulfil. Here too Carnegy has amassed numerous examples that read like a blooper real for The Ring. Bayreuth is often quoted as the birthplace of the darkened theatre, which, along with the semi-circular seating, makes it the precursor of early cinema houses. Yet the audience was only plunged into darkness at the inaugural performance of The Ring because the dimming mechanism on the gaslights had not yet been installed in the new hall. On stage, the electrically lighted rainbow bridge at the end of Das Rheingold failed to project onto the staircase, and instead lay flat at the bottom of the backdrop. The fire surrounding Brünnhilde's rock also had to be scaled back from real flames to a red-hued mist of steam. And of course, we cannot but mention the puppet dragon of Fafner in Siegfried that caused mirth rather than fright.9 While Wagner's complaints about existing theatrical conditions and his attempts to remedy them are often quoted by those who still advocate productions faithful to the letter of the Master's wishes, the list of visual mishaps and others like them at Bayreuth are evoked by those who would innovate technologically in order to comply with the spirit of his intentions, or of his vision.10 During the Bayreuth years, we find, in addition to these technical aspects, an aesthetic transformation in Wagner's scenography.Wagner's mythopoeia did not accord well with the academic accuracy lavished onto historical dramas at the time. Indeed, the crux of his aesthetic divergence with Ludwig II of Bavaria revolved around the king's insistence on historical recreations, going so far as to send designers to Nurnberg so they could replicate Hans Sachs' house for the sets of Die Meistersinger's premiere in Munich. Richard and Cosima had already fought hard to keep the costumes in the inaugural Bayreuth Ring from turning into museum pieces that would have very little to do with the internal logic of the drama being produced. This tendency towards the abstraction of historical visual detail was only confirmed as Wagner moved on from his epic tetralogy to a spiritual drama, Parsifal. The scenography of his last music drama would confirm a taste for simpler designs that would be iconic of an aesthetic vision, rather than a past reality. With the help of Christian symbolism, costumes and scenography were shorn of detail in order to concentrate visual attention on the key elements of the production. Although Wagner's distrust of historically accurate costumes and sets for The Ring might seem to be in line with the minimalist aesthetics of Parsifal, this visual abstraction contrasts dramatically with the mimetic requirements of the Tarnhelm scenes. Yet they both participate in the metaphysical ambitions of Wagner's music drama.MEDIA ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE WAGNERIAN GESAMTKUNSTWERKHow can media archaeology critically inform our reception of Wagnerian scenography? One might start to answer this question by turning to Friedrich Kittler's work. Rather than rehearse the Gesamtkunstwerk's genealogy in metaphysical aesthetics, Kittler focuses on the new theatrical dispositifs at Bayreuth, which I mention above. He identifies them as precursors to talking cinema: "Wagner's Bayreuth opera was the first historical realization" of the separation and incorporation of "individual sensory channels."11 Yet, in the larger point Kittler is making, audiovisual distinctions are less significant than the redistribution of light and the reordering of sight:However, the projection of electric light through an otherwise darkened room seems to be the most important thing. It not only established the aesthetics and social pathology of cinema, but it also created a new militaristic way of perceiving the world.12By social pathology, Kittler refers to his previous comments on the possibility of engaging in indecent activities (by 19th-century standards) in darkened public rooms. Kittler also intimates in the preceding pages how the stage lighting of actors under spotlights inevitably turned them into visual targets for the "actively armed eye." Paradoxically, the militaristic worldview was ushered into history by a glimpse of la vie en rose. Indeed, Kittler traces the invention of coloured lighting to a translucent pink hat chanced upon in a theatre, but then immediately developed for military signalling. At Bayreuth, Wagner had used coloured spotlight and electrical lighting in combination with steam for a number of special effects, including the fire on Brünnhilde's rock.By the time Wagner staged the Ring Cycle, the steam engine's technology had long since been harnessed and was therefore more reliable in the theatre than the new electrical lighting was. Thus Bayreuth had two full-sized locomotive boilers in its basement to provide its stage with all the primeval mist needed to envelop the gods in their magically unfolding world.13 Discussions of productions of Wagner that rely on new technological developments would benefit, for example, from Jussi Parikka's discussion of steam punk in the introduction to What is Media Archaeology? If this subculture, "emblematic of important [current] cultural desires [...] imagines in new ways the steam-engined machine worlds of the Victorian era which marked the birth of modern technological culture,"14 one might also consider how interpretations of The Ring promote or conceal the special-effects technology hidden in Bayreuth's Victorian basement. This focus would lead one away from the iconic Gesamtkunstwerk, as Matthew Wilson Smith defines it, which "seeks to bury all outward signs of mechanical production, [although] it nevertheless relies heavily upon mechanization for its pseudo-organic effects."15 Yet in actively seeking through media archaeology's methods to "expose and celebrate the outward signs of mechanical production" in Wagner's music drama, one might also be engaging with the crystalline Gesamtkunstwerk.16 The goal of such a reading, however, would be to move away from fantasized returns to natural origins--overtly supported by technology or not--and to conclude that the only way out of this dialectical aesthetic identity of technological concealment and revelation entails, in the end, the acceptance that there is no way out of our technological destiny.Before Wagner, opera had enjoyed a long history of wanting to make the invisible perceptible. In Metaphysical Song, Gary Tomlinson reads the history of opera in terms of this claim: its ability to express (the ideal forms of) a reality that cannot be seen, or, in Tomlinson's vocabulary, its claim to make the noumenal perceptible. In line with this metaphysical conceit, early opera actively sought to stage transcending figures of Greek or Roman mythology that would make this musical beyond also perceptible to sight. The production of opera, however, transformed according to its cultural context. By the late-18th century, the culturally dominant form of subjectivity was no longer attuned to the magical and the cosmic, but was defined instead by the objective remove of self-sufficient reason. If Romantic opera was to later attempt the retrieval of the fiction and magic of earlier times, it did so, nevertheless, within this self-sufficient subjective space that could no longer rely on an exterior figure of transcendence, like Orpheus or Apollo, to bridge this gap. As mentioned above, Wagner's myth of origins, written from this subjective vantage point, must therefore conciliate the immediacy of the magical world (the Tarnhelm's metamorphoses) with the distance through which the modern subject perceives the historical world and his or herself within it (Wotan's symbolic staff). This is precisely how Tomlinson approaches Wagner.The broaching of metaphysics in the late-modern West takes the form of the subject's attempt to recuperate in some manner the social forces hidden in exchange and its nostalgia for autonomy. This is, from the first, a metaphysics that circulates within the horizon of the commodity that defines it. It cannot, given the subject's complicity with this form by virtue of its claim to self-sufficiency, escape to reassert some putative earlier, as yet uncommodified, noumenon. Seeming reassertions of this sort are the alienated subject's vain attempt from within the commodity culture to recapture an imagined, earlier metaphysics outside it.17In this passage, Tomlinson follows Adorno's criticism of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk. Indeed, Adorno had already remarked in 1938 how "the Wagnerian phantasmagorias are among the earliest 'wonders of technology' to gain admittance to great art."18 The word phantasmagoria has been used at different times and in different contexts in order to denote a visual illusion.19 Whether it designates a magic lantern show or the consumption of art as a spectacular ersatz for spirituality, the phantasmagoria functions on the presupposition that its audience only obtains satisfaction when it experiences art as some ex nihilo creation that requires neither effort, nor work to produce.As Kittler suggests by situating his discussion of Wagner within the genealogy of the magica lanterna, the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk succeeded in reordering the multimedia sensory channels by not only giving sound, but also sight to the (im)possible retrieval of noumenal autonomy.20 Whether it hides the back-stage labour that goes into making the illusion or requires a "fourth wall" that prevents characters from acknowledging the audience, the stage of the Gesamtkunstwerk, and more specifically, the mimetic staging of the Tarnhelm, is the phantasmagoric site of alienation's (dis)appearance. The Ring's plot makes this seeming contradiction all the more obvious, since so much of its action is concerned with the control of labour.Historically, productions of The Ring that address this alienation have been heavily criticized and generated considerable controversy. The first scandal of this kind at Bayreuth was in reaction to Patrice Chéreau's centenary production of the tetralogy in 1976. After years of minimalist symbolism under Wieland Wagner's directorship, Chéreau opted for a return in his scenography to figuration, although heavily traversed by transhistorical commentary. Refusing to stage the primeval nature of the Rhine's depths, Chéreau locates the opening scene of the tetralogy at a massive cement dam. From the very first bars, the director overtly contradicts Wagner's stage directions. Furthermore, Chéreau was also defying Wagner's aesthetics as drawn out in his prose works:Thus the Machine is the cold and heartless ally of luxury-craving men. Through the machine have they at last made human reason their liege subject; for, led astray from Art's discovery, dishonoured and disowned, it consumes itself at last in mechanical refinements, in absorption into the Machine, instead of in absorption into Nature in the Art-work.21Rather than the creation of a primeval Rhine out of the harmonics of E-flat, the industrial dam defiantly spelled a rupture with the tradition of presenting Wagnerian myth as ahistorical and unaltered by the social context of its production. As such Chéreau's production was not simply critical of Wagner's indications, it was also highly critical of its implicit worldview.22Chéreau's overt reversal of the historical progression from Nature to civilization ties into his understanding of the technology also at work within the theatre. The presence of the dam at both ends of the tetralogy definitely evokes Adorno's critical comment on how, in the Gesamtkunstwerk, fantasy hides in plain view on the stage.23 Instead of following Wagner's indications, Chéreau challenged the mythopoeic aspects of the work and called their bluff. Indeed, what does The Ring mean if we accept Derrida's point that a primeval, pure Nature--the kind Rousseau and Herder theorized--never existed, except as early-modern speculation that has been tacitly framing the way we read and understand history and the world?24 Chéreau's break with scenographic traditions shatters an illusory worldview The Ring helped to perpetuate and that was already historically outmoded 50 years ago, hence the breaking of the fourth wall at the end of his staging of Götterdämmerung.25 If Chéreau's Ring starts in an industrialized world, then it stands to reason that at the end of the cycle's revolutions, we cannot be extricated from industrialization and return to Nature, from which a new cycle would start again. In this, Chéreau seems to have foreseen the irreversible ecological and geological transformations brought on by human industrial activity, a new worldview scholars have been calling the anthropocene.26INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN LEPAGE'S RINGSince Chéreau's production, the development of digital media has transformed the ways we experience opera. While audiovisual technology used to be employed to transmit performances (television broadcast, VHS, DVD, cinema relay), digital media have since made their way to the stage. Digital opera studies, however, are still influenced by previous scholarly work on audiovisual transmission. Musicologists have commented on this technological revolution. Melina Esse argued that opera's cinematic adaptation carries its own form of presence that is not secondary or fallen from the supposed authenticity of the live performance.27 Similarly, João Pedro Cachopo has more recently proposed that opera's translation into cinema might even be necessary for the genre's survival.28 In contrast, Bernadette Cochrane and Frances Bonner have pointed out that scholarly debates on these topics have been skewed through use of "inaccurate terms" in naming these new practices.29They argue for a critical understanding of relay technology, rather than relying on the purposefully inaccurate terminology of marketing strategies and their disavowal of the commodification of performance: relays are not live if you are not in the same time-zone and they are not broadcast because they are narrowly disseminated on encrypted digital channels to cinema goers willing to pay a premium. The authors conclude that studying relayed performances as if they were films obscures, rather than informs the theatrical and televisual aspects of these events.30 This semantic and critical confusion around filming and cinema relays also finds its way to discussions of digital media in opera scenography.Fig 2Photo 2.The cinematographic tenor of these scholarly debates seems to have spilled over into the controversy surrounding Robert Lepage's production of The Ring. According to Ellen Gamerman, for example, opera is now in the business of creating the kind of "film-style effects" usually found in Hollywood movies.31 Her remarks were prompted by Lepage's production of The Ring's first episode, Das Rheingold.32 Beyond the novelty of digital effects, however, cinema has a tradition of spectacular effects that was inherited from theatrical revues and, later, Broadway shows. Hollywood musicals transmitted the tradition of huge sets upon which performers danced, kicked, dived, and sang, an intermedial practice of theatre and cinema encapsulated as early as 1936 in The Great Ziegfeld33 (Photo 2). Because of this Hollywood tradition, something is strangely familiar in Lepage's immense 45-ton revolving-plank set, which takes up the whole space of the stage in all four episodes of The Ring. Not only do characters climb and slide all over this shifting machine like the Ziegfeld girls would, but lighting, images, and videos are projected onto it as well. Yet by focusing on the spectacular aspect of the production and the special effects inherited from Hollywood movies, (and, by association, its supposedly low-brow, comic-book superficiality) the critical reception of this Ring production has not fully investigated its digital innovations for opera scenography.When one hears the term special effects today, one thinks of fantastic worlds of science fiction and fantasy films. As Matthew Wilson Smith has noted, however, the special effects in Lepage's Ring are distributed within a theatrical practice of multimedia scenography that has less to do with cinema than it does with videogames.34 Most operagoers will have already seen a production that features the digital projection of an element of decor or set. Projections are, however, only one instrument in the cache of digital means upon which rely Lepage and his production company, ExMachina. In listing the production's interactive software and stage implements, Smith's article follows Lepage's claim that "digital interactivity [...] returns the human to performance" as the opera singers prompt the digital projections that take place not only on a backdrop behind them, but often all around them.35 The interactive media onstage promise wonders for future opera productions in terms of singer-led scripted improvisations that instantaneously alter or, more precisely, enhance scenography. In the liner notes that accompany the DVD of Die Walküre, Lepage states that the interactivevideo projections [are] triggered by the singers' bodies and voices. Very little is pre-shot. The idea was to put technology at the service of the music and the choreography and the theatrical presence of the performer.36Further on the same page, he explains that the same technology was used for instrumental passages in which the "live swelling [of objects projected on screen] comes from the orchestra." One wonders, however, at the level of interactivity in the magic lantern show that Lepage projected against the backdrop of Hunding's hut while Siegmund regales his hosts with the tale of his family origins. Does the orchestra's playing determine the rhythm of the phantasmagoria unravelling? Beyond evoking the intimacy of the hearth as the sole source of heat and light in a primitive hut, the magic lantern show is also Lepage's tip of the hat to Wagner himself, who, against the advice of his choreographer, used the technique to depict the Ride of the Valkyries in his inaugural staging at Bayreuth.37Yet by including the original form of the phantasmagoria in this particular scene, rather than employing the medium to stage winged horses, Lepage is making a comment that critics and zealots of fidelity should ponder further: one can be faithful to Wagner's curiosity and search for the newest stage technologies without, however, perpetuating a Romantic nationalistic discourse of mythical origins. Indeed, Lepage might be sympathetic to Wagner's technological scenography, but not necessarily to his aesthetic ideology. The proscenium in front of the Machine has, after all, clearly demonstrated Lepage's knowledge of previous scenographic reforms of Wagner's work, more precisely of Adolphe Appia's use of electrical lighting in order "to clear the stage space so that attention would be focused principally on the singing actor."38 In recasting the phantasmagoria to Siegmund's high tale, rather than the descent of the winged horses, and in nicknaming his set "the Machine," Lepage's production clearly invites us to look behind our shoulder, to turn our head and investigate not only the shadows on stage, but the sources of light that make them possible.Nevertheless, this type of intermedial interactivity--i.e. the prompting of moving images on the set through vocalization and bodily movements--is an important site of visual friction with the mimetic scenes in The Ring, not so much because of what the interactive media make appear, but because of Lepage's refusal to employ the technology to its full extent in the scenes that seem to require it most. For all of these ingenious and critical deployments of digital scenography, the Tarnhelm scenes are treated with relatively traditional means. Although the dragon's body as projected onto the "Machine" takes up the whole width of the stage, the image remains still, while only the mechanical head and tail on either side of the Machine are mobile. In this same scene, Alberich does not vanish through a smoke screen of digital invention, but by being rolled off-stage on a dissimulated dolly. As Alberich crouches while being pulled off-stage, the effect is one of transformation, especially as it occurs while the dragon comes to life. Similarly, the dragon in Siegfried is also a mechanical prop. All of the Tarnhelm's mimetic scenes of animal metamorphoses have been created with traditional theatrical effects, when, given its digital means, the production could have easily relied on greater displays of virtual reality. With the latest technology available to stage the mimetic scenes of The Ring, Lepage does not feed the illusion that an immersion in digital projections might free us from our awareness of technology and restore us--if not to a pure, primeval nature, at least--to the autonomy of our inner nature. By consciously avoiding this movement-detection and replication technology in the scenes that are potentially the most phantasmagorical, Lepage's digital scenography is thus critically discerning of the Gesamtkunstwerk's iconic and crystalline dialectic.CONCLUSIONIn an interview during an intermission of the cinema relay of Siegfried, Lepage's collaborator, Roger Parent, explained where his company Réalisations.net found the technology to give the Forest bird a three-dimensional appearance and make its beak move in time with the vocalist's singing. He quite candidly told viewers that it was gathered, among other places, from military research and development, but that put in the hands of artists, it recreated a magical world for the age of digital technology.39 In this confession, one hears the digital echoes of Kittler's discussion of Babbage's militarization of the coloured light he discovered at the theatre. Instead of looking back to Bayreuth's special effects and the concealment of steam engines and the manual labour involved in feeding their furnaces, another archaeological investigation of media might better explain how spectators adopt a certain discourse when they experience interactive stage media within an aesthetic totality.Sean Michael's novel Us Conductors offers many opportunities to ponder the darker political side of the kind of intermedial interactivity at work in Lepage's Ring. This fictional biography of Léon Theremin explores the ethical ramifications of the many technological devices he developed following his research in electromagnetism. Michael's novel stages a particular invention that resonates like an analogue counterpoint to the movement- and sound-activated digital bubbles, pebbles, mists, and clouds in Lepage's production of Das Rheingold. It was in New York City as well that Theremin's interest in the electromagnetic harnessing of dance gestures and their translation into sound led to his invention of the terpsitone. As Michael's novel embeds the novel's narration within imagined scenes in which Theremin writes his autobiography, the narrator and character here speak in the first person:the terpsitone [...] was my crown jewel, my new infatuation. It felt like an object I had found, an old artifact I had uncovered: dance that makes music. Whereas the theremin reads melody from the gestures of two hands in the air, the terpsitone, the "ether-wave dance stage," interprets movements of the whole body. The performer's gestures have a double meaning--the gestures as gestures, and the manipulation of sound.40The terpsitone is not only the mechanical expression of its inventor's passion for dance; the uncovered "old artefact" further represents Theremin's desire to employ technology to retrieve art's mimetic origins in bodily expression. The terpsitone, by sounding the music of people's dancing, could even reverse the commodification logic of the cultural industry.As noted above with Tomlinson, the attempt to resurrect a period prior to music's entanglement in the world of commodities was already an unknowing subject of concern for Wagner. Indeed, the similarities between Michael's representation of Theremin's technological utopianism and the Wagnerian "Artwork of the Future" both involve speculation on the mimetic origins and destiny of art:The most realistic of all arts is that of Dance. Its artistic "stuff" is the actual living Man; and in troth no single portion of him, but the whole man from heel to crown, such as he shows himself unto the eye. It therefore includes within itself the conditions for the enunciation of all remaining arts: the singing and speaking man must necessarily be a bodily man; through his outer form, through the posture of his limbs, the inner, singing and speaking man comes for to view. The arts of Tone and Poetry become first understandable in that of Dance, the Mimetic art, by the entire art-receptive man, i.e. by him who not only hears but also sees.41Wagner goes on to explain how drama was created after Dance's multiple stages of mimetic translation into other genres and media (Tone and Poetry). Theremin, going a step further, employs the terpsitone's electromagnetic technology to bypass all of the historical mimetic translations of dance into sound and poetry that form the gesamt part of Wagner's total work of art.42Does Theremin's analogue multimedia technology compare to Lepage's digital interactive stage devices? Or, to put it differently, do the special effects of Lepage's production unravel the aesthetic ideology of Wagner's Ring? For one, Lepage's interactive media do not produce sound, but rather images. Second, they harness sound, as well as gesture to modulate or enhance programmed images or even modify them according to programmed algorithms. Third, contrary to the surveillance capacities of Theremin's technology, Lepage's interactive media do not seek to invade private discussions or to spy on certain characters. One might say, therefore, that Lepage's interactive scenography is a digital extrapolation on Wagner's scenographic ambitions. To media archaeology, however, Wagner's music drama prefigures the social deployment of Theremin's technology. Indeed, just as Bayreuth foreshadowed other 20th-century technologies, Wagner's mimetic ambitions had already announced the rise of electronic surveillance. In answer to Mime's plot to kill Siegfried, Wagner has his hero drink the metamorphosed blood of the slayed Fafner, in order that he might partake in the mimetic order and understand the Forest bird's warning, as well as Mime's thoughts. In this scene as in others, the primitivist regression of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk foreshadows the worst social uses of media technology. In an age of massive surveillance, perhaps being "faithful" to Wagner's scenography entails the use of digital technology in order to problematize the desires and fantasies of the dramas, rather than attempting to realise Wagner's dream.Notes1.

This investigation is occasioned primarily by the rise of digital and networked photographies, and the disruptive potential they seem to hold with respect to this reciprocal influence. Drawing on theories of materialist media ecology, it proceeds by way of an interpretative experiment in relation to a set of photographs of a park, as circulated on Instagram. I ask, can social media images be seen as unintentionally disruptive of the reciprocity between landscape and photography, and if so, what are the avenues through which they might then become politically productive? My principal aims in doing so are (1) to explore an approach to photographic interpretation and analysis that is appropriate to the contexts of production and circulation provided by photographic social media; and (2) to identify possible strategies or points of future intervention on behalf of alternative or frictional visibilities.28242_UF0001.jpgErin Despard, is currently ICCS Postdoctoral Fellow at the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and an Honorary Research Associate in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow.

Email: erin.despard@glasgow.ac.ukThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netThis paper begins from the assumption that public designed landscapes such as parks and gardens do much more than simply provide a space for recreation, social mixing or "contact with nature." They constitute a socially and culturally powerful if subtle form of media. I mean this in two senses: first, they mediate perception of the surroundings in ways that differentially value particular views, experiences, activities, aesthetic qualities and ways of being;1 second, they function as mediums of social and cultural exchange--in the form, for example, of photographs taken and circulated in social media.2 In this second sense, it becomes clear that their functioning in the first sense is itself mediated, or rather, that designed landscapes are only socially and culturally effective in interaction with other media forms.In recent years, particularly in cities, the interactivity of landscape and other visual media appears to be intensifying, or at least, is increasingly explicit. On the one hand, the rise of camera phones and photographic social media (e.g. Flickr, Instagram) means that not only tourists but also residents are increasingly disposed to photograph and otherwise represent aspects of their engagement with landscape. Certain kinds of public landscape (especially parks and gardens) are also increasingly animated by programming promoted, and sometimes even delivered through social media. On the other hand, such landscapes are conceived as environments capable of mediating behaviour. Especially in North America, parks and other public spaces are increasingly designed to prevent behaviours such as vandalism, sleeping in public and drug trafficking,3 not to mention terrorist attacks.4 Further, those not designed and/or managed for such purposes are frequently seen to facilitate those activities.5As I discuss further below, such developments reflect an intensification or perhaps clarification of a longstanding reciprocity between landscape and other visual media--photography in particular. This reciprocity is worth investigating for three reasons. First, both landscape and photography exert a considerable influence over what is seen, and how, in urban public spaces. In this, they also shape what can be talked about, interacted with, reproduced, valued and so on. That is, to draw on the broad definition of visibility given by Brighenti (wherein the cultural-perceptual and socio-political dimensions substantially overlap): by visibilising public space in particular ways, they help to delineate the horizon of possible social and environmental relations.6Second, it is possible to observe in certain forms of both landscape and photography, a tendency toward an increasing homogenization of effects. For example, as the analysis presented below demonstrates, in landscapes designed for security, and networked or social photographies designed for commercially oriented data production, place-based visibilities are managed or structured in ways that tend to produce effects that are politically and perceptually similar.7 In relation to public parks, which have historically been sites for both the "symbolic projection of public culture"8 and a display of and/or contact with urban nature, the prospect of an increasing visual homogeneity, shaped by the imperatives of surveillance on the one hand, and those of commerce on the other, is troubling: what happens, for example, to those forms of life and ways of being in the city that impede surveillance or are not photogenic?Third, landscape and photography exhibit a similar "duplicity" in their ability to disguise their influence by concealing the means and conditions of their making.9 While the perceptual effects of media are always hard to see (because transparent), the various techniques that disguise and naturalize horticultural interventions in the landscape, combined with the "black-boxing" of digital photographic technologies, makes their contribution to the shaping of place-based urban visibilities all the more obscure.From this perspective, the rise of photographic social media such as Instagram--which enables a more broadly accessible means of visually engaging and communicating about urban landscapes--inspires a certain hope. Might the newness of such technologies, combined with the sheer volume of its their uptake, register some unexpected means of disrupting processes of visual homogenization and producing alternative points of view? I am particularly interested in the possibility that photographic social media may contribute to the development of collective processes of landscape interpretation and criticism. As several authors have recently argued, the sheer volume of images produced and consumed through social or "networked" photographies means their content cannot be interpreted according to existing models of representation and communication.10 Here I explore the possibility that this destabilization of interpretation by experts may open new terrain for collective critical practice.My primary intervention is to undertake an interpretative "experiment" in relation to a set of photographs of a park, as circulated on Instagram.11 Drawing inspiration from theories of materialist media ecology, I ask, can social media images be seen as unintentionally critical of a given landscape and public space, and if so, what are the avenues through which they might then become politically productive? My principal aims in doing so are 1) to explore an approach to photographic interpretation and analysis that is appropriate to the contexts of production and circulation provided by photographic social media; and 2) to identify points of future intervention on behalf of frictional as opposed to reciprocal visibilities of land, environment and social life in the city.I proceed by tracing some of the social, material and technical relations implied in the production and circulation of a particular photographic content on Instagram, attempting both to reveal an unintended critical potential, as well as identify the conditions of its interpretation and exploitation as such. While this results in observations that are not exactly hopeful with respect to a political use of Instagram, I finish by discussing some concrete interventions that may provide a starting point for connecting potentially frictional content with existing or future politics of urban visibility. Before presenting this analysis however, I discuss the reciprocity of landscape and photography from a historical perspective, the functioning of Instagram in relation to landscape generally, and the conceptual framework that motivates my approach.LANDSCAPES IN INTERACTION WITH OTHER VISUAL MEDIAFrom the perspective of the term's aesthetic use, "landscape" has, since its appearance in the 16th century, always been shaped by technologically enabled and culturally specific processes of visual mediation (e.g. painting, photography, landscape gardening).12 There is as such a historically specific conflation between the perception, representation and production of landscape: to look at landscape is already to look through land in a particular way.13 This conflation is in part what has enabled particular aesthetic values and sensibilities to appear self-evident in certain contexts, which in turn has facilitated a range of political projects dependent on the covert shaping of visibility--for example, through the design of landscapes that shape views and stage social relations in ways that are disguised and/or naturalized,14 or through representations and interpretations of land that elevate particular qualities and effects as a means to sustain or elevate a particular social order.15Arguably, photography has played a special role in elaborating and securing landscape's secret powers, since it was invented just as the landscape "way of seeing" was becoming naturalized. As Nickel writes, "photography was born into a pre-existing, albeit incipient, notion of the photographic, one based on conceiving of the world as already containing an infinite number of latent pictorial compositions awaiting discovery."16 Since then, Giblett asserts, it has become "one of the major ways in which modern, technologically savvy people relate to the land, and the land is mediated to them." In the process, starting with the fact that the landscape format is the norm for photography (since you have to turn the camera on its side to take a portrait): "The technology of photography ... inscribes and reproduces landscape aesthetics."17 Between the two "ways of seeing," there is a common work of aestheticization (and de-politicization): just as the perception and re-presentation of land as landscape is a means of putting oneself at a distance from its productive use,18 so the photograph both beautifies and objectifies what it pictures.19Of course, as both Cosgrove and Sontag note, what the device of the camera adds in particular, is the illusion of objectivity.20 Especially in landscape photographs, practices of "looking through" and "looking at" become thoroughly intertwined, leaving us with what appears to be an objective rendering of a particular place: not only how it looks, but what of interest is there, and its importance in relation to other elements. It is easy to forget that what we see of a given place is selective, and to allow a particular point of view to stand in for the place itself.21 Such an effect is amplified in a modern touristic context, where people tend to visit landscape precisely to see in person what they have already seen of it through postcards, promotional materials, and the myriad of (often very similar) images supplied by a Google Images search.22From this point of view, the homogenization of place-based visibilities seems inescapable in a digital age. However, the convergence of new photographic and communication technologies has also introduced new potential sources of visual friction. As Cruz and Meyer observe, camera phones make it much easier to take photographs in a variety of settings, while mobile and online photo-sharing applications make it cheaper and more convenient to share them.23 The massive and widespread uptake of digital and "networked photographies" has produced new, still emergent modes of photographic engagement. Not only are people taking and sharing more photos, more often, they are engaging in expressive and communicative as well as commemorative modes of photographic practice.24 This has given rise to new fields of aesthetic value as well as new forms of community that sustain them.25At the same time, photographic social media is increasingly deployed as a key component in promoting programming for urban public places, raising the possibility that the affordances of specific media forms may in turn shape the nature, or even the site of that programming. In this context, Instagram is particularly well suited to an investigation of the intermedial shaping of urban place-based visibilities. I turn now to a brief discussion of its specific functionality.INSTAGRAM AND URBAN SPACEInstagram is an application designed exclusively for smartphones (and more recently, tablets) that enables mobile photo capture, editing and sharing. It was launched in 2010, bought by Facebook in 2012 (for $1 billion), and currently claims 400 million active users who upload, on average, 80 million photographs a day.26 Though it is promoted as photographic social media, in which the social and the aesthetic are effortlessly blended, its most important feature from the perspective of its commercial productivity, is the way the uploading of photographs permits the correlation of location data and social data. With some exceptions,27 most research on Instagram has, to date, focused on the associated data, and in particular, how to make use of it for a variety of (often commercially oriented) purposes.28 In this context, what the photographs themselves are or do is not theorized, and sometimes not even clearly stated. This vagueness in relation to content corresponds to an underappreciation of the diverse ways in which Instagram accounts are used: for example, not only as a way of communicating with friends, but also as tools of marketing, advertising and awareness-raising, or as galleries, portfolios or visual journals for creative professionals.This combination of conceptual vagueness with a diversity of uses means that the larger cultural significance of Instagram has yet to be clearly articulated. However, I take seriously Instagram's claim that it is "a new way to see the world." For one, I find it striking that the majority of users regularly employ the built-in filters.29 Its restriction to mobile use, and its highly streamlined functionality (relative to Facebook or Flickr, for example), makes it possible to edit photographs on location and in place. This suggests that its effects in relation to urban spaces may be perceptual as well as social, simultaneously aestheticizing and elevating the social and cultural value of particular locations, qualities and events. In this context, it must be seen as a key vector through which the technical, habitual and discursive shaping of land and place-based visibilities takes place.CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGICAL ORIENTATIONAs several authors argue, the technological and practical changes associated with networked photographies and the never-ending avalanche of images that carry them, demand a new interpretative frame. Perhaps most importantly, the quantity and circumstances of their production, and their presentation in a continuously updated stream, suggest a relational or contextual significance that exceeds the boundaries of the photograph itself.30 This significance is specified in part through the use of hashtags, which provide photographs with a codified, as opposed to narrative, contextual significance. For Rubenstein and Sluis, this makes the taking and sharing of photographs more akin to speech than the kind of artistic or commemorative acts on which interpretation was premised in the past. They suggest that networked photographies operate in ways similar to what Frosh observes about stock photography--that is, on the basis of culturally engrained associations that signify without needing to be consciously interpreted.31 They trade, in other words, on the communicative economy of the glance: yielding a semantic density that tends to be culturally normative.While such developments challenge the existing premises for interpretation, they also make it possible to interrogate practices of "looking through" and "looking at" in new ways. When photographs of urban landscape are edited and distributed in place, the amount of reflection or critical appraisal is minimized, giving us less a collection of photographs selected for their aesthetic or narrative qualities, and more a record--or rather, a display--of the photographer looking through the camera at the landscape. At the same time, the simultaneous insertion of photographs into collective archives (via hashtags) produces new traces of the socio-cultural processes attending practices of looking. What visual social media offers to interpretation is thus less a particular kind of photograph, and more a different perspective on a multifaceted and ongoing process of (re)mediation.32At the same time, recent technological and urban environmental developments suggest that the agency of non-human objects and processes are increasingly pervasive in shaping photographic possibilities and constraints, particularly in relation to photographs of urban public landscapes. On the one hand, there is an increasing convergence between photographic and computing technologies;33 on the other, an increase in the presumed capacity of designed landscape to shape perception, use of, and movement through public spaces.34 Especially while they are still in process, these developments call for a mode of conceptualizing and interpreting social media photographs of landscape that acknowledges the intermedial and less narrowly intentional nature of their production.In the recent Digital snaps: The new face of photography, several authors propose that personal or social photography should be understood as an evolving media ecology.35 I propose that this is an especially appropriate framework for interrogating the role of such photographies in the intermedial production of urban visibilities. Inspired in large part by the work of Marshall Mcluhan and his contemporaries, the term "media ecology" acknowledges, for a start, the relational and interactive character of media forms, prioritizing the socio-material effects of those forms over their specific content. It takes media to be environmental in their influence, since they alter our perception and experience of, as well as behaviour in, the world in a manner that is immersive and effectively transparent.36Building on these observations, as well as the insights of vitalist and new materialist philosophies, authors such as Matthew Fuller and Jussi Parikka take a more inclusively materialist approach to the description of media ecologies, proposing that "media" refers not only to technologies of communication, but to a more general capacity to register and transduce or translate circumstances and events into intensities and effects perceptible to others. To mediate is thus not only to affect, but to be affected and thereby, to invent new relational possibilities.37 From this perspective, media ecologies do not constitute stable communities, but, to paraphrase Parikka, ongoing "experiments in relatedness" between a variety of bodies, technologies and circumstances in a given place.38 From this perspective, the production of visibility can be seen as a process of continual re-mediation that is always place-based, even when its effects are mobile.For my purposes, one of the principal benefits of this broadened definition is its displacement of emphasis from (intentional) use to the effects of media. It enables us to avoid resorting to "received concepts such as 'self-expression' or 'representation'" and encourages us to focus on how specific photographies work and what they do.39 This does not preclude an interpretative analysis, however: both Fuller and Parikka practice a materialist approach towards interpretation that is oriented toward effects produced by specific technologies, art works, media systems and practical communities, and the relations implied in and sustained or challenged by them. While they focus on examples drawn from artistic works that explicitly seek a creative disruption of existing media relations, I consider social media photographs of a particular urban landscape in terms of their potential for unintentional disruption. I do this by (somewhat artificially) isolating two moments in a larger process of ongoing (re)mediation, exploring within each, different avenues for making the relations implied in the production of specific urban visibilities appear.More specifically, I experiment with the introduction of interpretative constraints consistent with the observations about networked photographies outlined above. That is, I ask: given a certain photographic content, what might we see differently--of that content, or the landscape that afforded it--if we refuse access to the photographer's intentions, or recourse to a single "use" or genre of photography? Drawing on a variety of sources to contextualize the production and circulation of content, I trace a (failed) trajectory of its critical potential, attempting to show what the photographs can and can't do by pushing them (imaginatively) to do more than they want to, and to make certain socio-technical relations of production and circulation appear.The first moment I attempt to (partially) re-construct, is that of the photograph's production. On the basis of visits to the site, my own photographic documentation and consideration of the site plan, and drawing on Gibson's theory of affordances as well as knowledge of the principles guiding the design of public landscapes for security and crime prevention purposes, I identify a set of photographs that picture an unexpectedly disruptive relation between camera and landscape, but one whose socio-semiotic effects are thoroughly ambiguous. The second moment is prospective in character, constructed as a means of imagining what such potentially critical but politically ambiguous photographs might do in circulation. On the basis of my own experiments with hashtags and consideration of prescriptions regarding their use, I identify some constraints on the possibilities in this regard.The analysis is followed by a discussion of what, between these two moments, can now be said about the appearance and mobilization of unintended visual frictions within the intermedial production of urban visibilities. I conclude by making some modest suggestions regarding tactics for developing and extending their political potential.#GRANDPARKLA, THE INTERPRETATIVE EXPERIMENT: BACKGROUND AND SET-UPThe newly renovated Grand Park opened in downtown Los Angeles in July of 2012. Designed by landscape architects Rios Clementi Hale Studios, the signs at its entry points proclaim that it is "the park for everyone"--in other words, an inclusive space for celebrating the city's cultural diversity. Sloping downhill across four blocks to the base of City Hall, it is a park of wide-open spaces, spectacular architectural features (such as a large, multi-level fountain lit by coloured floodlights at night), and attractively framed views of important cultural and civic landmarks. Paid for in large part by the developer of a downtown condominium complex,40 the project has multiple stakeholders, including the Los Angeles Music Center, which is situated at the top of the park, and administers its programming. Envisioned in part as a means of addressing ongoing problems with homelessness, crime and drug use in the downtown core, the park is meant to be a safe, socially vibrant public space. It has been the focus of substantial cultural programming to entice people into the city centre, and its administrators have cultivated a comprehensive and strongly visual social media presence: in addition to a website, the park has a blog and Facebook account, as well as Twitter and Instagram feeds.In this context, Instagram users would appear to be doing the park administrators' work for them, since many of their photographs can be seen as promotional of park programming. As of January 11, 2015, Instagram returned 2407 photographs and videos associated with the hashtag #grandparkla. The majority of these photographs depict either the park's fountain, a view of City Hall, or people enjoying social and cultural events held in the park. More convincingly perhaps than park administrators, such photographs show the park's social relevance--often to thousands of people at a time--treating it as a backdrop to a range of social and cultural activities. In this context, I am particularly interested in those photographs that are of landscape--by which I mean, those that, more-or-less self-consciously, show us something about the landscape itself or its features. I see these as potential sites of a visible inter-action between landscape and photography.The example I treat here works with a subset of the photographs tagged #grandparkla, created on the basis of an observation made while scrolling through the updating grid of thumbnail images on the screen of my mobile phone. I was struck by the regular, if not frequent, appearance of a particular content that, even on this small scale, was unusually noticeable: that is, the park's bright pink furniture. Movable chairs, benches and tables are distributed in large quantities through most areas of the park, constituting both a content and a part of the landscape (see Figure 1). They are frequently featured in official photographs, commentary on the park and in its promotional materials (e.g. see www.grandparkla.org). The same colour of pink appears in all on and offline communications.Fig 1Figure 1.  Grand Park, Los Angeles, July 2013 (photograph by author).Grand Park is not the first to offer its visitors movable chairs.41 However, their bright colour and their distribution throughout the landscape, as opposed to being contained within one portion of it, introduces a more explicitly aesthetic dimension to their use. That is, they are for certain purposes--i.e. those that require novel content and highly contrasting colours--very photogenic. By inviting a photographic response, they serve to aestheticize what is otherwise a more exclusively social or practical use of landscape. To me, the photographs featuring these chairs epitomize Instagram's relation to landscape, since they capture a social use of it that wants to be pictured. Further, given the brightness and singularity of their colour, the chairs automatically situate the content of the photographs in which they appear within the park. Or at least, they do this more and more reliably as images of the chairs proliferate in various contexts over time. In this sense, the landscape facilitates its own mediation through (photographic) social media--promoting its cultural programming by permitting it to be definitively located whenever it is photographed in the vicinity of the chairs.In order to gain a way of working with these photographs in context (as well as avoiding contravention of Instagram's rules of use), I compiled a collection of photographs by reposting them to a dedicated Instagram account (with notice and credit given to the photographer; see Figure 2).42 To begin with, I selected all those that featured the pink furniture in a prominent enough manner to catch my eye on a continuous scroll (reproducing the kind of viewing involved in hashtag-based searches of Instagram generally). Looking at this collection (of approximately 100 photographs) made new observations possible--most notably, the fact that over a third of them (33) featured chairs that were either predominantly or entirely empty (see Figures 3 and 4).Fig 2Figure 2.  Profile page for @pinkchairsofgrandpark.Fig 3Figure 3.  Screenshot of photograph by @jessohbee, as reposted to @pinkchairsofgrandpark.Fig 4Figure 4.  Screenshot of photograph by @ogfrag, as reposted to @pinkchairsofgrandpark.These photographs would seem to challenge what otherwise appears a supportive role for photographic social media in relation to the park's programming, since they show the park failing in its mandate to populate a downtown public space. They present a view of the park that depicts not a design solution, but its founding problem: a social vacancy writ large. While recognizing that this reading reflects a disruptive potential more than an actual effect, asking how such content is both socio-semiotically afforded and--it turns out--complicated, by the landscape's design, is a way of seeing how such a potential might be unintentionally and collectively produced.SOCIAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL COMPLICATIONS: THE SOCIO-SEMIOTIC AFFORDANCES OF GRAND PARKAlthough it is not a common mode of landscape interpretation, a semiotic analysis of the way space is organized can reveal a great deal about the way the built environment is "read" and experienced by inhabitants and visitors.43 The broadly socio-semiotic interpretation I present here draws on J.J. Gibson's theory of affordances44 as a means of emphasizing that, not only is the use and experience of designed landscapes inextricably tied to the socio-cultural and geographical context in which they appear, they are always addressed at least in part to the body and its specific sociocultural competencies.45 Local users (or adequatelyknowledgeable visitors), need not explicitly "read" particular meanings in a given landscape in order for them to register on a perceptual and affective level. Designed landscapes make a particular orientation to land, environment and other users useful in a given setting--they afford the expression and therefore the reproduction of specific aesthetic values, perceptual habits, behavioural norms and so on. It is the production of such an orientation in Grand Park, as well as some of its socio-political implications that I attempt to uncover here.In North America, principles for the design of "safe" public spaces, as promoted since the 1970s by the Defensible Space, Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design and Secured by Design movements,46 are now enshrined in "best practices" for landscape architecture professionals.47These principles, which emphasize the importance of maximizing the "legibility" of public spaces and the visibility of users within them, provide an increasingly taken-for-granted orientation to public land that nonetheless has profound social and political implications. Perhaps most importantly, it is based on a model of crime prevention that requires the exclusion of certain users (e.g. not only criminals and terrorists, but homeless people, "loitering" youth, skateboarders and so on) in order to make others feel more comfortable.48 It also puts constraints on the type and form of vegetation that may be used, and on the style of its cultivation, relying heavily on the social significance of "tidy" vegetative forms to signify oversight.49 Reading Grand Park through the lens of the principle of "natural surveillance" in particular provides a means of bringing the park's visual infrastructure, and some of its locally afforded significance, more clearly into view.As noted above, Grand Park is composed of a series of open spaces that slope downhill. The vegetation is to a large extent clustered around the perimeter of these spaces, allowing the park to open on an attractively framed view of City Hall from multiple locations. Thus, in photographs of Grand Park that appear in various online contexts, and in the park's own promotional materials, it is very common to see a view of City Hall. The park's openness is however also conducive to other types of viewing, depicted only indirectly in photographs (i.e. in what is not pictured). Given that the vegetation surrounding or intersecting the open lawn areas, consists mainly of low growing perennial grasses and flowers, and relatively high canopy trees, the entire middle plane of the landscape is consistently empty, and there are virtually no opportunities for concealment. No matter where you are in the park, you can see across it. As such, it provides a perfect example of a space designed for "natural surveillance" (as well as that provided by an extensive cctv network and four security guards around the clock).50This quality of the landscape is especially significant (if not immediately perceptible as such) in downtown LA, where public spaces have tended to host gatherings of homeless people as well as a range of illegal activities, and where, just around the corner, Occupy LA was encamped in 2011. Thus, while city officials promised upon its opening, that political activities would be permitted within the park, their hope was that "the nature of the space might sway park-goers to more modest pursuits."51 As further press coverage of the park's opening emphasized, concerns about drug use, sleeping in the park, and protest encampments led to a commitment by the city to a "firm and vigilant" approach to security. As one administrator put it: "We don't want to throw protesters out ... but we want this to be a park for everyone to enjoy ...."52 Thus while the "park for everyone," proclaims inclusivity, in practice, the comfort of certain people is prioritized over the rights and needs of others (to free speech, or a place to sleep, for example).So far, the strategies employed at Grand Park seem to be perceived (at least in the mainstream media) as successful. A 2013 LA Times article compares Grand Park--where homeless people are reported to attend cultural events, and to use the restrooms to wash up each morning--to that of nearby Pershing Square, large portions of which are regularly roped off to prevent the use of lawns and benches by homeless people, and where police have been accused of harassing them. The enforcement of "extensive" regulations, and Grand Park's "design elements" are seen as major factors in its success.53 From this point of view, the photographs of empty chairs respond, not to a vacant, but a socially hygienic environment. They are not chairs that fail to be sat upon, but chairs that succeed in not providing a place to sleep. As a subject for photography, we could say that they are doubly (and ambiguously) attractive: they draw attention, not just because of their bright colour, and its contribution to the landscape, but also, with Pershing Square just around the corner, because of the historically and geographically specific affect of their emptiness.THE (LIMITED) MOBILIZATION OF AN AMBIGUOUSLY CRITICAL CONTENT VIA HASHTAGSThe majority of users posting photographs of empty chairs have also attached several hashtags to their photographs. Hashtags provide descriptions of photographs that are machine-readable, and therefore searchable. While some Instagram users do not employ them to a substantial degree, many use them to expand or specify the potential audience for their photographs. In general, they refer to events, places, personal interests, narrative themes, or more simply to the photograph's subject, and thus specify the contexts with which the photographer wishes the photograph to be associated. Politically speaking, their simultaneously classificatory and communicative functioning has multiple, somewhat conflicted effects.On the one hand, machine-readable photographs are amenable to data analysis, which enables its capture for commercial and surveillance purposes (i.e. correlating content with locations, which can in turn be correlated with all kinds of other data useful to market research, location-based advertising, predictive policing and so on). On the other hand, hashtags can be used to convincingly associate local places, circumstances or events with larger causes and campaigns (e.g. recently in the US, #blacklivesmatter). There is also a certain potential, though it is more rare, to make novel associations, or bring awareness to otherwise invisible problems. For example, in relation to Grand Park's empty pink chairs, we can imagine a somewhat challenging context might be specified by associating them with hashtags such as #whereiseveryone? #emptyparks or #socialexclusion. Finally, as Rubenstein and Sluis point out, hashtags also enable photographic content to escape the contexts of its original production, since it can be viewed by audiences outside of one's social network and potentially be shared or otherwise combined with other online content in unexpected ways.54The fact that the photos of empty chairs are accompanied by hashtags, thus suggests they have a certain potential for mobility. These hashtags are however, universally mundane and general in content. Aside from #grandparkla (which they all share), the most common among them are #dtla or #downtownLA (17 occurrences) and #pink (6 occurrences). Aside from these, there is little consensus among users, and most hashtags appear only once or twice, often pertaining to other aspects of the image (e.g. its inclusion of a pet dog or a new bike), or to such general themes as #work, #city or #furniture.To me, these hashtags are not only apolitical; they actively mitigate against a political interpretation. The fact that the only consensus among these users pertains to the location and pinkness of the chairs, upholds their aesthetic and locative function within the park's design--as if their social purpose and its relative success (to foster occupation and flexible use of a public space) was irrelevant. I find it modestly conspicuous that none of the photographers noted (in either hashtags or captions) that the chairs were empty, despite the fact that it is their emptiness that permits their portrayal as an aesthetic yet socially charged object. Elsewhere on Instagram, the enigma of the empty chair has become something of a cross-cultural preoccupation (e.g. #emptychairsproject contains almost 19,000 images of empty chairs from all over the world), while in another American park featuring movable chairs (Bryant Park in New York City), the sight of empty chairs en masse was so jarring as to permit their deployment as part of an art work commemorating the 9/11 terrorist attacks.55 In fact, what a consideration of these hashtags suggests, is that in the absence of a political intention, rather than increasing mobility, or enabling an escape of photographic content from its original context, what hashtags do more significantly, is fix the context of viewing: these chairs are pink, not empty. They are meant to signify a place (#grandparkla, #dtla), and the photographer's presence there, but little else.Although the choice of hashtags here is perhaps not as strategic as it could be (since photographs with popular hashtags--such as #dtla and #pink--fall very quickly off the front end of the search results) the fixing of context is in fact what Instagram "wants": this is what produces patterns of association useful to market research and location-based advertising.56 In an article in the Instagram Help Center, it is advised that the most effective hashtags are specific but "relevant"; they "stand out and connect with the people most like you."57 Thus while the use of hashtags would seem a potentially powerful moment for creating novel associations and challenging hegemonic perspectives, in practice, such use is destined to be marginalized: as I discovered in the process of experimenting with more political hashtags for my re-posted photos of empty pink chairs, if you want a given photo to be viewed by users other than your followers, you need to choose a hashtag that corresponds to existing interests and communities--something that other people already know and care about. The more political hashtags proposed above, correspond either with very small numbers of photographs (suggesting there will be few users who search for and find yours), or meanings not relevant to my purposes.It is also worth noting in this context, that Instagram does not permit other users to add hashtags to a given photograph, which severely limits the possibilities for the re-contextualization of content. In this context, I propose that it is less the quantitative mobility of photographs--their ability to "escape" the personal context of their production--and more the porosity of their contextualization that is disruptively promising. That is, it is not only a question of whether a given photo is viewed outside the social context provided by one's followers, but also of the extent to which those other viewings can be politically oriented or at least open-ended. Given that most users select apolitical hashtags, what might enable their photographs to be viewed in a way that is more open to critical or creative interpretative activities? One of the main benefits of identifying the constraints on a disruptive potential of networked photographies in relation to otherwise well-established place-based visibilities, is to identify the points at which an artistic or activist engagement might help to make such constraints visible as such or otherwise exploit them. I turn now to some reflections on the analysis pursued here, its broader socio-political implications, and some concrete suggestions for future intervention.DISCUSSION: TACTICS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COLLECTIVE AND UNDISCIPLINED LANDSCAPE CRITICISMMy aim in the preceding analysis has been to identify an unintended and politically generative excess within the communicative economy of the glance attributed to stock and networked photographies. There is however, a tension between this strategy and the critical ends towards which it aims, which is hinted at in the fact that landscapes designed for natural surveillance are similarly designed around the glance: the extent of surveillance must be immediately felt as opposed to consciously assessed in order to be effective in regulating behaviour and naturalizing exclusion. A strategic exploitation of the unthinking production of landscape photographs must therefore take into account their relation to regimes of surveillance.It is worth emphasizing in this context that, just as the unimpeded sightlines of Grand Park facilitate both photographs of spectacular views and more effective policing by security guards and security cameras, the use of Instagram enables data-based surveillance of users' interests, social networks and movement patterns.58 In both cases, it is precisely the unintended production of meaning--whether in the form of observable movements across the landscape, or the various types of data associated with Instagram use--that facilitates surveillance. Any attempt to excavate a critical potential from the same content must therefore take care to develop alternative venues or trajectories for its use. We need ways of seeing that are critical, rather than simply comprehensive (as is the aim of surveillance), or diverse (which in an age of "big data," is infinitely exploitable for the purposes of marketing). Instagram's frictional potential lies less in the volume and diversity of content produced through its use, and more in the new contexts and practices of communication that it has inaugurated, and which remain susceptible to extension and repurposing.Thus, for example, even though it was not explicitly intended as such, the act of reposting photographs of pink chairs to a dedicated account, was a communicative act with (modest) critical potential: by notifying the owners of the photographs, the novel association the account itself established was communicated to those users-- many of whom responded by following the account.59 This relatively straightforward and modest intervention is suggestive of the potential for developing a citizen (social) science of public spaces: for example, just as research in the field of urban informatics has developed applications that exploit the sensing capacities of smart phones for citizen-initiated environmental monitoring, the capacity to curate, recontextualize and communicate about place via social media platforms, suggests there is potential to develop a popular criticism or analysis of urban landscapes.In this context, Instagram's public API makes the development of third party applications a promising avenue for socio-political interventions that may help to create new venues and practices for interpretation and communication, and perhaps, eventually, new communities of users. There are many third party applications that currently enable searches of Instagram data. However these are designed to further the commercial use of the location and social data associated with photographs and present very limited possibilities for searches by individuals interested in the photographs themselves. The creation of a third party application to enable more complex searches (e.g. returning photographs from a given location with a particular hashtag, or particular keywords) could provide the content, and a venue for, collective consideration of political questions about the appearance, composition and use of public spaces, in a manner that is accessible in the course of everyday activities.60 A more explicitly critical design intervention that would afford interesting possibilities along similar lines, would be to create a search tool returning photographs of a given place that have been given hashtags corresponding to a very small number of photographs, or a small number of users (who post many photographs to that hashtag). This would be a way of identifying photographs of a place that have been contextualized by their users in idiosyncratic--perhaps personalized, perhaps politicized--ways.The question that such tactics attempt to address, is of how to make a surplus of meaning long associated with photography,61 work towards ends other than those of a comprehensive survey or endless variation on the same themes; to inaugurate not only new uses of the content produced via photographic social media, but through its repurposing, new ways of seeing together. In fact, this suggests we need to think in terms not of a surplus (of information or possible meanings), but rather a problematic remainder capable of inspiring questioning and critique. The fact that what we see is always conditioned in part by what we don't see has both a perceptual and a socio-political significance here: what, or who, is absent in order to render particular qualities, experiences and beings present? Looking at landscape photographs, it is very hard to say what is not there without first-hand knowledge of that landscape (or better yet, what preceded it). However, this is one thing that Instagram and other photographic social media offer, provided we have the means of searching, collecting and comparing their content in a useful manner. With strategically enabled searches, it would be possible to identify what is not being pictured, and also possible to ask why, in a public setting. Then a more artistic experimentation can begin: with the amplification of such absences, and strategies for turning them into political problems worthy of notice and discussion.CONCLUSIONSIn the preceding analysis, I have explored a contextually and materially oriented mode of photographic interpretation. This is a mode of interpretation that attempts to correspond--in a more deliberate, open-ended way--with the kind of unthinking attention that Instagram solicits and rewards in its users. Although the structure of the analysis has been tailored to investigation of the social and material conditions relevant to the site under consideration, I believe that the materialist media-ecological framework providing its overarching strategies and objectives is one with more general applicability. The observations made above with respect to the inadequacy of conventional models of representation and communication in relation to networked photographies, and the recasting of their effects in terms of an ongoing process of re-mediation, are similar to those that have been made about other visual media forms and practices.62 A broader orientation to media effects and relations is conducive to studying processes of mediation, rather than discrete visual technologies or forms. It also enables the investigation of the place-based, and place-making effects of visual media, and consideration of otherwise covert mediating effects of environments.Especially in cities, an awareness of the increasingly reciprocal shaping of communication and environment is crucial to the cultivation of democratic public life. My focus on unexpected disruptions of the reciprocity between social media photographs and designed landscape, and my attempt to outline some tactical possibilities for alternative engagements with them, highlights the critical pedagogical potential of the concretely experimental approach advocated by materialist media ecologists such as Fuller and Parikka. By experimentally working with Instagram to make it do more than it otherwise wants to, I have made some observations that not only contribute to a scholarly understanding of the intermedial shaping of urban visibilities, but which also, through the proposed interventions, may enable users to learn about the otherwise hidden cultural and perceptual effects of photographic social media and landscape alike. I hope that this can help us to more concretely envision a future in which the design of urban public spaces cannot be quite so cheerfully exclusive and discouraging of political activity.AcknowledgementsThis paper benefited from conversations with Chloe Reynolds, comments from Paul Frosh, and constructive feedback provided by reviewers and participants in the Nordic Network for Digital Visuality's "Visual Frictions" workshop.

The memorial service for Nelson Mandela on Tuesday, 10 December 2013, gathered dignitaries and celebrities from around the world at the First National Bank Stadium in Johannesburg, to mourn the passing of Madiba and to celebrate his life work. At the Grand Parade in Cape Town, the event was broadcast on large public screens, followed by live music performances and narrowcast interaction with the audience. Building on recent research on public screens during global media events, this article addresses the mediated mourning rituals at the Grand Parade in terms of a sacred drama. Focusing on social relationality, the article discusses how digital visuality mediated a sense of global communitas, thus momentarily overcoming historical frictions between the global north and the global south, while expanding the fame of Madiba. Paying attention to the public display of visual memory objects and the emotional agency of images, it argues that digital visuality mediated social frictions between the living and the dead, while recasting a historical subject as a historical object. The article further discusses how digital visuality mediated cultural frictions of apartheid and xenophobia, through the positioning of Mandela in the pantheon of Pan-African icons, thus underlining the African origin of this global icon. The analysis is based on ethnographic observations and experiences in Cape Town.28178_UF0001.jpgPaula Uimonen specializes in digital anthropology and anthropology of art, media, and globalization. Her research on digital media and intercultural interaction at an arts college in Tanzania was published in the monograph Digital Drama (Uimonen 2012), with accompanying web site at www.innovativeethnographies.net/digitaldrama. Paula has also done research on a music campaign against corruption in Tanzania, presented in an ethnographic movie Chanjo ya Rushwa (2013) online at www.vimeo.com/paulauimonen. Her most recent publications focus on visual identity in Facebook (2013), mobile photography in Tanzania (in press) and mobile infrastructure in Africa (2015). Paula is currently conducting research on African women writers as well as Pan-African icons.Keywords: Madiba; South Africa; digital visuality; sacred drama; virtual immortality; public screens; ritual; media; friction; co-presenceCitation: Journal of Aesthetics & Culture, Vol. 7, 2015 http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/jac.v7.28178Copyright: ©2015 P.

More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netLike a tsunami, the death of Nelson Mandela on 5 December 2013 sent waves throughout the global mediascape, culminating in the funeral in Qunu on Sunday, 15 December. Further to the public announcement of his passing, news agencies around the world broadcast the breaking news, which also spread rapidly through social and mobile media. As the government of South Africa declared a 10-day national mourning period, media coverage gained momentum, while commemorative rituals were organized around the world. In Cape Town, images of Mandela appeared all over town, along with textual tributes, often citing his words. Commemorative sites were erected in churches and public places, while hotels, shops, and even ATM machines displayed images of Madiba. In Facebook, individuals changed their portrait photos to photographs of Mandela, while sharing images with citations of his writings and speeches. Through various forms of digital visuality, people and places around the world were thus connected in mourning Mandela, while celebrating his life.This article discusses the mourning rituals for Mandela at the Grand Parade in Cape Town on 10 December 2013 in terms of a "sacred drama" (Figure 1).1 During this event, the official memorial service in Johannesburg was broadcast on large public screens, followed by live music and narrowcast interaction with the audience. The centre stage for this cultural performance was a fenced passage in front of the City Hall where people placed photographs and other memory objects in tribute to Mandela in what constituted a "social aesthetic frame."2 Such visual displays have become quite commonplace, turning public places into commemorative social spaces to mark the death of specific individuals, often celebrities, an early example of which was tributes to Princess Diana.3 Through digital media, the commemoration of celebrities takes on global dimensions, as exemplified by the multilayered media environments through which the death of Michael Jackson was recognized around the world.4 Building on earlier research on public screens by media scholars,5 this article discusses the digital visuality of mourning rituals for Mandela using anthropological theory on globalization, media, ritual, and fame.6 In using the term digital visuality, I refer to a wide range of cultural forms and practices in which digital and visual media converge, from digital public screens and visual memory objects to mediated co-presence and virtual immortality. From an anthropological perspective, digital visuality offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal mediations of human relatedness in an age of interactive global media. The overriding question that this article seeks to address is: How does digital visuality mediate historical, social, and cultural frictions in an interconnected world?7 The analysis is based on ethnographic observations and experiences in Cape Town.8Fig 1Figure 1.  Public screens at the Grand Parade.MEDIATED CO-PRESENCE AT THE GRAND PARADEOn Tuesday, 10 December, an impressive number of dignitaries gathered in Johannesburg to attend the memorial service for Nelson Mandela at the First National Bank (FNB) Stadium. This stadium, bordering Soweto, is the largest one in Africa and it was the venue for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final. For the memorial service, residents of Johannesburg lined up outside the stadium already the evening before and many more flocked to the stadium on the day itself. An estimated 80,000 people and over 80 heads of state and 30 former heads of state, leaders of 6 international organizations, royalty from 9 countries, and almost a dozen world celebrities attended the service, making it one of the largest gatherings of world leaders. The memorial service was broadcast and webcast by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), along with regional and international media. In addition to Mandela's status as a global icon, international media presence was undoubtedly facilitated by the fact that many foreign correspondents cover Africa from South Africa.9 It rained throughout the memorial service, which in Africa is considered a blessing.In Cape Town, the Grand Parade served as a venue for public screening of the memorial service in Johannesburg, broadcast in real time on large public screens. The public screening was one of many mourning rituals organized by the City of Cape Town in different parts of town to enable citizens to pay their tributes. The site itself was culturally and historically significant. The Grand Parade is the main public square in Cape Town and the site for the City Hall. It has been a venue for political rallies and this is where the 2010 World Cup FIFA Fan Fest was held.10 This is also where Nelson Mandela gave his first speech following his release after 27 years in prison, as recounted in his Long Walk to Freedom.11 The city's connection to Mandela was visually inscribed in large banners decorating the City Hall, depicting Mandela's portrait and the words "Cape Town honours Nelson Mandela 2013" and "Cape Town 11 February 1990. First speech by Nelson Mandela as a free man" (Figure 2).Fig 2Figure 2.  City Hall with banners honouring Mandela.The memorial service for Mandela attracted a few hundred people to the Grand Parade, the audience growing as the hot sun descended and the working day came to an end. Most people followed the memorial service on the two large screens outside the City Hall, one on each side of the building. Two additional screens located further away in the square were only attended by a handful of people. The public screens were large flat panel displays, with powerful sound systems. You could easily watch the screens and hear the sound from a distance of 10-20 m. Yet people congregated near the screens, thus forming a more intimate collective of mourners.As people gathered near the screens at the City Hall, the live broadcast mediated a sense of "co-presence," of taking part in an event that was taking place elsewhere. Enveloped by a solemn and dignified atmosphere, people intently watched the screens, while the soundscape was filled with tributes and music from the memorial service. Through the televised broadcast, people could participate in the service in Johannesburg at a distance, thus sharing the moment with others. As research during the FIFA World Cup in 2010 has demonstrated, live broadcasts on public screens create a sense of "being there from afar."12 Mediated co-presence is augmented by the cultural meaning of the event, in this case linking people from near and afar in a ritual of collective mourning. People were attracted to the screen site at the Grand Parade to share the moment with other people, thus underlining the "capacity of the screen to serve as the site for collective enactment of public rituals, including celebration and mourning."13DIGITAL VISUALITY AND GLOBAL COMMUNITASBy connecting mourners around the world, the public broadcast of the memorial service constituted a "cultural performance," a highly ritualized event with a pronounced degree of reflexivity serving as a commentary and celebration of "human relatedness."14 In this particular case, social connections spanned a vast variety of social constellations, from immediate family to world political leaders, with a long history dating back to the fight for independence from colonial rule and the long struggle against apartheid. Similarly, the social relations spanned the world, from Castro in Cuba to Obama in the United States, thus connecting the global north and the global south in intricate social networks. During the memorial service, the programme director read out names of the many countries that were present, while the use of idioms such as "father of the nation," "son of Africa," and "son of the world" underlined the cosmopolitan character of this commemorative event for Mandela.At the Grand Parade, people from all walks of life shared the moment with participants in Johannesburg and beyond, thus forming a global web of social relations. The audience was very mixed, from young men in cool hip hop style to middle-aged men and women in casual or professional attire, from students and political activists to homeless people in rag tags. Black and white people stood next to one another, along with people of different cultural origin, residents sharing the space with guest workers and tourists. This social and cultural diversity was in itself a tribute to Mandela's life work, a post-apartheid nation in an interconnected world. It could also be interpreted as somewhat evocative of the cosmopolitan aesthetic and creolized diversity of legendary South African township Sophiatown, which has inspired anthropological theorizing on the global ecumene.15The televised memorial service illustrated how digital visuality can mediate spatiotemporal constellations that multiply space and conflate time. Public screenings offer mediated forms of "spatial pluralisation," allowing for an event to "take place" in different places at the same time, as participants in one place are "symbolically connected" to others in other locations.16 As people are connected in real time, these screenings also mediate temporal convergence. Public live broadcasts thus bring a new dimension to "TV time" in the "making and expressing history in ex-colonies."17 On this occasion, TV time did not only assure the "coevalness between the periphery and the metropole,"18 but it illuminated the breaking through of the colonialist and imperialist "denial of coevalness."19 For a brief moment in time, South Africa was the centre of world attention, along with its historical connectedness to freedom struggles around the world. The social and political significance of these "transnational connections" was perhaps most visibly manifested in the presence of President Obama, the first black president of the United States paying his tributes to the first black president of South Africa.20In this context, digital visuality mediated a sense of global communitas, linking people around the world in a temporary web of human relatedness. By seeing each other on and off the screen, people could visualize a shared, collective experience. What makes the term communitas suitable in this context is that Turner insisted on the non-territorial nature of community and the existential quality of communitas.21 Returning to the memorial service for Mandela, it can be argued that a global communitas was formed as the world united in the mourning of a global icon. And it was through digital visuality that this "interconnectedness of the world" was achieved, as it was by seeing each other on digital screens that "the entire inhabited world" or "global ecumene" could be envisioned.22The notion of global communitas is useful for understanding how digital visuality can overcome historical frictions. Turner discusses how communitas break through in the interstices of structure (liminality), at the edges of structure (marginality) and from beneath structure (inferiority).23 The rigid statuses of structure are thus dialectically and asymmetrically related to the concrete and idiosyncratic relations of communitas. But there are times, especially during ritual events, when the social order is turned upside down, when "spontaneous communitas" are formed, sharing a sense of communion,24 and when the "underling becomes the uppermost," thus revealing the "powers of the weak."25When the world united to mourn Mandela, global structures of inequality and injustice were momentarily overcome, and the powers of the weak were revealed in a global communitas centring on "peripheral" South Africa. A global icon once classified as a terrorist by global power was now recast as a moral leader, a symbol of humanity. This was a ritual turnover where the marginality and inferiority of the global south momentarily could break through historical narratives dominated by the global north, a rupture mediated through the digital visuality of images of a global icon and mourners from around the world, coming together to reflect and remember a history of freedom struggle.SACRED DRAMA AND THE FAME OF MADIBADuring the mediated memorial service, the Grand Parade was transformed into a ritualized place of public liminality, serving as a stage for a "sacred drama."26 While many rituals, for example initiation rites, involve a liminal phase of seclusion, often in hidden or far-off places, there are also more public rituals, often marking a whole groups' passage, which have their liminality in public places, like village greens or city squares. When ritual events are staged, these public places are "ritually transformed" for a "privileged period of time."27 On this occasion, the Grand Parade remained an open public space, where people could come and go freely. But the space was also ritually bordered, especially through the fenced area in front of the City Hall, which was transformed into a social aesthetic frame, a sensory structure that through the placement of visual memory objects served as a reflection on broader social processes.28Through the performance of a sacred drama, with its narratives of heroic deeds, morality and transcendent beings, society's deepest values emerged.29 Mandela's immediate family as well as world political leaders made eloquent tributes, weaving Mandela's life into the fabric of world history. While the cultural practice of praise is a common feature of mourning rituals in Africa, in this case extraordinary epithets were pronounced by eminent world leaders. If anything, the praise for Nelson Mandela expressed by dignitaries at the memorial service confirmed his iconic status. Through these tributes, society's deepest values were articulated, emphasizing core values like freedom, justice, humility, tolerance, reconciliation, forgiveness, and humanity.Through this sacred drama, the fame of Mandela was expanded in time and space, as the world got to know his clan name Madiba, an honorary title carrying the cultural attributes of moral leadership. Munn discusses value transformation in terms of the expansion of "intersubjective spacetime," a social process in which a person's fame travels across time and space.30 Through the global spread of the name Madiba, Mandela's self was spatiotemporally expanded, linking his ancestral past to the present and future, while connecting South Africa with the world at large. As his name travelled around the world, Madiba's "virtual influence" was extended to distant others.31Digital visuality mediated the expansion of Madiba's fame in significant ways, especially through the global circulation of images of his face and words. Munn notes the importance of "witnessing" in the value creation of fame, since knowledge of a person by distant others is critical to the spatiotemporal expansion of moral influence.32 Although she focuses on how fame is expanded through discourse, as people talk about a name, through global digital media visual manifestations of fame are becoming increasingly significant. A comparable example is the role of photographs of Diana's face in the iconicity following her death.33 Since Mandela was a global icon prior to his death, his face was already familiar to people around the world. Through digital media, Mandela's own words were embedded in images of his face, thus combining different forms of visual expression. People around the world could thus "witness" Madiba's moral deeds, which expanded his moral influence, while affording him a state of virtual immortality.Liminality is an ambiguous condition, which became evident in audiences' responses to the speech by the South African President Jacob Zuma. While most tributes were accompanied by loud cheers from the audience, President Zuma's closing address met a more mixed response with boohs and jeers. Even at the Grand Parade, the response was mixed, some people clapping their hands, others booing and turning their thumbs downward as a sign of disapproval. This expression of popular discontent can be understood in relation to the social and political significance of deep values in a sacred drama. On the one hand, we find "cosmonogic narratives" of heroism, morality, and transcendence.34 But we may also find sceptical judgements of people and public policies in relation to these deep values: "the vices, follies, stupidities, and abuses of contemporary holders of high political, economic, or religious status may be satirized, ridiculed, or contemned in terms of axiomatic values."35The performance of the sacred drama was accentuated by visual displays decorating the symbolic border of the social aesthetic frame (Figure 3). People laid down flowers, images of Mandela, photos of themselves, and texts of love, gratitude, respect, and admiration, often citing Mandela's own words. This colourful display grew in volume as the hours passed, people constantly passing through to pay their tribute. At the end of the passage, people could sign books of condolence or submit electronic versions on computers made available. People often took pictures of the objects they had placed against the fence, along with commemorative objects placed by others as well as pictures of themselves, typically taken by others rather than selfies.Fig 3Figure 3.  Social aesthetic frame with visual memory objects.Within the social aesthetic frame, digital visuality mediated social frictions between the living and the dead, as social relations were reaffirmed through visual memory objects that immortalized the deceased. Although anticipated for years, the death of Mandela caused a rupture in the social fabric, cutting him loose from the world of the living. But the web of social relations in which his life was embedded remained alive, materialized in the placement of visual memory objects that connected the living with the dead. Through digital visuality, people could express their relatedness to Mandela, while acknowledging his life achievements, often combining photographs and texts in personalized tributes. Through these mediated commemorative practices, the characteristics of photography as a medium that keeps alive contacts between the living and the dead was reaffirmed.36 Similarly, through digital visuality, the ability of photography to "resurrect the deceased" by giving them "visual immortality" was asserted.37 As his face was reproduced and rematerialized through photographs, along with visual manifestations of his words and deeds, Mandela was kept alive. By crafting and displaying his words and images, the living could engage in interaction with the dead, while retaining his mediated co-presence among people whole lives he had touched.MEDIATED MUSIC AND NARROWCAST INTERACTIONAfter the live broadcast, a commemorative event was organized in the Grand Parade, with live music performances by local artists and mediated interaction with the audience, all of which was narrowcast on the public screens and facilitated by a media professional (Figure 4). As the sound of live music spread well beyond the public square, a growing number of people flocked to the Grand Parade, while many who had attended the broadcast memorial service remained. The audience retained its mobility, some people staying for a few minutes, others remaining for hours.Fig 4Figure 4.  Live music on screen.Local musicians performed popular songs in several languages, including English, Afrikaans, and Zulu. Songs by international artists were mixed with songs by famous South African musicians, including the popular songs Pata Pata by Miriam Makeba and Black President by Brenda Fassie. Many of the songs carried political messages, related to the freedom struggle and some of them had been specifically composed for Mandela. The songs were well known to the audiences and many people sang along, while also dancing, some waving their arms or flags. Each group of artists was only given time for a few songs, but all of them concluded with songs about Mandela, thus using the occasion to pay their personal tributes through music (Figure 5).Fig 5Figure 5.  Popular jazz musician paying tribute.After a while, the programme turned more interactive, with active engagement with the audience. The facilitator encouraged people to share their thoughts and feelings about Madiba. Some people became quite enthusiastic and volunteered, even demanded, to speak up in front of the camera; others were shyer. Since the audience was very mixed, with people of all colour and from different social backgrounds, the facilitator tried to get as many different people as possible to participate, making a special effort to involve women (Figure 6).Fig 6Figure 6.  Narrowcast personal tributes to Madiba.The interaction with the audience was narrowcast on the public screens, thus creating a mediated form of co-presence in real time and space. Not only were the audiences physically present, but they could also see themselves on the large public screens, which strengthened their "emotional engagement," while adding a "self-reflexive layer that 'thickens' the mediated experience of an event."38 This visual mediation exemplified how public screenings of television broadcasts are combined with interactive activities, the screen site functioning as a collective site for participatory media culture.39During the cultural programme, participants created their own visual media memories, digital visuality thus expanding the time and space of mediated co-presence. In most cases, people used their mobile phones to take photographs and videos of the music performances and interaction, often raising their arms to get a better angle for their shots, thus reaching above the crowd around them. Similar to what was observed in the FIFA Fan Parks, many took pictures of the screens as well as what was going on around them.40 These digital recordings served as a form of visual memory making, allowing for later viewings, in other places, with other people. But digital and mobile photography also enabled people to instantly share their images with others, by uploading their photos and video clips online. Through digital visuality, mediated co-presence could thus be spatiotemporally expanded across time (present, past, and future) as well as space (here, there, and elsewhere).EMOTIONAL AGENCY AND IMAGINARY PRESENCEThe commemorative cultural programme had a more festive atmosphere, with an undertone of sadness, combining feelings of grief, joy, and love. These feelings were the dominant emotions of the mourning period, a cultural melange of mourning and celebration. It is of course impossible to know what emotions people held within themselves, but collectively expressed feelings oscillated between sadness and grief as well as happiness and joy, underlined by powerful expressions of love.Emotions play an important role in all performances, especially rituals, since they have a unique ability to affect the cognitive as well as emotional state of the audience.41 Performances often contain "double emotional involvement," starting with the emotions that encourage people to engage in a performance, followed by the arousal of emotion during the course of the performance.42 This double emotional involvement was clearly at play in the mourning rituals at the Grand Parade. People were attracted to the place because it was linked to the memorial service in Johannesburg. The mourning ritual was in turn an emotionally charged cultural performance, which afforded participants a collective experience of emotional arousal.I had myself been drawn to the Grand Parade for emotional reasons, to share this moment of grief and joy with other people. As I listened to speeches, songs, and tributes, I reflected on the ways in which my own life had intersected with the life of Mandela, especially his struggle against apartheid, which had been my political awakening as a teenager in Sweden in the early 1980s. I was also recalling the televised broadcast of Mandela's inauguration as President in 1994, which I had watched during fieldwork in Cambodia, a beacon of hope amidst the human tragedy I was documenting. And here I was, feeling privileged to be part of the public outpouring of gratitude, admiration, and respect, a historical moment shared by millions around the world. As I immersed myself in the emotionally charged atmosphere at the Grand Parade, I recalled the words of the old grandmother I had encountered in a township a few days earlier: "We cry for Madiba. He was like Moses."At the Grand Parade, participants' emotional state was augmented through the embodied experience of being in a sacred place, which could be perceived with all the senses. The heat of the sun and the breeze of the wind added to the tactile experience of sharing the space with other people. Participants were also engaged though their aural senses, through the sound of music, speeches, and tributes as well as announcements by the facilitator. Sounds from the nearby traffic seeped into the square, accentuating its urban location, while setting it aside from the city soundscape. Visual expressions were ubiquitous, the surrounding visual landscape containing significant landmarks of Cape Town.During the narrowcast interaction, people made strong statements, often expressing their feelings for Mandela (respect, admiration, gratitude) in a highly personal manner, many times addressing Madiba directly, loudly declaring their love for him. This personalized form of tribute accentuated the ritualized performance of social relations, combining collective and individual expressions of emotion with a heightened sense of human relatedness, which included the deceased.The imaginary presence of Madiba acted as an emotional agent, with a moral imperative (Figure 7).43 Svasek has discussed the "emotional agency" of material objects, more specifically human body parts and remains, arguing that such objects are often perceived as subject-like forces, which are experienced through the senses, and tend to express and evoke strong emotions.44 In the case of Mandela, visual images, more specifically photographs, played a similar role, carrying a high degree of social agency. The photographs were not only representations of Mandela, but they allowed for his "resurrection," thus exemplifying the "uncanny" ability of photography to mediate between the living and the dead.45 Photographs of Mandela mediated a sense of visual presence, while conveying the transcendental qualities of a historical subject who was now transformed into a historical object.Fig 7Figure 7.  Emotional agency and visual presence of Madiba.PAN-AFRICAN WORLD HISTORY IN THE MAKINGThrough digital visuality, Mandela was also inscribed as a Pan-African icon, thus mediating cultural frictions of apartheid and xenophobia (Figures 8 and 9). As noted during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, "deliberate attempts were made to blend pan-Africanism with South African nationalism," thus emphasizing the "African-ness" of the World Cup.46 Similarly, during the mourning rituals for Mandela, Pan-Africanism was visually prominent, temporarily glossing over conflicts of xenophobia, while placing the anti-apartheid struggle in a wider African context. Digital visuality mediated the positioning of Mandela in the pantheon of Pan-African icons, connecting him with his less visible predecessors. It has been noted that "the face of Nelson Mandela is instantly recognisable around the globe," while that of Kwame Nkrumah, referred to as "the Nelson Mandela of the 1950s and 1960s," is less known.47 In casting Mandela as a Pan-African icon, his place in postcolonial history was linked to earlier Pan-African icons who struggled for the total liberation and unity of Africa.48 The Pan-African dimension of Mandela's legacy was pronounced in the last phase of the mourning ritual. During the funeral service in Qunu, only African leaders were called upon to make tributes, which firmly embedded Mandela in the history of Pan-African freedom struggle.Fig 8Figure 8.  Tribute by African freedom fighters.Fig 9Figure 9.  Pan-African unity.In the iconic inscription of Mandela as "son of Africa" and "son of the world," the fame of Madiba signified the spatiotemporal expansion of Pan-Africanism, thus valorising an African version of cosmopolitanism. With its struggle for Africa's rightful place in the world, Pan-Africanism rests on notions of "African humanity," the pre-colonial underpinnings of which shape the dialectic of "Afromodernity" and "Euromodernity."49 It could be argued that with its ethos of equality and justice in world society, Pan-Africanism redefines western ideals of enlightenment, while challenging the continued racialism of the modern world order. In writing the history of Mandela, this untold story of the subaltern other was firmly inscribed through words and images, thus visualizing what is often made invisible in historical narratives, while giving a deeper meaning to Madiba's moral fame as a global icon of African origin.CONCLUDING REMARKS[T]he meaning of a man's life, and of each moment in it, becomes manifest to others only when his life is ended.50As discussed throughout this article, it was through digital visuality that the fame of Madiba could travel around the world, linking the past with the present and the future (Figure 10). For a brief moment in time, visual images of a global icon could gloss over historical frictions, creating a sense of global communitas. Through visual memory objects, social frictions between the living and the dead could be mediated, reaffirming social relations while immortalizing the deceased. And by positioning Mandela in the pantheon of Pan-African icons, cultural frictions of xenophobia could momentarily be glossed over, while placing the anti-apartheid struggle in an African context. As digital images carrying the name, face, and words of Madiba continue to travel, they are expanding his fame into the future. In social media, Mandela "lives on" in a state of virtual immortality, his moral influence mediated through online forms of digital visuality that connect millions of followers around the world in webs of human relatedness.51I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter. I have made mistakes along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.52, p. 751Fig 10Figure 10.

Instead, we argue that selfies should be understood as a wider social, cultural, and media phenomenon that understands the selfie as far more than a representational image. This, in turn, necessarily redirects us away from the object "itself," and in so doing seeks to understand selfies as a socio-technical phenomenon that momentarily and tentatively holds together a number of different elements of mediated digital communication.28073_UF0001.jpgEdgar Gómez Cruz is a Research Fellow at RMIT, Melbourne.

Email: h.thornham@leeds.ac.ukThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netThe "selfie" phenomenon is trending across a number of academic disciplines and current research agendas. Even the Oxford Dictionary declared that "Selfie" was the word of the year in 2013, suggesting that it has also become a common reference and practice in popular media.1 The selfie has been understood in relation to rapid "documenting" of the self2 as a "socio-cultural revolution" about "identity affirmation"3 a "condition" of social media,4 a political convergence of the object and subject of photographic practice,5,6 and as a neoliberal, even narcissistic but increasingly normative mode of "self-branding."7 Set within this corpus of work, two issues become clear. First that selfies are widespread, contextually specific and nuanced--so that to speak of selfies as homogenous is increasingly disingenuous. Second, selfies resonate wider socio-cultural, political, and visual practices and how we approach them has political, ideological, and cultural significance.Alongside this corpus, there are also identifiable trends in recent work on selfies, which we would like to elucidate. The first positions them within a long tradition of visual culture where the images are read as representations to be interpreted. Seen here, selfies seem to evidence "visual probes" of "depicted realities" (see, for example, Manovich's project selfiecity8), and they are claimed as evidence of an intentional author (a political convergence of object and subject, for example, or a "documenting of the self") or seen as an objective window into cultures and communities, values, and ideologies (a neoliberal, narcissistic identity affirmation). We find this problematic, not least because it bleeds into a discourse of individualism but also because it centres and elevates both the visual image "itself" and the methods for analysing the image, which we argue undermines--if not negates--the wider practices, discourses, and ideologies that constitute the selfie phenomenon. Perhaps more importantly, this approach does not represent our experience of the selfie within our fieldwork, where it is the practices and contexts of selfies that are articulated (rather than the image "itself").A second issue with the accounts above is that they seem to exclusively frame selfies within a long-standing study of online self-representation, storytelling, and impression management.9 This, in turn, approaches selfies as a mostly positive force practiced by a fixed (gendered, expert, and reflexive) subject who uses selfies as a calculated resource for self-representation. We have a number of issues to note here. The first relates to the way that individualistic discourses of the digital technology user are re-evoked here,10 so that the underpinning and normative constructions of the user as the powerful force remain unproblematised. As the long history of feminist new media theory and STS reminds us, the user engages in a socio-technical mediation in which she or he is positioned as well as positioning. The second issue, and a consequence of this, is a flattening out of the practices of the selfie "itself," whereby the selfie becomes positioned as a communication method that is itself caught up in positive technologically deterministic rhetoric. Seen here the selfie is not simply a new communication tool; the selfie is posited as a better communication tool--faster, more representative, more immediate (for example), and thus, the rhetoric here feeds directly into the fetish of new technology as always positively novel.11 We would also note here that evenwhen selfies are framed as a narcissistic practice,12 the examples that are cited usually result in a kind of micro-celebrity status for the user that is itself (of course) caught up in a more positive discourse of individualism because of the complex overlap between narcissism and a more positive, agential form of self-branding or celebrity.13 Our argument here is that these approaches need to be unpacked if we are to disrupt (rather than repeat) problematic assumptions and approaches to wider digital culture. They approach the selfie as a communication "tool" for an intentional and agential author and in so doing undervalue or negate the selfie as a socio-technical phenomenon, which nuances the relationship between the user and technology.Finally, there is an increasing corpus of work that understands the selfie as a visual signifier of the self (as another form of self-representation). This understands the content of the selfie in relation to representational significance--reading into the visual image so that the object--despite being located as an effect of a practice--is made meaningful as a stand-alone representational signifier. Underpinning this approach to the selfie is specific history of photography, particularly in relation to the pictorial portrait, self-portraits, and art photography that is evoked in order to read aesthetically into the selfie and draw conclusions based on content. As Paul Frosh details,14 this approach, although insightful, it does not go far enough in understanding the wider socio-technological practice of the selfie. Indeed, such accounts position the selfie as a continuation of the pictorial portrait, self-portraits, and art photography15 and assume that many of the characteristics of self-portraits16 (namely the reflexive subject producer of an image) are also present in selfies. Against this, we have previously argued17 that understanding the role of photography in the digital age requires us to think about photographic practices instead.18 This means that the photographic image becomes one of several elements of the photographic process (sometimes not even the most important, for example when postprocessing changes the original image or when the image forms a context in itself like in memes). In the digital age, image making is but one element of several connective processes, inclusive of the power dynamics, design of, and normative practices of social networks. Seen here, photography through mobile phones is especially relevant because of its ubiquity, mobility, and seamless integration with social networks.19Our intention in detailing these approaches to the selfie is twofold. Firstly, to note the growing corpus of research on this phenomenon--that is both rich and sustained. Secondly, to set up our main argument: that there are alternative ways to understand the selfie and that the process of doing this reveals a number of frictions. The central friction is the continued use of traditional semiotics in analysing the image of the selfie--which many of the approaches above repeat rather than problematise. For us, this elevates not only the selfie as an image, but also the object-oriented approach of much visual culture that seeks to construct and then understand practices in relation to artefacts--reading intentionality into them. For the selfie, such an approach elevates the image over the practice, and continues to prioritise the visual and aesthetic over (and this is our contention) the power relations in which the image is situated. At the same time, it is the multitude of selfie practices that is what marks them as a phenomenon, as nuanced, as complex, and it is this that we need to underscore in critical work on the selfie. Elevating the visual within visual culture through visual methods perpetuates rather than problematises the visual as powerful: and in digital culture, our contention is that perhaps the visual might actually be a smokescreen for, or one element within, other far more pervasive power relations. Offering a non-medium centric approach to the selfie, however, is not without its own frictions: the object of the selfie, the image, is not "in" this paper because in arguing that this is problematic, we found it untenable to then repeat it methodologically.ALTERNATIVE GENEALOGIES OF/FOR THE SELFIEDurable selfieAt a moment when the term "selfie" is increasingly becoming mobilised in ways that are constructing it as normative shorthand for photography per se (especially when used to describe photos taken by primates,20 robots21, or drones22), it seems important to take stock of the underlying presumptions and claims around the selfie. Our starting point, in keeping with Paul Frosh,23 is that selfies should be understood as a wider social, cultural, and media phenomenon that positions the selfie as much more than a representational image. Approaching the selfie as a phenomenon rather than an artefact locates the practice within alternative genealogies, which we would like to elucidate here. This, in turn, necessarily redirects us away from the object "itself" and instead understands selfies as a socio-technical phenomenon that momentarily and tentatively holds together a number of different elements of mediated digital communication. The second consequence of this is to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of the selfie--which is temporary, contextually specific, changeable, situated, as well as durable and stable.We are not negating the connections noted above between pictorial and representational forms and digital images; we are setting alongside this narrative some alternative and equally persuasive ones. Our alternative genealogies are not intended to replace one problematic correlation with another, but to add to and nuance the approaches to the selfie detailed above. Our genealogy is perhaps as synthetic and simplistic as our critique of existing literature, but it is a tool to underpin our later and more substantive argument. We propose that there is a close relationship between specific technical affordances and the stabilisation24 of certain practices that allow the development of new technologies in a "complex continuum." This complex continuum serves as a basis for our first alternative genealogy.Selfies as chatsOur departing point is to locate selfies not within a history of photographic practice, but one of mediated communication. Crudely: What if we think about selfies as a "visual chat"? Indeed, the app Snapchat, one of the most important platforms for digital image exchange, seems to be exactly premised on this idea. If we consider the genealogy of chats (in any form, such as BBS, IRC, forums, Newsgroups, etc.) in relation to the selfie, we pull out dominant features--if not ideologies--of mediated communication that prompt (in a mediated and rhizomatic way) development and vice versa. What is interesting about this history is that the visual elements--that are so centrally claimed and positioned within contemporary approaches to the selfie--are repositioned here as something that is arrived at, that emerges through--but is not necessarily determining of, chat culture. Our simple point is that this alternative genealogy shifts some of the presumptive claims around selfies, and consequently how we are able to then frame and approach them as a phenomenon.Chats--as a field, as a cultural object, and as a device--were one of the central elements of computer-mediated communication, and formed the basis for the further development of internet studies as an academic discipline.25 Mediated communication was extracted as a focus of studies within the discipline of Internet studies, where communicative practices of a growing Internet culture were becoming stabilised in everyday life.26 Indeed, these studies argued that what was significant about chats was their ability to textually communicate, in an anonymous and (a)synchronous way regardless of (or despite) geographic distance through, what was, a technological precursor to the www. Perhaps more important in thinking about an alternative genealogy of the selfie, however, is the SMS.27 SMS integrated several practices already present in chats and emails, including emoticons. Emoticons, in turn, can be understood as a form of visual and emotional cue pertaining to the user, thus offering a context for/of the text "itself."28 While limited in their extension (generating therefore further language economies), SMS nevertheless added a new element in mediated communication because of one of the main features of cellular phones: mobility. By extending previously mediated communicative practices to a new device, the later inclusion of internet connections in mobile phones completed a series of stabilisations in digital communication. In this way, several communicative practices, already present in internet interactions, became mobile, more synchronous and "on the spot." One extra example of the cross-pollination between internet practices and mobile phone use could be observed in how both shared many features of new linguistic codes such as "initialism" and "internet slang"29 that also increasingly operate as visual signifiers in and of themselves.Selfies as stabilisationsIf we now think of where photography might be located, it is arguably in the latest stage of a number of stabilisations that converge image with text, hyperlinks, audio (what was praised as "multimedia"). These stabilisations also converge photography with (for example) smart phones and wider sharing and internet cultures that shifts toward the visual within chat culture, authorship, "personal media" developments, and self-representation. In other words, photography emergesas one element within a wider corpus, and even here, it is further convoluted by various practices that each renegotiate and reposition what constitutes "photography" in the first instance: cameraphones,30 immediate and ubiquitous connections, and extensive exchange are all important elements we would note in relation to definitions and constitutions of contemporary photography.31 In turn, these elements are further nuanced by the increasingly visual nature of mediated communication, and social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, each of which has its own convoluted genealogy inclusive of visual communication. We only have to note platforms such as Fotolog (2002) and Flickr (2004), to recognise this. Indeed, while Flickr supported a notion of "community" based on the exchange of pictures, experimentation and voyeurism, Fotolog, with its calendar-based structured, prompted a disciplining of the photographic practice into a weekly cycle as well as promoting the notion of constant updating as a main feature of the platforms. In this way, banality and the mundane also become intricately woven into genealogies of the selfie. Indeed, in the case of selfies, banality and constant updating are closely related to the notion of "social success" as a fundamental feature across different contemporary platforms (where social success becomes measurable through, for example, "like" buttons, favourites, followers and comments). Finally, with the advent of apps such as Whatsapp or Snapchat, digital imagery became one of the central elements in personal online communication. Therefore, vernacular photography (widely expressed by different scholars32), locates the selfies into a very different genealogy that weaves into (and beyond) that of the chat.Selfies as durable algorithmOur experiences33 suggest that the selfie mobilises technologies, cultural norms, and codes that are increasingly embedded in social networks, so that the practice of the selfie operates in a much wider continuum that we need to consider. Indeed, as Van House, (drawing on Suchman) suggests: "we need to turn the question of self-presentation around and ask, not just how people use SNSs, but how the design of SNSs configure members' capacities for action."34 Our final genealogy relates to what we are calling "durable algorithms" drawing a range of STS scholars including Latour,35 Manovich,36 Suchman37 and Van House38 who have all argued that an understanding of the social is always, inherently (also) technological (and vice versa). This is, of course, particularly relevant for the selfie, and works to locate the phenomenon of the selfie as one that has also emerged through non-human developments in (for example) software, code, digital design, and digital labour. We are not suggesting that algorithms straightforwardly shape or impact social behaviour. We are in the first instance recognising that algorithms are, to draw on Lucy Suchman, "materialisations of more and less contested, normative identifications of matter."39 Algorithms are a materialisation of power relations, negotiations, design; they are forged through human-technological relations and within dominant power structures. But they are also, to draw on Latour,40 "durable" in so far as they are also matter: they are built infrastructure that also generates possibilities of interaction and mediation. They are embedded within, but also make durable, power relations. Snapchat is a good example of how durable concepts within social media--such as "immediacy," "connectivity," "sociability,"41 which have particular affordances within social media because of their commercial and economic value--have become "stabilised" as underpinning socio-technical features of communication in a mobile App (as well as within wider social media). As José van Dijck reminds us, "immediacy," "connectivity" and "sociability" emerge through techno-economic systems that are interested in "sharing" because of the financial benefit of the data such actions generate.42 Or as Jenny Kennedy notes "sharing is never employed neutrally."43 It is not (simply) that algorithms make certain relations durable (techno-economic, socio-technical, for example). Instead, as Van House argues (above) we need to recognise that the systems also configure action not in a straightforward or transparent way, but in terms of configuring the socio-technical conditions within which users are invited to participate.To only understand the selfie only as self-representation, then, is to take an element of a moment of stabilisation (that may or may not become increasingly durable)--the visual image, for example--as singularly indicative of a wider socio-technical phenomenon in which relations and negotiations are flattened out and undermined--such as the socio-technical, the material, the context, issues of temporality, motivation, intention. It is to take the "matter" (the thing "itself") without necessarily considering materialisation, nuance, or contestation (to reiterate Suchman) that are all intrinsic to the practice. While we return to these issues below, our hope is that these alternative genealogies detail the breadth and depth of issues that are at stake here, not only in terms of what we are in danger of disappearing, but also in terms of what we actively reproduce by not critically considering.Taken together, these genealogies locate the image as one mediated element within a range of practices that combine (visual and mediated) communication, mobility, real time, economies of language and social networks elements. In turn, these practices promote individuality, immediacy, reciprocity, sharing, exchanging, constant updating, work and effort/commitment, and banality. As Van House suggests, the structure and policies of certain platforms, along with user practices and norms, support and even encourage certain kinds of self-representation, relationships, and even subjects or selves, while discouraging or making difficult others.44 It is not that the object--the selfie "itself"--represents these values and norms (by reading into the selfie, for example). It is that these values and norms constitute the related practices.SELFIES BEYOND (SELF)-REPRESENTATION: ENGAGING WITH THE THEORYSelfies as socio-technicalOur argument, then, is that we need to understand the phenomenon of the selfie as a performative and mediatory practice that cannot be reduced to, or solely taken from, the image "itself." Drawing also on a long history of feminist STS studies,45 we argue that image-creation (along with distribution and its use in social media), does not only represent bodies, it also generates them.46 In order to understand our approach, it is necessary to discuss the concept of performance that underpins claims that selfies are self-representations and that have traditionally been understood following the work of Erving Goffman. While we have limited scope to discuss this at length here, and indeed other authors have reflected on his conceptualisation of performance to think about digital photography,47 and self-representation,48 a brief overview is necessary. Indeed, drawing on Goffman serves two purposes: the first is to articulate some current debates that clearly resonate for the selfie, particularly around how we might frame the visual "object" of the selfie "itself" beyond what Papacharissi claims as "the self, performed" (2012:1990).49 The second is to attempt to nuance them, by positioning the selfie as embedded in the concept of performativity rather than as representative of it.For Goffman's "theatrical approach," interaction is the front-stage performance of a backstage self, where the self is a "performed character" to an imagined audience.50 It is not a coincidence that Goffman is often cited in texts regarding online self-presentation, especially in the first era of internet studies51 where Goffman was deployed within an increasingly problematised dichotomy of the so-called "real" and "virtual." Our reading of existing literature on selfies is that many analyses are tacitly based on this assumption of a real and absent self that is depicted, but not necessarily lived, in the artefact of the selfie "itself" (through, for example, process of performance or self-representation, staging or playing that are read through and into the image). What Goffman elucidates, of course, is the power of the performance "itself"--which, in the case of the selfies, is a bound up in visual signifiers, visual discourses, technologies, and "imaginative participation."52 But as Suchman has argued, "objects achieve recognition within a matrix of historically and culturally constituted familiar, intelligible possibilities. Technologies are both produced and destabilized in the course of these reiterations."53 In the case of the selfie, it seems increasingly that intentionality has become a transparent and straightforward claim made through an aesthetic reading of online content, rather than inherently problematised through socio-technical practices that are, at every stage, negotiated.In thinking about the phenomenon of the selfie, it seems to us that the dominant discourses underpinning claims around self-representation as performance, are increasingly becoming entrenched in practices located in and with technical devices and algorithms even as these technical devices and algorithms are downplayed in the overarching narrative of the selfie. Those technical devices and algorithms are similarly, like the subjects who mediate them, produced with/in and generative of, power relations, but like the subjects who use them, they also promote some mediations over others through their own socio-technological history of design and code (that operate within and beyond wider dominant power structures). What is notable from our alternative genealogies above, then, is an increasing emphasis on the visual, on immediacy, on connectivity. In other words, some elements of communication and mediation have become more powerful than others and this is revealed through alternative genealogies of the selfie.Indeed, one constant finding, across all of our fieldwork on selfies54 is that selfies are understood, claimed and lived by participants (most of our fieldwork has been with women), as a source of "empowerment feelings." These feelings, based on the selfies as a practice, are claimed to help them to accept their physical appearance, to increase their self-confidence or to engage in new social or sentimental relationships. In a surface level, these claims seem to directly feed into an understanding of the selfie as intentional authorship and self-representation. Certainly, it seemed at the outset of many of our studies, that selfies were being claimed in this way. Our fieldwork is always ethnographic in nature, and spending time with the participants in our studies necessarily reveals initial claims as inherently nuanced, if not contradictory. While we do not have the scope here to represent our fieldwork in its entirely, there are two issues we want to pull out at this point from our fieldwork that substantiate our argument. The first is to locate claims of empowerment, not with a subjective or intimate relationship with the image, but with/in a wider discourse of new media and consumerism where individualism, intentionality and rational causality are default modes of expression.55 This means that we need to do the inverse of many studies of selfies that we have critiqued in this article: rather than read into the selfie something about the author and intentionality, we need to locate the selfie within a wider practice of identity performativity56 through recourse to a more Butlerian approach to the selfie,57 which would position it as embedded in the concept of performativity rather than as representative of it.The second issue to highlight is that selfie generation is self-perpetuating: it is a "stylised repetition of acts"58 that is a "re-enactment and re-experiencing of a set of meanings already socially established" that are legitimated through their mundaneness and ritualisation.59 Selfies are part of what "disciplines its subjects even as it produces them,"60 or more simplistically, "people act in the way that they have learned to act, in accord with the dominant discourse."61 What we mean by this is that the practices of taking and uploading selfies (and this the same for Snapchat in our most recent work with teenagers in Leeds, UK) also "disciplines" (to draw on Foucault's ideas about the technologies of the self62) both the content of the image and practice itself. This argument is inclusive of the algorithms that underpin contemporary sharing cultures--that are designed and produced within power structures, but that also work in particular ways that value particular practices (such as image sharing) because of their particular (say, economic) value. This, in turn, makes some practices online not only more "durable" (to draw on Latour63), but it also enmeshes the algorithms that have other "ideological" frameworks (such as an economic one rather than a sharing one) within the phenomenon of the selfie--as well as wider digital culture. Selfies are part of a wider flow of communication that is both a technics and constituted through internet protocol: selfies are controlled (because of the socio-technical construction) and controlling because of their "technical reproducibility."64 At the same time, and as we argued earlier, there is also a moment of stabilisation here, whereby the notion of sociality serves both the visual culture of the selfie and the technological algorithms, so that we also need to recognise that the social-technical relations are fluid as well as mutually shaping in such moments of stabilisation65 If we only understand selfies as self-representation or the output of intentional authoring, we not only flatten out these relations, we also somewhat negate them by offering a causal trajectory between user and image.66CONCLUSIONS: TOWARD AN AGENDA OF POWER IN DIGITAL VISUAL CULTUREOur starting point for this article was that selfies are wider socio-cultural, political practices that need critically accounting for. At the same time, much literature on selfies has elucidated and underpinned the visual nature of contemporary culture that seems, at every turn, enhanced and exacerbated by digital technology and digital culture. Selfie as self-representation bleeds into traditional epistemic understanding of images as depictions of truth and reality. Selfie as self-representation also underpins notions of performance, self-branding, and the concept of the individual user that is embedded on the widespread use of social media. Combined, those two elements do reveal a number of issues and tensions around the constitution of social norms, interactions and practices, all of them within increasing power relations.Our argument, then, is that we need to approach the selfie as an embodied and re-articulated socio-technical act, that shapes, constitutes and imagines the self(ie). In other words, an investigation of the selfie re-turns us to imagined and live(d) self that blurs image and imagining processes and tells us not about intentional authoring, but a deeper desire and ambiguity for and of identity performance in a social media era.67 It is precisely through the staging, shooting, choosing, sharing, posting, commenting, liking through digital mediations that the performance of the image-self becomes meaningful not as a single image but as a complex process of practices that performatively construct the self through their normativity. By relating photography with mediated communication, for example--by thinking selfies as visual chats--the close relationship between digital technologies, increasing visuality and algorithmic culture is elucidated and this, in turn constructs individuals and users in specific (and problematic) ways (e.g. as consumers of subjectivities). The power of the algorithm68 and the use of images as communicative interfaces generate a destabilisation of both photography and representation. Neither become plausible as stand-alone signifiers; both constitute, and perhaps increasingly are a condition of, the dominant ideologies of a shifting digital culture--such as sharing, connectivity, and sociability. This opens an array of further questions that ask about selfies as reflections or practices of/on visual regimes,69 the relationship between the material and the visual,70 or digital mediations.71Finally, then, what is at stake here is how the combination of visual, material and digital elements create new forms of surveillance and sousveillance, can reshape what privacy, public and intimacy are and, finally, generate softer and more effective forms of power. More important than understanding the semiotics of the visual is understanding how the visual is becoming an essential element of a wider "semiotic algorithm." We need to move from focusing on the narratives about the visual or the narratives of the users to focus on the socio-technical practices that constitute--if not condition--those narratives. These practices perpetuate power relations in ways that are sometimes celebrated and very often accepted rather than critiqued.72 We need a critical stance more than ever if we are to grasp the complexity of how technologies, bodies, the visual and the narratives about them, operate in digital culture. Selfies as self-representation, very bluntly, does not offer the scope for this.Notes1. See for example http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/14/how-selfies-became-a-global-phenomenon.2.

For example, there are plenty of discussions about "the first selfie" (usually with examples of the beginning of the 20th century). This locates selfies as the contemporary version of a certain types of self-portraits, namely those where the photographer and the camera are visible at the moment of shooting, for example in a mirror.16.

Are people, however, aware what the digitally mediated cities they live in are? The starting point of my paper is a question of how computer-generated images (CGIs) influence human perception of real space. I am interested in the conflict between a vision and reality, which occurs when an architectural project materialises in a public space and is subsequently rejected by the inhabitants. To explain this conflict, I will use the notion of digital utopias and compare CGIs with the great tradition of "paper" architecture. I will analyse two case studies from a medium-sized Polish city--Poznan. The first case is a redevelopment of the Main Railway Station; the second is a re-design of a local square in Poznan. The analysis focuses on the ambiguity of CGIs used to advertise new investments. The Station in the phase of digital visualisation was appreciated by the Poznan inhabitants but when the project was finally realised, strong criticism of its users followed. The second one provoked public protests already in the phase of visualisation. In conclusion, I state that the concept of agonistic public spaces should be expanded and its virtual dimension should be taken into consideration as well. When dealing with hyper-realistic CGIs, we experience a certain utopia. Confronted with their material execution, we often experience dystopian disillusion which stirs us into action.28215_UF0001.jpgMarianna Michalowska currently works as an associate professor at the Institute of Cultural Studies at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan.

Rubiez 14/38, PL-61-612 Poznan, Poland. Email: mariamne@amu.edu.plThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netThe two examples of public spaces in Poznan I will discuss in my paper might be a perfect illustration of the old saying that hindsight is always better than foresight. The buildings and spaces I am going to talk about were accepted quite enthusiastically by audiences when their digital visualisations were presented for the first time. During the phase of planning and construction, they were awaited with great anticipation. However, when the construction phase was eventually completed, they proved to be a huge disappointment to the users. All the shortcomings, overlooked in the visualisation, surfaced. Was it because the structures were badly designed? Miscalculated? Or were the expectations of the future users of buildings fed with smooth surfaces of realistic-looking images?Elisabeth Grosz noted that introducing digital technologies into everyday life transformed our perception of urban environments. She wrote:Perhaps the most striking transformation effected by these technologies is the change in our perceptions of materiality, space, and information, which is bound directly or indirectly to affect how we understand architecture, habitation, and the built environment.1The consequences of the change described above are visible in the high hopes, which contemporary inhabitants of cities pin on urban planners and developers. The city should be not only comfortable, user friendly and well governed, but also connected to the internet. We want to be and act in both, physical and virtual space at the same time. As William J. Mitchell noted: "Our actions in physical space are closely and unobtrusively coupled with our actions in cyberspace."2 Mitchell's concept directs our attention towards a dichotomy which features in augmented reality: it contains both physical and virtual experiences. This dichotomy, the opposition of vision and reality, or virtual and physical entities in mediated public space will be a useful conceptual aid in the analysis of the processes which occur in the city.We are not only actors of augmented reality, but "true inhabitants of electronically mediated environments" as well.3 What does it mean to live in medially expanded reality? One of many features of digitally mediated life is proliferation of views which mix images of materiality with hyperreal simulations. As Baudrillard famously observed, those simulations are more attractive, more seductive and more convincing that reality itself. What happens if we are offered a digitally re-worked and improved vision of the city we live in? We will do anything to realise it. Our urban imagination is shaped to a great extent by digital images--photographic reproductions of edifices designed by "starchitects" or fantastic visions of cities visualised by creators of video games.THE METHODIn the paper I would like to look at the friction between visualisations and material outcomes of completion of architectural and urban plans and, therefore, I refer to images and comments published on popular community websites dedicated to contemporary Polish architecture (bryla.pl) and local news (poznan.naszemiasto.pl, mmpoznan.pl). I draw on opinions of various people affected by the projects--local inhabitants, tourists and also experts experienced in analysing contemporary architecture. Similarly, the images I describe in the text come from publicly accessible sources. I limited the visual material to the visualisations and photographs published in the media, and decided not to use my own visual documentation. I realise that having lived and observed changes in Poznan for the last 20 years, I will not be able to avoid voicing personal opinions in the text. This personal perspective becomes particularly evident when I analyse the visual material. As I write knowing the outcome of the projects, I cannot avoid confronting the visualisations and their physical equivalents. This self-knowledge implies that an absolutely objective analysis of visual material is impossible and that it always conveys unconscious connotations.4This article is consequently positioned in the field of interdisciplinary cultural research which builds links between theory and empirical reflection on people's everyday experiences, as well as emphasising participatory observation and discourse analysis. The remarks on integrative approach, made by Paula Saukko, perfectly support my choice of approach. As she writes:The distinctive feature of cultural studies is the way in which it combines a hermeneutic focus on lived realities, a (post)structuralist critical analysis of discourses that mediate our experiences and realities, and a contextualist/realist investigation of historical, social, and political structures of power.5In my paper, I utilise all the features of the integrative approach listed above. I take into consideration everyday realities of city life, the critical perspective on media discourse and the context of local social and political structures of power. The goal of this article is to examine the gap between computer-generated images and their physical manifestations. The text is divided into three sections. The first one follows the historical paths of utopias and considers the relationship between computer technologies and paper architecture; the second compares two architectural projects from Poznan, and analyses people's reactions to the materialised visions of the architects. In the conclusive third part, I consider a vision of a city as an agonistic space, where finding a consensus between the clashing powers, local communities, city councils, investors and developers, seems to be impossible. The article, however, will inevitably, to some extent be a personal narration about the city I live in, filtered through all my fears and expectations. In my opinion, this autobiographical autoreflexive filter might be an advantage, especially in an analysis of a city space, a space which is always perceived by its inhabitants.DIGITAL IMAGING AS A TOOL OF CREATING A NEW URBAN UTOPIAThe narrator of a poignant film Vacancy by Matthias Müller touched the very core of utopian projects describing Brasilia, the symbol of a modernistic urban utopia, as "the city not for now but for the future". At this point, I would like to consider briefly the principles of urban utopias and e-topias in order to establish the philosophical basis of digital architectural design. Let us start with Elisabeth Grosz who writes: "Utopias are the spaces of phantasmatically attainable political and personal ideals, the projection of idealized futures; embodiment, though, is that which has never had its place within utopias."6When utopia is embodied, it loses its utopian potential. Why can it not find its materialisation? The explanation lies in the philosophical source of the term. In Greek ou-topos means "no-place", and eu-topos a "good place". Both terms sound the same (they are homophones) but they are philosophically ambivalent. In her analysis of the origin of the term, Grosz recalls Thomas More's ambiguous interpretation. Although utopia evokes the notion of a "happy" and "good place" that people dream about, it is a no-place as well, and therefore it cannot be materialised. She emphases that it "cannot be regarded as topological at all,"7 because it exist only potentially and belongs to the future.From antiquity urban utopias were mostly narrated in philosophical dissertations or drawn. Only some were embodied, usually as examples in discussions about society and politics. While urban utopias in their very sense cannot be materialised, the projects of ideal cities use utopian inspirations and incorporate them into the bodies of real cities. The Renaissance urban plans reflect this tradition. Ideal cities use philosophical concept of a "good life" to create a perfect society, ruled by laws that are seen as appropriate for the chosen model of humanity. There are some noteworthy illustrations of ideal cities in Poland. One of them is Zamosc, a Renaissance city on a regular geometrical grid, built by Jan Zamoyski and designed by an Italian architect, Bernardo Morando.Both models of utopian and of ideal city met in modernity. Philosophers dreamt of materialising a vision of a perfect, ordered society in a physical space. Architects, therefore, had to become social engineers. The foundation of the modern fusion between an architect and an engineer was underpinned by a belief that a city is a working organism, a living machine which can be controlled by political powers. Thus, firstly, the city has to be examined, then, secondly, it has to be transformed through the means of urban construction. The ambition of transforming societies through cities was, however, never limited to a specific location but aimed to engulf the whole world. As Ewa Rewers noted:Urban utopias which were constructed by modern societies did not conceal their claims to universality and under its cover proposed a new, more ideal world, where a city was "just" a laboratory, even if the experiment was on a scale of Brasilia.8Today, as Rewers persuades, the modern laboratory has been replaced with a "workshop," where seemingly conflicting approaches are tested by a wide variety of bricoleurs: urban planners, philosophers, technocrats, inventors and artists.9 In the urban workshop, technologies meet ecologies and programmers cooperate with architects. It is the world, which William J. Mitchell called e-topia.e-Topia is neither an ou-topos (because it has its place, both in physical and virtual space) nor an ideal city. It exists, because we live in a technologically mediated milieu. It incorporates some features of eu-topos, not in the sense of a good life derived from Greek philosophy with its values as arete (virtues) and phronesis (practical and ethical wisdom), but because e-topia is convenient and flexible. Its residents have everything within their reach, on the screens of personal computers and mobile phones, even though they are not very focused on cognition. e-Topia is not ideal either. It embraces too many conflicting points of view to create a harmonious structure. Our new electronic cities are a mixture of virtual and physical features which facilitate our existence. As e-topia's everyday life cannot go on without a technologically mediated infrastructure, its construction requires competences that go beyond artistic visions and philosophical ideas, and demands cooperation between humanities and science.Rivka and Robert Oxman observe that computer technologies change the relation between architects and engineers. "This cultural evolution is pre-eminently expressed in the expanded collaborative relationships that have developed in the past decade between architects and structural engineers, relationships which have been responsible for the production, worldwide, of a series of iconic buildings."10It undermines the position of an architect, who from the age of Enlightenment was a central figure in a city, and, instead of architectural visionaries, elevates engineers. If we looked back at the history of architecture, we would observe that the change happened gradually. As early as the 18th century, Étienne-Louis Boullée, a great architectural visionary, posed a question: "Is architecture merely a fantastic art belonging to the realm of pure invention or are its basic principles derived from Nature?" and argued that the genius of an architect guides us towards Truth and Harmony through the means of rational geometry. His vision of architecture was, undoubtedly, utopian and existed in the sphere of pure imagination. Could we regard the architectural drawings by architects like Boullée or Claude Nicolas Ledoux as futuristic? They illustrated (similarly to Boullée's Cenotaph for Izaak Newton) the base concepts of aesthetics and philosophy and were never intended to be built. They were virtual in the sense of their potentiality. We should note that unlike digital architectural projects, drawings are always theoretical and never illusionistic, as their aim is to examine the structure of Reason. With time the position of an architect has changed, but its worth remembering that the tradition of theoretical architecture has found its continuation in the works of Bernardo Tschumi, Daniel Liebeskind and Peter Eisenman.The modernist movement emphasised the role of an engineer who worked not for universal Reason, but for a New Society. In the opinion of the one of Bauhaus's founders, Walter Gropius, "the products of intellectual, social and technical determinants of our times" will replace "caprices of a small number of architects."11 As a result, modern urban projects integrate engineering practice, ideological vision of society and metaphorical expression. Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse finds the metaphor of community in a "modulor"--a model of a perfect human body, and Lucio Costa's and Oscar Niemeyer's Brasilia in a figure of a cross/a bird/a plane that might be recognised in an urban structure. Brasilia was supposed to be not only a triumph of modern engineering but a readable symbol of a new nation as well. The architect cannot rely just on his vision, talents and intuition any longer. He has to be educated in the technical aspects of construction (the skill which evokes the Renaissance practice of art based on technical abilities), and, equally important, in team work. Gropius continues: "An architect of the future--if he will decide to return to the top--will have to come closer to processes of building production again."12The echoes of the move towards integrity of architectural, urban and technological practices can still be heard today. The change, inspired by new materials and structures, transforms the principles of imagination, which finds new inspiration in virtual space and enables experiments with 3D modelling. Computer modelling, programming and simulating create virtual copies of reality. As Oxmans observed: "No longer a posteriori, the design engineer is now up-front at the earliest generative stage, bringing to the fore the design content of materialisation and fabrication technologies."13Thus, on the one hand, architectural design, which corresponds with technologies and engineering infrastructure, should be practical and realistic, but on the other hand, it is an illusion of harmonious human interactions. A new eu-topia is created--coexistence of people, nature and machines. What do these new utopists dream about? Mitchell describes e-city as lively, friendly, wealthy and happy.The electronically enabled shift of activities back to the home, and in formation of twenty-four-hour, pedestrian scale neighborhoods that are rich in possibilities for local secondary social relationships, potentially produce the conditions for vigorous local community life, for the formation of social and cultural capital in ways that have seemed lost.14Modernists' image of an ordered, disembodied and abstract city (a "machine for living") was replaced by an image of a city emerging from R. Florida's concept of cultural capital, where cultural differences contribute to the prosperity of the city and enrich identity of the inhabitants. As I present further on, these visions are often created using the means of computer-generated images.According to Gillian Rose's research into architectural practices in the re-design of living areas, contemporary architects treat digital imaging as "canvases for expression," or "self-confident visual statements." Those individual expressions are the basis for the further design process which involves negotiations with investors, experts and local communities. The effects are constantly input onto the virtual representation of the space. Images are disputed and argued. In the end, visions which consist of many pieces of interests of clashing groups are implemented into physical reality. Gradually changing CGIs reflect the negotiations and remain, throughout, the basis for the process of place-making.To explain the features of CGIs, I will refer to the project of Gillian Rose, Monica Degen and Clare Melhuish called Visualising atmospheres: digital placemaking in the 21st century, which analysed the rebuilding of a ruined district of Msheireib in Doha. The authors described the venture using such adjectives as anthological, mutable, embodied, interfacial and spreadable. Let us consider in a few words the context in which the words were used. The first word, anthological, refers to the ability to amalgamate many varied fragments into the most appropriate form for the space which is being designed. The anthology is, thus, constructed using different materials and disciplines, and involves a constant collaborative effort of architects, urban planners and visualisers. The second word, mutable, directs us to a potential for change. The design is unstable, because it is permanently negotiated and modified both, by designers and developers. The third adjective refers to the power of place-making by simulating the local context. CGIs are embodied because they utilise recognisable local materialities and use realistic images of people. The aim of the embodiment is to enable the spectator to "feel" the place, or to rephrase; CGIs use the "language of affect" to immerse the viewer in the image. The forth adjective, interfacial, describes qualities which are a consequence of mutability of digital images. GCIs are interfacial, because they move from a digital to printed form, travel between servers situated in varied geographical locations and, what is crucial, are part of the communication process between individuals involved in the process of design. We could say that CGIs do not have their final visual form as they might be modified indefinitely. And finally, they are spreadable due to their potential for proliferation within diverse media and in a variety of spaces--from physical public space (i.e. as advertising billboards), 3D models on websites or reproductions in printed folders. Rose, Degen and Melhuish notice that "spreadability also has its frictions, as the media through which images are presented have different visual affordances."15CGIs seem to be a convenient tool for place-making which facilitates preprograming of interactions between human, infrastructural and natural agents. We should remember, however, that the basic principle of CGIs, which present future rebuilding (or "revitalisation") projects, is to sell them. Therefore, images of commercial and private spaces are rhetoric (I will discuss this notion in the last part of the article) and persuasive tools for winning new clients. This is why the researchers called the project in Msheireb the "reinvention" of the place and emphasised its power of manipulation achieved by balancing on the line between reality and illusion.Realism and atmosphere therefore constantly compete against each other within the frame of images as they are manipulated to produce evocations of a 'dream world' that meets the client's brief and sells the idea of the project to those who will mobilise resources for its translation into reality.16To conclude: until CGIs stay in the cyberspace (without any representation in the physical space) and follow the tradition of paper architecture, they might be criticised or appraised. The problem begins when they are materialised. What thus is the status of CGIs? Most often they are neither utopias nor plans of ideal cities, but objects of commodification: they are used to advertise and sell a product, a certain vision of a city. We shall see what happens when those commodified images are presented to the public in the next part of the paper.THE CHRONICLE OF TWO CONSTRUCTION SITES IN POZNANAs I mentioned at the very beginning, both cases I will describe are located in the city I live in, Poznan. It is a middle-sized city in the Western part of Poland with a population of about six hundred thousands inhabitants. The city is known for the motor industry, the International Fair, a few good universities (Adam Mickiewicz University, Medical University, University of Economics, University of Arts) which ensure a steady flow of new inhabitants, the International Festival of Street Theatres and, last but not least, a decent football team.On the wave of enthusiasm for the UEFA European Championships, which were held in Poland and Ukraine in 2012, a great number of major new investments were announced. Poznan, which was chosen as one of the four cites where football matches took place, followed suit. A series of large-scale renovations was planned, among them, reconstruction of a communication junction in the very heart of the city, new airport, redevelopment of the football stadium, new tram connections and small construction projects in the historic centre (some of these projects are still under construction). Construction of a new Central Railway Station replacing the old one was the icing on the cake.The investor, the Hungarian Trigranit corporation chosen to undertake the venture, was experienced in the implementation of many commercial projects in Central Europe and Poland itself. The construction, financed both from the public and private funds, had started in 2011 but was officially inaugurated in an atmosphere of great excitement a month before the first football match. Designers decided not to renovate the old building, which would have been a complicated and long-drawn process, but to build the new edifice next to the old one. The Main Railway Station was combined with a bus station and a huge shopping mall.Soon after the announcement of construction, the first visualisations were presented in newspapers and on the internet. They showed an open space, dominated by a white and blue edifice of glass and concrete. The images offered a perspective which ended with a renovated body of the old station, also clad in glass. From the visualised point of view the project seemed to be "on human scale": human figures were quite prominent, the railway station building complemented the shopping centre situated at the back. The colours of the image: light-coloured ground and blue sky create a pleasant first impression, where the modern (the new edifice) and the historic (the old building) harmonise. The image is a perfect example of one of the aims of CGIs I mentioned earlier--visualisation of an atmosphere. However, it is also a tool of commodification. It is worth remembering that this particular perspective and specific colours are the tricks of the trade of advertising companies, utilised in visualisations in order to present the most appealing vision of a new development (Figure 1).Fig 1Figure 1.  Visualisation of the Main Railway Station in Poznan, designed by Pentagram Architects (open access: abcnieruchomosci.pl).The progress of the construction was eagerly followed by journalists, passengers and passers by. Twenty-four-hour monitoring was installed and everybody could watch the development of the investment on the internet. On 20th February 2012, the website poznan.naszemiasto.pl (poznan.ourcity.pl) reported: "Poznan's railway station changes every day. Five thousand square metres of concrete floor have been laid recently. The lift shafts were installed last weekend. Soon the interior walls will be built and, as soon as it is warmer, the steel construction will be clad in glass."17 After looking at the photo documentation presenting the accumulation of steel and concrete elements, people posted favourable comments: "Impressive construction, bravo!"18The development was completed in two stages. The first stage, consisting of the building of the railway station, was ready just before EURO 2012 and the grand opening ceremony was conducted by the Polish president. The second phase was completed 1 year later and followed by an official opening of the shopping mall and the bus station. The first impressions were favourable. Users compared it to an airport terminal, or an exclusive commercial centre.19 Soon opinions changed radically and the project started attracting strong criticism. The building appeared to be impractical and badly located. It was too small for the footfall. The passengers preferred the old, partly ruined building to the new elegant space. The distance from the main hall to the platforms proved to be too great for people carrying heavy luggage, but the straw that broke the camel's back was the size of the shopping mall. The railway station seemed to be an annex to the commercial centre. The people of Poznan started to feel fed up with the number of commercial centres in the city. Comments posted on the internet are full of complaints and manifest general disappointment with the building (Figure 2).Fig 2Figure 2.  The Main Railway Station in Poznan, photo: BernardJ47, 2013 (open access: www.panoramio.com/photo/100005148).It is not difficult to find differences between the final effect and the visualisation when we compare the images of the two. First of all, the project has lost its white and blue elegance which was replaced with a colourful facade. The space in front of the railway station is full of cars. Also the proportions of the new building and the shopping mall are not the same as they seemed to be in the visualisation. The space around the building is surrounded by advertising billboards.In my opinion, the case of the railway station is a very good illustration of Rem Koolhaas's idea of junkspace. The term describes projects (Koolhaas does not call them architecture, since in his view "architecture disappeared in the 20th century"20) which flood our urban environment with shopping malls, airports and theme parks. The architect noted: "Junkspace is what remains after modernization has run its course or, more precisely, what coagulates while modernization is in progress, its fallout. Modernization had a rational program: to share the blessing of science, universally."21The forms are, thus, easily multiplied, often constructed from prefabricated elements, simply increased. To develop Koolhaas's observation, we could say that computer programming and its products belong to the same commercial sphere of imagination as junkspace. As such both CGIs and junkspace have to be flexible, adaptable to varied historic traditions and cheap in execution. Moreover, the types of constructions referred to as junkspace by architects (i.e. shopping malls or airports) are rarely publicly discussed, as they are usually largely privately financed (as in the case of Poznan's Railway Station) Of course, the great architects who dictate the trends and styles (like Zaha Hadid or Koolhaas himself) may still dream up grand designs but junkspace seduces those who are not so talented with its luminosity, openness and ornaments.Koolhaas perceives junkspace as an expression of a contemporary desire to transform everything. "Restore, rearrange, reassemble, revamp, renovate, revise, recover, redesign, return--the Parthenon Marbles--redo, respect, rent: verbs that start reproduce Junkspace ...."22 It does not mean that cities do not need renovations but, rather, that those renovations, when confronted with reality, prove to be tragically impractical. Why were they, therefore, chosen? I will try to answer this question further on in the article.The second example I intend to present is not as spectacular as the previous one. I would like to tell the story of a revitalisation of Asnyk Square, a space in the centre of Jezyce district which is known for its 19th century tenement houses. The story begins in 2010 when Zarzad Dróg Miejskich (Municipal Roads Authority) launched a programme of revaluation (the term used in ZDM's announcement) of the square by planting over 400 trees and bushes around the run-down playgrounds and benches.23 In 2014, the local community council decided to proceed with a brand new renovation. The project proposed a complete rebuilding of the space which came as a great surprise to the local people. A local newspaper, Glos Wielkopolski, announced: "Art Nouveau Asnyk Square will have a new surface (granite blocks), there will be new benches and plants. As the community council explained, after the rebuilding, the square will serve not only "drunks" but all the inhabitants of Jezyce."24 As soon as the first visualisations were presented to the community, people began protesting against the project. Why did the images not seduce people this time? (Figure 3).Fig 3Figure 3.  Visualisation of Asnyk Square, Joanna Kosenko (open access: www.gloswielkopolski.pl/artykul/zdjecia/3353759,plac-asnyka-rady-osiedla-jezyce-chce-dokonczenia-projektu-wizualizacje,3469511,id,t,zid.html).The image is seemingly less realistic than usual CGIs which are used in advertising projects and does not look like a photograph. The forms are situated in an abstract space. There are no buildings which could create an urban atmosphere of the visualisation. It is interesting that in this case the project was criticised already in the design phase. People complained mainly about the lack of playgrounds and pitches, as well as, the waste of money which had been spent on the previous reclamation of the area. In the article titled "Asnyk Square--only for the dead", the author reported the voices of the local community:The visualisations look embarrassing--a lady from Jezyce complained--There are no surrounding buildings, objects are not attractive ... glass surfaces instead of sandpits ... concrete couches covered with artificial moss. They will be comfortable enough after few beers. Asnyk Square is the only playground for children in Jezyce. There are always a lot of families with children there. Now it will be a paradise for beer-lovers.25The discussion was initiated because of such CGIs' features as spreadability and interfaciality. The images were widely presented in the neighbourhood, the local media and on the internet. People commented on all the ideas and submitted their opinions to the community officials. However, the project was not mutable enough and eventually the changes interposed in the project were not what people had hoped they would be. After few meetings, when the works on the Square had already started, people who had protested against the rebuilding project founded an active FB group called "The Asnyk Square Initiative" and displayed their opinions on posters attached to the fence of the construction site (Figure 4).Fig 4Figure 4.  Asnyk Square, Poznan, 2013 (open access: www.wiadomosci.onet.pl/poznan/plac-asnyka-tylko-dla-umarlych/z5m6s)."Asnyk Square for people", "No to a lounge of the dead". Finally, some small modifications were implemented into the design and the new Asnyk Square was finished. Looking at the Asnyk Square case in hindsight, we can identify all the mistakes that were made both during the planning and the construction stages (Figure 5).Fig 5Figure 5.  Asnyk Square, Poznan, photo: K. Nowicki, 2015 (open access: www.codziennypoznan.pl/artykul/2015-01-20/plac-asnyka-jest-gotowy#).The misleading factor in this case was the issue of revitalisation. As we know, the term does not refer to architectural changes, but usually describes social issues. "To revitalise" stands for "to animate" the community by means of urban planning. This time, the community's voice and officials' vision did not match. The officials' priority was to have an ordered, clean space whereas people hoped to have a space for community activities.The problem does not lie with the physical manifestation of the design, which had been altered to incorporate people's demands, but with the fact that the project was, from the very beginning to its final incarnation, unsuccessful. In a well-known concept of Henri Lefebvre, the space is produced in the series of layered interactions. The city is created by superposition of spatial practices, representation of spaces and representational spaces. The first two, on which I would like to focus here, refer to people's everyday activities and to a "conceptualised space" created by "urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers."26 We can observe a definite friction between those two. The new Asnyk Square is a good representation of space but does not allow people to act in the space in the way they would like to.PERSUASIVE IMAGES AND AGONISTIC CITIESThe stories I have told in the preceding part of the paper, revealed a number of inconsistencies which emerge when we talk about cities. First of all, we observe a process that Koolhaas called the shrinking of public life,27 where open public spaces are replaced by commercial areas. Secondly, as a result of the shrinking of public life, a tendency emerges to "clean" and "order" the space. It is an effect of an ambition to make the space more and more spectacular. In those processes, computer-generated images are just, to use a colloquial phrase, "handy" and subordinated to powers that provide projects with funding.In conclusion I would like to point out a few general issues:1. The form of CGIs differs from photorealistic representations to the digital schemas and, therefore, their persuasive power varies.2. The photo-realism of digital representation makes discussions at the stage of designing difficult. CGIs act as rhetoric messages and as such appeal to people hoping for a better future. When buildings are materialised, it becomes evident that the vision of the developers does not correspond with the expectations of the community.3. CGIs which are more schematic initiate public discussion in the phase of designing.4.  e-City is not a space of social and political consensus but an area of agon, permanent fight for space and cultural meaning.Let us now consider these presuppositions in more detail.While talking about rhetoric and persuasion beyond CGIs I refer to the concepts of Roland Barthes and William J.T. Mitchell. The notion of the first quality, rhetoric, draws on the Barthesian "third message" which is based on cultural connotations. We connote photorealistic metonymic images and, as a result, we believe in their message. Moreover, because of the photo-realism of CGIs, we are not able to consider those images as models and symbols. Therefore, to use Barthes's words, we are immersed in "the denoted scene as though into a lustral bath of innocence."28 Illusionist pictures, which are naturalised in human minds because of their photography-like appearance, appeal to people's dreams of a better future and better life.The second quality indicates that CGIs may persuade the city inhabitants to enthusiastically accept the presented vision. Just like images described by W.J.T. Mitchell, they are "transparently and immediately linked to what they represent."29 A message communicated by their means seems to be like an "animated, living thing,"30 or rather, in this case, a living space. Future residents settle in the space, although it only exists as a digital image. The glamorous appearance of CGIs conceals the commercial intentions of their producers. They are designed above all to sell a product and seldom become a part of public negotiations.Respondents who commented on the visualisations of the Poznan railway station often stated: "I like that, and I hope that the investment will be developed as planned."31 They clearly expected that the finished project would be exactly the same as the vision presented in CGIs. Unlike the CGIs of the railway station, the visualisation of Asnyk Square was more like a drawing than a photograph, thus it was not so seductive and it opened a public debate. We can notice that the digital simulations of the railway station not only fulfilled people's dreams about utopia of a new, better Poznan, but led people to believe that they would be able to live in it. Let us come back to Elisabeth Grosz. She noted:Can architecture construct a better future? How can it do so without access to another notion of time than that of projection and planned development (a time in which the future is fundamentally the same as the past, or increases in some formulaic version of the past)?32The failures of Poznan's rebuilding projects which looked so promising at the stage of visualisation lead me to a question about the ownership of the city and the identity of the beneficiaries of projects undertaken in it. Whose is the city and for whom it is re-designed?For whom should Asnyk Square be? For urban planners who want to see a trendy city square, or for people who live in the neighbourhood and prefer friendly chaos to a clean and paved urban area? The saying "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" seems to illustrate this story quite well. Instead of a good "revitalisation" project, people live with an unwanted concrete yard.For whom should the railway station be? For travellers, who need easy access to platforms and ticket offices or for the customers of the shopping centre? "Since when is the part of a shopping mall where ticket offices are located called a railway station?"33--asked an angry passenger. Is it possible to find a consensus between the clashing visions? This unfortunate situation is an effect of shrinking of the public space which was described earlier in the text. The powers of politics and commerce compete to gain influence over the city space and use urban projects as weapons in the struggle. This conflict is not a modern phenomenon, but the balance of the power clash has changed. As Don Mitchell observed:As a secular space, the public space of the modern city has always been a hybrid of politics and commerce. Ideally, the anarchy of the market meets the anarchy of politics in public space to create an interactive a democratic public. In the twentieth century, however, markets have been increasingly severed from politics.34Nowadays, CGIs are used mainly by commercial power. They are commodified to sell a product to as many buyers as possible. As soon as the product is sold, investors lose interest in the space as a good place and the eu-topos ends. The gap between CGIs and real life cannot be bridged.A similar observation can be found in the concepts of Chantal Mouffe criticising the Habermasian idea of public space consensus. She claims that interests of various groups meet and clash in cities, and all of them try to persuade the inhabitants to support their visions. Mouffe called her model of society an "agonistic model of public space" and confronted it with both the consensual and the antagonistic visions of a city. As she noted: "For the agonistic model, at the contrary, the public space is the battleground where different hegemonic projects are confronted, without any possibility of final reconciliation."35Where is a place for CGIs within the agonistic public sphere? It is not difficult to realise that cyberspace creates additional spacial layers in cities. CGIs, therefore, are the next dimension of multiple, discursive surfaces,36 which should be taken into consideration in urban debates. They reflect the visions of planners and the expectations of people. The virtually produced images try to win people's approval. They also have a power to activate their aspirations for eu-topia, a better life.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Margareta Melin, Ewa Rewers and my colleagues from the Department of Cultural Urban Studies at Adam Mickiewicz University whose kind comments helped me in ordering thoughts presented above, and Anna Glover who was a thorough reader of my paper.Notes1.

Specifically, I engage the museum as a text that has significant implications on how we approach the philosophy of hospitality in a time of terror. I argue that the ways in which objects and artifacts exist in relation to one another in the museum act out hospitality in ways that are both unexpected and unintended. For example, while human remains are stored on site, they are only referred to through symbolic art and digital displays that act as a kind of sleight of hand. In particular, I take up the inclusion of a brick from Osama Bin Laden's Abbottabad compound in Pakistan that has been incorporated into the museum in a fashion that is carefully orchestrated and framed. The brick, however, exceeds the frame in which it is permitted to be included in the exhibit; its visuality and materiality defy--and even contradict--the expected narrative of the museum. The brick appears as juxtaposed next to a Navy SEAL uniform and is meant to draw attention toward the distinction between terrorist and national hero, yet as a physical presence in the museum, it retains a sense of both vulnerability and affect as it bears striking resemblance to the bedrock of the towers themselves. Ultimately, I suggest that while the disjunctures between artifacts may seem initially jarring--these are items, after all, that are meant to produce very different material and mediatized effects; they offer a working-through of a hospitality that is crucial to the museum and all culture produced in response to the attacks.28217_UF0001.jpgLindsay Anne Balfour is a Visiting Scholar at New York University and an Andrew W.

Email: Lindsay.Balfour@nyu.edu; LBalfour@911memorial.orgThis paper is part of the Special Issue: Visual Frictions. More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.netOpened in May 2014, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum represents a culmination of public mourning and remembrance, research, debate, and recovery in the aftermath of 9/11, and in some way signals the end of the critical phase of the War on Terror (although this war is, to be sure, far from over). The death of Osama Bin Laden, the passing of the 10 years anniversary of the attacks, the opening of the central landmark of memorialization, and the completion of One World Trade Center--which has become the most prominent signifier of the financial revitalization of lower Manhattan--are all notable moments in the culmination of more than a decade of history. The museum also marks out a beginning and perhaps initiates a time when we might start thinking differently about the preoccupation with strangers that continues to dominate social, cultural, and political life. These strangers are, of course, as methodological and philosophical as they are tangible, and this paper seeks to engage with the figure of the stranger beyond conventional markers and representations of cultural, religious, or racial difference. The study of such representations--of the so-called "terrorist other" is well covered by both foundational and contemporary thinkers.1 Moreover, the dominant narrative of a general "us" (white, American) versus a vague "them" (Eastern or Arab, racially othered) is certainly present in the mainstream rhetoric surrounding the museum's purpose, plan, and physical displays. I want to read the stranger, however, as a figure of depth, philosophical resonance, and ethical injunction that destabilizes what we think we know about the boundaries of what is strange and familiar, particularly in the space of a museum that, I argue, reverses and collapses such distinctions, rendering the strange familiar--or, at the very least, uncanny--and the familiar strange once more. In other words, the rush to revitalize and commemorate raises important questions for what it means to engage hospitably with known and unknown others, questions that matter even more in what is still a time of terror. Indeed, if there was ever a time for a resurgence of hospitality as we understand it in the philosophical sense--that is, the open and unconditional welcome of whoever or whatever may arrive--the time is now, not only in consideration of the museum's official opening but also because, as the War on Terror shifts away from Iraq and Afghanistan and toward other nations, it matters increasingly how we deploy strategies of apprehending others--particularly as those strategies are learned from the visual legacy of the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, not only do the events of 9/11 continue to reverberate as series of images and have developed their own visual iconography--familiar images such as the towers or Osama Bin Laden's face on a wanted posted that circulate indefinitely, for example--but the War on Terror itself, in many ways, continues to be fueled by a visual imagination, hostile to difference.AFFECT AND AESTHETICS: THE VISITOR EXPERIENCEThe initial experience of the museum is certainly different from a visit to the surface memorial as the names etched into the granite walls begin to reanimate once one walks through the doors of the bright entry pavilion.2 Yet, it is the first moments underground that suggest the museum is defined by a provocative and haunting discourse of hospitality--one that can be interrogated in many of the museum's visual exhibits. Joining the crowd wandering toward the main exhibition space, one registers that this mass of people is shuffling deeper into what essentially remains a crypt. Indeed, in both the public and political expressions of mourning following 9/11, the site is often referred to as a cemetery, burial ground, or final resting place. As former mayor Rudolph Giuliani argues in his editorial for the anniversary edition of Time in September 2002, "Ground zero is a cemetery. It is the last resting place for loved ones whose bodies were not recovered and whose remains are still within that hallowed ground."3 Yet, the museum is also a place of deep abstraction, as the digital and symbolic displays often come to substitute for their material referent. The museum crypt is an especially fraught place of burial, particularly because the space was not intentionally created to house the remains of victims; instead, it was carved out in the very process of their demise. The crypt, in fact, was what killed them. Yet, it is in this crypt where hospitality makes its two most significant gestures, through the cordoning off of human remains that refuse to go unnoticed and in the unlikely placement of artifacts that are displayed in an extraordinarily out-of-place fashion.Surely the museum has a rigorous screening process for the items it includes and emphasizes a very particular narrative of events, often at the expense of other narratives. This central narrative of commemoration, while presented objectively, is beholden, of course, to the tenuous relationship between memory, personal and historical perception, selective representation, and forgetfulness.4 In other words, narrative, while presented as objective and historically accurate, can be wildly imaginative and swayed by both intentional and unconscious factors. This is particularly the case with visual narratives, whose "truths" are translated once more from text, speech, or firsthand experience--a hermeneutical chain that has, since antiquity, been an unstable and slippery cycle of interpretation. What then of these visual displays themselves--the strange passages, curious absences, odd juxtapositions, and artifacts that seem generally out of place, either in the structural flow of the museum or in their detachments from the bodies that once gave them animation? In other words, where in the museum might we read other incidences of invitation or exclusion, things that seem foreign or odd, and find "guests" that show up uninvited and unannounced and defy coherent interpretation? I invoke the spectral here to refer to ghostly figures of haunting, unhomeliness, exception, invisibility, curiosity, and phantasm, especially when these figures appear outside of expectation, outside of material presence, and who operate thus as social figures and not simply as gothic terrors. They appear in traces rather than in whole and are often both undefined and uninvited. As Patrice Ladwig elaborates, "ghosts can here be understood as strangers to the realm of the living who through the crossing of an ontological boundary intrude into a world to which they usually do not belong."5 Thus, in their deconstructive efforts, ghosts become both the invited and uninvited guests in the process of making and unmaking meaning. Where then do we find these spectral artifacts that meld, attract, or repel? And what can be made of objects that appear similar in shape, structure, and design but that come with vastly irreconcilable histories? As a crypt, the 9/11 museum inadvertently engages with remains and remnant objects that administrators and politicians would likely prefer to keep buried, even while they stand on obvious display. One such artifact--a single brick from Osama Bin Laden's Abbottabad compound--reflects precisely this mingling of the spectral and the tangible and, in so doing, offers a sustained preoccupation with a discourse of hospitality at the museum site. The brick is placed alongside a Navy SEAL uniform and is intended to be a symbol of both those responsible for the attacks and ultimately America's victory over them; unintentionally, however, it offers much more.UNLIKELY CRYPTFELLOWSTo find the Abbottabad brick, visitors walk through the "Center Passage," into Foundation Hall. The hall is a curious and cavernous space with only a few exhibition materials and is situated between the preserved slurry wall and the excavated North Tower--of which the original bedrock support columns are still visible. At the entrance to Foundation Hall, visitors pass by the mangled wreckage of the Ladder 3 fire engine and the steel beam from Flight 11's point of impact, at which point the material immediately gives way to the mediatized in the form of four digital screens and a recording studio inviting written and verbal personal messages. This thread--material to digital and back to material--continues to be the most prominent feature in Foundation Hall. The "last column," a 30-foot section of steel beam, acts as a "symbol of resilience" and tribute to rescue workers and became the last portion of the tower to be removed from the excavation site.6 Preserved now in the museum, the last column stands alongside interactive features such as recorded testimony from rescue workers, touch screens that provide close-up images of the inscriptions, and posters affixed to the column itself. At the end of Foundation Hall is an interactive timeline that uses a complex algorithm to search news reports from all over the world that contain material related to 9/11. The entire hall is permeated by the strange relationship between tangible and digital worlds--perhaps befitting of an event that was, in many ways, mediatized before materialized, yet curious nonetheless. This relationship is strange because it is oddly characterized by a simultaneous disparity and interdependency between the material and the mediatized and is continually disrupting the visitors' expectations of how the events of 9/11 should and can be remembered. In places where one might expect to find a tangible artifact, for example, in the case of human remains, such elements are referred to symbolically and represented via artistic installation or digitalized in a photographic wall but never actually shown. In most cases, moreover, the digital and material seem to work together and do not initially appear to offer a contradictory narrative of the events and their mourning. The attempt here is to establish a unified and continuous narrative--using different media to tell what is meant to be the same story. Yet object, material, digital, or otherwise often do far more than the work they are intended for. For example, in the case of the timeline projected on the wall, the aesthetic element of light, mathematical algorithms, and computer technology work together to produce what the original items (newspapers and magazine) cannot in the space of the museum. Yet, it is what is next to this virtual timeline that is the most curious addition to Foundation Hall and a complete rupture with the careful balance between the virtual and the tangible. It is a display that represents not only a physical history but also acts as a conduit for a provocative spectrality. To be sure, there are elements of spectrality in a number of the museums displays, particularly those that offer a virtual experience of 9/11 and its aftermath, yet it is the final display in Foundation Hall that seems to surpass even the digital in its presentation of an object that is no much more than its material presence.Within Foundation Hall, the brick from Bin Laden's compound is ----encased in glass, and is among a handful of small artifacts in the room that is mostly meant to showcase large artifacts such as the last column. While the brick is certainly part of the larger narrative of 9/11, it seems out of place in a space so heavily invested in emotional commemoration and the personal narratives of victims and rescue workers. There are exhibits detailing the rise of Al Qaeda, the timelines of each hijacking, and history of the War on Terror, yet they are all located elsewhere, part of the historical exhibition, predominantly digital, and, as such, the materiality of the brick stands out in stark contrast to the overwhelmingly somber, commemorative, and deeply personal Foundation Hall displays. Where the integration of digital and tangible elements elsewhere in the museum provides a way for visitors to continually reflect and engage in their movement through various exhibits, here, it is jarring. The brick, one of only a few materials not originally excavated from the site, interrupts the careful and thoughtful flow of a visitor experience that is otherwise meticulously orchestrated. Moreover, the brick, in its location and in its similarity to other artifacts in the museum, surpasses its own materiality and even exceeds the possibility of its digitization.Rendered spectral in its representation of death and role as a signifier for retributive justice, the brick also calls up significant and likely unintentional similarities that are particularly compelling in a museum narrative that seeks to establish a common identity among visitors that is easily distinguishable from 9/11 perpetrators. The museum presumes that the brick comes to stand for a difference with which no visitor will identify. The brick can only arrive at the museum as an other/hostile who is invited into the space conditionally and only in its capacity to stand as a marker of murderous and irredeemable difference. What is the museum asking of us who visit then? To align ourselves as victims and unite in grief, memorialization, and, ultimately, victory? Indeed, the circumstances and commentary surrounding this particular brick--one of thousands to fall from the compound--present it as a historical artifact but also as a spoil of war. Part of the brick's curious placement is due to its value as a testament to vengeance and revenge; it is an enduring reminder of the combined efforts of the CIA and the SEAL team and a symbol of justice served. In this way, the brick breaks from the narrative of memorialization and resembles, much more closely, the rhetoric of revenge and retribution that characterized so many of the cultural responses to Bin Laden's death.7 By doing this, the symbolism of the brick inadvertently links the museum with a project of revenge, even if this is not its expressed purpose, and suggests that the attacks need to be not only remembered but also perpetually avenged. What is also significant are the ways in which the brick's placement and context draw attention to a revenge that can only be enacted through violent means. Bin Laden's death is represented here not in the form of an obituary, a birth and death date, or images of his burial; rather, it is represented as a death that was specifically carried out as a targeted killing and in direct retaliation for the 9/11 attacks. The disruption between the carefully crafted memorial narrative and the visual reminder of a black ops assassination is likely not intended to elicit a sense of contradiction in the visitor, yet the brick ruptures the dominant narrative of events and gestures toward another set of unintended consequences.Indeed, the brick is most certainly a symbol of revenge but it is not contained by that symbolism either. In other words, it is much more than the revenge that it signifies, and more than the narrative made possible through its final display location. Moreover, it is its jarring integration into Foundation Hall that raises significant questions about what it means to open one's home, memory, or self-hospitably to the other. What, for example, are the implications of accepting an artifact as a symbol of difference, yet one that whose materiality is painstakingly well kept? For instance, before the arrival of the museum visitor; before the integration of written context, audio commentary, and glass casing; and prior to being set alongside a Navy SEAL uniform, a brick arrives at the gate of the crypt. Like all artifacts arriving at the museum, it is treated carefully, possibly handled with gloves so as not to disturb its fragile state of decomposition. At once an object of abjection, slated for demolition, and one of celebration, this artifact is meticulously preserved, even protected. It is an oddly generous, we might even say hospitable, welcoming of an artifact that was intended for destruction and carelessly chiseled with little regard for its conservation. Stripped of context and down to its irreducible singularity, then, the brick announces something besides its affiliation with terrorism--something else entirely--that may not eliminate but certainly exposes the conditional hospitality leveled upon it. Furthermore, it calls on visitors to recognize the scene by which they will be interpellated, and that has already been determined, calling into question Foundation Hall's emphasis on a shared narrative of events, and, more crucially, a shared vulnerability to attack. The display attempts to assuage difference by asking visitors to participate in a collective identity that is not directly victimized but closely and somewhat arbitrarily (and historically8) aligned, yet simultaneously preserves the difference of the brick.A TALE OF BRICK AND BEDROCKAt first glance, it appears like any other brick, although lighter in color than a traditional red brick. Its edges are not perfectly squared and the color of the natural rock from which it was excavated shows through. It is stamped with an indistinguishable imprint and several indented marks can be seen, perhaps from the destruction of the compound or from the chisel used to separate it from other bricks. On its own, it appears innocuous and unthreatening. Importantly, the brick is not from the top of the three-story compound but, rather, a piece of its fortified foundation.9 It operates as far more than evidence of a successful mission; it also inadvertently raises provocative questions--questions that cannot be contained by attempts to digitize the display--about the nature of remnant objects which function in often-unintended ways. What are the accidental effects, for example, of including an artifact that is also from a place of ruin--an item that, if positioned without its context, could easily be mistaken for a chiseled piece of bedrock from one of the towers? Indeed, the brick shares an eerie material affinity with the excavated support columns of the towers that are on display throughout the museum.Similar in color and composition, the "box column remnants" lie at intervals around both the North and South Tower excavations. As the anchors for the steel beams that supported the towers, these remnants have been cut in such a way that the grooves in the surface resemble the chisel marks on the Abbottabad brick. Moreover, much like the brick from Bin Laden's compound, the box column remnants are support structures, excavated from the foundation of the towers. They are, like the foundation bricks in Abbottabad, what anchored the towers in place and, just as the foundational bedrock at Ground Zero is not simply inanimate rock, neither is the brick. Both carry meaning far deeper than their physical composition and function, and it is their curious placement in such proximity that allows us to think about a hospitality to difference precisely through their similarities. There are compelling comparisons to be made between the brick and the tower bedrock. Both are stone, both are preserved for eternity (presumably), and yet both represent vulnerable buildings and bodies. Moreover, neither was intended to be excavated and put on display in this fashion, and the exhibition of geological material seems more appropriate for a natural history museum than a memorial one. Curiously then, in their similarities, the brick and the bedrock are both figures of difference; they are both out of place and not entirely at home in this space, even if part of the original structure.The placement of the brick in Foundation Hall could possibly stand as a reminder of by whom and how the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated. Significantly, it stands in juxtaposition to the digitalized historical displays that recount the rise of Al Qaeda. As a historical artifact, the brick might better serve as a point of victory and celebration as part of this historical narrative that dichotomizes the bravery of the SEAL team and resilience of counterterrorism intelligence against the threat of global terror. Yet, why is the brick remembered in Foundation Hall--in an area so invested in tribute? Incredibly, while many visitors can turn around and walk back through the Foundation Hall the way they came, it is also possible to walk from the display of the brick, around the perimeter of the North Tower back to the center passage between the two towers. There is only one possible route around this excavation area and, after the brick, the dedicated walkway follows the angles of the former tower (alongside box column remnants) around to the large art installation, Trying to Remember the Color of the Sky That Morning, by Spencer Finch,10 that obscures the on-site repository and medical office for the storage and identification of 9/11 human remains. There are, in short, no additional exhibits between the brick and the repository adding to the peculiar and unexpected positioning of the brick on the far side of Foundation Hall. The respository and the brick, in other words, are literally next to one another; they are neighbors in this space and they share it as most unlikely cryptfellows. The brick's location in Foundation Hall, rather than in the history of Al Qaeda and as a stranger alongside established victims, is so crucial, and, while it is surely not the intended function, the location of the brick positions it not as history to be told but as a trace to be remembered. It is, if both its original location and final resting place are any indication, foundational to the ways in which we come to think about ourselves in relation to strangers.Almost everything about the Abbottabad brick seems out of place; its resemblance to the excavated bedrock, ordination in regards to the repository wall, and its affiliation with perpetrator rather than victim in an exhibition hall (with this solitary exception) dedicated to meaningful tribute. The proximity between the brick and the remains of 9/11 victims, not to mention the resemblance between the brick and the bedrock, are particularly strange scenarios in a museum that seeks, on every occasion, to highlight the difference between victim and perpetrator. Yet, what would it mean to view these objects as visual impetus to think of the destruction of the towers and the victims who died there as similar to the destruction of Osama Bin Laden's compound and his death? Conversely, what can be made of this inadvertent, or perhaps careless, juxtaposition of artifacts within Foundation Hall that actually aims to prevent such an unthinkable equivalence and how do we think through this similarity in order to maintain a difference that does not level the ethical demands of each? It is possible to test the conventions, possibilities, and limits of hospitality without dissolving completely the difference between brick and bedrock. By some force of theoretical alchemy we might try to meld the two together; they would, by all material appearances, be indistinguishable and there is certainly something provocatively productive in thinking through a would-be object11 whose material remains are ambiguous. Yet, despite the important ethical questions raised by similitude--the ways in which they both represent a kind of structural and corporeal vulnerability, for instance--such questions need not detract from the singularity of each and their unique demands. If these objects appear similar, that must not eliminate their differences. To see both as representative of loss, in other words, is not to hold those losses in equity. Both are differentially complex. Indeed, the victims of the 9/11 attacks, whose remains are stored behind the repository wall, are unidentified yet easily mourned. Osama Bin Laden, on the contrary, is strategically located, forensically identified, and yet nearly impossible to mourn. Thus, the utility of thinking through difference lies not in rendering these artifacts, bodies, or losses equal but, rather, in leveraging a comparison--an effect produced by the ordering and display of the 9/11 Museum--in order to think through the complexities of hospitality more comprehensively and trace its prevalence more than its solution across a number of complicated terrains, including a terrain of spectrality that cannot be untethered from discussions of hospitality in remnant objects.HOSPITALITY AND THE GHOST OF TRAUMAS PASTTo travel beneath the surface of the memorial and into the literal crypt of 9/11 trauma is to discover that the memorial and museum are powerfully, intimately, and irrevocably concerned with the relationship between the digital and the material, both of which have effects that linger long after the visit and exceed the borders given to them. We might call these effects, which bend the tangible and digital into one another, spectral effects. To be sure, the museum is intensely preoccupied with matters of haunting and, more specifically, the figure of the ghost. The site is permeated by a sense of strangeness, not only in the more eerie or macabre rhetoric of a sacred burial ground but also in less obvious figures of dust, sacrament, invisibility, and virtuality. The site itself, as built into the ground in uncharacteristic contrast to the surrounding cityscape, plays on notions of what is visible and what is hidden and prompts queries into what lingers, or even perhaps haunts, below the surface of things. Beyond Giuliani's designation of Ground Zero as a "cemetery," one notorious example of how the entire space is rendered spectral is the "Tribute in Light" memorial which dominated the New York skyline from March 11 until April 13, 2002, to mark the 6-month anniversary of the attacks. Shooting powerful beams of light up from the tower's footprints and into the sky, this temporary memorial was referred to as the "Phantom Towers" and the two beams have been described by Julian LaVerdiere, one of the artists involved as "ghost limbs [that] we can feel ... even though they're not there anymore."12The ghost becomes such a crucial figure for hospitality then not only because it appears as an invited guest in the space and archive of the museum but also because hospitality is not based on invitation at all but on visitation. The museum can certainly limit its scope of invitation through a variety of practical and discursive practices, but it cannot limit the visitation(s) that the ambiguity of spectral objects make possible. It would seem that the most provocative figures of hospitality are the ones that show up despite the attempts to banish them, to render them invisible, or contain them within entirely digital or material frameworks. These ghosts return as virtual specters or trace phantoms in remnant objects such as bricks and are never fully exorcised in order to pose serious questions about how we encounter strangers after 9/11. If hospitality is concerned especially with what or who does not belong, then the museum and memorial provide ample evidence of things "out of place": obscene images of falling bodies, eerie artifacts, human remains, disembodied objects and voices, and the faces of the perpetrators. These are the revenants of the museum--the things that are not invited into the official narratives of memorialization but that "come back precisely because [they] have been buried or concealed" much like memory.13 Thus, in their deconstructive efforts, these artifacts become both the invited and uninvited guests in the process of making and unmaking meaning. As spectral figures demonstrative of the impossibility of absolute ideological suppression, they deconstruct the very processes that seek to annihilate them. In short, they challenge what we know and understand about the world, whether they are summoned or not.At stake in the welcoming (back) of uninvited ghosts to the World Trade Center site is the possibility that such ghosts arrive not only to teach us something about hospitality but also to demand that we exercise such hospitality before we know what the consequences might be and regardless of where we might be. And like the ghost, the Abbottabad brick becomes the unannounced, unexpected, and uninvited stranger par excellence who defies all attempts to render it familiar or predict its arrival. Derrida defines this arrival of the stranger as[a]waiting without horizon of the wait, awaiting what one does not expect yet or any longer, hospitality without reserve, welcoming salutation accorded in advance to the absolute surprise of the arrivant from whom or from which one will not ask anything in return and who or which will not be asked to commit to the domestic contracts of any welcoming power.14Derrida's definition is even more apt when reading the presence of a brick at the memorial and museum site, as a specter who not only comes uninvited but arrives before the notion of awaiting such an arrival ever enters the imagination. It is a ghost that is always waiting, existing perpetually on a threshold between here and there, life and death. Indeed, the brick forces us to confront important questions, among them: is the ghost a welcome guest, a hostile threat, or perhaps both? Indeed, in addition to challenging the borders of what we know or expect, the brick also confronts questions of being and reality that are integral to a deeper understanding of (and intervention in) post-9/11 culture. The spectrality of remnant objects is crucial to working through these questions. Moreover, these are questions that only increase in consequence as we move further away from September 11, 2001, the date, and toward a notion of 9/11 as a defining cultural milieu--one whose meaning reverberates and recurs endlessly. As a moment, the event shapes and haunts the present, even (and especially) as the completion of the museum and official missions of the "War on Terror" have been scaled back yet at the same time renewed, especially in Iraq and Syria, with a different yet familiar enemy. The deeply material yet simultaneously ghostly figure of the brick reminds us that this past is not dissociated from even the more philosophical questions about others and strangers. The ghosts can teach us about how we respond to and read the culture of 9/11, and it is something intimately and provocatively invested in relations of hospitality.The September 11 Memorial and Museum is a compelling text through which to think through remnant objects and artifacts "out of place" in order to conceptualize the significance of hospitality for how the event of 9/11 and its aftermath are remembered, commemorated, and taught. Yet, the brick and other "ghostly" objects do more than pose critical questions about politics and culture; they are also decidedly ethical figures--signs of alterity that makes significant demands. Despite the attempt to exorcise ghosts from the memorial site or, at the very least, force them to conform to acceptable positions as harbingers or protectors of nationalist culture and ideology, the ghost is a figure that resists such containment and, if accepted under conditions of absolute hospitality, can teach us much about how we encounter strangers and strangeness in a post-9/11 world. Moreover, such ghosts return to teach us something about the past, a past we may not be familiar with and thus demands an openness to the kinds of memories that ghosts may bring along that challenge not only the enduring and decidedly exceptional narrative of 9/11 but also other global instances of violence and inequity as well. Perhaps, it is the ghost that opens this gate for us and interrogates our openness to alternative histories, living and dead, elided in the service of a narrative of 9/11 memorialization that, however official, remains incomplete. Indeed, as Avery Gordon argues, "the ghost cannot be simply tracked back to an individual loss or trauma. The ghost has its own desires."15 Gordon's recognition is crucial in the context of memorialization and the individualization of diverse desires for the museum and memorial. We must ask of our memorials, in other words, what the ghosts--guests or hostiles, tangible or digital--might want and offer a hospitality to history that accounts for those omissions.The September 11 Memorial and Museum, through its conjuring of some ghosts and exorcism of others, reveals not only the complexity but also the absolute necessity of hospitality toward what is most odd about commemorating trauma. Ultimately, it is the strange artifacts such as the Abbottabad brick that reveal that the event of 9/11 is not in any rigorous sense finished. The contradictory placement of artifacts at Ground Zero pose ethical as well as ontological questions about how we mourn a traumatic event and what that mourning might mean in terms of how we incorporate or disavow remnants, or revenants, be they the return or residue of memory, artifacts, or the living dead that are buried in the crypt-like foundations of the museum and aspirated as dust into the lungs of New Yorkers. While its initial associations may be of hearth and home, hospitality is always, first and foremost, a haunting--and it is a haunting brought on by mourning which makes the processes of memorialization at Ground Zero an ideal site upon which to practice an ethic of unconditional welcome to whomever, whatever (ghosts, guests, bricks or bedrock, strangers or hostiles, digitalized or materialized) might turn up, for even in that extreme risk there is something to be learned that transcends the scene of the museum and makes tangible the possibilities of hospitality across the complex topographies of social and cultural life after 9/11. As Jodey Castricano elaborates, "[t]o learn to live with ghosts is to rethink ourselves through the dead or, rather, through the return of the dead (in us) and thus through haunting."16 This living with, as a kind of living through and for, is not about tolerance, nor is it about charity. It is not about welcoming the stranger in, as a kind of benevolent extension of the privilege of the host but, rather, about an unreserved welcome to a figure from whom we require nothing but who nonetheless comes with much to offer.Notes1.

The New York Post employed this discourse emphatically on its front page with a bold "GOT HIM" in block letters and beneath that: "Vengeance at last! US nails the bastard." Newsweek used a white and red image of Bin Laden with the title "Mission Accomplished" for its May 16, 2011 cover, and the Seattle weekly magazine The Stranger highlighted the old adage of "an eye for an eye" in the week of May 4-10, 2011, by depicting Bin Laden much like a black and white tower against the blue backdrop of the sky, a lone bullet approaching from his left side bearing resemblance to an airplane flying much too low. Even President Barack Obama employed the language of revenge when, on television and announcing Bin Laden death to the world, he proclaimed "Justice has been done" (quoted in Macon Phillips, "Osama Bin Laden Dead," The White House Blog, May 2, 2011).8. There is precedent for this type of memorialization as a shared or vicarious victimization. Indeed, it echoes a refrain of historical suffering that is not experienced in vain alongside the promise to "never forget"--a phrase saved for the very worst of collective traumas, including the Holocaust and Pearl Harbor. In the case of 9/11, such calls to remembrance not only risk reinforcing rhetoric of American exceptionalism but they also initiate a dominant American public into a shared sense of present (vis-à-vis historical-traumatic) collective identity.9.

Finch's piece is created from 2,983 hand painted sheets of Italian paper--the number of total victims from the 1993 and 2001 attacks. Visitors take in the sheer volume of the installation, the poignancy of the Virgil quote incorporated into its design-- "No day shall erase you from the memory of time" --and the diversity of cool tones that represent the imagination of New Yorkers looking at the sky that September morning. Meant to represent the lives lost on 9/11, these individual panels of paper offer a symbolic gesture toward the museum site as a final resting place. What is not immediately obvious (and, for some, never known) is what is behind the wall: an actual crypt that houses the dead. Stored since 2001 in a Manhattan medical examiner's office, the as-yet unidentified human remains of 9/11 victims were transferred on May 10, 2014, in a ceremonial procession to the 9/11 Museum--their "final resting place."11. This possibility is not simply imaginative as the museum does contain an object precisely of this sort. Part of the historical exhibition includes a large section of the former towers known simply as "the composite." The composite is a 15-ton section of compressed granite, steel, and other material which fused together during the collapse of the buildings. Scientific analysis has proven that there are no biological remains present in the composite, yet while no human DNA has been found in the composite, officials do admit that comprehensive testing is difficult. It is, after all, composed of four or five floors and includes pieces of paper with discernable human writing that, despite the lack of official DNA, offer "trace" remains of human contact and industry.12.

Westmoreland*Institute of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology, Leiden University, Leiden, The NetherlandsAbstractMade in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, Inti Mabsoota? is an experimental pedagogical video project that draws upon the emerging mobile esthetics of cell phone filmmaking and public encounters with revolutionary spontaneity. Inspired by the landmark cinéma-vérité film, Chronique d'un été (1960), in which participants ask people on the streets of Paris if they are happy, several of my students at the American University in Cairo became mobile film units, asking people the same innocuous question, "Inta mabsoot?/Inti mabsoota?"--Are you happy? Are you content? This seemingly benign exercise belies a variety of conceptual and methodological frictions, which offered productive pedagogical possibilities. Drawing upon the emergent revolutionary visual culture, this student project complicated both the reductive assessments of the "Arab Spring" as a manifestation of digital democracy and the heavy-handed way that western journalism has tended to address the "Arab Street" as a volatile mob. Using an embodied visual approach allowed students to apprehend modes of lived experience that might not register as political in more normative models, but which nonetheless form the basis of how people live and experience political life. Highlighting the non-representational aspects of the encounter also foregrounds the corporeal and visceral dimensions of the students' experience. Accordingly, the critical video methods employed elucidate the kinds of affective knowledge produced for those on screen, behind the camera, and viewing from a distance.28253_UF0001.jpgMark R.

The fear of cameras had disappeared completely and they were now the instrument to learn what was going on .... Even if a lot of this footage will remain unseen, it was the source of understanding--of our condition, of our life, of what we want and of who we are.--Narrator in CROP (2013, 49 m, dirs. Marouan Omara and Johanna Domke)1Such acts of image-making reveal important generative dimensions of visuality available during revolutionary flux. Rather than passively documenting the conditions of political upheaval, ordinary citizens armed with perhaps nothing more than a simple camera-phone harnessed the mobility and ubiquity of these devices to produce new forms of political agency. Images of mass protests that arose in Tunisia in December 2010 and then Egypt in January 2011 ricocheted across the region with unexpected scenes of street politics, seemingly deflating lumbering state behemoths and shocking viewers around the globe with unprecedented possibilities for political change. In Cairo, the occupation of urban space not only shook President Hosni Mubarak from office but also enabled Cairenes to reclaim the city.2 While the ultimate political outcome of the uprisings was (and perhaps still is) uncertain, Samia Mehrez argues that the "newfound power of ownership of one's space, one's body, and one's language is, in and of itself, a revolution."3 Perhaps, following the epigraph above, Egyptians also claimed a new sense of ownership of their image.At the outset of these uprisings, thousands, if not millions, utilized the proliferation of cell phone cameras to record these political events and then perhaps upload and share them. The ubiquitous presence of these mobile cameras also indicated an emergent vernacular esthetics of cell phone filmmaking, in which the embodiment of the spectator shifted from the eye to the end of an arm, indicative of watching a screen or choosing to record without watching.4 Along with the ubiquity of cell phone cameras and the emergence of mobile aesthetics, the mass protests "triggered a new visual culture."5 In this state of revolutionary flux, new understandings of public culture took shape, in which the street offered new and different kinds of encounters. Tahrir Square "became the spot to film and to be filmed, as well as being a space to see others and to be seen."6These examples also demonstrate how the experiences of this period were profoundly felt on visceral, physical, and affective levels. These inchoate affective states "can shake people out of deeply grooved patterns of thinking and feeling and allow for new imaginings."7 Indeed, revolutionary political processes do not principally take shape on the discursive level, but become enacted through the body. The enactment of revolutionary politics requires bodies assembling in mass, sharing moments of collective action, and reaching states of hopeful excitement, not to mention suffering physical harm and sorrow. Occupying the streets day in and day out radically shifts one's spatial and temporal experience.As Egyptians (and foreigners) negotiated their newfound image rights, they had to contend with the highly charged nature of this new visuality, which could either enact public ownership of the city or may provoke suspicion if not hostility. While these events offered an expanded latitude of visual agency, the public production of images requires operating on multiple registers. For instance, graffiti artists, who helped situate visual practices within an emergent field of urban public culture during the revolution, had to constantly negotiate space and confront hostilities to sustain these possibilities. Indeed, the widespread depiction of an eyepatch became a prominent symbol against the practice of eye snipers intentionally blinding protestors, thus enacting a critique of the brutal measures taken against acts of witnessing. Under these circumstances, filming on the streets of Cairo became inherently political.While the iconography of the region had suddenly (if momentarily) shifted from more entrenched scenes of conflicts between belligerents, these seemingly supple images of civil politics may have too quickly become brittle and shattered under the reassertion of regimental power. After two and a half years in revolutionary flux, the military definitively reclaimed political power and reasserted control over the public visual culture. So as the ubiquitous mobile figure bearing a digital camera (phone) opened new possibilities for enacting public political subjectivity, so too have the evolving political circumstances presented frictional conditions that necessitate adjusting the forms and practices that these encounters take.In this context, I initiated a class project intent on critically assessing the dominant representational frameworks used to understand the experience of political change and thus explore a series of related questions. How does the fluidity and friction of this evolving visual culture help us understand the way people live and experience day-to-day political realities? How might social inquiries utilize the camera to enact compelling and committed accounts of political experience? And how might such public encounters convey this experience on unconventional and unanticipated registers than those usually assigned to political discourse? And yet, when the street is no longer a site of generative possibilities, how might this emergent visual culture find alternative sites for creativity? As such, under the rubric of "thinking with a camera during revolutionary times," this pedagogical intervention aimed to position students as active producers of representational knowledge within the still unfolding Arab Uprisings by engaging in visually based research practices.THINKING WITH A CAMERA DURING REVOLUTIONARY TIMESAs a visual anthropologist based at the American University in Cairo (AUC) between 2008 and 2013, my intellectual agenda became tightly enveloped within the everyday realities of a protracted political revolution. Wrestling with the generativity and restrictivity of image practices in this moment, I aspired to teach my students to both critically think about the flood of images circulating in revolutionary Egypt and engage with a visual methodology attuned to these volatile dynamics. Committed to a project on the production of alternative visualities in the contemporary Middle East and how local image practices mediate emergent cultural imaginaries, subvert the geopolitical gaze, and envision the region anew, I began to prepare an MA seminar around a beguilingly simple question: How to do visual anthropology at this moment in Egypt?The answer to this question is far from self-evident and could not be arrived at only conceptually. As the now ubiquitous mobile camera claimed new potentiality for public modes of witnessing and political participation, I knew that students should embody the methodological possibilities that this historic precedent afforded by publicly engaging people on the streets with a modest video camera.8 Due to the perpetually shifting image politics during these tumultuous times, my pedagogical objectives required an experimental approach to doing ethnography with a camera. Even under the most stable circumstances, Sarah Pink warns, "It is impossible to predict, and mistaken to prescribe, precise methods for ethnographic research,"9 but uncertain times also demand uncertain methods, open to discovering unclaimed feelings and sensitive to the affective intensity of instability. This does not mean proceeding blindly. Indeed, this required attunement to the shifting tensions that inform the local visual culture oscillating between moments of generative exception and the recurrent reification of entrenched norms. As such, Pink also heeds deploying appropriate visual methods based on the conventions of local visual cultural and "an ethnographic appreciation of how visual knowledge is interpreted in a cross-cultural context."10As nearly everyone had become enraptured by the processes of political change, so too had most of my MA students at AUC begun to do research on some aspect of the revolution in Egypt. Preparing them for doing ethnographic research with visual tools meant pragmatically addressing the particular but shifting set of challenges that this socio-political situation included, while also inspiring them to see the promise of such a venture. While drawing upon the long traditions of ethnographic and documentary cinema regarding issues of representation, authorship, and reflexivity, I had students also engage recent critical ideas about the relationship between esthetics and politics in non-fiction video.11 We critically assessed the recent proliferation of visual (and sensory) techniques in both social science research and human rights/activists agendas.12 And thus by questioning the underlying assumptions about the efficacy of visual methods, this course aimed to develop a refined epistemological toolkit able to critically traverse the production and consumption of images circulating in politically volatile times. As such, the course intentionally brought together materials and discourses from a variety of sources that would help students think through issues of visuality at this moment in Egypt.This meant understanding and situating ourselves within an emergent political economy. While the "Arab Spring" had seemed to become a commercial event sponsored by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, a revolutionary industry quickly followed in which "the revolution" was being (re)produced for different markets. It seemed that everyone was clambering to get a piece of the gold rush. Academics, filmmakers, and journalists, among others, would parachute in for an adventure tour, while often bypassing the local perspectives most encumbered by the political events. For a visual anthropology of contemporary Egypt, this meant trying to remain true to the more spontaneous acts of self-expression, while also attune to the renewed investment in political visibility, the proliferation of new visual approaches, and the integration of amateur documentarians as key agents of the mass political spectacle.13Thinking about how to do visual anthropology in Egypt also meant addressing a serious prohibitive dimension of public image-making. In a context in which filmmakers and photographers commonly face aggressive challenges from bystanders, if not authorities, would require preparing students to negotiate the public policing of images that typically accused documentarians for showing the "negative side of Egypt."14 While the enactment of mobile filming would resonate with the politics of mass street protests, the revolution was nevertheless a highly contentious event. Although the role of cameras during the uprisings had made public image-making more common, the xenophobic discourse about infiltrators intending to "destroy Egypt" ensured that filmmaking on the streets would remain a highly charged and suspicious act.In other words, to put these ideas into practice meant both actively engaging in the emergent potentialities and responding to the recurrent swath of challenges. Thus, by choosing to enter into this hyper-mediated fold intent to produce yet more images required solid methodological and theoretical grounding. This meant negotiating the tension between the important dynamics of "street politics" for the success of these mass uprisings15 and the heavy-handed way that western journalism has tended to address the so-called Arab Street as "the worst kind of barbarous urban mob, threatening local and global orders ..."16 While critical of biased approaches, our aim would not be based on critiques of mainstream media coverage. And while inspired by citizen journalism, a visual anthropology of contemporary Egypt would not be satisfied with passively documenting visible evidence. Furthermore, we had to avoid engaging subjects with predetermined frameworks, such as interview questions about social protests, political parties, national sentiments, and so on. Instead, I aimed to shift attention to more open-ended interactions that would engage people in more speculative approaches and ideally reveal an emergent political subjectivity embedded within mundane personal experience--that is, the affective registers of the everyday--which often becomes obscured by more didactic approaches. By fostering both generative and provocative encounters, I followed David MacDougall's ambition to provoke new forms of knowledge in the act of producing a film by "creating the circumstances in which new knowledge can take us by surprise."17So, in effect, my course on "Thinking with a Camera during Revolutionary Times" initiated an experimental pedagogical video project intent to reconceptualize a framework supple enough for doing visual anthropology at that moment in Egypt.18 In order to both capture the potential of the political moment and navigate these thorny issues of political representation an innovative approach would have to be taken. Drawing upon the emerging mobile esthetics of cell phone filmmaking and public encounters with revolutionary spontaneity, the project aimed to show students that the use of visual ethnography would provide them with ways to think critically about images of social unrest, offer them new perspectives on the experience of political change occurring on the human scale, and resituate the production of knowledge in the ethnographic encounter itself.Drawing upon the canons of documentary studies and visual anthropology alike, I appropriated the work of Jean Rouch for inspiration. The landmark cinéma-vérité film Chronique d'un été/Chronicle of a Summer (Jean Rouch & Edgar Morin, 1961) provided a solution to the dilemmas outlined above. In other words, by responding to both the technological development of 16-mm sync sound filmmaking and the political burden of the French colonial wars, Chronique d'un été similarly suggested an answer on how to do visual anthropology at that moment in France. The collaboration between Rouch and Morin also provided an experimental approach to doing ethnographic research. By engaging in spontaneous interactions and employing open-ended provocations, they thus distanced themselves from more didactic approaches. But given the significant difference between the two contexts, I had no intention of doing a remake of Chronique d'un été. Instead, inspired by the opening scene, in which participants ask people on the streets of Paris if they are happy, my students in Cairo similarly solicited a spontaneous response from people to a single question, Inta Mabsoot?/Inti Mabsoota?--Are you happy?AREN'T YOU HAPPY?The vox populi interviews conducted by my students captured spontaneous responses and gave fresh perspective to the different moods and opinions among participants in this post-revolutionary moment (fall 2012). The uncertainty and frustration of political turmoil weighed on Cairenes in idiosyncratic ways from the lack of work and money reiterated by street vendors to the more bourgeois interests in wealth, good food, and romantic relationships. The emotional intimacy of the question and the public anonymity of the context produced a generative juxtaposition. This dialectic quality of the encounter helps to disrupt assumptions of passively collecting data about "happiness." While collecting responses in Cairo's different districts revealed distinct differences in people's concerns, the corporeal and visceral aspects of these sensibilities also elucidate the uneven experience of the revolution on an affective register. As one student commented:While we were watching other classmates projects, it was striking to see how different geographical areas even within greater Cairo reflected different views on happiness and misery. People in Zamalek, an upper-class neighborhood, tended to be happier and more willing to attribute their emotional status to personal reasons. On the other hand, street vendors in local areas were relating their unhappiness to the country's shaky economic and political status. In our project, the presence of the revolution was strong due to the proximity of Tahrir Square and most people expressed their feelings toward the revolution's success or failure.19Video 1.

Geographies of class. Saad Zaghloul: http://www.aestheticsandculture.net/public/journals/7/multimedia/Video 2-Saad Zaghloul.mov.This seemingly benign exercise of asking Inti mabsoota? belies a variety of conceptual and methodological frictions that have rubbed people the wrong way. On almost every occasion that I have presented this work, someone takes issue with the question. Most often this is expressed as a matter of translational precision, never mind that this is already a cross-cultural translation from the French "êtes-vous heureux?" Indeed, strictly speaking, mabsoot is better translated as "satisfied" or "content." And while Inti mabsoota? is used idiomatically like, "how are you?," this phrasing was developed in collaboration with the native speakers of Arabic in the project.The next most common critique suggests that we have not asked the "right question." Baring the assumptions about the inauthenticity of the translated question, there may be other ways to consider the potential inappropriateness of Inti mabsoota? For instance, despite the success of ousting President Hosni Mubarak from office, for many the optimism from those initial days had begun to wane by the time of our project.20 This meant that the project had a clearly ironic strategy at its core. While humor could offer a subversive aspect to these interviews, for others the absurdity of the question could be offensive. Consider these two initial reflections from students:I am already starting to find an absurdity in the project. We did not feel as though we could actually ask someone in earnest if they were happy in the middle of what would become weeks of clashes in the square and later in front of the Presidential Palace.21I grew mixed feelings towards the project. It was paradoxical experience asking people about happiness and there are injured and dead people and raped women meters ways.22These responses not only reflect the initial ambivalence of some of the students but also suggest that a more politically direct question may be deemed appropriate for engaging these confused and saddened Cairenes.23 While this project was inspired by Chronique d'un été, I also showed my students an important rejoinder to this film made only one year later. Like Chronique d'un été, Chris Marker and Pierre Lhomme's Le Joli Mai is also a "portrait of everyday Paris" and Marker suggested that he was also interested in the issue of happiness.24 But, in the hands of Chris Marker, the "seemingly innocent 'Are you happy?' implies the silent and subversive accusation, 'How can you possibly be happy?'" 25Asking this question--"How can you possibly be happy?"--would surely have produced more confrontational responses, but I would argue in spite of the prompt that neither Chronique d'un été nor Inti mabsoota? were necessarily about happiness. Instead, this project, like Chronique d'un été, envisioned the juxtaposition between the public anonymity of the street with the superficial intimacy of a presumptuous question as the primary crux of the experiment. In other words, rather than assessing happiness on a psychological level, the project operationalized the concept within the tenuous but mundane political climate of a protracted revolution in order to enact affective responses in the ethnographic encounter by both interviewees and interviewers as well as others present at the time. As indicated above, the affective particularities of these responses often revealed more about the context than the individual's emotional state.With these critiques noted, I argue that it is precisely within the context of these challenges that pedagogical possibilities emerge from the affective intensity of these mediated encounters.26 Indeed, the ambivalence about the question reflects a deeper tension between representational and non-representational aspects of the project. If taken as a representational project, then a viewer privileges the subjects in front of the camera being interviewed and the kinds of things they say in response to the question. As such, this model literally foregrounds the speech act--both the question asked and the answers offered--and the particularities of the responses invariably come to represent a generalizable Egyptian mood. This reflects a hermeneutic short circuit that privileges language over other sensory registers as if a transcript of the verbal exchange would suffice.Furthermore, while nearly everyone initially responded to the question with, alhamdullilaah ("thanks to God"), the religiosity of this phrase belies its mundane ubiquity. As with many idiomatic phrases in Egyptian Arabic borrowed from the Quran, "[s]o much are these phrases a part of the language that one need not be a believer nor even a Muslim necessarily in order to use at least some of them."27 Whereas religion became expressed on different registers from one's comportment to one's convictions about President Morsi, people's initial perfunctory response to the interview prompt indicates instead how the question seemed unremarkable. People were unaccustomed to giving this question much significance, but the context disrupts this expectation. As reflected in the following student reflections, its unassuming qualities meant that the meaning of the question is something that often times had to be negotiated in the moment--"What do you mean by mabsoot?"In the beginning of the conversation where both researcher and interviewee are trying to reach a common understanding for the question.28This topic of happiness is something that we might mention every day and think about but rarely does one stop and talk about it and need to really think through what such a concept means. I felt like the reactions to the questions were very interesting.29As such, if we instead consider the non-representational aspects of the project, then "the question is really beside the point," as one of my students exclaimed to me.30 Another student echoed this sentiment and expanded, "it was more a matter of where that question was taking us; what are the doors that are being opened through it."31 Indeed, the encounter presented a generative opportunity for many participants with an audiovisual amanuensis, in which the camera afforded them the chance to address an unknown public.32 While invariably bound to a lexical encounter, a non-representational framework nonetheless opens itself to the students behind the camera as well as those off-screen. The visual brings a great deal of experiential knowledge to the situation, from facial expressions, gestures, interpersonal reactions, stirrings in the background, personal dress, forms of comportment, one's relationship to the street, but also one's relation to the camera and to the interviewers. By locating the production of knowledge through corporeal processes of looking and being rather than discursively communicating it in thoughts and descriptions,33 students tested an embodied visual approach in order to apprehend modes of lived experience that might not register as political in more normative models, but which nonetheless form the basis of how people live and experience political life.So rather than gathering survey data to be crunched, the question provoked an encounter capable of taking us by surprise. The prompt got students talking to people on the street, who they may otherwise never meet, about how they relate to the political situation in the country without presupposing a political stance. If we thus emphasize the encounter that the question provides, then the question itself opens up to more dynamic readings. But this also revealed an unnerving, if not violent, dimension of being encountered with this question, as evoked by this student response:Some of those who refused offered justifications or alternatives. During our second day of filming, an antique shop owner insisted to give a reason for his refusal to be interviewed saying he is an old man with a short nerve that hardly enables him going through the day and he cannot be subjected to any emotional imbalance the interview could put him through. 34As students of the AUC, they were invariably marked as privileged citizens. According to our informed consent protocol, students had to identify themselves and their research intent before recording peoples' replies. Not only did this situate the students in very particular ways with the participants, it subverted the spontaneous punch of the question. And yet, the presence of young, cosmopolitan, and mostly female university students on the streets of Cairo with camera phones, if not DSLRs, and audio recorders, would not immediately be read within a research context. Given the ubiquity of journalists since the uprisings began, they would more likely be read in this capacity. While generally considered innocuous, particularly given the more open status of visual culture, xenophobic rhetoric meant that the possible threat of public policing of image-making always lurked in every encounter. While uncommon during our project, this issue did manifest itself for some students.The hostility mostly came from upper middle class individuals who were highly suspicious of our identity and insistent that we're filming the negative aspects of Egypt to cause more trouble and mutate Egypt's image abroad. This reflects significantly the kinds of concerns that are projected by the national media .... The systematic vilifying of any one with a camera, who might show us things we don't want to see. Having a camera instantly put us in a political position and attracted judgmental responses.35Furthermore, the impact of these encounters also deeply affected the students. While the students who initially felt ambivalent changed their perspectives through the project, some students spoke of profoundly haunting experiences and the violent dimensions of confronting strangers with personal questions."Turning back the anthropological gaze" was manifested through the fact that many of them turned back the question to me after I finish filming them. Each time I was asked back the question, I was not prepared and it frightened me. But, this worked as a good reminder of the violence in asking the question and that made me more attentive to what people share and appreciating that they share the same feelings.36Video 3. The ethnographic encounter: http://www.aestheticsandculture.net/public/journals/7/multimedia/Video 3-ethnographic encounter.mov.And while some students initially felt that this exercise would not benefit the people interviewed, several noted the mutually transformative potential. Suggesting that the encounter offered people an opportunity to break from their daily routine, one student said, "the street feels different to me so maybe it felt different to this man."37 Several others mentioned the way people thrived on the opportunity, perhaps out of loneliness or more particularly "as if we had come down from the skies and were her therapy."38 For one student, the camera-mediated encounters produced a heightened sensitivity and she has become more hesitant about filming and photographing people in public.While the non-representational notion of encounter helps to situate the street as a space of ethnographic engagement, the role of the camera and microphone (audio recorder) helps to push this into the more generative domain of enactment. Although the project does not aspire to re-enacting Chronique d'un été in a conventional sense, the creative appropriation of the opening scene reenacts the film's provocatory gesture. Despite the long-standing assumptions about the passive objectivity of photography, Scott McQuire reminds us that the agency of the camera actually ruptures realist paradigms.39 As such, the camera as the mediating agent in these encounters enacts the emergent visual-political paradigms as well as the recursive image politics. Rather than the fly-on-the-wall stance of Direct Cinema, Inti Mabsoota enacts Jean Rouch's methodological sensibilities that harness the camera's agential abilities to engender cinematic realizations. Whereas the technological innovations of 16-mm film cameras with sync sound in the 1960s helped produce the untethered esthetic qualities of cinéma-vérité in Chronique d'un été, the emerging mobile esthetics of cell phone filmmaking accentuate the technological particularities of the historic moment in this project. While avoiding a technologically deterministic explanation of the Arab Uprisings and acknowledging the various forms of grassroots face-to-face politics that foreground these events, the role of video in these encounters nevertheless echoes the way politics became enacted in relation to these communicative technologies.Following Peter Snowdon's argument that these videos advanced an "aesthetic revolution" based on the kind of politics anticipated by the Arab Uprisings,40 we could say that the notion of "thinking with a camera during revolutionary times" also aimed to become attune to both the political possibilities nestled within the emergent image-making practices of the region and their concomitant frictions. In the context of mentoring students in the embodied methodologies of visual anthropology, this meant aligning our understanding of the way the camera lens radically situates the body of the filmmaker in relation to the ethnographic encounter41 alongside the body genre of "political mimesis" in which acts of filmmaking during street protests and subsequent viewings evoke feelings of sensuous politics.42 And yet, despite the playful enactment of Rouch's camera gesture, as the political dynamics shifted in Egypt, so did the visual possibilities for public provocations.REVOLUTIONARY ENACTMENT WITH A CAMERA DURING COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TIMESDuring the following year (2013), discontentment with President Mohamed Morsi's heavy-handed favoritism for Islamist interests, on the one hand, and a pervasive rhetoric for "stability" in the country, on the other, led to both his removal by the military junta and a ruthless criminalization of his Muslim Brotherhood followers. More significantly, the incredibly violent coup and mass suppression of dissent radically altered the context that had enabled the vibrant urban public culture. With a divided opposition, this renewed authoritarian brutality also allowed the regime to reestablish a prohibition over public image-making. In November 2013, some of the students and I discussed heading back out to the streets to ask the same question one year later and possibly finding some of the same individuals to reflect on their earlier responses in relation to the current situation, but with the increasing criminalization of protestors and journalists the risks seemed too high and I called off the plan.43In order to answer the question about how to do visual anthropology at this moment in Egypt meant recognizing that the moment had changed. Despite the instability of the revolutionary period, the revolutionary flux had afforded a great deal of creative agency. The generative potentiality made vibrantly possible from January 25, 2011 ostensibly ending on June 30, 2013, at least for re-enacting the mobile esthetics of revolutionary cell phone filmmaking. In spite of the bloodshed, instability, and power-grabs of this era, perhaps we had taken for granted the opportunities that this revolutionary visual culture had provided. Whereas the visual became part of a collective promise, this oath had now become criminalized as a lie for some and as lost hope for others. Instead of repeating this vox populi exercise that would likely produce predictable results, the situation called for yet a different tactic.As the experience behind the camera had proven just as significant as that in front of it (as evidenced in the students' reflections), I opted to interview students about their experiences with the project in order to highlight a dialogic or parallax dimension. I asked them to reflect on their encounters with random people on the street, the process of negotiating the meaning of mabsoot, and the perpetually shifting political/social landscape. In order to accentuate the friction between the claustrophobic circumstances of the present political moment and the central significance of the public space of the street, I created an esthetic device that could accommodate this tension--I filmed them indoors in a rooftop studio in front of a blue sheet that could be digitally replaced with street images in postproduction. With the sounds of the city in the background, I had them face the blank sheet and imagine themselves on the street. Turning toward the camera, I asked about their experience being a woman on the street doing this project and then prompted them with the question, Inti mabsoota? Here four of the women offer their reflections, some facing the imagined street and some with street images in the background.Video 4. Parallax perspectives from amidst the counter-revolutionary moment http://www.aestheticsandculture.net/public/journals/7/multimedia/Video 4-Parallax perspectives.mp4.While we could no longer deploy the camera publicly to enact an ethnographic encounter, this created an opportunity to draw upon the street's generative energy in radically different ways, which nevertheless evoked its affective potential looming just out of reach. Moving beyond notions of representational realism that characterized the project's public encounters with people on the street, the enactment of the street through this layered montage foregrounds the way esthetic and narrative devices transform actuality footage into compelling and committed accounts of political experience. While prompted by a series of reflective questions, it is the combination of camera, screen, and the digital effects that shift this exercise from producing representational knowledge to the enactment of affective knowledge. Perhaps, in a feeble way, the effort to do visual anthropology at that moment in Egypt both on and off the streets through the conceptual gesture of "thinking with a camera during revolutionary times" helped to elucidate the way images of rebellious actions cultivate new forms of political agency, subjectivity, and collectivity.44Notes1.

This endeavor started as a pilot project in Spring 2012 as I began to experiment with ways to engage the situation in Cairo with the toolkit of a visual anthropologist. I had approached three of my best undergraduate students (Mariam Abou Ghazi, Nada El-Kouny, and Sarah Hawas) about conducting short interviews with people on the streets of Cairo in order to ascertain how people would personally express themselves within the context of a heavy political backdrop. Based on the initial success of this pilot, I formalized this project in fall 2012 in an MA seminar on Visual Anthropology, taught to 15 MA students (In addition to Mariam and Nada from the pilot project, Brice Woodcock, Claire Forster, Dalia Ibrahim, Dana Alawneh, Derek Ludovici, Ewelina Trzpis, Manar Hazzaa, Mariz Kelada, Marwa Abed El Fattah, Nadia Dropkin, Noha Khattab, Nouran El-Hawary, and Omnia Khalil). The students formed seven groups of --two to three students and all but one included a native Arabic speaker. Collectively, they recorded over 5 hours of footage. During our final course meeting, I hosted a screening of sections of from all of these projects that generated a lively discussion. After the screening, the students submitted Reflection Essays about the project, which I draw heavily upon here.19. Dalia, Reflection Paper, December 2012.20. When preparing to do this project in my MA seminar, the mood had significantly shifted from the spring pilot project. And when we started filming interviews in late November 2012 at the time of the anniversary of the Mohamed Mahmoud Street clashes, political violence again escalated on the street and this was followed by protests at the presidential palace opposing President Mohamed Morsi's constitutional declarations. These events heavily impacted the mood of both my students and most of the interviewees.21. Derek, Reflection Paper, December 2012.22. Dalia, Reflection Paper, December 2012.23. Although not elaborated here, another critique suggested that modeling the project on Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's experiment imposes a colonial framework that undermines its credibility. Furthermore, as a course assignment designed by an American academic, there is an unavoidable dimension of pedagogical imposition. These tensions notwithstanding, many of the students have offered unsolicited endorsements of the project, often noting its participatory and collaborative dimensions.24.

At the end of the course, several of the students expressed interest in continuing the project and perhaps producing a film from the interviews. While some students planned to conduct more interviews, the cumbersome challenges of the political context and the general demands of personal obligations disrupted the flow of our project. I did manage to record a dinner discussion with some of the students modeled on the discussions in Chronique d'un été, in May 2013, but then I depart from Egypt in the summer of 2013 and could not actively facilitate participation. After revisiting several of the students in November 2013, I decided a new tactic was needed. During another visit in April 2014, I conducted these follow-up, "blue screen" interviews with six of the students and in August Claire Forster (one of the students) conducted an interview with another student. I am presently compiling all this footage into a stand-alone project.44. I'd like to acknowledge a variety of people who contributed to this project in either large or small measures. First, Mariam Abou Ghazi, Nada El-Kouny, and Sarah Hawas who agreed to pilot this project and who proved that the idea was viable. Among the students in the course, Claire Forster deserves special thanks for remaining dedicated to the project and working to continue it in my absence. Dalia Ibrahim, Mariz Kelada, Noha Khattab, Omnia Khalil, Manar Hazzaa, and Nouran El-Hawary also supported the project after the semester ended.

Pierre Bourdieu, the French sociologist, termed them allodoxic, in that they challenge the traditional academic way of thinking and doing. Results from two research projects, spanning over 5 years, employing a multitude of methods, have been used in this article. The results show that these challenging bridging attempts create conflictual cultures. First, faculties with different backgrounds are employed and they bring with them their respective habitus and doxa (Bourdieu), which is manifested in their different epistemologies, doxas. Despite a strong will to work interdisciplinarily, conflicts (destructive) arise particularly around epistemological and pedagogic issues. Second, I show that students at these schools have had double-perspective learning, through theoretical and practice-based methods, despite little help from their lecturers who have high ideals but little actual knowledge themselves of working in/through a double perspective. In many cases, through trial-and-error processes, students have appropriated embodied knowledge of a double perspective, which has given them surplus value when compared with learning through only traditional academic learning practices. It gives reflexive insights and understandings as well as transferrable skills highly useful in professional life. I finally argue that allodoxic conflictual cultures actually construct new ways of knowing through continuous discussions and meetings between faculties with different competences.29690_UF0001.jpgMargareta Melin, PhD, is a senior lecturer/associate professor in Media and Communication Studies at the School of Arts and Communication at Malmö University in Sweden, and is also a textile designer.

TI  - Cumulative impacts of stream burial on network structure and functional connectivity in headwater stream systems
AU  - Weitzell, Roy Everett, Jr.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Stream burial is common during urbanization, and disproportionately affects headwater streams. Burial undermines the physical, chemical, and spatial processes governing aquatic life, with consequences for water quality and biodiversity, both within headwaters and in downstream waters. Network changes associated with headwater burial have not been explored, limiting our understanding of changes in biotic composition with urbanization of these critical ecosystems. To address this need, I predicted stream burial across the Potomac River Basin (PRB) from impervious cover data and training observations from high-resolution aerial photography. Results across the PRB urban gradient reveal consistent burial patterns related to catchment area and topographic slope. I discuss these results in the context of physiographic constraints on stream location and urban development, including implications for management of aquatic resources. Second, I examined burial-related changes to headwater network structure and habitat connectivity, using a series of topological and distance measures, and a novel application of circuit-theoretical modeling to stream networks. Results show stream burial significantly affects both the number and size of remnant stream segments and their spatial orientation. Significant decreases in landscape connectivity were observed with burial, around ecologically important features such as confluences, and for urbanized headwater systems as a whole. Third, I used biological data to compare environmental and spatial controls on species turnover in fish and insect communities across headwater systems. Turnover was analyzed using generalized dissimilarity modeling, which accommodates variation in rates of species turnover along and between gradients, and two novel measures of resistance distance, which combine aspects of space and environment, specifically the spatial extent, orientation, and relative favorability of habitat across the landscape. Results show headwater species are more sensitive to environmental parameters, with less mobile species more sensitive to habitat fragmentation and required dispersal distances. Rapid compositional turnover occurred within short distances from the sampled reaches, suggesting headwater taxa disperse only short distances, with even small obstructions or habitat loss having potential to impact diversity within headwater systems. Knowledge gained from this research is critical for understanding the cumulative impact to stream networks, and for future decision-making allowing for urban development while protecting stream ecosystem function.

AB  - BackgroundUrbanization causes modification, fragmentation and loss of native habitats. Such landscape changes threaten many arboreal and gliding mammals by limiting their movements through treeless parts of a landscape and by making the landscape surrounding suitable habitat patches more inhospitable. Here, we investigate the effects of landscape structure and habitat availability on the home-range use and movement patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) at different spatial and temporal scales. We followed radio-tagged individuals in a partly urbanized study area in Eastern Finland, and analysed how landscape composition and connectivity affected the length and speed of movement bursts, distances moved during one night, and habitat and nest-site use.ResultsThe presence of urban habitat on movement paths increased both movement lengths and speed whereas nightly distances travelled by males decreased with increasing amount of urban habitat within the home range. The probability of switching from the present nest site to another nest site decreased with increasing distance among the nest sites, but whether the nest sites were connected or unconnected by forests did not have a clear effect on nest switching. Flying squirrels preferred to use mature forests for their movements at night.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the proximity to urban habitats modifies animal movements, possibly because animals try to avoid such habitats by moving faster through them. Urbanization at the scale of an entire home range can restrict their movements. Thus, maintaining a large enough amount of mature forests around inhabited landscape fragments will help protect forest specialists in urban landscapes. The effect of forested connections remains unclear, highlighting the difficulty of measuring and preserving connectivity in a species-specific way.

TI  - Barriers to Dispersal and the Challenges Facing the Southern Expansion of Bobcats in New Jersey
AU  - Cerreta, Ariana
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In urban environments, the threats of habitat fragmentation and loss, barriers to dispersal, and anthropogenic causes of mortality affect the recolonization potential of extirpated species. One such species, the bobcat (Lynx rufus), historically occurred throughout the state of New Jersey, but due to increased urbanization and agricultural expansion has been confirmed to occur almost exclusively in the northern portions of the state since the 1960’s. In this study I examine current barriers to bobcat dispersal and the possibility of the establishment of central and southern New Jersey bobcat populations. First, I developed a statewide habitat suitability index for bobcats and validated it with known bobcat locations. I then identified discrete suitable habitat patches and calculated landscape resistance values across the state from the inverse of the habitat suitability values with some adjustment for road-based metrics. To evaluate landscape connectivity throughout New Jersey, I applied circuit theory using the program Circuitscape within a GIS framework. I ran “current,” representing movement potential, through the resistance landscape between each pair of previously identified habitat patches. Using circuit theory in combination with least-cost path analysis, I next identified bottlenecks to bobcat movement throughout New Jersey. I identified barriers to movement using the change in least-cost path value based on a hypothetical barrier reduction. Finally, I repeated all these analyses for a case study in central New Jersey, where all stream crossing structures under roadways were assigned the lowest resistance value of 1, representing the ideal scenario that all structures had been modified to allow bobcat passage. I found that habitat patches were connected with some redundancy in the north, but with less redundancy throughout central New Jersey. The regions of high cumulative current flow around the Trenton area indicate that dispersing bobcats would have to pass through west central New Jersey to move from northern to southern habitat patches. Of the four least-cost paths connecting northern patches to southern patches, the shortest was approximately 25 km in length. While bobcats can easily disperse that distance, the movement corridors I identified cross through a highly urbanized landscape and contain several potential barriers. The resultant maps I produced will allow state managers to target specific areas for connectivity maintenance and improvement work within the CHANJ framework that are important for bobcat movement.I next used spatially explicit agent-based simulation models to examine the possibility of the establishment of central and southern New Jersey bobcat populations. The simulations consisted of a primary population model using life history statistics as well as two spatially explicit sub-models that examined dispersal and home range formation through a rasterized landscape representing movement resistances for bobcats. I evaluated the impacts of the following management actions: 1) status quo, 2) barrier reduction, and 3) single translocation event. I ran each scenario ten times to project population size and distribution at the end of 1, 5, 10, and 25 years. There was no significant difference in population size at the 1-, 5-, 10-, and 25-year time intervals for both the status quo and barrier reduction scenario. The translocation scenario revealed that the model needs further refinement as the population decreased between the 1- and 5-year time intervals, with no differences found between any other time interval pairs. Results from all scenarios indicated high probability of bobcat occupancy in habitat north of Route 80 over the course of 25 years. Bobcats more consistently occupied territories south of Route 80 but north of Interstate 95 under the barrier reduction scenario than either the status quo or translocation scenarios. The translocation scenario revealed higher probabilities of occupancy in the south at the 5-year time step likely due to the continued presence of translocated bobcats in their original territories. However, this high probability decreased by the 10-year time step and occupied territories largely disappeared by year 25. The surprising results of the translocation scenario highlighted the need to refine how the model identifies reproducing females, as it is currently too strict. Additionally, the impact of multiple small translocations on the persistence of a southern bobcat population should be evaluated before any decisions are made regarding translocation. Overall, my results suggested that bobcats are unlikely to recolonize central and southern New Jersey under current conditions within the next quarter century. Mitigation of barriers, through the implementation of modified culverts and crossing structures appropriate for bobcat movement, may allow for more reliable establishment of bobcat presence in the region south of Route 80, but still little occupation of territory south of Interstate 95. Given limitations in the model and its need for further refinement, no conclusions can be made regarding the translocation scenario. Translocation, especially in conjunction with barrier mitigation and the conservation of corridor habitat, may still be a viable management opportunity for NJDFW as it has previously been successful with bobcats in both in Georgia and northern New Jersey. However, further research should be pursued before any decisions are made. Once properly calibrated, spatially explicit agent-based models can be useful tools for wildlife managers to evaluate the potential impacts and results of different management actions. Overall, this research has expanded the scientific understanding of species-specific connectivity in an increasingly urban world, thus informing the implementation of mitigation methods to maintain and increase permeability within the landscape.

AU  - Cruz Lorenna Campos
AU  - Pompeu Paulo Santos
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanization results in major changes in stream morphology, hydrology, and water quality; the consequences on fish assemblage of Neotropical urban streams remain poorly understood. Due to the importance of better understanding fish assemblage responses towards urbanization in biodiversity hotspots, we evaluated the factors structuring the fish assemblages in a Neotropical medium-sized city. Additionally, we evaluated possible differences in fish diversity and biotic homogenization between the urban and control streams. To do so, fish were sampled along with physical habitat and water quality parameters in 16 urban streams in southern Brazil. Multiple regression and distance-based linear models (DistLM) were used to assess the importance of predictor variables in determining species richness and fish assemblage composition, respectively. The fish abundance rank curves were plotted to evaluate graphic differences in fish diversity between urban and control streams, while the relationship between distance and similarity (Bray-Curtis index) was used to evaluate biotic homogenization. The results revealed the importance of variables linking habitat diversity and basin connectivity to fish assemblage richness and structure. In addition, riparian vegetation was the main driver of fish assemblages, explaining 78% of abundance variation. We identified lower diversity and higher biotic homogenization in urban streams, with higher dominance of the non-native species Poecilia reticulata. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the physical and biotic variables of streams outside of water pollution levels alone. Finally, it is necessary to support urban planning practices that recover riparian vegetation, avoid canalization, and promote connectivity along stream networks as well as the removal of artificial structures in urban basins.

TI  - Understanding the Effects of Fox Movement on the Spread of Sarcoptic Mange in Urban Settings: An Individual-Based Modelling Approach
AU  - Dimitrov, Nikol
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The threat of disease spread to humans is greater in urban settings where contact between wildlife and human populations occurs frequently. Movement of host species plays a key role in maintaining transmission of direct-contact disease. Understanding how wildlife hosts move in fragmented urban landscapes is therefore imperative for disease control efforts. In cities, disease spread can be affected by the ability of a host to move through urban features, or by behavioural changes that are pathogen induced. Using the urban-adapted red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and its associated disease sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in the city of Toronto, I ask: How does movement of foxes according to landcover type affect the spread of mange? And how does variable movement of susceptible and infected foxes influence mange transmission? These questions are addressed using an individual-based modeling approach, where two movement behaviours of foxes in a city are compared: random and least-cost path. To assess the effects of movement ability according to disease status (here, susceptible-biased, and infected-biased movement), I compare a range of movement probabilities. For each scenario, the number of effective contacts and the effective reproduction number (Re) are estimated. Findings suggest that mange spread may be accelerated when movement is based on landcover types and when there is equal movement ability of susceptible and infected foxes. This study emphasizes the importance of including realistic movement behaviours when modelling the dynamics of mange and disease spread in urbanized landscapes.

TI  - Conservation Through Population Assessments Across Variable Landscapes
AU  - Huang, Ryan Marshall
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Few areas of the planet are untouched by human actions, be they marine or terrestrial. Marine habitats face disturbance from overexploitation of fisheries and pollution while terrestrial habitats face significant threat from land cover conversion and degradation. To address these threats, conservationists utilize a variety of population viability analyses to both assess and manage species’ health. The results of these analyses often play a key role in determining when intervention is necessary and which actions will be the most successful. Within this dissertation, I used several population modeling approaches to advance our understanding of changes in the landscape on the persistence of populations and by extension, species.This dissertation may be broadly divided into two halves, the first assessing a single, local population and the second evaluating metapopulations. In Chapter 2, I combined telemetry data on sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) with a long-term capture-mark-recapture dataset from the Dry Tortugas National Park to map the movements at sea for this species, calculate estimates of mortality, and investigate the impact of hurricanes on a migratory seabird. Included in the latter analysis is information on the locations of recovered bands from deceased individuals wrecked by tropical storms. I present the first known map of sooty tern migration in the Atlantic Ocean. The results indicate that the birds had minor overlaps with areas affected by the major 2010 oil spill and a major shrimp fishery. Indices of hurricane strength and occurrence are positively correlated with annual mortality and indices of numbers of wrecked birds. As climate change may lead to an increase in severity and frequency of major hurricanes, this may pose a long-term problem for this colony.In the latter half of this dissertation, I utilized a variety of metapopulation analyses for conservation at multiple scales. As a landscape becomes increasingly fragmented through habitat loss, the individual patches become smaller and more isolated and thus less likely to sustain a local population. Metapopulation theory is appropriate for analyzing fragmented landscapes because it combines empirical landscapes features with species-specific information to produce direct information on population extinction risks. Combining a spatially explicit metapopulation model with empirical data on endemic species’ ranges and maps of habitat cover, I could calculate the metapopulation capacity— a measure of a landscape’s ability to sustain a metapopulation.Mangroves provide an ideal, model landscape for my analysis in Chapter 3. Of conservation concern, one can easily delineate their patch boundaries. I calculated metapopulation capacity for 99 metapopulations from 32 different mangrove-endemic bird species globally in the years 2000 and 2015. Northern Australia and South East Asia have the highest richness of mangrove-endemic birds, with some hotspots also occurring in Guyana and French Guiana. The areas with the highest metapopulation loss are the Caribbean, the Pacific coast of Central America, Madagascar, Borneo, and isolated patches in Southeast Asia in Burma and Malaysia. Regions with the highest loss of habitat area are not necessarily those with the highest loss of metapopulation capacity. Often it is not a matter of how much, but how the habitat is lost since fragmentation of patches has a complicated relationship with extinction risk.After analyzing the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on a species’ risk of extinction, it is natural to examine the reverse, the restoration of habitat. In Chapter 4, I used metapopulation models to prioritize locations for potential habitat corridors. I compared these results to standard connectivity models that have grown in popularity to illustrate how together they provide a more complete set of recommendations for the recovery of species. For this chapter, I use the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) as the focal species. Endemic to the highly fragmented Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil, the golden lion tamarins are a highly studied species of top conservation concern. I identified the best locations for habitat restoration to increase metapopulation capacity and how they compare with movement of individuals in the current landscape. I also evaluated how a previous corridor restoration ranked according to these methods and how it effects future conservation planning. While large, occupied patches are significant for both sets of models, metapopulation models also indicate the importance of nearby, medium-sized empty patches that if connected by a corridor would facilitate the growth and recovery of tamarin populations.In summary, I applied a suite of population modeling techniques to an assortment of landscapes and species for conserving biodiversity. Despite the variety of models used, I illustrate the flexibility and utility of population ecology to conservation management.

TI  - Edge effects in fire‐prone landscapes: Ecological importance and implications for fauna
AU  - Parkins, Kate
AU  - York, Alan
AU  - Julian Di Stefano
T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Edges are ecologically important environmental features and have been well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio‐temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions. To aid the incorporation of new data into our predictive framework, our model has been designed as a Bayesian Network, a statistical tool capable of analyzing complex environmental relationships, dealing with data gaps, and generating testable hypotheses.

AB  - The urbanization process of Bogota has a direct impact on tree cover, because construction projects prioritize logging instead of transplant, and their landscape projects do not generate sufficient compensation. The progressive reduction of green spaces and trees, diminish the necessary habitats for the birds. In the management of the urban trees that includes activities of planting, pruning, transplant and logging, the city applies procedures to reduce its impact on avifauna. Its environmental authority has generated information to expand knowledge and allow understanding of the dynamics between trees and urban birds, which serves as a basis to analyze the efficiency of its action, both in the birdlife management procedure and in the design and selection of species in new tree plantings. This article shows statistics from a review of avifauna management final reports in various infrastructure projects and the work’s results of a study prepared between the District Department of Environment –sda– and the Bogota’s Ornithology Association –abo–, in which technical criteria are formulated for the ecological connectivity with emphasis on bird conservation and consolidation of restoration processes in the city’s main ecological structure.

AB  - In the face of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is needed to both encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of fragmented wildlife populations. In a developing region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) persists in fragmented remnants of tallgrass prairie in an urban park system. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost permeability swath model, and to evaluate the outputs with snake road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat blocks, a subset of which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. Four high-ranking pathways intersected roads through or near road mortality hotspots. This research will guide conservation interventions aimed at recovering endangered reptiles in a globally rare ecosystem, and will inform the use of permeability swaths for the identification of locations most suitable for connectivity interventions in dynamic, urbanizing landscapes.

AB  - The middle reaches of the Yangtze River region (MRYRR) are China’s first trans-regional urban agglomeration, located in the center of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The MRYRR is an important ecological reserve, and its land cover changes are affected by both socio-economic development and geographical environment. In this paper, Landsat ETM/TM/OLI remote sensing images were used to monitor land use and landscape patterns from 1990 to 2015. Through supervised classification, land use transfer matrix, landscape pattern metrics and correlation analysis, the spatial-temporal patterns of land use change and its relationship with socio-economic in the study area were revealed. The results showed that: (1) the main land use types in the study area were cropland (CL) and forestland (FL), accounting for more than three-quarters of the study area. During the study period, built-up land (BL) increased, CL decreased, FL increased first and then decreased; (2) the BL expanded mainly by occupying CL and FL, and regional landscape pattern was gradually fragmented, with complex patch shape and increasing diversity and heterogeneity. Among them, the BL is gradually gathered, and the FL and CL are gradually fragmented; (3) in the past 25 years, the urbanization process in this region has been obvious, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has increased by 36 times. The socioeconomic variables were positively correlated with BL, orchard (OL) and Shannon diversity index (SHID), and negatively correlated with CL, Wasteland (WL), mean patch size (MPS) and contagion size (CONTAG). The results showed that the urbanization development has a great impact on the region, and the ecological protection task is still challenging. It is necessary to protect high-quality cropland and draw a red line for ecological protection. We should strengthen the construction of ecological corridors and ecological nodes to adapt to regional sustainable development.

AB  - Effective habitat connectivity tools that use GIS data perform well in remote areas but may not be as dependable in urban environments. My goal was to study uses and limitations of a conservation management tool in development, the Metro Regional Habitat Connectivity Toolkit, which evaluates connectivity for and permeability of wildlife movement. Habitat quality scores are generated from GIS-derived and field collected data such as connectivity patch/matrix characteristics, water source, vegetation, other structural components, wildlife observations, and human disturbance at survey sites. I compared GIS and field generated habitat quality scores for the Northern Red-legged Frog (Rana aurora) in urbanizing Gresham East Buttes, Oregon. Using Spearman’s ranked correlation, there was low positive correlation between GIS and field scores indicating the two scores assess different types of data. The magnitude of difference between these scores had no interdependence along a development gradient. Assessment of Northern Red-legged Frog locations in Forest Park, resulted in habitat quality scores which were sensitive to the presence or visibility of water sources and other structural components such as woody debris. These findings indicate the need for repeat field surveys, and the importance of field-collected data’s unique contributions which ensure crucial wildlife dispersal is protected in rapidly changing environments. To give regional conservation managers confidence in applying connectivity tools in urbanizing environments, I compared a predictive Circuitscape connectivity model to additional field collected data such as habitat quality, and distance between aquatic-terrestrial habitats using aquatic egg mass surveys for Northern Red-legged Frog. Further genetic and demographic studies are recommended to fully discern the implications of these findings and to protect this Oregon state strategy species that utilizes at-risk aquatic and terrestrial connections during its annual migrations.

AB  - Ecosystem conservation in Mesoamerica, one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, is a top priority because of the rapid loss of native vegetation due to anthropogenic activities. Riparian forests are often the only remaining preserved areas among expansive agricultural matrices. These forest remnants are essential to maintaining water quality, providing habitats for a variety of wildlife and acting as biological corridors that enable the movement and dispersal of local species. The Acomé river is located on the Pacific slope of Guatemala. This region is heavily impacted by intensive agriculture (mostly sugarcane plantations), fires and grazing. Most of this region’s original forest is now restricted to forest remnants concentrated along the riverbank. However, the botanical composition and species diversity of the riparian communities has not been characterized. This baseline information is essential to develop restoration strategies and management plans. This study aimed to characterize the riparian tree communities along the Acomé riverbank by systematically collecting herbarium specimens and photographic material for trees over 10 cm DBH (diameter at breast height). Cluster analysis was used to identify the main riparian communities, and diversity indices were calculated for each community. A total of 115 tree species were identified, belonging to 91 genera and 43 families. The cluster analysis suggested the presence of four riparian tree communities along an altitudinal gradient. Rhizophora mangle, Cecropia obtusifolia, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Brosimum costaricanum were the dominant species of the identified communities. This research will support ongoing restoration efforts and biological connectivity plans in this region.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe Far-Eastern Himalayan Landscape, a global biodiversity hotspot spread across parts of India, Myanmar, and China, holds great potential for the long-term conservation of tiger populations. National-level efforts aimed at tiger conservation, such as the creation of protected areas, have been critical for the survival of key tiger populations. However, for tigers to continue to survive into the future, it is important that these key populations remain connected with each other, particularly in this transboundary landscape. This requires greater regional and cross-border co-operation in conservation research, monitoring, and planning to protect habitats and corridors. Here, we review and synthesize the available literature on two decades of conservation efforts aimed at the study and conservation of tigers, their co-predators, and prey in the landscape to understand research trends, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest priority areas for future research and conservation interventions. This review could be useful for formulating conservation plans and actions that could help in the recovery of tiger populations; for identifying, restoring, and securing connectivity between key tiger habitats; and for addressing other key threats, such as habitat loss, poaching, and trade in wildlife parts.AbstractAddressing the effects of human-caused habitat destruction on free-ranging threatened large carnivores requires actions that go ‘beyond borders’ in conserving and protecting their habitat and prey base. In this review, we compiled information from available literature on 20 years of conservation efforts aimed at tigers, co-predators, and their prey in the Far-Eastern Himalayan Landscape that is situated at the confluence of three global biodiversity hotspots covering parts of India, Myanmar, and China. The vast area of the proven biodiversity-rich forested landscape is highly suitable for long-term survival of carnivores, such as tigers. Habitat loss, ritual hunting, commercial exploitation, and poaching are the prevailing threats that have resulted in low tiger, co-predator, and prey population densities. Studies suggest that tiger presence is confined to a few areas, while other tiger populations have been extirpated across most parts of the landscape. Past research also suggests that the landscape holds low abundance of diverse prey species richness (n = 22), and urgent conservation measures are required to improve their habitat and numbers. This calls for greater regional and transboundary co-operation on research and knowledge sharing, conservation awareness programs for locals, and cross-border co-operation on wildlife monitoring. Strict policies are also required to enable PA managers to develop strategic plans to conserve large predators and protect their habitats and corridors.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - The fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat for biodiversity. However, the impact and spatial scale of natural isolation mechanisms leading to species loss, compared to anthropogenic fragmentation, are not clear, mainly due to differences between fragments and islands, such as matrix permeability. We studied a 500 km2 Mediterranean region in France, including urban habitat fragments, continuous habitat, and continental‐shelf islands. On the basis of 295 floristic relevés, we built species–area relationships to compare isolation in fragments after urbanization, with continuous habitat and continental‐shelf islands. We assumed either no dispersal, infinite dispersal, or estimated intermediate levels of habitat reachability through graph theory. Isolation mechanisms occurred in fragments but with a lower strength than in near‐shore islands, and most importantly affected perennial plants. Annual plants were less affected, probably due to their smaller size and shorter life cycle. Isolation occurred at landscape level in fragments and at patch level in islands. The amount of reachable habitat (accounting for spatial configuration) explained local species richness in both systems, but the amount of habitat (no consideration of spatial configuration) was already a good predictor. These results suggest an important role of habitat amount around fragments in mitigating the isolation effects observed in near‐shore islands, and the importance of carefully considering different functional groups.

TI  - Habitat, Connectivity, and Gene Flow of Mexican Spotted Owl in Southwestern Forests
AU  - Wan, Ho Yi
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalix lucida ) has experienced population decline and has been listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1995. The cause of its decline has traditionally been attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of human activities, including even-aged timber management and urban development. Over two decades have passed since the listing, with new information acquired and protection measures being in place to maximize the persistence potential of the species. Yet, the future of the species remains unclear as new threats emerge to negatively affect the species populations. In the southwestern United States, wildfires have increased in size and severity in many forests, and are expected to continue to increase with projected warmer and drier climate. The increased risk of large, high-severity wildfires has raised concern about its effects on the Mexican spotted owl, which typically nests in dense and old-growth forests that are prone fires. This dissertation contains 5 chapters that review current literature on threats to the spotted owl, evaluate habitat suitability, connectivity, and gene flow of the spotted owl under current landscape condition, and evaluate fire effects on the habitat of the spotted owl. Results from my dissertation provide much needed information for managing the Mexican spotted owl. The modeling and analytical approaches demonstrated herein lay the groundwork for quantitative assessments in improving the understanding of impacts of emerging threats on the threatened species.

AB  - Accurate identification of land use conflicts is an important prerequisite for the rational allocation of land resources and optimizing the production–living–ecological space pattern. Previous studies used suitability assessment and landscape pattern indices to identify land use conflicts. However, research on land use conflict identification from the perspective of ecological security is insufficient and not conducive to regional ecological, environmental protection, and sustainable development. Based on ecological security, this study takes Shandong Province as an example and comprehensively evaluates the importance of ecosystem service function and environmental sensitivity. It identifies the ecological source, and extracts ecological corridors with a minimum cumulative resistance model from which ecological security patterns are constructed. It identifies land use conflicts through spatial overlay analysis of arable land and construction land. The results show that: (1) Shandong Province has formed an ecological security pattern of “two ecological barriers, two belts, and eight cores” with an area of 15,987 km2. (2) The level of arable land–ecological space conflict is low, at 39.76%. The proportions of serious and moderate conflicts are 13.44% and 26.97%, respectively, distributed primarily on the Jiaodong Peninsula and the low hill areas of Ludong. (3) Construction land–ecological space conflict is reasonably stable and controllable, at 76.39%, occurring mainly around urban construction land, with serious and moderate conflict concentrated in the eastern coastal areas, mainly between rural settlements and ecologically safe space in the region. This study has important theoretical and practical reference values for identifying land use conflicts, protecting regional ecological security, and optimizing land use patterns.

TI  - Scenarios of future changes in land use, open space, and habitat connectivity around the National Wildlife Refuge System and other protected lands
AU  - Hamilton, Christopher M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Conservation in the face of land use change, a primary threat to biodiversity, requires understanding both the threat changes pose to conservation efforts and the drivers of change.  Protected areas, our primary approach to conservation, are often surrounded by land being used for agriculture or houses, which affects their conservation value.  Considering current land use and identifying future threats is critical to effective conservation, both within protected areas and without.  My dissertation goal was to assess threats to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) from land use change.  To do this, I first quantified land use change around refuges under different economic policy scenarios.  Second, I quantified and projected housing growth effects on structural habitat connectivity.  Third, I projected changes in functional habitat connectivity under land use and climate change scenarios for Blanding's turtle, a species with limited dispersal ability. \My primary result was that there will likely be significant land use change regardless of economic policy scenario.  However, differences among scenarios were minor with the exception of restricting urban growth, which had stronger effects than other policies and preserved natural habitats as well as a policy specifically designed to preserve natural habitats.  In addition, relying on habitat connectivity to mitigate the effects of global change is unlikely to be broadly effective because urban use has already precluded restoring connectivity for many refuges.  In both of these cases, land use change patterns were strongly regional in nature.  Finally, climate change had a stronger influence on changes in habitat connectivity than land use change for the Blanding's turtle, which demonstrated a "trailing edge" effect wherein populations at the southern edge of the range lost habitat connectivity more quickly than in the northern part of its range.  My findings indicate that a single national policy is not workable without the flexibility to account for regional differences change, that conservation planning should occur at the ecoregional as well as the individual protected area level, and that protected areas managing for a single species should assess the effects of global change on their focal species and conservation goals.

AU  - Leonard, Paul Brandon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Systematic conservation planning is a fertile scientific discipline capable of examining global natural resource threats including land cover conversion, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Many of these threats are acting in concert to accelerate the rate of change which increases the urgency of action. The scale of these changes creates unique spatial analysis and computational challenges. This study was designed to address several of these challenges pertaining to the analyses of publicly protected areas, habitat connectivity, and private lands conservation. I examine how using high-throughput and high-performance computing helps conservation practitioners ask and solve larger ecological questions. I describe when practitioners might consider using these technologies based on the types of questions that are asked. I improve upon existing circuit-theory based habitat connectivity modeling by using parallel processing and develop new methodologies which facilitate fine-grained analyses over broad geographic extents. I explore how species-level habitat connectivity can inform broad patterns of current and future landscape connectivity in the southeastern U.S. by incorporating species with a diverse group of dispersal abilities and including forecasted threats to connectivity. Since most of the conservation lands in the eastern U.S. are privately-owned, I explore the spatial patterns, distribution, and social covariates around private lands conservation (e.g., easements) throughout the Appalachian region.Harnessing the power of high-throughput and high-performance computing facilitated a 72-125 times speedup for several large-landscape spatial analyses. These improvements arm researches with the ability to ask questions which more closely capture the complexity seen in nature. Circuit-theory based habitat connectivity is notoriously computationally expensive and the results presented herein suggest computational bottlenecks can be overcome with a 160 times speedup. Moreover, the results illustrated circuit-theory based connectivity maps converge on a near solution much faster than previously thought and thus the description of this ‘convergence factor’ will save researchers many hours of computation and make broad-extent analyses practicable.Species-derived connectivity maps indicate far fewer large contiguous areas will be available to facilitate animal movements across ecoregions in 2100. Overall species potential habitat cores were reduced by 36% reaching as high as 72% for one species.  I observed a more simplified landscape connectivity in 2100 where values were dissected and depleted for the highest quantiles.  Despite these discouraging findings, private lands conservation may provide a ‘stop-gap’ measure to slow these changes. I found conservation easements throughput Appalachia nearer to urban developments, major road networks, on arable lands, and surrounded by areas of higher diversity than random. These results differ from that of global protected areas but the drivers of easement location may be more tightly linked with social processes, rather than environmental ones. Collectively, this research can help guide practitioners about what science and technology is needed and at the appropriate scale to match their conservation questions. Although the increasing threats to biodiversity conservation are well documented, strategies such as those presented here may help facilitate positive conservation outcomes.

T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSo far, the development of international resort hotels has enjoyed a history of hundreds of years, while in China, leisure vocation does not have a rapid development until in the past 20 years after the Reform and Opening-up. However, as for the development and construction of resort hotels, there is still a big gap between China and the rest of the world. People are paying more and more attention to the landscape design, which is an important part of the image of resort hotels. Although holiday resorts are developing rapidly, some problems still exist, including a lack of local characteristics and the variety of the facilities. What's more, many people develop resorts blindly without considering ecological environment, which destroys natural landscape resources. As a backyard garden of Guangzhou City, Conghua has picturesque scenery and abundant tourism resources. Scenic spots such as Liuxihe National Forest Park, Qiangang Ancient Village, etc. constitute the 80km Gold Tour. In addition, Conghua is famous for radon sodium carbonate hot spring, which is well known as the First Hot Spring of Lingnan Area. All these have made Conghua a famous destination for leisure vocation both at home and abroad. However, problems still occurred. For example, the urbanization of the Conghua Hot spring Resort is more and more serious. On the other hand, the hot spring resources are over exploited, leading to the resource exhaustion and deterioration of natural environment. Besides, the landscape of resort hotels is simple without unique features of themes and image. The Imperial Spring lies in the riverside of Liuxihe River of Liangkou Town in Conghua, covering an area of 29.28 Kilometers, with rich natural and cultural resources. As an important part of an ecological protective screen of forests in northern part of Guangzhou City, the resort plays a vital role in protecting the eco-system, conserving water resources and soil & water conservation. Therefore, the resort focuses on afforestation and protection of vegetation so as to create a green space. In this way, it assures the link of ecological corridor and the exchange of material and energy so that the ecosystem can maintain a steady and healthy status. With a setting of ecological landscape and a corridor of wet land the resort takes hot spring as the theme. The resort is characterized by A Valley,Three Areas, namely commercial conference area, hot spring area and public leisure area, which form a banding landscape structure with pleasant environment and attractive scenery. Congdu Resort Hotel is located in the commercial conference area and its landscape design optimizes the structure of ecological view. By combining the landscape layout of Congdu Resort Hotel, the landscape space, functional structure and the landscape of courtyard with the buildings in a harmonious and unified way and analyzing the modern unique landscape factors with Chinese characteristics, it can be summarized that Imperial Spring has generated a beautiful environment with rich Chinese cultures and a relaxing atmosphere. By studying the landscape design of Imperial Spring, this paper concludes that resort hotels should be different from city hotels in terms of the protection and development of natural and ecological environment, the uniqueness of landscape style as well as the creation of the atmosphere of leisure vocation. The above conclusion can serve as a reference for the development and construction of resort hotels in the

AB  - IntroductionIn the Pacific Northwest of North America, research addressing lentic-breeding amphibian population vulnerability has emphasized aquatic habitats, frequently neglecting terrestrial habitats. Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance.ResultsRana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance.ConclusionsArea and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales.

AB  - Przestrzeń natury może być odbierana w dychotomiczny sposób. Tradycyjnie odczytywano ją jako przestrzeń „zewnętrzną”, zarówno w stosunku do istoty ludzkiej, jak i do przestrzeni miasta. W epoce Oświecenia staje się przestrzeń natury instrumentem integracji więzi społecznych i niwelacji nierówności jako swego rodzaju „przestrzeń wewnętrzna”. Proces internalizacji natury odzwierciedla się w projektach miast utopijnych.Dewastacja środowiska naturalnego w XX wieku wpłynęła na rozwój zainteresowania problemami natury. Z drugiej strony przyczyniła się do powstania swego rodzaju postawy defensywnej, wynikającej z konieczności bieżącej walki z zagrożeniami ekologicznymi. Można było zaobserwować brak wielkich idei i narracji dotyczących zieleni i natury. Przełomem stał się rozwój koncepcji bioróżnorodności. Koncepcja ta powstała jako reakcja na procesy wzmożonego wymierania gatunków niektórych roślin i zwierząt. Postulatowi rozszerzaniu spektrum różnorodności biologicznej może odpowiadać postulat poszerzania spektrum różnorodności form architektonicznych. Powstaje w ten sposób architektura współdzielona z naturą.The space of nature may be understood in a dichotomous way. Traditionally, it was interpreted as an “external” space both in relation to the human being, and city space. As a specific type of “internal space”, during the period of the Enlightenment, the space of nature became an instrument of social integration and a levelling force of social inequalities. The process of internalization of nature is reflected in the projects of utopian cities. The devastation of the natural environment which took place in the 20th century, contributed to an increase of interest in the problems of nature. On the other hand, it also contributed to the creation of a specific type of defensive attitude, resulting from the need to conduct a current struggle with ecological threats. One could observe a lack of great ideas and narrations concerning green spaces and nature. What turned out to be a great breakthrough point was the development of the conception of biodiversity. The latter conception arose as a counter-reaction to the processes of ever increasing extinction of certain species of plants and animals. The postulate of broadening the spectrum of biological diversity may find its reflection in the postulate of broadening the diversity of architectural forms. In this way, there arises architecture which is co-shared with nature.

TI  - A Multi-scale Exploration into the Spatial Patterns of a Three Dimensional Urban Tree Infrastructure (UTI) : Integrating Landscape Connectivity, Network Resilience, and Social Deprivation
AU  - Bishop, Oliver James
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - A functionally connected urban tree infrastructure (UTI) contributes to ecosystem function, resilience, and the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Variation in tree height is an important attribute influencing movement of passerines, habitat quality and landscape patterns. UTI provided ES are particularly beneficial in the most deprived areas of a city. Presented in this thesis is an exploration into the social-ecological shape of a UTI using a holistic, multi-scale and dimensional, landscape approach.The potential landscape connectivity of a UTI in the City of Salford, UK was quantified and compared using the integral index of connectivity (IIC) across vertically stratified canopies existing in 2005, 2009, and 2013. System resilience was assessed through landscape graph network analysis and by the identification of canopies critical in maintaining connectivity (dIIC). The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was related to UTI landscape composition and configuration through a series of statistical tests.The connectivity of Salford’s vertically stratified UTI was low (IIC = <0.000001 – 0.0045), besides this the temporal change in connectivity was complex with no discernible overall pattern. The rate of connectivity increase decreased after a 90-120m gap-crossing threshold. The resilience of Salford’s UTI relies on the connectivity of canopies within 4 to 5 sub-connected regions, depending on passerine perception, increasing to 10 -16 smaller regions for canopies above 17.1m. The resilience and stability of these sub-connected regions were often reliant on a central canopy patch. UTI composition is related negatively with deprivation, UTI configuration is related positively, while structural diversity of canopy heights revealed no correlation with deprivation.The research in this thesis contributes to the debates on how to best manage the UTI for both people and nature. The findings of this thesis have a number of important implications for future urban landscape management, especially as previously unknown landscape patterns have been identified.

AB  - Larger patches generally are inhabited by higher species richness, including birds, as predicted by the island biogeography theory. The objective of this research was to reveal the response of bird species richness in different patch sizes in peri-urban habitat. The study site area was five patches (2 large patches near human activities, remote large patch with a small lake, small patch, corridor patch) of disturbed secondary shrub-forest in Riau University, Sumatra. Birds were observed using the standard point-counts in early morning and late afternoon (8 points/patch, 3 replicates, total 40 observation-hour) in March-April 2021. Species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity indices (H’), Chao species prediction, and Bray-Curtis similarity indices (B) were calculated. Total of 979 individual birds were observed, consisted of 68 species from 28 families with B ranged from 0.573 to 0.846. Large patch with lake in remote area had the highest species richness (S:39 species, Chao:54) and H’ (3.097). However, two large patches closed to human activities had the lowest number of species (S:27, Chao:30, H’:2.908, and S:23, Chao:32, H’:2.938, respectively), even lower than small patch (S:30, Chao:40, H’:2.925) or corridor patch (S:34; Chao:51, H’:2.724). Clearly human disturbance and micro-habitat diversity affect species richness in a local scale.

TI  - Urban open spaces from a dispersal perspective: lessons from an individual-based model approach to assess the effects of landscape patterns on the viability of wildlife populations
AU  - Penteado Homero Marconi
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Green areas drawn on a city plan represent open spaces that have different meanings for humans and wildlife. Diverse kinds of green may influence species viability in urban environments. It is necessary to understand what those areas mean for wildlife populations and how land-use changes affect habitats and movements for making scientifically defensible planning and design decisions. My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed). Dispersal model HexSim simulated three target species – Red-legged frog (Rana aurora aurora), Western meadowlark (Sturnella neclecta) and Douglas squirrel (Tamasciurus douglasii) – movements on those scenarios to compare and contrast sustained populations to the ca. 2010 baseline landscape. Network scenarios presented the largest number of frog breeders. Greenway scenarios showed the largest populations of squirrels. Park and network scenarios sustained viable populations of meadowlarks, but park scenarios performed best. Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks. Network scenarios performed best when considering the collective of species. Networks presented more diverse habitats, sustaining higher diversity of species. For plans to sustain more species, more comprehensive and diverse habitats must be promoted, otherwise trade-offs should be expected – like the extinction of meadowlarks in greenway scenarios.

TI  - Do Indigenous Street Trees Promote More Biodiversity than Alien Ones? Evidence Using Mistletoes and Birds in South Africa
AU  - Shackleton, Charlie
T2  - Forests
AB  - Trees in urban landscapes provide a range of ecosystem services, including habitat, refugia, food, and corridors for other fauna and flora. However, there is some debate whether the richness and abundance of other biodiversity supported is influenced by the provenance of trees, i.e., native or non-native. This study assessed the presence of mistletoes and birds (and nests) in 1261 street trees. There were marked differences between native and non-native street trees, with the former having a significantly higher prevalence of birds (and nests) and supporting more species and in greater densities, whilst the latter supported a higher prevalence of mistletoes. Additionally, for birds, the proximity to green space, tree size and species were also important, whilst for mistletoes, the proximity to green space, slope aspect, and tree species were significant. Preference ratios indicated that some tree species had a higher than random occurrence of birds or mistletoes, whilst others had a low abundance. The indigenous tree species, Acacia karroo Hayne was the only reasonably abundant street tree species that was important for birds, nests, and mistletoes. At the street scale, there was a positive relationship between street tree species richness and bird species richness. These results emphasise the importance of selecting appropriate tree species if biodiversity conservation is a core outcome.

AB  - Around 77% of Indonesian islands is small islands and Indonesia known as mega biodiversity center, but coastal biodiversity of small islands was not well documented. The objective of this study is to assess coastal biodiversity in small islands and its conservation status. The study indicated that small islands provide complex biodiversity ranging from ecosystem to species. Diversity index of mangrove: 1.4-1.8, seagrass: 1.5–1.9, coral: 1.7–2.3. Ecosystem condition in urban small island was poor and in rural small island was healthy. The islands also provide fauna diversity i.e mollusc (110 species), crabs (52 species), and coral fish (261 species). Diversity of mollusc and crabs in rural island was higher than in urban island, χ2 (1) = 1.3, p< 0.001 and χ2 (1) = 4.3, p< 0.002, respectively. Diversity index of coral fish range from 2.14 to 4.27 (mean: 3.4). Most of the biodiversity located outside protected area and main threats were ecosystem degradation, pollution, overexploitation, and sedimentation. In conclusion, small islands are important coastal biodiversity spots, but it faces tremendous threats. The study recommends better management of coastal biodiversity i.e. establishing coastal protected areas in small islands, building marine corridor, and public awareness to ensure biodiversity conservation.

TI  - The Ecological Drivers of Urban Tick-Borne Disease Emergence
AU  - VanAcker, Meredith C.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Tick-borne diseases cause in enormous burden on human, livestock, and wildlife health globally and are driven by the increasing abundance and geographic expansion of medically important tick species. More recently, tick-borne disease emergence is occurring in urban landscapes due to complex feedbacks between the environment, humans, wildlife, and ticks. In this dissertation, I focus on the ecological conditions that allow for tick-borne disease emergence in a city. I use a combination of spatial landscape modeling, empirical data collection, wildlife movement tracking to determine drivers of zoonotic hazards in New York City, NY, and employ vector genomics to examine vector dispersal in the northeastern United States. In chapter one, I pair tick collection throughout the five boroughs of New York City with landscape connectivity modeling to examine how green space connectivity and habitat availability affects the density and infection of questing nymphs – an important epidemiological measure of human risk for tick-borne diseases. I found that green spaces that were highly connected for deer had higher nymph density and infection prevalence for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. In chapter two, I use camera trapping, live trapping, and tick collection on Staten Island, NY, to examine how landscape fragmentation – through changing habitat size and connectivity – shapes the host community available for questing Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Further, I examined whether patterns in host species abundance and activity correlate with the density of nymphs and their infection prevalence with three different pathogens that vary in host-specificity, B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. I found associations between host species and the size and connectivity of the park habitat, identified host species which amplified and removed ticks in the environment, and determined links between host activity and abundance and the infection prevalence of nymphs with host-specific pathogens. In chapter three, I utilize movement data from 59 white-tailed deer on Staten Island, NY, to assess the drivers of movement and its impact on tick-borne disease hazard across the landscape. I found that white-tailed deer avoid anthropogenic development at fine spatial scales when establishing home ranges but select for anthropogenic resources within their home range, increasing the potential to distribute ticks into environments that interface with humans. Finally in chapter four, I use double digest Restriction Associated DNA sequencing to examine the genetic differentiation of six I. scapularis populations across the Northeast region. I found high levels of gene flow across a spatial scale of 400 km, likely resulting from frequent host-mediated dispersal events combined with large I. scapularis populations. Taken together, this work emphasizes that host movement and ecology are critical determinants of urban tick-borne disease emergence through directing vector and pathogen dispersal, serving as pathogen reservoirs in urban habitats, and interfacing with humans in unique ways that increase human exposure to zoonotic hazards.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - As elements of green infrastructure, railway embankments are important corridors in urban environments connecting otherwise isolated habitat fragments. They are interrupted when railways cross major roads. It is not known whether dispersing animals use railway bridges to cross roads. We examined the function of a set-aside iron-steel railway bridge crossing a 12 m wide road with high traffic density in Basel (Switzerland) for dispersing animals. We installed drift fences with traps on a single-track, 32 m long and 6 m wide railway bridge with a simple gravel bed, and collected animals daily for 9 months. We captured more than 1200 animals crossing the bridge: small mammals, reptiles and amphibians as well as numerous invertebrates including snails, woodlice, spiders, harvestmen, millipedes, carabids, rove beetles and ants. For some animals it is likely that the gravel bed, at least temporarily, serves as a habitat. Many animals, however, were apparently dispersing, using the bridge to cross the busy road. We found season- and daytime-dependent differences in the frequency the bridge was used. Our findings indicate an important function of a set-aside railway bridges for connecting urban habitats. As most animal dispersal was recorded during the night, railway bridges with no (or little) traffic during the night may also contribute to animal dispersal. As important elements of green infrastructure, set-aside railway bridges should be considered in future urban planning.

AB  - The polarization and diffusion effects of landscape patterns are important features of megalopolis development. Under the urbanized effects, green space is a key spatial unit in delivering vital ecosystem services for sustainable urban planning. However, currently, fast urban developing is swamping the green space. In this study, by tracing landscape pattern changes of a fast-developing megalopolis, the Chengdu-Chongqing Megalopolis in the southeast of China, and using land-use data from 1980 to 2020, we aimed to determine the polarization and diffusion effects of the megalopolis and their impacts on the green space within and between the cities. We found that: (1) during the past four decades, spatial expansion of the megalopolis mainly occupied grassland and farmland, triggering an increase in landscape fragmentation; (2) based on socio-economic indicators, the spatial-attraction network analysis showed a significant polarization effect; however, based on the natural landscape, this analysis demonstrated a more scattered pattern; (3) importantly, the megalopolis developed at quite a similar pace, which caused the green rural area between the central cities demonstrating an encroached trend by the urbanization. To promote sustainability of the fast-developing megalopolis, we suggest that the boundary of the green space should be broadened to form a green network in which natural green space and urban green space are interconnected, improving the connectivity of habitats within the megalopolis for urban biodiversity. Our study implied that maintaining the green buffer shall be considered in advance for sustainable megaregional planning and establishing resilience of the fast-developing megalopolis.

TI  - A multi-scale exploration into the spatial patterns of a three dimensional Urban Tree Infrastructure (UTI) : integrating landscape connectivity, network resilience, and social deprivation
AU  - Bishop, O J
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - A functionally connected urban tree infrastructure (UTI) contributes to ecosystem function, resilience, and the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Variation in tree height is an important attribute influencing movement of passerines, habitat quality and landscape patterns. UTI provided ES are particularly beneficial in the most deprived areas of a city. Presented in this thesis is an exploration into the social-ecological shape of a UTI using a holistic, multi-scale and dimensional, landscape approach. The potential landscape connectivity of a UTI in the City of Salford, UK was quantified and compared using the integral index of connectivity (IIC) across vertically stratified canopies existing in 2005, 2009, and 2013. System resilience was assessed through landscape graph network analysis and by the identification of canopies critical in maintaining connectivity (dIIC). The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was related to UTI landscape composition and configuration through a series of statistical tests. The connectivity of Salford’s vertically stratified UTI was low (IIC = <0.000001 – 0.0045), besides this the temporal change in connectivity was complex with no discernible overall pattern. The rate of connectivity increase decreased after a 90-120m gap-crossing threshold. The resilience of Salford’s UTI relies on the connectivity of canopies within 4 to 5 sub-connected regions, depending on passerine perception, increasing to 10 -16 smaller regions for canopies above 17.1m. The resilience and stability of these sub-connected regions were often reliant on a central canopy patch. UTI composition is related negatively with deprivation, UTI configuration is related positively, while structural diversity of canopy heights revealed no correlation with deprivation. The research in this thesis contributes to the debates on how to best manage the UTI for both people and nature. The findings of this thesis have a number of important implications for future urban landscape management, especially as previously unknown landscape patterns have been identified.

AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock‐replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re‐establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting‐edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced‐representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub‐sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re‐colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

AB  - Land cover and use changes are important to study for their impact on ecosystem services and ultimately on sustainability. In urban environments, a particularly important research question addresses the relationship between urbanization-related changes and biodiversity, subject to controversies in the literature. Birds are an important ecological group, and useful for answering this question. The present study builds upon the hypothesis according to which avian diversity decreases with urbanization. In order to answer it, a sample of 4245 observations from 650 sites in Annaba, Algeria, obtained through the point abundance index method, were investigated by computing Shannon-Wiener’s diversity index and the species richness, mapping them, and analyzing the results statistically. The findings confirm the study hypothesis and are relevant for planning, as they stress the role of urban green spaces as biodiversity hotspots, and plead for the need of connecting them. From a planning perspective, the results emphasize the need for interconnecting the green infrastructure through avian corridors. Moreover, the results fill in an important lack of data on the biodiversity of the region, and are relevant for other similar Mediterranean areas. Future studies could use the findings to compare with data from other countries and continents.

TI  - Urban wetland structure and its relationship to exotic plants, biodiversity, and West Nile Virus risk
AU  - Shappell, Laura Jean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wetlands provide crucial ecosystem functions that aid water security, stormwater management, and biodiversity conservation. However, the underlying mechanisms that influence headwater wetlands in urban landscapes are poorly understood. Further, biodiversity loss may reduce ecosystem function and increase the transmission risk for some enzootic diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). My research aimed to: 1) assess wetland vegetation structure and the importance of fragment size and landscape position on biodiversity; 2) test the importance of flooding conditions for mitigating invasive plant dominance in forested wetlands using Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) as my study system; and 3) identify relationships between vegetation structure, fragment size, and the relative abundance of competent avian WNV hosts and mosquito vectors. I used a combination of measurative and experimental research methods to address these objectives, the third of which was part of a collaborative interdisciplinary research grant. Vegetation structure was measured in 36 plots located in six forested wetlands and data loggers were used to monitor aboveground flooding. Avian and mosquito research teams coordinated  iii with my sampling points. My results illustrate the capacity for urban headwater wetlands to support a diverse flora, as well as the complex interactions between human activities and wetland structure and function. Red maple, oak, sweetgum, and green ash were the dominant tree species. Half of the 287 plant species identified only occurred at 1-2 sample points. Groundcover composition reflected the confluence of hydrogeomorphology, and past and present human actions. Connectivity via nearby streams or ditches had a greater impact on exotic plant richness than did wetland patch size. Aboveground flooding prior to seedling emergence significantly reduced the distribution of Japanese stiltgrass. Avian species richness was positively correlated with plant richness. In contrast, mosquito richness was negatively correlated to plant richness. WNV hosts and vector abundance both increased with maple (Acer spp.) tree canopy dominance. Cumulative host abundance averaged 24% and was composed primarily of American Robin, which showed large interannual shifts in fragments <15 ha. The relative abundance of competent vectors ranged from 5 to 26% and their populations demonstrated less interannual variation than were observed in the host populations.

AB  - Using a case study of an isolated management unit of Sichuan snub‐nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), we assess the extent that climate change will impact the species’ habitat distribution in the current period and projected into the 2050s. We identify refugia that could maintain the population under climate change and determine dispersal paths for movement of the population to future suitable habitats. Hubei Province, China. We identified climate refugia and potential movements by integrating bioclimatic models with circuit theory and least‐cost model for the current period (1960–1990) and the 2050s (2041–2060). We coupled a maximum entropy algorithm to predict suitable habitat for the current and projected future periods. Suitable habitat areas that were identified during both time periods and that also satisfied home range and dispersal distance conditions were delineated as refugia. We mapped potential movements measured as current flow and linked current and future habitats using least‐cost corridors. Our results indicate up to 1,119 km2 of currently suitable habitat within the study range. Based on our projections, a habitat loss of 67.2% due to climate change may occur by the 2050s, resulting in a reduced suitable habitat area of 406 km2 and very little new habitat. The refugia areas amounted to 286 km2 and were located in Shennongjia National Park and Badong Natural Reserve. Several connecting corridors between the current and future habitats, which are important for potential movements, were identified. Our assessment of the species predicted a trajectory of habitat loss following anticipated future climate change. We believe conservation efforts should focus on refugia and corridors when planning for future species management. This study will assist conservationists in determining high‐priority regions for effective maintenance of the endangered population under climate change and will encourage increased habitat connectivity.

AB  - This study took place within the Oak Openings Region, a biodiversity hotspot in northwestern Ohio. The Oak Openings was created during the Cenozoic period, a time where glaciers continuously moved across Ohio, creating valleys and riverbeds. When the Wisconsin glaciers melted back from Ohio around 14,000 years ago, waters were released into multiple lakes with sandy beaches. Overtime, these sandy beaches started to became dunes inundated by rainwater that could not drain past the clayey till and bedrock ground layer. Water that would stand between the clay layer and sandy dunes provided moisture to eventually support oak savanna habitat. Between the sand ridges, rainwater would saturate the land, which created open areas of wet prairie (Higgins, 2003; Grigore, 2004). The combination of oak savanna habitat and open wet prairie gave this region the name of "Oak Openings" (Grigore, 2004).Today, the Oak Openings looks quite different as a result of the economic development and agricultural pursuits along the Toledo-Detroit corridor. This area is highly fragmented by roads, agricultural fields and urban/residential development. Roughly 45% of the Oak Openings Region contains urban and suburban development and roughly a quarter of the region has been converted to areas of agricultural production (Schetter and Root, 2011). However, there are still remnants of wild lands that exist west and south of the city of Toledo. This area is Ohio's largest single surficial sand covering which is 1-12 meters thick and consists of wet lowland and sand ridge terrain with elevations up to 210 meters above sea level. This region is approximately 8 kilometers wide and 32 kilometers long (Higgins, 2003; Figure 1) and contains oak savanna, oak woodland and wet prairie habitats on post glacial beach ridges and swales and covers 478 km2 (The Nature Conservancy, 2001; Grigore, 2004; Schetter and Root, 2011).The Oak Openings Region contains one third of all of Ohio's endangered plant communities as well as many rare animals and early successional ecosystems. However, only about 10% of the Oak Openings Region is in protected areas (Abella et al., 2007). Early successional ecosystems in this area (e.g. oak savannas and prairies) were historically maintained by disturbances such as fire. Now, these disturbances are mimicked by management activities such as prescribed fires and thinning. In Ohio there are two preserves known as the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest, which are the largest protected areas and support many different vertebrate populations and species. However, these two preserves are also highly fragmented by agricultural fields, roadways, railways, and trails that may limit animal movement and increase road mortality. Therefore, it is critical to better understand animal movement and road mortality in this area to promote viable populations, increase our knowledge of vertebrate movement and prevent the killing of vertebrate species by vehicle collisions. This thesis has two foci, each as the topic of stand-alone chapters. The overarching goal is to predict animal movement and identify the features that may be managed to reduce road mortality, which is likely to be applicable to other reserves in human-dominated landscapes. The objective of the first chapter is to understand what factors influence animal movements and road mortality. Specifically, the first chapter examines how structural features of roads, environmental variables, spatial factors and land cover types can influence vertebrate movement (e.g. mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians) and road mortality on roads surrounding and within the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest. Road surveys as well as visual surveys on trails within both protected areas were utilized to account for animal movement, dispersal and mortality.The second chapter focuses on mammal movement patterns and road mortality on roads surrounding and within the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest. Similar to chapter I, road and visual surveys along trails were utilized to understand mammal movement and mortality. Mammals were found as roadkill more than any other taxa, so it is important to specifically understand what factors influence these trends. Again, structural features of roads, environmental variables, spatial factors and land cover types were all analyzed to understand what influences mammal movement and mortality.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Asian Longhorned Beetle in Worcester, MA: Thermal Effects, Community Responses, and Future Vulnerability
AU  - Elmes, Arthur Francis Marett
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban environments experience air, water, noise, and heat pollution as a consequence of their composition, structure, and function. These adverse environmental conditions, which have direct and indirect effects on human health and ecological stability, can be mitigated or partially offset by healthy and extensive urban forests. Additionally, urban trees provide a number of cultural, aesthetic, and property value benefits. However, to provide maximum ecosystem service benefits, an urban forest must be carefully planned and maintained, so that average tree lifespan is maximized and ecological vulnerability is minimized. Maximal urban forest resilience is best achieved via taxonomic and age-diversity, such that no one genus or age-cohort dominates. This diversity enhances overall urban forest resilience, which in turn facilitates maximum ecosystem service provision. The Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB,  Anoplophora glabripennis) infestation in Worcester, MA represents a case example of taxonomic monoculture vulnerability, but also an excellent opportunity to reinvest and diversify the urban forest. As a result of the ALB infestation, which was first documented in 2008, approximately 35,000 host trees were removed from residential and public property, substantially reducing urban tree canopy coverage and uncovering impervious surfaces. Chapter two quantifies this Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) loss, and shows that in loss areas Land Surface Temperature (LST) increases range from 1 – 6° C. The research investigates multi-scale effects of this relationship, particularly in the hard-hit Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods of Worcester, MA. In response to the large quantity of UTC loss suffered due to ALB, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), the City of Worcester, and the Worcester Tree Initiative (WTI) have together planted over 30,000 trees, primarily via tree giveaway programs to local residents. Chapter three assesses the effectiveness of this initiative in terms of juvenile tree mortality rates – a critical indicator of long-term urban forest success. Results indicate that tree stewardship variables such as renter proportion and number of trees planted per property are strong predictors of tree mortality. Tree species was shown to be strong predictor of mortality, with ornamental trees showing lower mortality rates than shade deciduous or conifers. Finally, Chapter four investigates the potential risk of further ALB infestation in the Worcester area, using a circuit theory dispersal model, which uses an analogy with electrical circuits to predict the dispersal of random-walkers across a heterogeneous landscape. The results indicate that impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as proximity to existing trees are facilitators of ALB movement. Circuit-based dispersal maps highlight the importance of narrow dispersal corridors connecting larger areas of potential dispersal. Dispersal potential was combined with ALB habitat suitability measured with Mahalanobis typicality, yielding a hybrid map of ALB infestation risk. These map products are valuable both as contributions to the understanding of invasive species movement in novel environments, and as tools for land managers attempting to eradicate ALB, such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This dissertation investigates three elements of the ALB infestation of Worcester, providing a holistic explanation of the impacts, recovery, and vulnerability of Worcester’s urban forest.

TI  - Environmental filtering of wild bee assemblages in New York City parks and community gardens
AU  - Alamoudi, Alaa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Evidence suggests that bee declines are occurring on a global scale. One contributing factor to these declines may be habitat loss and fragmentation associated with urbanization. Using bee abundance data from New York City parks and gardens, I examined how bee communities are partitioned within this large metropolitan area by looking at environment filters at the landscape and local scales. At the landscape scale, I examined factors that differentiate bee communities between parks and gardens by constructing a mitochondrial coxl-based phylogeny; clades were characterized based on their association with habitat type and functional traits for each species were overlain on the phylogeny to examine patterns of ecological clustering. At the local scale, I investigated environmental factors (i.e., available sunlight, floral diversity, garden size and surrounding green space) that might influence bee diversity patterns among community gardens. I performed multiple regression analyses to identify models which best explained differences in bee abundance, richness and diversity. At the landscape level, species commonly found in parks tended to be soil nesting species that emerge as adults in early spring. Species associated with gardens were more commonly cavity nesters or oligoleges of plants commonly found in community gardens. At the local scale, bee abundance was primarily influenced by available sunlight, whereas richness and diversity were influenced by a combination of sunlight, floral diversity and surrounding green space. We suggest that efforts to conserve bees in cities should consider issues related to sunlight availability, suitable nesting resources, and habitat connectivity.

TI  - Road to the Future: Strategies for Wildlife Crossings and Youth Empowerment to Improve Wildlife Habitat in Roaded Landscapes
AU  - Tanner, Dawn Renee
T2  - ProQuest LLC
AB  - As the footprint of human society expands upon the earth, habitat loss and landscape fragmentation is an increasing global problem. That problem includes loss of native habitats as these areas are harvested, converted to agricultural crops, and occupied by human settlement. Roads increase human access to previously inaccessible areas, encourage landscape conversion as human access is increased, and are a pervasive component of the developed landscape. Helping our youth understand and engage with these processes is critical for informed decision-making about conservation of biodiversity, increased awareness and sensitivity to the effects of landscape fragmentation, improved attitudes toward local environments, and empowering environmentally responsible behavior. This dissertation addresses the question "What management strategies will optimize wildlife crossing structures and what educational strategies will optimize youth understanding and engagement to improve wildlife habitat in roaded landscapes?" The first chapter is global and reviews the literature addressing road crossings for wildlife. This chapter demonstrates that a network of crossing structures across roads can restore habitat connectivity for target species of wildlife; these structures function optimally for wildlife when best management practices including long-term monitoring and adaptive management are implemented. Nine best management practices developed in this paper advance the quest for optimization of wildlife crossings. Wildlife crossings are a significant tool for conserving wildlife in roaded landscapes. A broader question about advancing society's wildlife goals for roaded landscapes addresses education of our youth. Crossings are major engineering investments. As young people learn to value and take action on environmental issues, we may have improved opportunities to reconnect wildlife habitats. The remaining chapters in the dissertation address that second aspect of living in a roaded landscape: education. The chapters present and analyze the Taking Action Opportunities (TAO) curriculum in which students investigate the effects of habitat change for themselves using remote cameras to explore and understand biodiversity in fragmented habitats. Students compare camera-trap results in their schoolyard with findings in a nearby protected area and become engaged in social action, communicating with school and community leaders to achieve changes that improve habitats for biodiversity. The curriculum is quantitatively analyzed to show how it affects attitudes and behaviors of 5th-grade students. Two years of field testing results using TAO are analyzed with matched pairs pre and post tests. In those analyses, students using TAO as the experimental treatment were compared to a control group of students in the same school district who participated only in the standard environments curriculum delivered in 5th grade. Students in the experimental group were found to have higher scores on knowledge; attitudes; and behavior confidence, intent, and practice. Greatest gains were demonstrated in the category of behavior practice, providing evidence that TAO is a successful mechanism to increase student awareness of issues of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation and take action to improve wildlife habitat in their school and community. These five chapters advance society's ability to sustain the coexistence of wildlife and human communities in roaded landscapes. Some landscape conditions require "hard" engineering approaches and others require "soft" educational approaches. Through strategic investment, school districts, cities, states, and nations can protect and manage wildlife-rich habitats, reduce habitat loss and fragmentation, and can encourage young people to understand and value those wildlife-rich habitats.

T2  - PLoS One
AB  - Terrestrial long-distance migrations are declining globally: in North America, nearly 75% have been lost. Yet there has been limited research comparing habitat suitability and connectivity models to identify migration corridors across increasingly fragmented landscapes. Here we use pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) migrations in prairie habitat to compare two types of models that identify habitat suitability: maximum entropy (Maxent) and expert-based (Analytic Hierarchy Process). We used distance to wells, distance to water, NDVI, land cover, distance to roads, terrain shape and fence presence to parameterize the models. We then used the output of these models as cost surfaces to compare two common connectivity models, least-cost modeling (LCM) and circuit theory. Using pronghorn movement data from spring and fall migrations, we identified potential migration corridors by combining each habitat suitability model with each connectivity model. The best performing model combination was Maxent with LCM corridors across both seasons. Maxent out-performed expert-based habitat suitability models for both spring and fall migrations. However, expert-based corridors can perform relatively well and are a cost-effective alternative if species location data are unavailable. Corridors created using LCM out-performed circuit theory, as measured by the number of pronghorn GPS locations present within the corridors. We suggest the use of a tiered approach using different corridor widths for prioritizing conservation and mitigation actions, such as fence removal or conservation easements.

TI  - Moving People for Tigers: Resettlement, Food Security and Landscape-Level Conservation in Central India
AU  - Neelakantan, Amrita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Resettlement of humans from protected areas conserves habitats for wildlife. However, impacts of resettlement on the well-being of resettled communities and on broader conservation goals at the landscape level have been poorly quantified until now due to inadequate documentation and baseline information. Recent documentation and advances in measurements of human well-being enable studies that examine the impacts of resettlement for both people and conservation. In India, the current standardized resettlement policy by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is explicit in its goal to create inviolate habitats for tigers within protected areas. More than 70% of the global tiger population lives in protected areas in India. The central Indian national parks hold approximately 40% of Indian tiger populations. Implementation of the NTCA policy provides an opportunity to study resettlement with relatively accurate records of where resettled households moved, a standardized monetary compensation and the potential for replication with large representative groups to study impacts in various landscapes across the country. This dissertation focuses on resettlement in Kanha National Park in central India, one of the most well-known and oldest tiger reserves in the country. The Kanha National Park (KNP) landscape mirrors the realities of many people-park interactions in human-dominated areas with high percentages of indigenous human populations, historical forced displacements, and current resettlements that follow a standardized national policy. From a conservation point of view, connectivity between KNP and other protected areas across central India is crucial for genetically healthy tiger populations. This dissertation consists of three analyses that combine data from field surveys and existing data sources to examine the impacts of resettlement on food security, landscape connectivity for wildlife, and human-wildlife conflict in the KNP landscape. In Chapter 1, I use household surveys to compare the food security and livelihood associations of resettled households compared to their non-resettled neighbors at new settlement locations. I show that resettled households have similar availability and access to foods as their non-resettled neighbors. Increases in off-farm income sources are associated with higher food access for all households. In Chapter 2, I explore the pattern of low food access in the KNP landscape using the five capitals model for sustainable development to illustrate significant associations between livelihood factors and household food access. Salaried stable incomes and kitchen garden diversity are significantly associated with higher food access. Financial capital dwarfs the contributions of social and natural capitals which have supplementary roles in times of financial stress. In Chapter 3, I address resettlement impacts on habitat connectivity between protected areas and human-wildlife conflict that resettled households face after relocating outside the park. Resettled households are not disproportionately moving into corridors between protected areas, especially when compared to the manifold more non-resettled households already residing in these areas. Resettled households however are moving into areas of high human-wildlife conflict due to their continued proximity to KNP. Outcomes from Chapter 3 also confirm that steady incomes can alleviate forest use and lower human activities in forests reducing human-wildlife conflict. In human-dominated landscapes such as KNP, financial capital and the stability of household incomes can aid both food security, lower pressures on non-protected forests and potentially lower human-wildlife conflict. The results counter assumptions that resettled communities continue to follow traditional natural resource reliant livelihoods. Local populations are not likely to engage in livelihoods that are heavily reliant on natural resources as rural populations become integrated into urban economies.  The results from this dissertation imply that managers in the KNP landscape can alleviate food security and aid landscape wide conservation goals by increasing off-farm salaried incomes. Finally, in India, there is a high potential for replication of this study around other protected areas, with nationally standardized resettlement in landscapes that vary geographically, ecologically and socially.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Invasive mammalian carnivores contribute disproportionately to declines in global biodiversity. In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground‐nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive‐reared animals associated with the fur‐farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape‐genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape‐genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape‐genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox.

AB  - Simple SummaryAn urban environment holds many barriers for mammals with limited mobility such as hedgehogs. These barriers appear often unsurmountable (e.g., rivers, highways, fences) and thus hinder contact between hedgehogs, leading to genetic isolation. In our study we tested whether these barriers affect the hedgehog population of urban Berlin, Germany. As Berlin has many of these barriers, we were expecting a strong genetic differentiation among hedgehog populations. However, when we looked at unrelated individuals, we did not see genetic differentiation among populations. The latter was only detected when we included related individuals too, a ‘family clan’ structure that is referred to as gamodemes. We conclude that the high percentage of greenery in Berlin provides sufficient habitat for hedgehogs to maintain connectivity across the city.AbstractWe use the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a mammal with limited mobility, as a model species to study whether the structural matrix of the urban environment has an influence on population genetic structure of such species in the city of Berlin (Germany). Using ten established microsatellite loci we genotyped 143 hedgehogs from numerous sites throughout Berlin. Inclusion of all individuals in the cluster analysis yielded three genetic clusters, likely reflecting spatial associations of kin (larger family groups, known as gamodemes). To examine the potential bias in the cluster analysis caused by closely related individuals, we determined all pairwise relationships and excluded close relatives before repeating the cluster analysis. For this data subset (N = 65) both clustering algorithms applied (Structure, Baps) indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. These results suggest that the high proportion of green patches in the city of Berlin provides numerous steppingstone habitats potentially linking local subpopulations. Alternatively, translocation of individuals across the city by hedgehog rescue facilities may also explain the existence of only a single cluster. We therefore propose that information about management activities such as releases by animal rescue centres should include location data (as exactly as possible) regarding both the collection and the release site, which can then be used in population genetic studies.

First, I review how researchers have defined and measured the quality of wildlife habitat over the past four decades. I then demonstrate a new approach to quantifying habitat quality by modeling habitat for the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis, RCW) across the Onslow Bight, a one million hectare region of North Carolina's coastal plain. Next, I describe the development and operation of a GIS toolbox for ArcGIS 9.3, called "Connect", designed to help conservation practitioners incorporate habitat connectivity considerations into land management and land-use planning. In two stakeholder-driven case studies, I use the Connect tools to prioritize private land parcels for connectivity conservation in fragmented habitats around Fort Bragg, NC, and evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed corridor in promoting dispersal for RCW in the face of urban development.

AB  - Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil.

AB  - O rio Leça tem uma bacia hidrográfica de 307.600 hectares sendo uma das linhas de água mais importantes da Área Metropolitana do Porto (AMP). Atravessa os concelhos de Santo Tirso, Valongo, Maia e Matosinhos, tendo o seu vale ocupação milenar, pelo que é alvo de contínua transformação, refletindo-se na paisagem do vale do Leça, a cada momento, a expressão no território da sociedade.A mobilidade é um dos fatores que mais contribui para a qualidade de vida na cidade. A mobilidade sustentável é hoje entendida como crucial para a sustentação das dinâmicas sociais e económicas da vida urbana. É nesta perspetiva que se considera ser necessário criar uma estrutura intermodal que atenda às necessidades de uso diário da população, sem descurar o recreio e o turismo e que atenda à compatibilização das características multifuncionais das deslocações e ao carácter da paisagem fluvial antrópica do rio Leça.Nestes termos, considera-se ser necessário definir um percurso destinado a ciclistas e peões ao longo do vale do rio Leça no concelho de Matosinhos, no entendimento de que este percurso contribuirá para a mobilidade sustentável no município, e que integrará também a preservação das áreas com elevado valor ecológico, cultural e paisagístico. Pretende-se que o percurso ao longo do Leça contribua para o reforço da identidade deste curso de água.Neste sentido propõe-se a definição do Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça que incluirá o percurso pedonal, ciclovia, margens do rio leça e interligações com a paisagem do vale e estruturas de mobilidade, numa proposta que visa consolidar as estratégias de mobilidade e de implementação de corredores verdes do concelho, promovendo-se a mobilidade sustentável e a Estrutura Ecológica Municipal.O programa a desenvolver para o Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça atenderá à requalificação das margens do rio Leça atendendo à recuperação das funções ecológicas e à valorização do património histórico, cultural e natural presente na paisagem.

He went into some detail, which I know some sectors are not going to like, but in all fairness we can't hide from this. Peter said: "The spread of urban development has a tremendous impact on all wildlife. Two developments near Cranbrook -- Wildstone and Shadow Mountain are located on winter range and now are in the City boundaries. Elk and deer which move out of Perry Creek and Lamb Creek in the late fall move to the St. Mary's and Wycliffe areas during the winter months.. Fragmentation of these low lying habitats, will displace elk and deer to less desirable areas, and increased recreational use of Crown Land surrounding private development will impact range quality. The controversial proposed I-block development will impact range used year-round by mule deer, some whitetail and elk. Their movement corridors will be disrupted in a big way. Up to 200 elk which graze on the City Irrigation fields during the night and early morning, move south to the I-block to bed during the day. Changing all of this is sure to increase wildlife problems within the City"

AB  - The fisher (Pekania pennanti) was found throughout Pennsylvania prior to the mid-1800s but were extirpated due to habitat loss and overharvest. The species was reintroduced in 1996 into Pennsylvania following New York and West Virginia in 1967 and 1983, respectively. A sampling of genetic material and point locations of these and other fishers began in 2002 across Pennsylvania and were used to discern source populations using 12 microsatellite loci.For my thesis, I used this dataset to develop gene flow and movement models within the Isolation by Resistance theory framework. The models were built and validated using a training and testing set method with 70% and 30% of the sample points, respectively. Two results that need investigation is the role of rural development as a positive factor for fisher movement and gene flow and possible movement corridors near Scranton, PA and the Kittatinny Ridge in south eastern Pennsylvania.

AB  - Today, most wild tigers live in small, isolated Protected Areas within human dominated landscapes in the Indian subcontinent. Future survival of tigers depends on increasing local population size, as well as maintaining connectivity between populations. While significant conservation effort has been invested in increasing tiger population size, few initiatives have focused on landscape-level connectivity and on understanding the effect different landscape elements have on maintaining connectivity. We combined individual-based genetic and landscape ecology approaches to address this issue in six protected areas with varying tiger densities and separation in the Central Indian tiger landscape. We non-invasively sampled 55 tigers from different protected areas within this landscape. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian genetic assignment tests indicate long-range tiger dispersal (on the order of 650 km) between protected areas. Further geo-spatial analyses revealed that tiger connectivity was affected by landscape elements such as human settlements, road density and host-population tiger density, but not by distance between populations. Our results elucidate the importance of landscape and habitat viability outside and between protected areas and provide a quantitative approach to test functionality of tiger corridors. We suggest future management strategies aim to minimize urban expansion between protected areas to maximize tiger connectivity. Achieving this goal in the context of ongoing urbanization and need to sustain current economic growth exerts enormous pressure on the remaining tiger habitats and emerges as a big challenge to conserve wild tigers in the Indian subcontinent.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I surveyed songbirds and lizards adjacent to dry rivers throughout metropolitan Tucson and related species richness to recreational use and habitat using stepwise multiple regression. Habitat characteristics included vegetation structure and floristics in river-edge areas, adjacent land uses, and land uses of the surrounding landscape.Bank stabilization had a negative effect on species richness of all bird groups. Total vegetation cover, mesquite (Prosopis velutina) density, and natural open space had a positive effect on species richness of most bird groups. Tall vegetation was important for species richness of lizards.River corridors could function as conservation corridors for five bird species and two lizard species. However, habitat for many other species was not continuous across the metropolitan area.Recommendations include protecting mesquite bosques without bank stabilization, protecting wide areas of upland vegetation near large protected areas, and increasing structural diversity and use of native plants in river parkways.

AB  - As far back as 1970, Eugene Odum, whose ecology textbooks are used in universities throughout North America, estimated that 40% of the State of Georgia should be managed as natural areas. Two years later, along with H.T. Odum, he suggested that managing half of southern Florida as natural area and half as cultural land was optimal. Currently, [Reed Noss] and [Michael Soule], while recognizing that each region must be assessed individually, suggest at least half of the land area of the 48 lower states be encompassed for management as wilderness areas. Given the fragmented condition of the United States, much of this land would have to be restored to wilderness through ecological regeneration, which would include, for example, the removal of roads, the removal of exotics and the replanting of native species. For areas in Canada that have more wild land remaining, they recommend higher targets. In British Columbia, [Jeff McNeely] (who has admitted making a mistake by recommending 12% protected areas to the Brundtland Commission) suggested 70% of land mass as protected areas as a reasonable figure for B.C. in his recent talk; "Biodiversity: New Ideas in Protected Areas". Obviously McNeely has been paying more attention to conservation biologists lately and so should we all.Habitat fragmentation, as Noss and others have shown, is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. It occurs when large areas of natural habitat are broken up into smaller, isolated pieces or "islands". In order to ensure biodiversity for the entire range of species, including genetic, species, ecosystem and landscape diversity, parks and protected areas must be connected to each other. Only in this way can evolutionary processes such as population dispersion and differentiation, gene pool flow and mixing, and mutation be maintained. Noss and Larry Harris have defined connectivity with respect to protected areas as a reserve system where individual reserves are functionally united into a whole thatis greater than the sum of its parts.A New Yorker, [Benton MacKaye] analyzed the "industrial water - shed" of New York City. At that time 75 years ago New York was the harbinger of the automobile age. MacKaye clearly understood the relationship of cities to wilderness. He saw the wilderness as containing both the psychological and natural forces needed to help stem the tide of civilization. For MacKaye, the "primeval world" contained the source of life itself. The biological and spiritual "key" to the restoration of New York's industrial watershed lay in the mountain wilderness of New England wilderness of those mountains. The Appalachian Trail built by hundreds local volunteer groups and individuals inspired by MacKaye's vision of the eastern mountains as the backbone of a regenerated Appalachia remains intact to - day. It may yet prove to be the "backbone" of ecological restoration in the eastern U.S.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Planning and Management
AB  - Increasing fragmentation is occurring in most valley floors in Alpine regions, where urbanization and infrastructure development are reducing connectivity among remnant natural areas. This undermines the conservation of alpine biodiversity. Using a landscape graph-based approach, we visualized and assessed the dispersal opportunities for three target species (Rana synk. esculenta, Erinaceus europaeus, Moscardinus avellanarius) on a municipal scale. We considered the barrier effect caused by landscape objects, such as linear infrastructures and artificial land covers. Species-specific barrier effects were estimated through a Delphi survey involving 25 experts. The information collected was then used to draw a landscape graph of local connections and to estimate the functioning of the networks of habitat patches in terms of their capability of sustaining local populations of target species. The methodology was applied in an alpine valley floor in Trentino, northern Italy, and resulted in the mapping of all possible and remnant linkages between habitat patches in its current state. The approach may provide a better qualitative understanding of the impacts of proposed land-use changes, and was found to be particularly helpful in contexts where availability of data is limited.

AU  - Ford, Adam
T2  - PeerJ PrePrints
AB  - After decades of persecution, large carnivores are returning to human-occupied landscapes in many areas of North America and Europe. To ensure the safety of both people and wildlife, we need to understand how these animals perceive and select habitat as they navigate through developed area. Here, I investigate habitat selection by wolves and cougars in a 20,000 km2 landscape characterized by a marked gradient of urban and industrial development. I used data from over 15,000 km of wolf and cougar movement pathways, and from over 750 kill sites made by these two predators. These data were collected during the past 22 winters in Banff National Park (Alberta, Canada) and environs. Using GIS software, I created habitat selection models by comparing ‘used’ resources (e.g., topography, habitat type) found along movement pathways and at kill sites, with random points located <500 m from used sites. I then incorporated the results of these habitat selection models into a connectivity analysis to quantify the predicted flow of both movement and predation across the landscape. These results illustrate the extent to which ‘connectivity’ depends on species (e.g., cougars vs. wolves), behavior (movement vs. foraging), and proximity to people. These results are being used to inform policy on land-use planning in areas where large carnivores and people co-exist.

AB  - Large populations of free-roaming cats (FRCs) generate ongoing concerns for welfare of both individual animals and populations, for human public health, for viability of native wildlife populations, and for local ecological damage. Managing FRC populations is a complex task, without universal agreement on best practices. Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic. This is the first demographic simulation analysis to consider the use of temporary contraception and account for the realities of FRC dispersal and owned cat abandonment.

He went into some detail, which I know some sectors are not going to like, but in all fairness we can't hide from this. Peter said: "The spread of urban development has a tremendous impact on all wildlife. Two developments near Cranbrook -- Wildstone and Shadow Mountain are located on winter range and now are in the City boundaries. Elk and deer which move out of Perry Creek and Lamb Creek in the late fall move to the St. Mary's and Wycliffe areas during the winter months.. Fragmentation of these low lying habitats, will displace elk and deer to less desirable areas, and increased recreational use of Crown Land surrounding private development will impact range quality. The controversial proposed I-block development will impact range used year-round by mule deer, some whitetail and elk. Their movement corridors will be disrupted in a big way. Up to 200 elk which graze on the City Irrigation fields during the night and early morning, move south to the I-block to bed during the day. Changing all of this is sure to increase wildlife problems within the City"

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species’ range; yet it is possible that P. regilla, like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships for P. regilla in a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explained P. regilla occupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to support P. regilla if they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

En el departamento del Valle del Cauca, Colombia, dos corredores viales, en distintas etapas de desarrollo, comunican a la ciudad de Cali con el puerto de Buenaventura. Para evaluar y cuantificar los impactos que tienen estas carreteras en las poblaciones silvestres de fauna de la zona se desarrolló un proyecto de investigación en dos fases: modelación de corredores y validación en campo. Las interacciones entre las poblaciones de fauna silvestre y estos corredores viales fueron evaluadas y cuantificadas a partir del modelamiento de corredores con información proveniente de los sistemas de información geográfica (SIG) respaldados por datos tomados en campo sobre estructuras de drenaje, atropellamientos y registros de fototrampeo. Se identificaron cuatro zonas prioritarias de cruce para nueve especies de mamíferos. Tras evaluar 738 estructuras viales, se registraron 19 especies utilizando estas estructuras y 38 especies fueron atropelladas en ambas carreteras. Dichas vías difieren en estructuras y trazados, sin embargo, comparten sus problemáticas como la falta de estructuras viales preexistentes adecuadas para el paso de fauna, su uso como refugio y el desarrollo poco estructurado en su periferia son las causas del efecto de barrera que limita la conectividad y flujo génico de animales en esta zona.

AB  - Relationships between isolating land use and amphibian populations in sub-boreal peatlands of the Midwestern United States  Jeana Albers  Master of Science in Biology  Minnesota State University, Mankato  Mankato, Minnesota, 2014  Successful conservation efforts of amphibians depend on the knowledge of habitat preferences because the biggest threat to amphibian populations is considered to be habitat loss.  Sub-boreal peatlands in the Midwest may be a refuge for amphibian populations, but little is known about the flora and fauna of these peatlands.  My study examined amphibian species richness and species diversity in 17 sub-boreal peatlands in Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2011 and 2012.  I assessed the relationship between land use of lands adjacent to peatlands and use of those peatlands by amphibian populations at three spatial scales by examining landscapes surrounding peatlands in circles with radii of  500, 1000, and 2500 m.  I tested for linear relationships of both species richness and species diversity with habitat variables including peatland area, aqueous pH, geographic isolation, canopy cover, and the proportions of forest and isolating land use (agricultural and urban) in the three radii. I hypothesized that high levels of isolating land use isolate peatlands via habitat loss and degradation of surrounding land.  I predicted that species richness and diversity would be low in peatlands that experienced high levels of agricultural and urban land use because they were more isolated.  I found no support for my prediction for the correlation of isolating land use with lower amphibian diversity and    richness, but isolation was an important indicator of species richness, with more isolated peatlands having fewer species present.  Canopy cover was also an important predictor of species richness at all three spatial scales in 2012, with greater canopy cover correlating with lower species richness.  Other studies corroborate my findings in regard to isolation and canopy cover having negative effects on amphibian populations, and because of this and my findings, I suggest that conservation efforts for amphibians in sub-boreal peatlands be focused on maintaining connectivity between peatlands, and prioritize those that have little canopy cover to be refuges for remaining populations.

TI  - Urban Alaskan Moose: An Analysis of Factors Associated with Moose-Vehicle Collisions
AU  - McDonald, Lucian R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As human populations continue to grow and encroach into wildlife habitats, instances of human-wildlife conflict are on the rise. Increasing numbers of reported wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) provide tangible evidence of anthropogenic impacts on wildlife as well as increasing threats to human health and safety. Increasing WVCs are of particular concern, especially those involving large-bodied ungulates such as moose (Alces spp.), because of the increased risk of property damage, personal injuries, and human fatalities. Motorists directly involved in a WVC are at risk of injury or mortality, but other motorists are also put at risk due to road obstructions and traffic congestion associated with WVCs. Mitigating these impacts on motorists and wildlife requires investigation into the temporal and spatial factors leading to WVCs.In Alaska, most WVCs involve moose (Alces alces), a large bodied ungulate capable of threatening human life when involved in a collision. Each moose-vehicle collision (MVC) in Alaska is estimated to cost $33,000 in damages. With this analysis, I analyzed the plethora of factors contributing to moose and motorist occurrence on the road system and motorist detection based on a historical dataset of MVC reports throughout Alaska from 2000 to 2012 and a dataset of field-derived measurements at MVC locations within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough from 2016 to 2018. My first analysis focused on the daily and annual trends in MVC rates as compared to expected moose and human behavioral patterns with a focus on guiding mitigation strategies. Fifty percent of the MVCs reported between 2000 and 2012 occurred where the commuter rush hours overlapped with dusk and dawn in winter, and the artificial lighting differences between boroughs suggest a link between artificial lighting and reduced MVCs.To focus more specifically on roadside features contributing to MVC risk, I collected and analyzed local and regional scale land cover and road geometry data at reported MVC sites in an area with a rapidly growing human population. I compared these data to similar data collected at random locations near documented MVC sites and at locations where moose that were fitted with global-positioning system (GPS) transmitters crossed highways. I used generalized additive mixed models to delineate which of the variables impacted the risk of both moose road crossings and MVCs. Moose road crossings were influenced by approximations of spatial, seasonal, and daily moose density as well as the proportion of deciduous-coniferous and coniferous forest in the area and the number of possible corridor or land cover types surrounding the site. The best MVC risk model was described by expected seasonal and daily changes in moose density and local scale measurements, including the sinuosity of the road, the height of vegetation near the road, and the angle between the road surface and the roadside. Together this information should guide transportation and urban planners in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to use roadside vegetation removal, seasonal speed reduction, improved lighting strategies, dynamic signage, or partnerships with mobile mapping services to reactively reduce MVCs and to focus future road planning in areas with lower moose abundance and build roads that increase visibility and detection distances in areas where moose are common.

The first part of the research investigates the relationship between forest bird abundance and the surrounding landscape characteristics, especially, forest area and its spatial configuration in urban regions at multiple scales. The results are similar for simple and multiple regression analyses across three scales. The percentage of forest cover in a landscape is positively correlated with bird abundance with some thresholds. Overall, the percentage of forest cover in the landscape, contrast-weighted forest edge density, and the similarity of land cover types to forest cover are identified as important for the conservation of the target bird species.

TI  - Enhancing Habitat Connectivity in Fragmented Landscapes: Spatial Modeling of Wildlife Crossing Structures in Transportation Networks
AU  - Downs, Joni A

T2  - Annals of the Association of American Geographers
AB  - Roads fragment habitat and pose a variety of threats to wildlife by restricting their physical movements or causing direct mortality. Wildlife crossing structures can mitigate some of these effects by simultaneously connecting fragmented habitat and reducing collisions between animals and traffic. This research develops two classes of spatial models for optimally locating crossing structures in situations where the goal is to connect discrete habitat patches that are fragmented by roads. The first group of models uses variations of minimum spanning forest (MSF) problems to select crossing structure locations in scenarios where the goal is to connect all habitat patches in the landscape. This article explores three variations: distance-based, intersection-weighted, and component-based MSFs. The second set of models includes newly developed integer programs with objectives that maximize interpatch connectivity given a fixed number of crossing structures. One of these integer programs maximizes overall connectivity in a landscape, and the other maximizes the connectivity of patches to a core reserve. We illustrated the models using hypothetical landscapes and applied them to a case study where the goal is to connect vernal pool habitat for amphibians. Results of the applications guide a discussion of the relative merits of each approach for meeting various conservation goals related to improving habitat connectivity in fragmented landscapes. More broadly, this article develops an analytical framework for dealing with habitat connectivity issues due to road network fragmentation as well as a new neighborhood graph and several spatial models.

AB  - Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and surprising ways. Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation‐funded Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of “populations and communities.” The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long‐term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scientific ecology that have significant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50–100 yr as human and environmental drivers influencing specific ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, five themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the “connectivity” theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi‐scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land‐use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and flows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long‐term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion. Increased connectivity due to warming can also lead to species range expansions or contractions and the introduction of undesirable species. Continued long‐term studies are essential for addressing the complexities of connectivity. The diversity of ecosystems within the LTER network is a strong platform for these studies.

TI  - IMPACT OF COAL MINING, THERMAL PLANTS, ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES ON WILDLIFE CORRIDORS FOR NATIONAL PARKS AND WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES IN THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH, INDIA
AU  - Galodha, A

AB  - To the rampant rise in urban settlements and human population, the national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and national tiger reserves of middle and southern India have been intruded upon by human settlements regularly. These are adjoined by paths called as ‘wildlife corridors’ especially the tiger and elephant corridors which are used as a means for migration. Bandipur and Pench-Satpuda national parks have one such essential pocket of wildlife corridors the Bandipur corridor interconnects the population of 8000 plus elephants between Mysuru and Wayanad in southern India whereas the Pench-Satpuda corridor sustains 120 plus tigers between Pench-Satpuda Tiger Reserve in middle India. To assess this it’s imperative to assess the pattern of wildlife movements, changes in the animal habitats in terms of habitat cluster zones, land-use changes, the onset of human settlements and anthropogenic activities are to be monitored. For this, land use land cover (LULC) changes for these corridors were analyzed across two decades using geospatial and remote sensing technique. The study finds a organized deprivation of dense forests and open forests respectively, thus indicating large-scale destruction. The study also found the net area changes of dense forests and open forests which were diverted for agriculture activities indicating extensive encroachment of forest land for human settlement. The classification was monitored for water bodies that have reduced, indicating shrinkage during the duration under research. The existence of substantial coal deposits in the wildlife corridor and operational coal mining in the proximity of the wildlife corridor is a matter of grave concern which has been highlighted in the research. We examine to identify long-term sustenance and protection of such corridors for preserving the natural habitat. Thus, with such suitability in wildlife monitoring, we can mark an increasing need for adaptable, tenable, and secure wildlife management as illustrated under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 15 mentioned under United Nations).

TI  - The effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in Southern California
AU  - Alonso, Robert Scott
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat destruction and degradation is a serious threat to biodiversity, and urbanization and road development are driving factors in habitat loss. As the human footprint continues to expand, the natural landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and human development can create barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow. Carnivores in particular are sensitive to fragmentation and may be used as model animals for understanding how roads and urbanization can fragment wildlife populations. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern California. Since southern California is one of the most populous areas of the country, coupled with high biodiversity, it is a unique area to study the effects of road development and urbanization on carnivores.  In the first chapter, I estimate the density of bobcats in a coastal reserve isolated by urbanization using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques with camera trap data. The use of camera trap data to estimate carnivore abundance is increasingly common, and to date many such studies have utilized a mark-recapture framework and focused on carnivores with unique pelage patterns. The recent improvement of mark-resight estimators, however, provides an opportunity to estimate the abundance of carnivores without unique pelage patterns. We utilized both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks to estimate bobcat population sizes in a geographically isolated urban reserve in southern California. Due to their sensitivities to urban fragmentation, bobcats have been a focal species in several studies throughout southern California, yet few population estimates exist for this region. Since bobcats are individually identifiable, and a subset of the study population was physically marked with GPS telemetry collars, we were able to compare the utility of both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks for carnivore population estimation with camera trap data. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the study area and recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights from July 2006 through January 2007. Density point estimates were reasonably consistent with prior studies and ranged from 0.40 to 0.55 bobcats per km2 depending upon the estimator used, but the confidence intervals for all estimates overlapped suggesting that they were not significantly different. Percent confidence interval length ranged from 150% to 180% indicating a low amount of precision for all of our estimates. We conclude that mark-resight estimators performed comparably to the mark-recapture estimators and show promise for use with camera trap data to estimate carnivore population sizes. The low precision for both our mark-recapture and mark-resight estimators, however, highlights the sensitivity of both frameworks to small datasets typical of large carnivore studies. In future studies, it will be important to develop techniques to increase capture probabilities of target species to maximize the utility of camera traps for estimating population sizes.  In the second chapter, I evaluate the effects of a road expansion and mitigation project on underpass usage of three target species: bobcat, coyote and mule deer. Roads can negatively impact wildlife, particularly large mammals. In response, transportation agencies have implemented mitigation measures like the installation of wildlife fencing and wildlife crossing structures. The evaluation of these mitigation measures is crucial to determine the success of reducing road impacts. Herein, we evaluate a road expansion and mitigation project completed by the California Department of Transportation along State Route 71 (CA-71) through the Chino Hills southeast of Los Angeles. We designed a remote camera survey to study how the widening of CA-71 and implementation of mitigation measures affected large mammal movement and underpass use. Based on camera detections, bobcat underpass use was higher in the construction and mitigation zone after construction than before, but there was no difference in use of underpasses in the impact compared to the control zone in either time period. Underpass use by coyotes was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use between the before and after periods. Small numbers of mule deer detections at few underpasses precluded a comparison between the control and impact zones, but a comparison of before and after periods revealed that mule deer underpass use was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigation efforts, and other factors, such as habitat availability, urbanization, or demography, may have also influenced underpass use along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in traffic volume, mitigation structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and hence connectivity across the roadway for the target species.

TI  - Investigating the small public urban open spaces at high-density cities: a case study of hong kong
AU  - Lau, Hiu Ming
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Many researches have shown that urban parks can enhance the quality of life, which is a key factor of building a sustainable city. Hong Kong, as one of the most densely populated financial city in the world, has severely low urban park density. Instead, a large number of small public urban open spaces (SPUOS) are scattered within the city fabrics. This paper therefore aims to study the design and functions of these SPUOS. It is also hoped that find out whether a network of connected small open spaces can compensate for a large urban park. After reviewing the history of urban parks in Hong Kong. It is believed that the multitude of SPUOS is the result of poor urban planning and imperfect urban renewal schemes during the early occupation by the British Government. These SPUOS are usually around 1000 to 1500 m2 large in size and can be abundantly found along adjacent streets. For the design of the SPUOS, benches are usually the only facility installed and the vegetation is of poor quality. The connectivity of SPUOS located within the study area in the Yau Tsim Mong District is investigated with the use of graph theory and connectivity indices. The result has shown that these SPUOS in the study area have a high degree of connectivity. They are further compared with a larger urban park located nearby. Based on the comparisons and other prior researches, a conclusion has been drawn that size of a park is not the major concern of park users but rather its facilities and design. It is believed that a network of connected SPUOS might serve the local community better due to their locations. However, they should not be able to entirely replace large urban parks since they have fewer amenities provided. The SPUOS are found to have rather different functions to the society than what urban parks are commonly expected. Their environment and economic functions are constrained mainly by the poor design and the locations. An interview with the representative of a non-government organization has been made to further understand their social functions. The interviewee believes that SPUOS now mainly act as social hubs and living rooms for senior citizens. This statement is then verified by the result of a prior survey and some other researches. This is due to the combination of aging population structure, exploding population growth, and expanding poverty gap. Lastly, a comparative study has been made on the small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Copenhagen. The SPUGS can attract visitors of different age group from other far neighborhoods. Despite than fact that there is cultural difference and citizens from these two cities have different lifestyles, a better design of the pocket park might be the reason of why it becomes an attractive natural meeting point in the central Copenhagen for all age-groups visitors. Based on all the investigations and findings, suggestions have been made to improve the quality of SPUOS in Hong Kong.

TI  - Avian use of suburban greenways as stopover habitat
AU  - Kohut, Salina M
AU  - Hess, George R
AU  - Moorman, Christopher E
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Greenways may provide stopover habitat for migrating birds in otherwise inhospitable suburban landscapes. We examined the effect of greenway forested corridor width, vegetation composition and structure, and adjacent land cover on the species richness and abundance of migrating songbirds during spring and fall migration in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Generally, migrating birds were more abundant in wider forest corridors during spring and fall migration. During the spring, migrants were detected more commonly in greenways with taller trees and a higher percentage of hardwood trees. In the fall, migrant richness and abundance was highest in greenways with lower canopy cover, possibly because of the increased vertical complexity of the vegetation at these sites. Forest-interior migrant richness was not correlated with corridor width in either season, but these species were more abundant in greenways bordered by less bare earth and pavement cover in the spring. No other bird groupings were correlated with adjacent land cover measures. Although migrants used greenways of all widths, forested corridors wider than 150 m should be conserved whenever possible to provide stopover habitat for forest-interior migrants. Shrub cover should be retained to maintain vegetative complexity. Habitat for the greatest diversity of migrants can be provided by constructing greenways in areas of lower development intensity and encouraging residents to retain shrubs and trees on properties bordering greenways.

TI  - Metapopulation dynamics of oysters: sources, sinks, and implications for conservation and restoration
AU  - Theuerkauf, Seth J
AU  - Puckett, Brandon J
AU  - Eggleston, David B
T2  - Ecosphere
AB  - Metapopulation and source–sink dynamics are increasingly considered within spatially explicit management of wildlife populations, yet the application of these concepts has generally been limited to comparisons of the performance (e.g., demographic rates or dispersal) inside vs. outside protected areas, and at spatial scales that do not encompass an entire metapopulation. In the present study, a spatially explicit, size‐structured matrix model was applied to simulate the dynamics of an Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) metapopulation in the second largest estuary in the United States—the Albemarle‐Pamlico Estuarine System in North Carolina. The model integrated larval dispersal simulations with empirical measures of oyster demographic rates to simulate the dynamics of the entire oyster metapopulation consisting of 646 reefs and five reef types: (1) restored subtidal reefs closed to harvest (i.e., sanctuaries or protected areas; n = 14), (2) restored subtidal reefs open to harvest (n = 53), (3) natural subtidal reefs open to harvest (n = 301), (4) natural intertidal reefs open to harvest (n = 129), and (5) oyster reefs on manmade, hard structures such as seawalls (n = 149). Key findings included (1) an overall stable, yet slightly declining oyster metapopulation, (2) variable reef type‐specific population trajectories, largely dependent on spatiotemporal variation in larval recruitment, (3) a greater relative importance of inter‐reef larval connectivity on metapopulation dynamics than local larval retention processes, and (4) spatiotemporal variation in the source–sink status of reef subpopulations wherein subtidal sanctuaries and reefs located in the northeastern portion of the estuary were frequent sources. From a management perspective, continued protection of oyster sanctuaries is warranted. Sanctuaries represented only 6.2% of the total reef area, however, they harbored 19% (± 2%) of all oysters and produced 25% (± 6%) of all larvae settling within the metapopulation. Additional management priorities should focus on restoration or conservation of subpopulations that serve as frequent source subpopulations (including those with poor demographic rates, but high connectivity potential), and management of harvest from sink subpopulations. The application of a source–sink framework and similar integrated modeling approach could inform management of oysters in other systems, as well as other species that exhibit similar metapopulation characteristics.

TI  - Conservation Status Of Lwafi Game Reserve, Tanzania
AU  - Martin, Andimile
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Rich in biodiversity, Tanzania's protected areas (PAs) are internationally recognized as of primary conservation value. Biodiversity loss continues, however, and limited understanding of ecological stocks and limited funding for management are making it harder to plan and carry out conservation activities.  Lwafi Game Reserve (GR) is an important part of the conservation network in western Tanzania that falls in the Katavi - Rukwa ecosystem in Rukwa Region, Tanzania. I examined the role of Lwafi GR in protecting wildlife and facilitating movements between Katavi National Park (NP) and Loasi and Kalambo Forest Reserves (FRs). In particular I assessed the abundance and distribution of Lwafi GR mammals, determined signs of movements of mammals between Lwafi GR and Loasi and Kalambo FRs and possibly further into Zambia, established and quantified threats to the survival of wildlife in Lwafi GR, and determined perceived and real boundaries of Lwafi GR.   My findings show that farming, hunting, logging and charcoal production take place inside and around the Reserves. Farming is dominant on the western boundaries especially adjacent to Loasi and Kalambo FRs both inside and around the border of the Reserves. The intensity of livestock incursion is similar between the eastern and western sides of the Reserves, but livestock graze more around the border on the western side than the eastern side of the Reserves. Additionally, I find that the distance from village settlements to the Reserves is much more important in determining the occurrence of human activities inside and around the PAs than the distance to town/market.     For the ecological part of the study, I found 38 species of mammals in the surveyed area. The mammals are more abundant in the northern part of Lwafi GR (Lyazumbi - Kabwe and Kakoma - Ninde transects) than in the south (Namanyere - Kipili, China - Wampembe and King'ombe - Kala transects).  The presence of some species declined with the distance from the nearest village center, some increased, and others did not change. Most of the species that showed a decline - eland (Taurotragus oryx), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), roan (Hippotragus equinus ), blue duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), and dik dik (Madoqua kirkii) - could be attributed to hunting since they are consumed by locals; however some edible species did not demonstrate this trend. These species include buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bush buck (Tragelaphus scriptus), klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) and bush rat (Thryonomys). Generally species including elephant (Loxodonta africana) were found throughout Lwafi GR with some declines towards the southern part of the GR, possibly due to the availability of food, shelter and cover. In particular, species such as African palm civet (Nandinia binotata), bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), lion (Panthera leo), reedbuck (Redunca arundinum), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), topi ( Damaliscus korrigum) and zebra (Equus quagga),were seen in Lwafi GR only in the dry season and disappeared in the wet season. These species either migrated to Katavi NP during the wet season or are less detectable during that time.    I conclude that Lwafi GR is facing acute anthropogenic pressures. Additionally, Lwafi GR is an important depository for wildlife and a potential area for developing tourism; the presence of carnivores such as lion, aardvark ( Orycteropus afer), black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas ), leopard (Panthera pardus), and wild dog (Lycaon pictus) can offer a special attraction to tourists. This could be complimented by Kalambo Falls at the Tanzania - Zambia border.   I suggest that the Tanzania government should consider enlarging the size of Lwafi GR and that the Mahale - Katavi corridor be upgraded to a Wildlife Management Area (WMA), a status that ensures management by local people. Finally, there should be periodic ecological surveys in order to have long-term records on animal as well as other biodiversity in Lwafi GR. With regard to connectivity to Zambia's PAs, I suggest that wildlife authorities on both sides consider the protection of a wildlife corridor to Nsumbu NP in Zambia.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Assessment of biodiversity conservation importance in the beibu gulf economic region of the hainan province
AU  - Zhang, Cheng Qiang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBiodiversity conservation is a global focus, and biodiversity assessment is the basis of the biodiversity assessment and management. To obtain precisebiodiversity information is a foundation of scientific decision-making for biodiversity conservation. The broadscale biodiversity assessment has alread-y become an urgent problem in the study and administration of biodiversi-ty. In this paper, we will search the literature and establish the species data, analyze the global regional biodiversity assessment in conservation imp-ortance, make up the biodiversity assessment index system and the compr-ehensive biodiversity assessment method on the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province, so, we can do the biodiversity assessment of the Beibu Gulf of Hainan. Finally, according to the results of the assessment and the development plan of Beibu Gulf of Hainan, we can give out the pertinently advice and measures about the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan Province. The results were as follows: 1. After the research of the home and abroad regional biodiversity assessment in conservation importance, we formulate the biodiversity assessment index system of the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province, including six indicators: species richness consisted by the wild higher animals and plants species richness, diversity of ecosystem types, completeness of vertical stratification of vegetation, endemism, extent of threatened species and extent of alien species invasion. 2. Through the comprehensive biodiversity assessment method, we can obtain the results of the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province by county level; at last, the assessment results were classified into three grades. Changjiang, Ledong is the classⅠmeaning boast highly rich in biodiversity of the assessment as the highly rich not only in species and diversity of ecosystem types, but the endemism and the extent of threatened species; the biodiversity index(BI) is Ledong>Changjiang. Haikou, Danzhou and Dongfang is classⅡ what is boast quite high biodiversity as the quite high rich not only in diversity of ecosystem types and species, but the endemism and the extent of threatened species; and they have somewhere highly rich in species. Chengmai and Lingao have moderate biodiversity with the moderate rich with class Ⅲ on behalf of diversity of ecosystem types and species, including the endemism and the extent of threatened species; and they have somewhere moderate rich in species, the BI is Chengmai>and Lingao. These data are consistent with the actual biodiversity status, and generally reflect the distribution of biodiversity in Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province. 3. On the basis of the results of the assessment and the development plan of Beibu Gulf of Hainan, we can make out the pertinently advice and measures about the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan Province. The primary measures are as follows: to carry out the investigation of biodiversity in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province. Biodiversity impact assessment and ecological compensation are needed in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan especially in the West Industial Corridor including Lingao, Danzhou, Changjiang, Dongfang. We should enhance the precaution and remedy about the alien species invasion especially in the Chengmai and Lingao which are developed under agriculture. Tourist city like the Haikou and Ledong have to strengthen the scientific exploitation and coordinated management which is more obvious comprised the increase of the management level of the nature reserve especially the national nature

AB  - Facilitating coexistence between people and wildlife is a major conservation challenge in East Africa. Some conservation models aim to balance the needs of people and wildlife, but the effectiveness of these models is rarely assessed. Using a case‐study approach, we assessed the ecological performance of a pastoral area in northern Tanzania (Manyara Ranch) and established a long‐term wildlife population monitoring program (carried out intermittently from 2003 to 2008 and regularly from 2011 to 2019) embedded in a distance sampling framework. By comparing density estimates of the road transect‐based long‐term monitoring to estimates derived from systematically distributed transects, we found that the bias associated with nonrandom placement of transects was nonsignificant. Overall, cattle and sheep and goat reached the greatest densities and several wildlife species occurred at densities similar (zebra, wildebeest, waterbuck, Kirk's dik‐dik) or possibly even greater (giraffe, eland, lesser kudu, Grant's gazelle, Thomson's gazelle) than in adjacent national parks in the same ecosystem. Generalized linear mixed models suggested that most wildlife species (8 out of 14) reached greatest densities during the dry season, that wildlife population densities either remained constant or increased over the 17‐year period, and that herbivorous livestock species remained constant, while domestic dog population decreased over time. Cross‐species correlations did not provide evidence for interference competition between grazing or mixed livestock species and wildlife species but indicate possible negative relationships between domestic dog and warthog populations. Overall, wildlife and livestock populations in Manyara Ranch appear to coexist over the 17‐year span. Most likely, this is facilitated by existing connectivity to adjacent protected areas, effective anti‐poaching efforts, spatio‐temporal grazing restrictions, favorable environmental conditions of the ranch, and spatial heterogeneity of surface water and habitats. This long‐term case study illustrates the potential of rangelands to simultaneously support wildlife conservation and human livelihood goals if livestock grazing is restricted in space, time, and numbers.

TI  - Applying Landscape Ecology in Biological Conservation
T2  - Applying Landscape Ecology in Biological Conservation
AB  - Landscape ecology and conservation biology are rapidly developing disciplines, and a current synthesis of principles and applications in these two fields is needed under one cover. Many managers are not applying principles of landscape ecology in efforts to conserve biota, yet the loss of biological diversity could be reduced if broad-scale processes and patterns were consistently considered in management and conservation decisions. Bringing together insights from leaders in landscape ecology and conservation biology, this book explains how our knowledge about landscape ecology can help us understand, manage and maintain biodiversity. Beyond explaining pertinent concepts of landscape ecology and biological conservation and describing examples of their use in management, research and planning, this book also distills principles for applying landscape ecology in conservation, identifies gaps in current knowledge and provides research approaches to fill those voids. The book is divided into five parts: the first part introduces the book and discusses what landscape ecology is and why it is important to biological conservation. The second deals with multiple scales, connectivity and organism movement. The third part discusses landscape change and how this affects biodiversity, and the fourth part covers conservation planning. The final part presents a synthesis that identifies overarching principles, pervasive constraints and realistic prospects for applying landscape ecology in biological conservation. Conservationists, land-use planners, and ecologists will find this book to be an essential resource. Foreword by Richard T.T. Forman.

TI  - Movement Patterns in the Southern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in Urbanized and Rural Environments
AU  - Howard, Jeremy
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the human population continues to grow, urbanization and expansion continue into untouched areas causing fragmentation of forests. Fragmentation restructures a landscape and impacts a variety of flora and fauna, including small mammals. Fitness effects on small mammals caused by forest fragmentation is nuanced, but is negative overall. The New World flying squirrels (genus Glaucomys) in particular, with their direct link to forest trees for food, shelter, and travel, make a good model to understand the effects of fragmentation on forest mammals. This study examined the southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in urban and rural fragments in southwestern Illinois. Urban study sites were the three forest patches on the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) campus: Bluebell Woods, Sweet William Woods, and the Western Corridor. The rural study site is privately-owned land north of Edwardsville, IL (McCracken Woods). Squirrels were collared and tracked using radio-telemetry both nocturnally and diurnally. Nighttime tracking was done to establish home range sizes. Daytime tracking was used to determine nesting tree preference. It was predicted that (1) home range sizes will be greater for males than females, (2) trees selected for nesting will be predominantly hard mast trees and (3) of larger size (diameter), and (4) squirrel dispersal will be limited between patches. Home ranges were determined via two methods: 95% minimum convex polygon and 95% kernel estimator. A two-sample equal variance t-test was used to determine differences in male and female home range sizes. General comparisons for home range sizes were also done for site as well as in the context of other studies. Nesting tree preferences for hard mast vs. soft mast were tested via Fisher’s exact test.  Nesting tree diameter size preferences were tested via a Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit test. Gap crossing potential was determined via trigonometric calculations. Male squirrel home range sizes were not significantly different from female home range sizes. The minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach indicated squirrels on the SIUE campus had smaller home range sizes than those in McCracken Woods. The 95% kernel density estimator (KDE) indicated no difference among sites. Home ranges in the study were among the lowest described for both MCP and KDE. Low home range estimates may be due in part to some squirrels having a low number of observations (minimum = 5). Flying squirrels selected soft mast trees for nesting significantly more than expected. This preference may be due to greater cavity availability or food source seasonality. Tree size preferences were found to be significant in regard to medium and large trees (> 40 cm diameter) versus small trees (< 40 cm diameter). The finding of larger tree usage was consistent with most other studies. Finally, one male flying squirrel was found to cross between forest patches on the SIUE campus. This dispersal event involved crossing from the Western Corridor to Sweet William Woods through a gap bisected by a road. The most likely route was via a peninsula of trees that extended outward from the Western Corridor. This gap could have been crossed successfully through the air by flying squirrels with near average glide angles. Fire resistant tree plantings should occur to encourage successful crossing by more squirrels. Such a course of action will aid in reconnecting fragmented habitat patches for southern flying squirrels within the campus area. This study on movement patterns in southern flying squirrels in fragmented habitat can inform management practices throughout Illinois with potential benefits for other forest species.

AB  - Sustainable land-use planning should consider large-scale landscape connectivity. Commonly-used species-specific connectivity models are difficult to generalize for a wide range of taxa. In the context of multi-functional land-use planning, there is growing interest in species-agnostic approaches, modelling connectivity as a function of human landscape modification. We propose a conceptual framework, apply it to model connectivity as current density across Alberta, Canada, and assess map sensitivity to modelling decisions. We directly compared the uncertainty related to (1) the definition of the degree of human modification, (2) the decision whether water bodies are considered barriers to movement, and (3) the scaling function used to translate degree of human modification into resistance values. Connectivity maps were most sensitive to the consideration of water as barrier to movement, followed by the choice of scaling function, whereas maps were more robust to different conceptualizations of the degree of human modification. We observed higher concordance among cells with high (standardized) current density values than among cells with low values, which supports the identification of cells contributing to larger-scale connectivity based on a cut-off value. We conclude that every parameter in species-agnostic connectivity modelling requires attention, not only the definition of often-criticized expert-based degrees of human modification.

TI  - The effectiveness of urban space corridors in meeting recreational habitat and wildlife needs (BL)
AU  - Briffett. C.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Urban space corridors can be defined as linear tracts of undeveloped, vegetated land located in city centres and suburbs that accommodate the recreational needs of human users and the refugia requirements of wildlife. This research study investigated the planning, design, use and management of urban corridors in many locations throughout the world.  The hypothesis selected for the study was to determine if managed recreational use is compatible with habitat conservation and wildlife occurrence in open space corridor systems. To do this detailed site based surveys were conducted in Singapore and many completed corridor systems in the United Kingdom were investigated for selection criteria, design parameters and management practices. Other locations and corridors schemes were also researched in the literature and site visits were made to Australia, New Zealand, South African and America. The partially completed island-wide network of park connectors in Singapore provided a suitable resource for an on site assessment of recreational use, bird occurrence and corridor maintenance and management.It was determined that there was strong public support for and enthusiastic use of corridor trails and that good opportunities were available for improving biodiversity. Whilst there is still doubt on the viability of corridor resources to act as conduits for wildlife they are effective as wildlife refuges subject to habitat design. In cases where corridors are narrow or even partially disconnected continuity of recreational trails is considered important to achieve. For wildlife, such as birds, their general mobility tends to overcome minor fragmentation effects. The importance of the matrix that comprises the surrounding land adjoining the corridors was established for wildlife (birds), especially where corridors are narrow or are closely encroached by densely built developments such as city centres. Compatibility between recreational use and bird occurrence was determined through the surveys and a comparative evaluative framework was devised for ten corridor locations in Singapore to include environment, habitat and maintenance characteristics.

AB  - Managers are moving towards implementing large-scale coastal ecosystem restoration projects, however, many fail to achieve desired outcomes. Among the key reasons for this are a lack of integration with a whole-of-catchment approach, the scale of the project (temporal, spatial), the requirement for on-going costs for maintenance, lack of clear objectives, a focus on threats rather than services/values, funding cycles, engagement or change in stakeholders, and prioritization of project sites. Here we critically assess the outcomes of activities in three coastal wetland complexes positioned along the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon, Australia, that have been subjected to restoration investment over a number of decades. Each floodplain has been modified by intensive agricultural production, heavy industry and mining infrastructure, urban/peri urban expansion, aquaculture development and infrastructure expansion. Most development has occurred in low-lying coastal floodplains, resulting in major hydrological modifications to the landscape. This has left the floodplain wetlands in a degraded and hydrologically modified state, with poor water quality (hypoxic, eutrophication, sedimentation, and persistent turbidity), loss of habitat, and disconnected because of flow hydraulic barriers, excessive aquatic plant growth, or establishment of invasive species. Successful GBR wetland ecosystem restoration and management must first include an understanding of what constitutes ‘success' and be underpinned by understanding of complex cause and effect pathways, with a focus on management of services and values. This approach should recognize these wetlands are still assets in a modified landscape. Suitable, long term, scientific knowledge is necessary to provide government and private companies with the confidence and comfort that their investment delivers dividend (environmental) returns.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Urban RiversStormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Ecology of Carnivorous Species in Urban Ecosystems: Are they Adapted?
AU  - Ribeiro, Stefan Martins
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Com o atual crescimento das populações humanas, principalmente em zonas urbanas, o crescimento das áreas urbanas atingiu proporções nunca antes vistas. Este processo tem levado à destruição e fragmentação dos habitats e, consequentemente, à criação de habitats com novas características. Existe, então, a necessidade de estudar o impacto que o crescimento urbano provoca nas populações selvagens existentes nesses locais (parques e jardins urbanos). Perceber quais são os fatores que modificam a densidade e diversidade das populações de mamíferos é essencial para selecionar politicas de gestão ao nível da conservação da biodiversidade. O presente estudo visa avaliar o nível de adaptação dos carnívoros presentes nos dois locais de estudo (Jardim Botânico da Universidade de Coimbra e Mata Nacional do Choupal), bem como a densidade dos micromamíferos (presas). A foto-armadilhagem, capturas de micromamíferos e a análise de excrementos foram as técnicas utilizadas para a realização deste estudo. Considerando os resultados obtidos nos dois locais, foram observados maiores valores de diversidade e densidade no Choupal (peri-urbano). O Jardim Botânico (urbano) tem baixos valores de densidade de micromamíferos e uma quase inexistência de carnívoros. Os resultados de densidade registados no Choupal permitiram perceber que os habitats urbanos podem possuir densidades mais altas comparativamente às obtidas em zonas rurais. Relativamente ao nicho ecológico, a maior sobreposição de nicho foi registada entre a raposa e o texugo, o que indica que estas espécies podem coexistir e dividir os recursos disponíveis.Conclui-se que a fragmentação nos habitats, provocada pelo desenvolvimento urbano, pode provocar isolamento e perda de recursos, afectando populações selvagens. Estas alterações irão provocar mudanças nas estruturas populacionais, causando diferenças na adaptação das diferentes espécies, o que poderá levar à perda de biodiversidade. São então necessários mais estudos em ecologia urbana, de forma a propor acções para mitigar estesefeitos, como por exemplo a criação de corredores ecológicos, para que se permita a movimentação das plantas e animais entre os diferentes fragmentos

TI  - Road to the Future: Strategies for Wildlife Crossings and Youth Empowerment to Improve Wildlife Habitat in Roaded Landscapes
AU  - Tanner, Dawn Renee
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the footprint of human society expands upon the earth, habitat loss and landscape fragmentation is an increasing global problem. That problem includes loss of native habitats as these areas are harvested, converted to agricultural crops, and occupied by human settlement. Roads increase human access to previously inaccessible areas, encourage landscape conversion as human access is increased, and are a pervasive component of the developed landscape. Helping our youth understand and engage with these processes is critical for informed decision-making about conservation of biodiversity, increased awareness and sensitivity to the effects of landscape fragmentation, improved attitudes toward local environments, and empowering environmentally responsible behavior. This dissertation addresses the question "What management strategies will optimize wildlife crossing structures and what educational strategies will optimize youth understanding and engagement to improve wildlife habitat in roaded landscapes?"The first chapter is global and reviews the literature addressing road crossings for wildlife. This chapter demonstrates that a network of crossing structures across roads can restore habitat connectivity for target species of wildlife; these structures function optimally for wildlife when best management practices including long-term monitoring and adaptive management are implemented. Nine best management practices developed in this paper advance the quest for optimization of wildlife crossings. Wildlife crossings are a significant tool for conserving wildlife in roaded landscapes. A broader question about advancing society's wildlife goals for roaded landscapes addresses education of our youth. Crossings are major engineering investments. As young people learn to value and take action on environmental issues, we may have improved opportunities to reconnect wildlife habitats.The remaining chapters in the dissertation address that second aspect of living in a roaded landscape: education. The chapters present and analyze the Taking Action Opportunities (TAO) curriculum in which students investigate the effects of habitat change for themselves using remote cameras to explore and understand biodiversity in fragmented habitats. Students compare camera-trap results in their schoolyard with findings in a nearby protected area and become engaged in social action, communicating with school and community leaders to achieve changes that improve habitats for biodiversity. The curriculum is quantitatively analyzed to show how it affects attitudes and behaviors of 5th-grade students. Two years of field testing results using TAO are analyzed with matched pairs pre and post tests. In those analyses, students using TAO as the experimental treatment were compared to a control group of students in the same school district who participated only in the standard environments curriculum delivered in 5th grade. Students in the experimental group were found to have higher scores on knowledge; attitudes; and behavior confidence, intent, and practice. Greatest gains were demonstrated in the category of behavior practice, providing evidence that TAO is a successful mechanism to increase student awareness of issues of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation and take action to improve wildlife habitat in their school and community. These five chapters advance society's ability to sustain the coexistence of wildlife and human communities in roaded landscapes. Some landscape conditions require "hard" engineering approaches and others require "soft" educational approaches. Through strategic investment, school districts, cities, states, and nations can protect and manage wildlife-rich habitats, reduce habitat loss and fragmentation, and can encourage young people to understand and value those wildlife-rich habitats.

AB  - Human activities result in the formation of a mosaic of forest patches within a non-habitat matrix. The response of the local biodiversity to changes in land-use may occur at different scales. It is important to evaluate the effects of the attributes of both the patches and the surrounding landscape on the occupancy of forest patches by animal populations. Here, we assessed the predictive potential of local (basal area, tree density), patch (size, shape) and landscape scale (total area of forest, number of patches, matrix permeability, patch proximity) variables on the occupancy of forest patches by the syntopic primates Alouatta caraya, Sapajus libidinosus and Callithrix penicillata in the city of Goiânia in the Cerrado region of central Brazil. We used playback to survey primate populations in 22 focal patches and assessed the landscape within a 1000 m buffer zone around each site. In A. caraya, occupancy was influenced by the shape of the focal patches, the amount of forest and fragmentation level of the landscape. Focal patch size and the permeability of the matrix were the principal determinants of the occupancy of S. libidinosus. None of the predictors influenced patch occupancy in C. penicillata, and the structure of the vegetation did not influence occupancy in any of the species. The preservation of as many forest patches as possible, both large and small, as well as gallery forests, and the enhancement of matrix permeability will be essential for the long-term conservation of the syntopic primates of the Cerrado of central Brazil.

TI  - Mammalian habitat use along a residential development gradient in northern Colorado
AU  - Goad, Erica H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - "Exurban" development occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique development gradient designed to capture landscape permeability in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity (frequency of detections) were measured in summer and winter seasons and these data were analyzed in conjunction with a novel, acoustic-based approach to assessing human activity. Impacts of exurban housing varied by mammal species, with some species, such as bobcats, elk, and coyotes, showing decreased activity and occupancy levels at higher housing densities, whereas others, including red foxes and Abert's squirrels, occurred more frequently in these areas. Human-sourced activities associated with development and non-natural sound levels emerged as top models for most species. Relative activity rates corroborated occupancy results, indicating that some species not only use habitat in high density areas, they use it more frequently. In addition, some species, including black bears, preferentially used embedded greenbelts in high-density exurban subdivisions, suggesting that greenbelts may be important for structural and functional connectivity. This study demonstrates that the impacts of exurban development are species-dependent. However, incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance may be critical to mitigating development impacts to most wildlife in regions undergoing continued exurban expansion.

AB  - The process of ecosystem fragmentation causes three types of changes in the ecosystem: changes of abiotic, direct biotic and indirect biotic nature. Among these changes, some of them are the microclimatic alterations, edge effect, decrease of the gene flow and losses of biodiversity, among others. In this way, the present study aimed to evaluate the environmental quality of forest remnants in a highly urbanized area through environmental indicators and landscape metrics, such as total area, circularity index, shape of forest fragments, nuclear area, connectivity between them, use and occupation around and distance from the nearest neighbor. The indicators were evaluated according to the methodologies established in the literature and grouped into an index to determine the environmental quality of each forest remnant. The index consisted of the sum of the weighted values for each indicator, according to its classification. The results indicate that most forest remnants evaluated in the study area present medium environmental quality, which demonstrates the degree of edge effect to which they are submitted, and this emphasizes the need for appropriate management actions in these areas, in order to soften such external pressures and ensure long-term sustainability. In addition, it was also identified that the metrics related to the area are essentially important for the determination of the environmental quality of forest remnants.

AB  - Conservation authorities invest heavily in the restoration and/or creation of wetlands to counteract the destruction of habitat caused by urbanization. Monitoring the colonization of these new wetlands is critical to an adaptive management process. We conducted a turtle mark-recapture survey in a 250 ha artificially created wetland complex in a large North American city (Toronto, Ontario). We found that two of Ontario’s eight native turtle species (Snapping turtle (SN), Chelydra serpentina, and Midland Painted (MP) turtle, Chrysemys picta marginata) were abundant and both were confirmed nesting. The Blanding’s turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) was present but not well established. Species richness and turtle density were not equally distributed throughout the wetland complex. We noted SN almost exclusively populated one water body, while other areas of the wetland had a varying representation of both species. The sex ratios of both SN and MP turtles were 1:1. We tracked the movement of Snapping and Blanding’s turtles and found that most turtles explored at least two water bodies in the park, that females explored more water bodies than males, and that 95% of turtles showed fidelity to individual overwintering wetlands. We performed DNA analysis of two Blanding’s turtles found in the created wetlands and could not assign these turtles to any known profiled populations. The genetic data suggest that the turtles probably belong to a remnant local population. We discuss the implications of our results for connectivity of artificial wetlands and the importance of the whole wetland complex to this turtle assemblage.

AB  - BackgroundBacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent bacterium closely related to Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax. The latter has a worldwide distribution and usually causes infectious disease in mammals associated with savanna ecosystems. Bcbva was identified in humid tropical forests of Côte d’Ivoire in 2001. Here, we characterize the potential geographic distributions of Bcbva in West Africa and B. anthracis in sub-Saharan Africa using an ecological niche modeling approach.Methodology/Principal findingsGeoreferenced occurrence data for B. anthracis and Bcbva were obtained from public data repositories and the scientific literature. Combinations of temperature, humidity, vegetation greenness, and soils values served as environmental variables in model calibrations. To predict the potential distribution of suitable environments for each pathogen across the study region, parameter values derived from the median of 10 replicates of the best-performing model for each pathogen were used. We found suitable environments predicted for B. anthracis across areas of confirmed and suspected anthrax activity in sub-Saharan Africa, including an east-west corridor from Ethiopia to Sierra Leone in the Sahel region and multiple areas in eastern, central, and southern Africa. The study area for Bcbva was restricted to West and Central Africa to reflect areas that have likely been accessible to Bcbva by dispersal. Model predicted values indicated potential suitable environments within humid forested environments. Background similarity tests in geographic space indicated statistical support to reject the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with B. anthracis to those of Bcbva and when comparing humidity values and soils values individually. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with Bcbva to those of B. anthracis, suggesting that additional investigation is needed to provide a more robust characterization of the Bcbva niche.Conclusions/SignificanceThis study represents the first time that the environmental and geographic distribution of Bcbva has been mapped. We document likely differences in ecological niche—and consequently in geographic distribution—between Bcbva and typical B. anthracis, and areas of possible co-occurrence between the two. We provide information crucial to guiding and improving monitoring efforts focused on these pathogens.

AB  - Selecting urban ecological patches is of great significance for constructing urban green infrastructure network, protecting urban biodiversity and ecological environment. With the support of GIS technology, a criterion for selecting sources of patches was developed according to existing planning. Then ecological source patches of terrestrial organism, aquatic and amphibious organism were selected in Wuhan city. To increase the connectivity of the ecological patches and achieve greater ecological protection benefits, the green infrastructure networks in Wuhan city were constructed with the minimum path analysis method. Finally, the characteristics of ecological source patches were analyzed with landscape metrics, and ecological protection importance degree of ecological source patches were evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that there were 23 important ecological source patches in Wuhan city, among which Sushan Temple Forest Patch, Lu Lake and Shangshe Lake Wetland Patch were the most important in all kinds of patches for ecological protection. This study can provide a scientific basis for the preservation of urban ecological space, the delineation of natural conservation areas and the protection of biological diversity.

AB  - Oceanic islands harbor unique yet fragile marine ecosystems that require evidence-based environmental management. Among these islands, the Galapagos archipelago is well known for its fish diversity, but the factors that structure communities within and between its islands remain poorly understood. In this study, water quality, physical habitats and geographical distance were assessed as potential predictors for the diversity and structure of fish assemblages. Differences in the structure of fish assemblages of the two studied islands (Santa Cruz and Floreana) were most likely driven by temperature and nutrient concentrations. In the relatively highly populated island Santa Cruz, the structure of fish assemblages was more affected by water conditions than physical habitats while the contrary was true for the more pristine area of Floreana. A wide variety of species with different geographical origins were distributed over the different islands, which indicates that most fish species are able to reach the islands of the archipelago. However, temperature gradients and elevated nutrient levels cause large differences in the structure of local fish assemblages. In addition, in Santa Cruz nutrient concentrations were negatively correlated with αdiversity. Since pollution is a clear pressure on the fish assemblages of oceanic islands, environmental management of the coastal areas is of paramount importance.

AB  - The boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) is at risk of extinction in parts of its range in Canada. Our objectives were to quantify the influence of local and landscape characteristics on the occurrence of the species in wetlands in southern Québec. We hypothesized that site occupancy depends on local characteristics and landscape characteristics contributing to site connectivity. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) method to detect the species and compared the detection probability of this method to traditional call surveys. We collected water samples from a total of 180 sites (90 in 2017, 110 in 2018), whereas we surveyed a subset of 63 sites using both eDNA and call surveys in 2018. Site occupancy varied across years, but was higher in sites where the species had been previously detected during the last 12 years by other studies. Site occupancy did not vary with other local and landscape characteristics, in part due to an apparent decrease in the number of sites occupied by the species since the last 12 years. Detection probability via eDNA (0.81; 95% CI: [0.31; 0.98]) did not differ from that of call surveys (0.62; 95% CI: [0.25; 0.89]). To identify the optimal sampling period for the boreal chorus frog, future studies should estimate the detection probability of eDNA during the breeding season and the larval development period of the species.

T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - The contradiction between rapid urbanization’s demand for land resources and the ecological environment is increasing, which has led to large-scale hardening of the underlying surface of the city and reduction of land for storage. In addition, construction land occupies rainwater confluence land, resulting in a significant decline in urban stormwater control capabilities. The increasingly frequent flood disasters in recent years have exposed the contradiction between urban construction and stormwater safety that cannot be ignored. Therefore, this article takes the central city of Harbin as the research object, uses ArcGIS for spatial analysis and SCS (Soil Conservation Service) hydrological model simulation to construct the rain and flood safety pattern in the research area, and proposes targeted optimization suggestions and strategies based on the evaluation results to achieve the purpose of coordinating the water ecosystem service function with social and economic development. The research shows that protecting the original stormwater corridor and strengthening the connection between the stormwater control patches can effectively guarantee the connectivity of the stormwater corridor, build the natural stormwater regulation and storage system, and then increase the ability of the city to resist the risk of rainstorm, reduce the disaster caused by urban waterlogging, and achieve the goal of sponge city construction.

AB  - Many protected areas worldwide increasingly resemble habitat isolates embedded in human-modified landscapes. However, establishing linkages among protected areas could significantly reduce species-loss rates. Here we present a novel method having broad applicability for assessing enhanced regional connectivity on persistence of mammal diversity. We combine theoretically-derived species relaxation rates for mammal communities with empirically-derived pathways. We assess the value of enhanced regional connectivity for two hypothetical networks of national parks in western North America: the Yellowstone-Glacier network and the Mount Rainier-North Cascades network. Linking the Yellowstone and Glacier park assemblages by eliminating barriers to movement in identified mammal dispersal pathways and by incorporating adjacent wilderness areas and known ungulate migratory routes into a protected area network would greatly enlarge available habitat. This would enhance medium to large mammal species persistence time by factor of 4.3, on average, or ~ 682 generations relative to individual parks. Similarly, linking Mount Rainier and North Cascades park assemblages would enhance mammal species persistence time by a factor of 4.3, on average, or ~305 generations relative to individual parks. Enhancing regional connectivity among western North America parks could serve as an important template for landscape-scale conservation in the 21st century.

TI  - Biodiversity of Coastal Ecosystems: Exploring Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Intertidal Macroinvertebrate Communities of Sandy Beaches
AU  - Schooler, Nicholas Karraker
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Biodiversity plays a vital role in the function, stability, and resilience of ecosystems. Concern about biodiversity loss and the alteration of ecological communities has driven major efforts to catalog and monitor species in ecosystems across the globe and to quantify relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. Evaluating responses of biodiversity and community structure to abiotic and biotic drivers, such as climate, disturbance, and species interactions requires comparisons across relevant spatial and temporal scales. Located at the boundary between land and sea, coastal ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are subject to increasing threats from escalating anthropogenic and climatic impacts. Sandy beach ecosystems, which support unique macroinvertebrate communities and provide irreplaceable ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient recycling and wildlife support), experience heavy human use and manipulations making them particularly vulnerable to urbanization and environmental change. For temperate sandy beaches the degree of vulnerability is expected to vary with major trophic guilds due to differences in functional, trophic, and life history traits, with greater impacts expected for wrack-associated than lower beach species. To gain insights on mechanisms influencing ecological communities and functioning, I explored questions concerning responses of biodiversity, community structure, and composition of sandy beach ecosystems to environmental and anthropogenic factors operating over a range of temporal and spatial scales for my dissertation research. To evaluate these questions, we conducted 60 intertidal macroinvertebrate surveys at 41 study beaches spanning > 1800 km of California coastline (~9 degrees of latitude) from 2009–2015. These were the first quantitative surveys ever conducted at many of these beaches. In my first chapter, I addressed the important issue of comparing species richness across surveys conducted using different sampling methods by developing a calibration approach to adjust species richness for sampling effort. In my second chapter, I assessed the direction and magnitude of change in intertidal biodiversity over time by comparing values of species richness from surveys collected > 30 years apart (1970s and 2009–11) using the calibration from my first chapter. In my third chapter, I evaluated ecological impacts of coastal urbanization by comparing intertidal macroinvertebrate communities between urban beaches with intense maintenance regimes and reference beaches lacking such maintenance. In my final chapter, I evaluated spatial patterns in biodiversity, structure, and composition and the role of environmental factors in structuring intertidal macroinvertebrate communities of sandy beaches at different spatial scales. Overall, findings from my dissertation suggest sandy beaches are more diverse and biogeographically complex than generally acknowledged and that central and southern California beaches may represent a global biodiversity hotspot for intertidal macroinvertebrates. The peak in intertidal species richness of sandy beach macroinvertebrates in temperate latitudes is not consistent with the well-known pattern of a negative trend in species richness with latitude reported for a wide range of ecosystems and taxa. My results highlight the importance of connectivity to donor ecosystems and the strong influence of subsidies on intertidal macroinvertebrate communities of sandy beaches, particularly that of drift macroalgae on wrack-associated species. The functional, trophic, and life history traits of wrack-associated macroinvertebrates, a major component of intertidal diversity (> 40% of species), make this guild disproportionately vulnerable to human and climatic impacts compared with lower beach species. Human impacts associated with urbanization (e.g. mechanized grooming, sediment fills) strongly degraded intertidal macroinvertebrate biodiversity, structure, and function and appeared to influence sandy beach communities more at local than regional spatial scales. Though local scale processes masked the influence regional and global scale processes at most study beaches, we observed biodiversity declines consistent with habitat loss from sea-level rise.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The decline of industry has frequently lead to disinvestment into rail corridors in both the City of Buffalo and elsewhere throughout the United States and other First World countries. Rail companies and the industries they served historically used these rail corridors and immediately surrounding spaces, yet even after the decline of industry and disinvestment by rail companies, these spaces have continued to operate and function in ways unplanned for and largely uncontrolled by the official property owners and designers. After a large decline of rail use in these sites there were some initial overt and intentional and planned physical alterations, frequently including the physical demolition or removal of tracks, signals, switches, and storage units. Unplanned and undesigned alterations and occurrences, including natural (vegetation) regeneration, the proliferation of animal activity, and the increase in human activity, in the form of pedestrian, bicycle, and ATV travel throughout the site, can also be seen throughout many of these areas. Parts of the site are still active and facilitate active rail lines, but even where these “official” uses do not exist, there are well-maintained paths, and established and maintained trails, despite no grounds crew or maintenance staff. There are clearly defined spaces, despite there being no designer.These corridors are undefined but not abandoned spaces that are described by Ignasi de Solà-Morales Rubió as terrain vague, and operate separately from the defined and structured urban form around them. Despite their unofficial status and lack of widespread acknowledgment or recognition, these spaces continue to serve an important role to neighborhood residents, plant, and wildlife. The popularity and observed but largely undocumented busyness in these corridors stands is partly supported by new zoning codes and piecemeal planning in the City of Buffalo, but runs contrary to the residential development and exclusiveness uses occurring elsewhere in the city. Intentionally tentative and subtle interventions are proposed in and around these sites, with a primary focus on the Black Rock Yard in the northwest section of Buffalo. These interventions include access control and filtering structures and strategies coupled with branding and wayfinding, as well as observation and gathering structures located within the site, acting to further legitimize and offer a more defined sense of belonging to a diversity of site users. Further research will study the inherent equity of access these sites offer, as well more closely tied integration strategies connecting this site to the surrounding neighborhoods.

AB  - SUSTAINABILITY IS A BROAD CONCEPT, The root "sustain" means "provide with nourishment, keep going" as defined by Webster, the United Nations' Bruntland Commission defines sustainability as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," The concept of sustainability is a goal that can be applied at all scales of planning, from global to municipal jurisdictions and down to corridors and individual sites.There are many interpretations and applications of die term, but it should not be defined too narrowly. While sustainability of the natural environment is basic, the concept also includes social and economic components. For instance, a diversity of housing in proximity to daily needs or public transportation can have an impact housing opportunities and air quality. Similarly, a lack of diversity in the economic sector can have impacts on the tax base and employment opportunities.A variety of concepts and principles can be followed to achieve sustainability. Planners have smart growth, green infrastructure, complete reels, and transit-oriented design. Architects have LEED design, and landscape architects have the sustainable Sites initiative. Engineers apply strategies for carbon emission reduction, alternative energy systems. and low-impact design. Biologists have strategies for protection and enhancement of endangered habitats and biodiversity. There are also solutions relating to solid waste and hazardous materials.

AB  - Green infrastructure is a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas that are designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. It incorporates green and blue spaces and other physical features in terrestrial and marine areas. Despite the increase of green infrastructure planning in several regions of the world, such as Europe and North America, there is still a complexity and diversity associated with the concept of green infrastructure that influences the variance in approaches of green infrastructure planning. This research proposed a multi-criteria method that was organized in four steps for designing a green infrastructure for the municipality of Setúbal (Portugal) that efficiently integrated the ecological and social components in the planning and policymaking processes, as well as green infrastructure planning principles. The results show a green infrastructure that comprised around 91% of the territory of the case study, organized into two systems: the fundamental green infrastructure, which was related to the areas whose ecological interests were more favorable, and the urban green infrastructure, which aimed to enhance and intensify ecological processes in built-up areas. This approach focused on the protection of ecological functions, the preservation of the cultural and natural heritage, and the prevention of risks at a local level; it also followed several green infrastructure planning principles, namely, connectivity, multifunctionality, diversity, integration, and applicability.

TI  - Ecology and conservation of prairie rattlesnakes ( Crotalus viridis viridis) in relation to movement in a fragmented urban environment
AU  - Andrus, Wonnita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Eighteen prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis viridis ) were tracked using radio-telemetry and 82 snakes were PIT-tagged over a 2-year period in Lethbridge, AB to determine population size, movement patterns, and habitat utilization, and to predict fragmentation effects on the species within an urban locale. Population size was estimated using closed population models at 374 snakes (295 adults) and open population models at 204 snakes (161 adults), greater than an estimate of <50 adults in 2003 (Ernst, 2003) and 2006 (Ernst & Quinlan, 2006). Mean home range sizes, based on 95% minimum convex polygon analysis, differed significantly between years (31.51 ha in 2005, 3.72 ha in 2006). Calculated movement parameters, such as mean distance moved per day, total distance moved over the course of the active season, and frequency of movement varied between years and individuals. Greater-than-expected (under hypotheses of even habitat choice) utilization was observed in habitat types located within coulee and flood plain areas, with apparent preference towards unbroken parcels of grassland or cottonwoods, whereas less-than-predicted utilization of agricultural habitat type was observed. Fragmentation effects on prairie rattlesnake movement and occurrence were examined through modeling and were found to coincide with observed species' locations, suggesting that prairie rattlesnakes are undergoing modification of movement patterns to avoid highly concentrated human density or use. Influence of weather on the use of vegetative ground cover was observed, as it was accessed more by prairie rattlesnakes at higher temperatures. Recommendations towards future management of the prairie rattlesnake population in Lethbridge are given, including protection of the Bridge View Drive site and inclusion of varied habitat types and terrain when planning habitat and wildlife corridors. Management decisions that ensure remaining habitat parcels and connective areas near rattlesnake foraging or movement corridors are also advocated. Identification of future research focuses include studies on juvenile survivorship, genetic structure, and vehicle-related mortality.

AB  - The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape’s complexity and the landscape pattern’s fragmentation showed a decreasing–increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.

AB  - Traditional methods for Chagas disease prevention are targeted at domestic vector reduction, as well as control of transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission. Population connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected vectors and hosts, among sylvatic, ecotone and domestic habitats could jeopardize targeted efforts to reduce human exposure. This connectivity was evaluated in a Mexican community with reports of high vector infestation, human infection, and Chagas disease, surrounded by agricultural and natural areas. We surveyed bats, rodents, and triatomines in dry and rainy seasons in three adjacent habitats (domestic, ecotone, sylvatic), and measured T. cruzi prevalence, and host feeding sources of triatomines. Of 12 bat and 7 rodent species, no bat tested positive for T. cruzi, but all rodent species tested positive in at least one season or habitat. Highest T. cruzi infection prevalence was found in the rodents, Baiomys musculus and Neotoma mexicana. In general, parasite prevalence was not related to habitat or season, although the sylvatic habitat had higher infection prevalence than by chance, during the dry season. Wild and domestic mammals were identified as bloodmeals of T. pallidipennis, with 9% of individuals having mixed human (4.8% single human) and other mammal species in bloodmeals, especially in the dry season; these vectors tested >50% positive for T. cruzi. Overall, ecological connectivity is broad across this matrix, based on high rodent community similarity, vector and T. cruzi presence. Cost-effective T. cruzi, vector control strategies and Chagas disease transmission prevention will need to consider continuous potential for parasite movement over the entire landscape. This study provides clear evidence that these strategies will need to include reservoir/host species in at least ecotones, in addition to domestic habitats.

AB  - Accelerated urbanization in Brazil promoted the rapid growth of cities and, in most cases, was not based on adequate land use planning. The result was the intense fragmentation of the landscape, causing the destruction and fragmentation of forest habitats, which were restricted to small and isolated remnants. In this sense, the present study promoted an analysis of the environmental quality of vegetation fragments in the sub-basins of Ribeirão Anhumas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil by calculating and interpreting the circularity index (CI), in order to define the format of the fragments, connectivity/isolation and the use and occupation of the environment as well as area and location, in order to promote the diagnosis and identification of priority areas for the implementation of restoration and environmental management actions. It was identified, therefore, that the remaining vegetation of the upper, middle and lower sub-basins is divided between small and medium unconnected fragments of which 56.2% and 24.2% presented an elongated and moderately elongated shape, respectively, and, therefore, high susceptibility to external interference and edge effects. On the other hand, high urbanization evidenced mainly in the high-level limits forest management projects, since the fragments are surrounded by built areas.

TI  - An exploration of the impact of greenway trail development on riparian habitat
AU  - McFadden, John F.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Greenways are linear parks generally designed and managed to support recreation and conservation. Ahern's (2004) greenway theory includes three hypotheses: co-occurrence of resources, inherent benefits of connectivity, and the compatibility of uses. The compatibility of recreation and conservation uses was the foundation for the current study. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of greenway development through an examination of trail footprint width (at 8, 10 and 12 ft widths plus their respective mowed areas), trail age, and surface type on percent canopy cover and surface temperature; the secondary purpose was to explore biodiversity through a comparison of tree species diversity for the greenway and a pristine natural area. Two greenways in Middle Tennessee were utilized to achieve the study purposes. Study findings revealed that eight foot asphalt trails do not effect percent canopy cover, while ten and 12 ft trails do effect percent canopy cover ( p = .000) as compared to on and off-site controls. As well, trail center surface temperatures were significantly different from on-site control surface temperatures (p = .000). The main effects model resulting from multivariate analysis of variance revealed that footprint width effects on percent canopy cover and surface temperature were significant; however, further analysis using Tukey's HSD post hoc analysis indicated that there were no significant effects, and the model lacked predictability and explained little variance (r2 =  .04). Study findings indicated that trail age had no effect on percent canopy cover. There was a significant, but weak correlation between on-site control canopy cover and surface temperature, yet not between the trail percent canopy cover and surface temperature. T-tests results indicated no significant difference between concrete and asphalt surface temperatures. Finally, descriptive analysis found tree species diversity lower on the greenway when compared to a pristine area. Study results may help planners and designers better integrate conservation of natural resources and recreation infrastructure in riparian greenways. Furthermore, study results may be helpful to greenway managers interested in understanding how vegetation management around hard surfaced trails may impact tree canopy cover. Finally, results from this exploratory study indicate future research directions.

T2  - Acta Scientiarum. Biological Sciences
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is highly anthropized, this reduce the areas of native vegetation and impacts the biodiversity of the biome. The objective of this study is to analyze forest remnants with native vegetation characteristics using a free GIS. This analysis takes place using landscape metrics and was based on the supervised vectorization of land use in the municipality of California, PR. The area of the vectored polygons was obtained and a classified, and then the calculation was made with the nearest neighbor index, mean distance observed, Patton diversity index and the perimeter/area ratio of forest fragments. The results show that most of the fragments have an area smaller than 1 ha, the fragments with more significant area (<50 ha) represent more than 16% of the native vegetation area. The small fragments are important to maintain the connectivity, since the withdrawal of these increases the mean distance observed and nearest neighbor index. Most of the fragments are elongated and amorphous in accordance with the perimeter/area ratio and the Patton diversity index respectively, this may demonstrate the fragments may be subject to edge effects. Even with these characteristics, these fragments may be part of what is planned in public policy for preservation in the Atlantic Forest in the state of Parana. Therefore, even small fragments with little core area are important for maintaining biodiversity, especially in a highly anthropogenic landscape

TI  - From Second Creek to New Pangea: A multi-scale analysis of patterns and trends in aquatic biodiversity
AU  - Duncan, Jeffrey Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are undergoing a period of dramatic change. The simultaneous expansion and contraction of aquatic species' ranges is leaving an indelible mark on the evolutionary histories of the world's freshwater species. This dissertation represents a compilation of research efforts that quantify, explain, and propose policy recommendations concerning current trends in aquatic biodiversity. Part II provides an appraisal of the status of the world's freshwater fishes that asks two primary questions—are all taxonomic groups equally susceptible to extinction, and can we identify a unifying suite of extinction risk factors? Although I concluded, that extinction risk is not randomly distributed among freshwater fish families, the identification of a unifying set of extinction predictors remains elusive. In Part III, focusing on the U.S., a species list was compiled for each of the lower 48 states to represent their historic and future freshwater fish faunas. Species richness was calculated for each state, and the degree of change in faunal similarity was estimated between neighboring states. Comparisons indicated that states are likely to become more distinct from their neighbors in the future. In Part IV, I evaluate aquatic diversity trends along a natural gradient within the state of Tennessee. Changes in species richness and faunal similarity occurring between historic and future faunas were calculated between ecoregions. Species richness was found to decrease statewide. Similarity increased for virtually all ecoregion-taxonomic combinations indicating that Tennessee is losing its historic biological distinctiveness. Part V represents a study of biophysical homogenization at a fine spatial scale. I compared the frequency of debris dams in a forested reference stream to a stream in a heavily urbanized watershed. I found that debris dams occurred in greater frequency within the forested reference stream compared to the urban stream. A follow-up analysis determined that although there was a significantly greater amount of riparian canopy litter within the urban stream corridor, the quality and timing of litter inputs prevented debris dam genesis and retention. It is believed that the scouring flows that typically accompany highly impervious urban watersheds contributed to decreased frequency of debris dams in the urban stream.

AB  - Background: Most heat-related deaths occur in cities, and future trends in global climate change and urbanization may amplify this trend. Understanding how neighborhoods affect heat mortality fills an important gap between studies of individual susceptibility to heat and broadly comparative studies of temperature-mortality relationships in cities.Objectives: We estimated neighborhood effects of population characteristics and built and natural environments on deaths due to heat exposure in Maricopa County, Arizona (2000-2008).Methods: We used 2000 U.S. Census data and remotely sensed vegetation and land surface temperature to construct indicators of neighborhood vulnerability and a geographic information system to map vulnerability and residential addresses of persons who died from heat exposure in 2,081 census block groups. Binary logistic regression and spatial analysis were used to associate deaths with neighborhoods.Results: Neighborhood scores on three factors--socioeconomic vulnerability, elderly/isolation, and unvegetated area--varied widely throughout the study area. The preferred model (based on fit and parsimony) for predicting the odds of one or more deaths from heat exposure within a census block group included the first two factors and surface temperature in residential neighborhoods, holding population size constant. Spatial analysis identified clusters of neighborhoods with the highest heat vulnerability scores. A large proportion of deaths occurred among people, including homeless persons, who lived in the inner cores of the largest cities and along an industrial corridor.Conclusions: Place-based indicators of vulnerability complement analyses of person-level heat risk factors. Surface temperature might be used in Maricopa County to identify the most heat-vulnerable neighborhoods, but more attention to the socioecological complexities of climate adaptation is needed.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization and associated infrastructures may fragment habitats, particularly within streams. This thesis examines the impacts of culverts on fish assemblages near Vancouver, Canada. I compared fish communities across 26 streams with and without culverts. Densities of cutthroat trout (O ncorhynchus clarkii) increased whereas coastrange sculpin ( Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (C. asper) densities decreased, on both sides, relative to unculverted reference streams. I also found that simple retrofits for improving culvert passage may increase fish diversity over decadal timescales. I then examined the effects of four culverts within one urban watershed and show that successive culverts had a cumulative effect on fish distributions, particularly for prickly sculpin and cutthroat trout (negative and positive, respectively). Overall, this thesis demonstrates that culverts may drive changes in fish communities through speciesspecific impacts that are consistent both within and across watersheds. Understanding biotic responses to stream fragmentation can inform urban watershed restoration and conservation efforts.Keywords: barrier; connectivity; culvert retrofit; fish passage; road crossing; river restoration.

TI  - The role of urban climate and land cover in phenology, nest success, and habitat use
AU  - Becker, Miles
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban development is the fastest growing global land use and it increasingly brings drastic environmental change to natural systems. Climatic variability and spatial habitat heterogeneity within a city could influence species in habitat remnants.  The objectives of this project were to investigate the relative importance of temperature variation and urban land cover for nest survival, the function of thermal refuges for habitat use by breeding birds, and the relationship between urban climate and phenology.  Temperatures, leaf phenology, invertebrate abundance, nest habitat, and nest fate were monitored over a four-year study period at nine sites along an urban to rural gradient.  The sites were located in a riparian corridor passing through the cities of Reno and Sparks, Nevada.  Study area temperature anomalies from the 20-yr normal strongly impacted nest survival rates of American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura ), and Black-headed Grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus ).  Nest survival increased at warmer than normal temperatures and to a lesser extent at colder than normal temperatures.  Canopy cover within a 20m radius of the nest and pedestrian traffic at a site were positively associated with nest survival. Microsites available to nesting birds that had more vegetation were cooler at night and warmer in the day when they had more bare ground, less impervious surfaces, and less canopy cover.  The nests of doves and robins were constructed at cooler locations when air temperatures were warmer.  Temperature varied between sites with the warmest temperatures recorded in rural sites, followed by the more urban sites, and with coolest temperatures in suburban sites. The timing of nesting by robins occurred earlier in the warmer sites and at sites with earlier bud break by Populus  spp.  Peaks in foliar invertebrate abundance were also weakly associated with leaf out, while the sequence of peaks by aerial invertebrates was related more to the level of urbanization at a site.  The results from these studies demonstrate the ability of urban development to differentially affect phenology across trophic levels, have an additive effect with temperature variation on nest survival, and offer opportunities to provide thermal refuges to buffer the impacts of regional climate change.

AB  - Correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) estimate species niches using occurrence records and environmental data. These tools are valuable to the field of biogeography, where they are commonly used to infer potential connectivity among populations. However, a recent study showed that when locally relevant environmental data are not available, records from patches of suitable habitat protruding into otherwise unsuitable regions (e.g., gallery forests within dry areas) can lead to overestimations of species niches and their potential distributions. Here, we test whether this issue obfuscates detection of an obvious environmental barrier existing in northern Venezuela – that of the hot and xeric lowlands separating the Península de Paraguaná from mainland South America. These conditions most likely promote isolation between mainland and peninsular populations of three rodent lineages occurring in mesic habitat in this region. For each lineage, we calibrated optimally parameterized ENMs using mainland records only, and leveraged existing habitat descriptions to assess whether those assigned low suitability values corresponded to instances where the species was collected within locally mesic conditions amidst otherwise hot dry areas. When this was the case, we built an additional model excluding these records. We projected both models onto the peninsula and assessed whether they differed in their ability to detect the environmental barrier. For the two lineages in which we detected such problematic records, only the models built excluding them detected the barrier, while providing additional insights regarding peninsular populations. Overall, the study reveals how a simple procedure like the one applied here can deal with records problematic for ENMs, leading to better predictions regarding the potential effects of the environment on lineage divergence.

The results demonstrated that white-naped cranes migrated an average of 2556 km (±187.9 SD) in autumn and 2673 km (±342.3) in spring. We identified 86 critical stopover sites that supported individuals for more than 14 days, within a 100–800 km wide migratory corridor. This study also confirmed that Luan River catchment is the most important staging region, where white-naped cranes spent 18% of the annual cycle (in both spring and autumn) each year. Throughout the annual cycle, 69% of the tracking locations were from outside of the currently protected areas, while none of the critical staging areas enjoyed any form of site protection. We see further future potential to combine avian tracking data and remote-sensing information throughout the annual range of the white-naped crane to restore it and other such species to a more favourable conservation status.

TI  - Home Range of Rehabilitated Antillean Manatees in Belize and the Role of Benthic Vegetation in Visitation
AU  - Deardeuff, Amanda Kay
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Antillean manatees, Trichechus manatus manatus, are an endangered subspecies of the West Indian manatee, with fragmented populations throughout their range. Belize is thought to support the largest population of Antillean manatees (800 – 1,000 individuals). As coastal development and tourism increase, destruction of vital manatee habitat, including seagrass beds and mangroves, and watercraft collisions are also increasing. Chapter 2 focused on estimating the home range of two rehabilitated manatees in Belize, F1 and M1. The objectives were to (1) estimate home range of two rehabilitated and released manatees in Belize and identify areas frequently used by the manatees, and (2) identify differences in home range size and make inferences about potential causes for such differences. Kernel density estimators were used to calculate home ranges and core areas in R v3.2.5, using the adehabitat library. It was predicted that M1 would have larger home range and core area sizes, potentially attributed to mother calf bonding time in the wild. Post release 95% home range for F 1 was 49.51 km2 and 50% core area was 3.79 km 2. Post release 95% home range for M1 was 971.69 km 2 and 50% core area was 161.38 km2. Results of the range analysis and movements patterns show differences between both individuals for post release, but relatively similar movement patterns and home range for soft release, which could indicate bias in soft release movement based on care taker influence. The results of this study show that F1 made clear and repetitive movements within a cluster of habitats near where she was released, unlike M1 who only stayed in the Corozal Bay Wildlife Sanctuary (CBWS) for about a week, after which he traveled down the coast to Belize City and The Drowned Cayes. Studies have shown that males tend to show less site fidelity and travel further distances. This study reflects similar results. However, as time in the wild progresses, behavior and movement patterns could change. Future studies should focus on tracking individuals for as long as possible during post release to observe changes.The objective of the second study was to infer relationships between movement patterns of the M1 and the vegetation in those areas. A quadrat was used to estimate percent cover and species richness along a 10 m transect. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences among Places, Primary Corridors, Secondary Corridors, and No Visit sites, with regards to percent cover of T. testudinum (P= 0.002) and combined cover of seagrasses (P= 0.019). Spearman’s correlation coefficients between visit number and the independent variables show a positive correlation. After applying a Bonferroni correction and adjusting the calculated P-values, only three of the comparisons were significant: visit with T. testudinum  (P< 0.001), visit with combined seagrasses (P= 0.006), and visit with combined cover for all species (P= 0.042). This study demonstrates that more highly used areas were positively correlated with T. testudinum,  the combined cover of T. testudinum and  H. wrightii, and the combined cover of all species. Future management strategies, as well as research, should focus on identifying and protecting critical habitats of manatees in Belize.

TI  - Construction and application of ecological property evaluation index system for urban parks: a case study of xiamen urban parks
AU  - Xiao, Liang Chang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs an important component of eco-city construction, improving the ecological property of urban parks is the development direction of modern urban parks, however, there is still lack of a valid index system to evaluate ecological property of urban parks. The present study focused on the connotation of ecological property, set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks with Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process. Thereafter, seven typical urban parks in Xiamen were taken as a case to verify the index system. Firstly, this study set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks taking the rationality of ecological structure as well as the efficiency of functions as the criterias. The index system consisted of four aspects, which were community structure, landscape pattern, ecological service function and garden ornamental function. Then the degree of ecological property was divided into four grades according to their scores, which were excellent(grade I), good(grade II), fair(grade III), and poor(grade IV). Secondly, we measured the principal indexes such as vegetation quantity, tree species diversity, landscape diversity, birds diversity, and carbon fixation and oxygen release, decrease of temperature and increase of humidity, dust-retention and noise reduction in seven typical parks of Xiamen. According to their vegetation characteristics, seven parks were classified to semi-natural parks(Huweishan Park, Xianyue Park and Zhonglun Park)and artificial parks(Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, Bailuzhou Park and Huli Park). Finally, these seven parks were evaluated using the index system and the evaluating scores were in the order of Huweishan Park(0.6830, II)>Xianyue Park(0.6698, II)>Zhongshan Park(0.6365, II)>Nanhu Park(0.6120, II)>Zhonglun Park(0.6057, II)>Huli Park(0.5181, III)>Bailuzhou Park(0.5067, III). According to our investigation and evaluation, the structure and function of the seven parks were further analyzed. The results indicated that Huweishan Park and Xianyue Park had higher green space ratios and native species percentages, richer community levels and more diverse bird species than artificial parks. Their average patch areas were larger and plaque integrity and connectivity were better, but the landscape diversities were lower. These two parks thus had better ecological service functions, but weak garden ornamental functions. In Zhonglun Park, the community structure was simplified after artificial modification, and its ecological service functions were poorer than the other semi-natural pakrs. In the artificial parks, Zhongshan Park and Nanhu Park had more diverse tree species than the others, with more rational collocation of native species and exotic species. The landscape types were diverse, but their fragmentation degrees were high. In Bailuzhou Park, the community structure was simple and tree species were poor. In Huli Park, there was a large number of recreation facilities and water surface area and the green space ratio was low. With regard to functions, Zhongshan Park had strong ecological service functions while the other three artificial parks had weak ecological service functions, but strong garden ornamental functions. In a word, there were better ecological structures and ecological service functions in semi-natural parks, but stronger ornamental functions in artificial parks. This study set up the index system for evaluating ecological property with strong scientificity and feasibility. It had certain reference value to ecological construction of urban

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - In a context of expansion and densification of cities, themes related to mobility and the improvement of the quality of life have aroused the interest of researchers and county managers. Using the case of the main urban mobility intervention in Niterói, the TransOceânica Road Corridor (CVT), this work aims to identify the perception of the population affected by the project in relation to the occurrence of the impacts predicted in the project planning phase, as well as to identify which of these impacts most influenced the standard of living and mobility of this population. The survey results showed that the respondents’ perception of the impacts—as the change of air quality, the change of noise levels, the alteration of the local dynamics and neighborhood disturbance—did not confirm the scenario envisaged when planning the project.

AU  - McKechnie, Stephen W
AU  - Mackay, Duncan A
T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Biological invasions have significant ecological, evolutionary and economic consequences. Ants are exemplary invaders and their invasion success is frequently attributed to a shift in social structure between native and introduced populations. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach to determine the social structure, origin and expansion of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, in Australia by linking behavioural and genetic studies with indicators of dispersal pathways and propagule pressure. Behavioural assays revealed a complete absence of aggression within and between three cities – Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth – spanning 2700 km across Australia. Microsatellite analyses showed intracity genetic homogeneity and limited but significant intercity genetic differentiation. Exceptions were two Perth nests that likely represent independent translocations from Adelaide. These patterns suggest efficient local gene flow with more limited jump dispersal via transport corridors between cities. Microsatellite analyses of L. humile from potential source regions, combined with data from port interceptions, trade pathways and the timeline of spread within Australia, implicate the main European supercolony as the source of L. humile in Melbourne. Such an introduction probably then redistributed across Australia and spread to New Zealand to form an expansive Australasian supercolony.

AU  - A-M Kurth
AU  - Weber, C
AU  - Schirmer, M
T2  - Hydrology and Earth System Sciences
AB  - In this study, we investigated whether river restoration was successful in re-establishing groundwater–surface water interactions in a degraded urban stream. Restoration measures included morphological changes to the river bed, such as the installation of gravel islands and spur dykes, as well as the planting of site-specific riparian vegetation. Standard distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and novel active and passive DTS approaches were employed to study groundwater–surface water interactions in two reference streams and an experimental reach of an urban stream before and after its restoration. Radon-222 analyses were utilized to validate the losing stream conditions of the urban stream in the experimental reach. Our results indicated that river restoration at the study site was indeed successful in increasing groundwater–surface water interactions. Increased surface water downwelling occurred locally at the tip of a gravel island created during river restoration. Hence, the installation of in-stream structures increased the vertical connectivity and thus groundwater–surface water interactions. With the methods presented in this publication, it would be possible to routinely investigate the success of river restorations in re-establishing vertical connectivity, thereby gaining insight into the effectiveness of specific restoration measures. This, in turn, would enable the optimization of future river restoration projects, rendering them more cost-effective and successful.

TI  - Shrubs for wildlife program deserves consideration; [Final Edition]
AU  - Martin, Murray J
T2  - Packet and Times
AB  - The widest diversity of wildlife food will achieve the greatest diversity in wildlife. Most rural people like to see wildlife in their back yards. On my own property, we have built many bird boxes in preparation for the 2004 nesting season. Throughout the year we spend approximately $40 every five weeks on peanuts for the squirrels, chipmunks and blue jays along with another $20 a month on black sunflower seeds for the birds. You really don't have to go to this expense but for us, the rewards are ten-fold as our cup runneth over with wild critters.Unfortunately, rural townships as well as the City of Orillia, have missed the boat in providing wildlife corridors. These wildlife corridors are an essential and integral part of planning for wildlife. When sitting on the Simcoe County planning board, the then chair, Garfield Dunlop (now our MPP) was steadfast in assuring that these corridors were part of the Simcoe County plan. Even some developments were turned down because he felt the corridors would be broken. Maybe he might be encouraged to present such a plan to the Minister of Natural Resources.One of the best shrubs for wildlife is the Autumn Olive shrub. The berries will attract birds such as robins, cardinals, waxwings and other birds. Rabbits are attracted to the bark. Russian Olive is also a berry producing shrub, not as good as the aforementioned, but provides excellent nesting areas for smaller birds.

TI  - Fight greenhouse effect by planting trees; [Final Edition]
AU  - Jim St. Marie
T2  - The Record
AB  - [Mike Mahaffey] calls himself an urban forester, that is, a tree professional dealing with trees for their esthetic value rather than as a cash crops. As such, urban foresters are concerned with the tangible, intangible and visual benefits of trees in cities and towns. A few tangible benefits are soil retention, noise and dust control. Some of the intangible benefits of trees are as a harbour for wildlife, stabilization of the water table and air filtration. Amongst the visual benefits of urban trees are the softening of the concrete and asphalt landscape, highlighting architecture, presenting corridors and vistas.Glen Lumis, a University of Guelph tree expert, advises that the depth of the hole is critical because a young tree must be planted at the same depth or slightly above the depth it grew in the nursery. Lumis says that a firm bottom to the planting hole is best, so don't dig any deeper than necessary. That way the tree will not sink too deep into the loosened soil soon after planting.Again, following Lumis's advice: "It is always best to use the soil that was dug out of the hole for planting. A "foreign" soil high in organic matter should not be used. Research has shown that organic amendments do not benefit and may retard tree growth after planting. In any clay soil, the addition of organic matter results in excessive moisture retention. In a sandy soil, organic matter helps retain water but results in increased capillary movement away from the young developing roots."

TI  - Four legs good, two legs bad: the pursuit of an animals-only utopia is making BC jobs an endangered species (Wildlands' Project and the Yellowstone to Yukon Biodiversity Strategy (Y2Y))
AU  - Brunet, Robin
T2  - British Columbia Report
AB  - It's no secret that B.C.'s eco-zealots fantasize about dismantling roads, closing towns, and choking industry. If their goals were ever fully realized, wild animals would multiply unchecked in vast unbroken tracts of provincial wilderness, while humanity huddles in shrinking islands of civilization. Until recently, however, such grandiose plans could be dismissed as green pipe-dreams, since environmental extremists had accomplished little more than isolated acts of sabotage. Not any more. A recent episode of David Suzuki's The Nature of Things highlighted the increasing credence being accorded the "Wildlands Project," a plan to depopulate huge areas of western North America. Still, public knowledge remains sketchy of just how sweeping that plan is. Its strategists have carefully crafted a step-by-step script, and they have made key strides towards their  fauna-first fantasy. As a result, critics warn, the livelihoods of thousands of B.C. families in resource-dependent communities are at risk. The success of the environmental movement in influencing B.C.'s ruling New Democrats is one key reason to take the Wildlands Project seriously. Many of its backers, such as the Western Canada Wilderness Committee and the Sierra Club, have strong links with the provincial NDP. And during the NDP's first term, environmentalists managed to lay much of the groundwork for the Wildlands Project's central goal of creating immense development-free land corridors by persuading Victoria to sharply increase the scope of provincial land set-asides. That NDP willingness to placate greens continues, as evidenced by a recent government pledge to seek United Nations "biosphere reserve" status for the contentious Clayoquot Sound area. Activists also convinced the Harcourt New Democrats to impose the 1994 Forest Practices Code to minimize the environmental impact of logging. Company spokesmen blame those regulations for much of the current malaise that pervades the forest industry (see story, page 22). Last month, television viewers were afforded a glimpse of the environmental movement's future plans. Dr. Suzuki, the former University of B.C. geneticist who has become Canada's highest-profile environmental propagandist, devoted the February 20 episode of his weekly CBC series to extolling the virtues of the "Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) Biodiversity Strategy." Y2Y seeks to link Rocky Mountain parks with protected migration corridors and buffer zones in which human activity is severely restricted. In some cases, roads would be dismantled and businesses closed so grizzly bears can range freely. "Y2Y has been developing for years right under our noses," says Jack Carradice, executive director of the B.C. Environmental Information Institute. "In some areas, it is practically a fait accompli. It's a huge threat to Cranbrook, Revelstoke, Prince George, and other communities along the Rockies." More troubling still is that Y2Y is merely the flagship endeavour of the Wildlands Project, created in 1992 by Earth First founder Dave Foreman. The project aims to eliminate human activity in at least half of North America. "There's very big money and influence behind this scheme," says Mr. Carradice. "We can't afford not to take it seriously." Dr. Suzuki characterizes the Rockies as a place where "everywhere you look, life has found a foothold." However, "as in much of North America, nature doesn't have the space it needs. The landscape is broken into fragments." The first "fragment" examined is Wy- oming's Yellowstone National Park, a one-million-hectare preserve established in 1872 that is home to one of the world's largest elk herds, 3,400 bison, and 300 grizzlies. "Nature is in trouble here," Dr. Suzuki claims, explaining that when migratory animals move beyond park boundaries, they risk being "shot or slaughtered" by humans. He also laments that timber is being harvested and tourist facilities are being built just beyond park boundaries. Human activity nearby is only part of the alleged problem. With three million visitors a year and climbing, Dr. Suzuki warns that Yellowstone "is being crowded out...parks are becoming prisons, embattled islands of disturbed and damaged wilderness." He adds that male grizzlies can range up to 2,400 square kilometres, but since Yellowstone's grizzly population has been isolated, "bears will disappear due to inbreeding if people don't kill them first." The Wildlands Project, a "plan for the next 1,000 years," is then unveiled. Louisa Wil-cox, a Wildlands Project director, describes her colleagues as "a collection of conservationists, visionaries, philosophers and biologists attempting to  define a broader vision of wildland protection in North America. This vision is based for the first time on good  science." Nothing more is revealed about the project, other than that its members want buffer zones around protected areas in the Rockies and "wildlife corridors" to "reconnect" them.

TI  - Systematics and evolution of the Ronnbergia alliance (Bromeliaceae): History of disjunct diversification in three biodiversity hotspots of the neotropics
AU  - Aguirre Santoro, Julian Andres
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The systematics, biogeography and evolution of the “ Ronnbergia Alliance,” a nested lineage within the Core Bromelioideae, were investigated. In the first chapter, the phylogenetic relationships of the Ronnbergia Alliance were reconstructed using three chloroplast and three nuclear DNA sequence markers in combination with a wide species sampling across the Core Bromelioideae and a nearly complete species-level sampling of the five species complexes that likely comprise the Ronnbergia  Alliance. The analysis indicates that the Ronnbergia Alliance is a robust monophyletic group sister to the remaining Core Bromelioideae, and it is composed by species of the polyphyletic genera Aechmea,  Hohenbergia and Ronnbergia. The first of main lineage within the Ronnbergia Alliance, here called the Pacific Clade, contains species of that occur exclusively in the forests of southern Central America to northwestern South America. The second clade, called the Atlantic Clade, contains species mostly limited to the central corridor of the Atlantic Forest and the Greater Antilles. The combination of apically spreading tubular corollas and unappendaged ovules are diagnostic for the Ronnbergia  Alliance, whereas flower size, corolla tube length, and petal pigmentation are important characters to differentiate the Pacific and Atlantic Clades. A new taxonomic reorganization and synopsis for this clade was proposed in the second chapter. Here, all the species of the Pacific Clade were placed in Ronnbergia, whereas the species of the Atlantic Clade were relocated in the resurrected genus Wittmackia. In the third chapter, a complete taxonomic revision of the Caribbean clade of  Wittmackia was conducted. In the fourth chapter, the biogeographic history and evolutionary rate dynamics of the Ronnbergia Alliance were analyzed. These analyses showed that one vicariant event that separated Ronnbergia from Wittmackia in South America, and a later long-distance dispersal event allowed the separation of Wittmackia between the Atlantic Forest and Jamaica. Although the evolutionary rate dynamics remained constant during the diversification of Ronnbergia, these rates were heterogeneous during the radiation of Wittmackia. This is the first species-level approach that combines phylogenetic, ecological, geographic and morphological information to reveal fine-scale processes that shaped the evolution of highly diverse lineages of Bromeliaceae.

AU  - Dunn, Emily R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Cerambycid beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) locate suitable hosts and mates using both pheromones and plant volatiles, many of which have been identified and are now produced synthetically for trap lures. The range over which these lures attract cerambycids within a forest, and the tendency for cerambycids to move out of a forest in response to these lures, have not been previously explored to our knowledge. We conducted two field experiments using baited and unbaited flight intercept traps in northern Delaware to investigate these questions. Within forest fragments, traps that were 2 m from the baited trap, but not 10 or 20 m, captured more beetles than control traps suggesting relatively short-range and nonspecific attraction by these lures. In contrast, male  Prionus laticollis (Drury), which were attracted by the female-produced sex pheromone 3,5-dimethyldodecanoic acid, were rarely caught in unbaited traps at any distance from baited traps. Baited traps attracted significantly more cerambycids than unbaited traps outside of the forest at distances up to 40 m from the forest edge, with catch generally decreasing between 8 and 40 m from the forest. Some cerambycids were caught in both baited and unbaited traps at all distances from the forest edge, indicating that at least some cerambycids disperse freely outside of the forest independent of any pheromone attractants. Our results provide context to previous studies that used these pheromone lures, and offer insights into the dispersal behavior of cerambycids. Forest fragmentation and human development undoubtedly affect wildlife movement on a landscape, but this effect likely varies by species. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two species of cerambycid beetles and in white- footed deermice (Peromyscus leucopus) to determine the population structure of these species on the same fragmented landscape in northern Delaware. White-footed deermice showed more population structure than either cerambycid species, indicating that cerambycids are more capable of movement among forest fragments. The cerambycid Xylotrechus colonus  showed less population structure than Prionus laticollis, which may be explained by both dispersal ability and life history differences. Our study highlights the importance of using diverse study species to assess connectivity and movement on a human-dominated landscape.

TI  - Predicting Suitable Habitat for the Critically Endangered Yellow-Tailed Woolly Monkey (Lagothrix Flavicauda) in Peru
AU  - Zarate, Melissa Ann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot holds a remarkable amount of species at risk of extinction due to climate change and human activities. One of these species, the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda), has experienced alterations in its known geographical range, along with a recent sighting in the region Junín, 206 kilometers south of previous observations, calling for a re-evaluation of potential suitable habitat. In this thesis, I fit, evaluate, and apply predictions of a habitat suitability model within the country of Peru. I used a generalized linear modeling approach across various range constraints, incorporating bioclimatic variables, forest cover, distance to cities and elevation as predictor variables. Precipitation features most strongly influencing observations of species presence in my model and evaluation measures showed the elevation-constrained model accuracy to be around 95%. Habitat suitability maps illustrate novel areas of potentially suitable habitat in central Huánuco, Pasco, and limited areas in Junín. The newly discovered population was found to be in an area of low suitability, calling for further investigation of the species in this area. Areas of suitable habitat should be surveyed to decrease bias in occurrence data, increasing the accuracy of habitat modeling for this species. Surveying these areas may also reveal corridors of gene flow between these populations, and could facilitate landscape genetics studies to characterize the viability of this taxon. Better characterization of the true distribution of the species will provide information to conservation stakeholders in priority areas, helping to protect this species and associated threatened wildlife.

AU  - Sitz, Rachael A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Two emergent disease complexes called drippy blight and thousand cankers have become injurious to hardwood trees in communities across the urban corridor of Colorado. In order to better understand these disease complexes, studies were initiated to identify the causal agents, symptomology, and epidemiology of drippy blight disease as well as determine if multiple fungi were involved in thousand cankers disease.Chapter I, published in the Journal of Arboriculture and Urban Forestry, provides information on the basic biology of drippy blight disease. This article explains the signs and symptoms of drippy blight, and shows that the bacterium Lonsdalea quercina subsp.  quercina is able to cause the disease. Finally, it was noted that a kermes scale insect was abundant on all diseased oaks, but its role as a vector is unknown. Overall, this research documents the microbe and insect causal agents in this disease complex. These findings are biologically significant as the isolated bacterium was able to produce disease on several species of sapling red oaks. This, taken into consideration with other diseases caused by Lonsdalea quercina, implies that this bacterium has the potential to become widespread.Chapter II provides a detailed life history of Allokermes galliformis,  the insect causal agent in drippy blight disease. Management decisions to mitigate the effects of insect damage are largely based on an understanding of the life cycle. This research documents periods when A. galliformis  may be most exposed and vulnerable to controls and notes areas of the tree where it inflicts damage when feeding. Therefore, the information provided in this chapter can serve as a guide for more informed decisions when considering management of drippy blight-affected trees.Chapter III considers what insects may be involved in the dissemination of Lonsdalea quercina subsp. quercina from oaks with symptoms of drippy blight disease. Although kermes scales are the most consistent and abundant insects found in association with drippy blight disease, other more mobile insects are frequently observed on diseased trees and it was hypothesized that these may play a role in spreading the bacterial pathogen within trees and to new trees. After testing insects collected on diseased oak trees for bacterial contamination, various insects were documented to carry the bacterium, providing insight into ways the disease may move in a population of susceptible hosts.Chapter IV, published in Plant Disease, involves a tree disease characterized by an insect and fungal pathogen interaction, thousand cankers disease of walnut. This study investigates whether genetically distinct isolates of the fungal pathogen Geosmithia morbida vary in pathogenicity. Also examined was whether Fusarium solani, commonly found on diseased trees, may contribute to production of thousand cankers disease. A range of Geosmithia morbida isolates were tested alone and in combination with a Fusarium solani isolate to determine the relative contribution of each fungal pathogen to thousand cankers disease. Importantly, in Colorado Geosmithia morbida does not interact synergistically with F. solani.Overall, this research is the first to describe the emergent disease complex drippy blight and provides information to better understand the bacterial and insect causal agents. Furthermore, the investigations of drippy blight of red oak and thousand cankers disease of walnut, improve our understanding of the epidemiology of woody plant diseases that involve both arthropod and pathogen partners.

TI  - The Viability of Conservation Subdivisions as Habitat for Urban Carnivores in North Central Texas Suburbs
AU  - Fabricant Wood, Sherry
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine perceptions of conservation subdivisions as habitat for urban carnivores in North Central Texas suburbs. This research was conducted through the University of Texas at Arlington; Landscape Architecture Program. The literature review examines the history of conservation subdivisions and their use within North Central Texas as well as their application as an ecological solution to present-day threats to biodiversity with a focus on mammalian apex carnivores. It further explores their use as habitat in the context of urban patches and corridors. Additionally, the practice of bioregionalism was reviewed in contrast to current political boundaries governing North Central Texas cities as related to conservation subdivisions. This study targets conservation subdivisions located within the North Central Texas Councils of Government (NCTCOG), the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metropolitan statistical area of North Texas. The subdivision ecoregions represented include Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairies.The study employs qualitative research methods to gain insight into participant perceptions. Phone interviews were compiled from 14 Interview subjects chosen for their professional work related to or knowledge of conservation subdivisions or urban ecology in the study area. All respondents consented to be named and are considered experts in their field. Findings were attained through a process of rigorous coding methods and domain analysis.As the profession of landscape architecture increases its reach and influence in our natural and built world, it is important to gain awareness of urban development in various contexts. In the context of conservation subdivisions in North Central Texas suburbs, this research furthers public and professional knowledge concerning urban wildlife habitat for urban carnivores and its implications towards conservation efforts overall.These data support the view that conservation subdivisions are, in part, a viable solution as a conservation tool and are perceived as viable habitat for urban carnivores in the study area. However, further community education and research are needed to expand the effective use of conservation subdivisions in North Texas. The development of conservation subdivisions in the study area is perceived as a developer marketing tool to increase profits and fall short of intended conservation goals lacking actionable long-term maintenance plans. Recommendations based on the findings and for future research are presented to improve the future sustainability of urban wildlife habitat and therefore increase wildlife diversity and open space conservation within high-density, metropolitan areas.

TI  - Using landscape structure indices to understand the possible impacts of landscape change: Case of the mountain preserves in the city of Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Esbah, Hayriye
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Historic land use development in Phoenix has impacted the city's ecologically valuable open spaces. This dissertation studies the possible effect of landscape change between 1968 and 1998 on the South Mountain Preserve (SMP) and Phoenix Mountains Preserve (PMP). Recommendations for a future development pattern are provided. Three principal analyses are employed: (1) matrix utility analysis; (2) isolation analysis; and (3) connectivity analysis. Black and white aerial photographs of the study area were used for the investigation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results indicate: (1) a decline in matrix utility value of 21.65% for SMP, and 36.50% for PMP, (2) an increase in isolation value of 1.28% for SMP, and 285% for PMP, and (3) a decline in the overall matrix connectivity value of 67.8%. The conclusions of the research are that the ecological values of the mountain preserves may change due to the historic land use pattern: (1) the areas surrounding the mountain preserves were occupied by environmentally less sensitive land use types, (2) existing open space patches became smaller and more isolated due to increasing fragmentation, (3) connectivity between the open space patches was paralyzed as the detrimental effect of urban sprawl, and (4) PMP experienced more decline in the ecological values than SMP. Recommendations primarily include: (1) encouraging more environmentally compatible land uses around the preserves, (2) creating buffer zones, (3) considering both content and the context of the preserve in management actions, (4) developing effective land acquisition and zoning plans, (5) unifying preservation efforts of different local and government agencies, (6) improving connectivity with other open-space systems, and (7) maintaining near-natural levels of biodiversity in the urban matrix.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on pattern and typical function of regional wetlands
AU  - Zhao, Hui
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorGlobal urbanization has dramatically impacted various kinds of wetlands in the last decades. China has also been experiencing rapid urbanization due to the intensive economic growth and industrialization since market-oriented economic reformation in 1978. During the past three decades, large areas of wetlands in east and south estuarine cities of China disappeared and the remaining areas became vulnerable due to urban industry, agriculture and domestic developments. In the paper, two regions with different development patterns of urbanization were choosed as typical examples. There is cluster-style development pattern of urbanization in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and decentralized development pattern of urbanization exists in Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR). The objectives of this paper are to: 1) conduct a systematic and holistic quantitative studies on the wetland pattern and ecological function under the stress of varous activites of urban based on the change of wetland pattern caused by urbanization; 2) discuss the spatial pattern of evolution of wetlands, the changes of typical ecological function, and the relationship between spatial pattern of wetlands and the main ecological functions; 3) examine the driving mechanism of degradation of wetland functions; 4) divide function zones base on the wetland function and establish rational control strategies. The research results can be summarized as follows: 1) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the Pearl River Estuary. From 1979 to 2009, the net loss of area of wetlands was 1/3 (12383 km2) and the occupied area ratio also decreased from 53.36% to 38.91%. We found that the tendency that nature wetlands changed to constructed wetlands and then to urban land was obvious in the process of transfer of wetlands and the direct and major way for degradation of wetland was cluster-style development of urban land. The urbanization can greatly exacerbate the transition activities of different types of wetlands resulted from that the total transition index (TTI) were far greater than the net transition index (NTI). Meanwhile, based on the analysis methods of river network and landscape network, wetland network in PRE was constructed using the vector data of wetland. The length, connectivity and complexity of river corridor have already been reduced from 1979 to 2009. Wetland networks in PRE have a trend of evolution, inverted "V" type to "# "type, then to main river-way. 2) Water purification functions of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied from 1979 to 2009 in PRE. The wetland network structure index Dr,β,γ,α are closely related to the capacity of water purification. The good corridor connectivity and patches near degrees are the important conditions for network water purification. Estuary wetland pattern changes have a direct impact on the water purification in regional wetland system, which is irreversible with lands for city construction lack gradually. 3) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the LRGR. Highway construction is closely related to urban development. Perfect highway construction is not only the base of city development, but also an important style of urban system formation. The relationship between mountainous city land and highway density can be described by the linear regression equation. Highway development in mountains is the foundation conditions of urban sprawl, and also is main ways of urbanization impact on wetlands. By analyzing wetland pattern driven by the highway construction, the wetland density in the highway buffer (2000m) is decreased from 0.10 km-1 to 0.06 km-1. Patches density and edge density of the natural wetland and artificial wetland in the buffers present the increasing trend, and the increasing trend is evident. The results indicated that natural wetlands and artificial wetlands were gradually fragmentation. 4) The biodiversity function of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied in LRGR. Highway construction influences wetland pattern and biodiversity in mountainous. As a representative activity in the mountains, highway construction has detrimental side effects on maintaining biodiversity function in the regional wetlands. In influencing zone of highway, construction activities mainly influence the single block wetland, such as, lake, reservoir and swamp; and decrease biodiversity of wetlands. The Shannon diversity index is nearly proportional to wetland area with polynomial exp (S2), which is consistent with Gaussian regression model. 5)The Pearl River Estuary is divided into two primary function zones and six secondary function zones; Yunnan mountainous area is divided into two primary function areas and five secondary function zones. The protection policies were formulated separately based on regional typical wetland

TI  - Ant and spider dynamics in complex riverine landscapes of the Scioto River basin, Ohio: Implications for riparian ecosystem structure and function
AU  - Tagwireyi, Paradzayi
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In recent years, a holistic ecosystem conceptualization has emerged that structurally and functionally links the river, and its riparian and floodplain zones into an integrated ecological unit—the riverine landscape. The array of riverine landscapes distributed across a river system represents biophysical complexity over broad spatial and temporal scales. Internal riverine landscape patchiness (e.g., gravel bars, mudflats, swamps, etc.), on the other hand, represents heterogeneity at finer spatiotemporal scales. Collectively, an understanding of environmental drivers and consequences of riverine landscape patch dynamics is critical to both basic riverine science as well as to management and conservation efforts. However, despite the well-documented importance of river corridors (e.g., as biological refuges in human-modified landscapes), the role of riverine landscape pattern and composition on ecosystem structure and function is largely unknown. In this dissertation, I worked at 12 study reaches distributed along an urban-rural gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. To better understand environmental drivers of riverine landscape distribution and physical heterogeneity, I investigated the influence of internal (river size, lateral flow connectivity) and external (catchment land use and land cover) factors on site-specific riverine landscape patterns. At a finer scale, I used riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae and ants as model organisms to explore the associations between internal riverine landscape patchiness and the distribution, diversity, and trophic dynamics [e.g., trophic position (TP)] of riparian arthropod communities. Because of a growing recognition of the importance of aquatic-to-terrestrial energetic subsidies (largely in the form of aquatic insects that emerge from the water as adults) to riparian and terrestrial food webs, I gave particular consideration to the reliance of aquatic carbon [C (CA)] of riparian spiders and ants. Riverine landscape patchiness was measured using a combination of field (vegetation surveys, canopy photography, shoreline habitat measurements) and remote-sensing approaches [e.g., using a GIS, aerial photos, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data]. Ants and spiders were surveyed on each side of the river at each study reach. A suite of analytical methods were used including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), linear regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling, a model-selection approach using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). I found that a mixture of external and internal factors were associated with riverine landscape pattern (patch area and shape and size) including drainage area (a proxy for ecosystem size), proximity to impoundment (a proxy for lateral flow connectivity), and catchment land use and land cover (e.g., % urban, % agriculture). Percent impervious surfaces in the catchment, for instance, was strongly related to more convoluted patch shapes in the riverine landscape. Riparian ant density and diversity were highly variable along the urban-rural gradient. Agricultural riverine landscapes exhibited lower ant density but elevated ant diversity. Patch area, edge, and shape emerged as important predictors of ant diversity whereas patch composition, as well as patch area, edge, and patch density were strongly related to ant density. However, MaxEnt modeling indicated that patch-type influenced ant habitat choice less than gradients in distance from surface water. Patch composition was strongly associated, with TP and CA of ants (Formica subsericea) greatest at crop patches (TP = 1.79, CA = 91%). I observed that both terrestrial (habitat) and aquatic (emergent insect food resources) were important environmental determinants of riparian tetragnathid distribution, trophic dynamics, and the capacity of spiders to ecologically link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, tetragnathid TP, which averaged 2.45 across all study reaches, was largely driven by emergent insect density. For both ants and spiders, CA was positively related to TP (R2 = 0.14 for ants, R2 = 0.48 for spiders), suggesting that algal-based energy pathways contribute to more complex riparian food webs. Collectively, these findings indicate that patchiness in riverine landscapes exerts strong influences on the distribution, diversity, and trophic dynamics of riparian arthropod consumers. Additionally, my results contribute to a growing understanding of the impacts of landscape change in river corridors, and suggest that integrating conservation efforts at both broad (e.g., catchment) and fine scales (e.g., the aquatic-terrestrial interface) will be an important step in maintaining diverse, functional river-riparian ecosystems. In particular, I found that urbanization is likely to prompt changes in riverine landscape structure as well as arthropod distribution, diversity, and trophic structure. Because these findings provide evidence that spatial habitat patterns within riverine landscapes can influence the structure and functions of riparian ecosystems, they also lend insight into the utility of landscape ecology to river science.

T2  - Calgary Herald
AB  - The two families who own the ski resort are having a tough time staying in business as a winter-only venture, drawing an average 100,000 skiers a year, when more like 125,000 are needed to achieve profitability. Norquay competes with the much larger Sunshine and Lake Louise ski resorts nearby.Of course, such a proposal can only move forward if environmental concerns are met. The ski hill is on the Cascade Corridor, which lies on the north side of the TransCanada Highway and the town of Banff. It's the busiest avenue for wildlife movement around the Banff townsite -- an area that is already heavily congested.Both Sunshine and Lake Louise have found ways to operate in summer without hurting the wildlife or vegetation of the area. And Norquay, too, has been the site of a summer gondola, which was removed by previous owners under a 1988 plan to offset an expanded skiing operation.

AB  - The environmental impacts in this XXI century increased dangerously and, thus, was reinforced the paradigm of maintaining the environment. In the context of an urban forest, was recommended the increase of green areas and the connectivity between them, as well as encourage greater use of native essences, even as an expansion in the diversity of species. The aim of this study was to diagnose the environmental conditions of Chico Mendes Municipal Park. The qualitative analysis of avifauna and plant was based on the presence and absence compared to other studies. The Sørensen index was estimated for flora and avifauna, and a review of the phytosanitary conditions of tree specimens. Thus, in the present study were cataloged 51 species of birds in the Chico Mendes Park, being 23 considered migratory and 28 as residents, 2 species of amphibians, reptiles 10, 9 mammals and 55 plants. The Sørensen index for avifauna expressed a similarity value of 0.65420 when compared to other studies; while the same index for tree flora was in order of 0.37500. It is necessary the development of awareness and transformation tools that promote behavioral change in the surrounding community.

TI  - The Dispersal, Storage and Remobilisation of Heavy Metals in the River Aire Contaminated by Urban and Industrial Wastes
AU  - Dawson, Emma Joanne
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Industrial and urban activities in the Leeds catchment of the River Aire have caused the widespread dispersal and contamination by a variety of pollutants, including heavy metals. This contamination is reflected by enhanced metal concentrations in the sediments and soils of the river and floodplain. The cycling of sediment and associated metals in the fluvial environment is highly related to hydrological, geomorphological and chemical phenomena. The main research objective is to investigate quantitatively the dispersal, storage and remobilisation of heavy metals in the Leeds reach of the River Aire. A wide variety of relevant processes are analysed. Metal pollution studies have often neglected urban and industrial catchments, where sources of pollutants to the river channel are diverse. In the past, heavy metals have entered the river from industrial activities, sewage disposal and coal combustion. The main present source of metals is the disposal of domestic and industrial effluent from sewage treatment works. The fluvial dispersal of wastes has caused enhanced concentrations of heavy metals in aquatic sediment and floodplain soils. This results in long-term storage of metals in river corridors and poses problems as sediments act as a source of contaminants long after pollution of the fluvial system has been abated. The pollution problem is most severe immediately downstream of sewage treatment works, through the city centre, where traffic and industrial density is greatest and where floodplains are frequently inundated with floodwaters. Heavy metals are not necessarily permanently fixed by the sediment and can be remobilised through mechanical, chemical and biological processes, affecting surface and groundwater quality and plant animal and human health. However, it is not the total amount of a metal stored in sediment, but how it is actually bound that is important in assessing its environmental impact. Results suggest that a significant proportion of each metal is held in a potentially mobile and bioavailable form, particularly cadmium. The data collected is used to compile mass budgets of sediments and associated metals for the alluvial area of the River Aire in Leeds.

TI  - The Relationship between Nature Deprivation and Individual Wellbeing across Urban Gradients under COVID-19
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - Lockdown aiming at slowing COVID-19 transmission has altered nature accessibility patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions to assess if retracted nature contact and perceived nature deprivation influence physical and emotional wellbeing. We measure through on-line survey methods (n = 529) how pandemic mandates limiting personal movement and outdoor nature access within the United States affect self-assessed nature exposure, perceived nature deprivation, and subsequent flourishing as measured by the Harvard Flourishing Index. Results indicate that perceived nature deprivation strongly associates with local nature contact, time in nature, and access to municipal nature during the pandemic, after controlling for lockdown mandates, job status, household composition, and sociodemographic variables. Our hypothesis is that individuals with strong perceived nature deprivation under COVID-19 leads to diminished wellbeing proved true. Interaction models of flourishing showed positive modification of nature affinity with age and qualitative modification of nature deprivation with race. Our results demonstrate the potential of local nature contact to support individual wellbeing in a background context of emotional distress and social isolation, important in guiding public health policies beyond pandemics.

TI  - The dispersal, storage and remobilization of heavy metals in the River Aire contaminated by urban and industrial wastes.
AU  - Dawson, E.J.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Industrial and urban activities in the Leeds catchment of the River Aire have caused the widespread dispersal and contamination by a variety of pollutants, including heavy metals.  This contamination is reflected by enhanced metal concentrations in the sediments and soils of the river and floodplain.  The cycling of sediment and associated metals in the fluvial environment is highly related to hydrological, geomorphological and chemical phenomena.  The main research objective is to investigate quantitatively the dispersal, storage and remobilization of heavy metals in the Leeds reach of the River Aire.A wide variety of relevant processes are analysed.  Metal pollution studies have often neglected urban and industrial catchments, where sources of pollutants to the river channel are diverse.  In the past, heavy metals have entered the river from industrial activities, sewage disposal and coal combustion.  The main present source of metals is the disposal of domestic and industrial effluent from sewage treatment works.The fluvial dispersal of wastes has caused enhanced concentrations of heavy metals in aquatic sediment and floodplain soils.  This results in long-term storage of metals in river corridors and poses problems as sediments act as a source of contaminants long after pollution of the fluvial systems has been abated.  The pollution problem is most severe immediately downstream of sewage treatment works, through the city centre, where traffic and industrial density is greatest and where floodplains are frequently inundated with floodwaters.Heavy metals are not necessarily permanently fixed by the sediment and can be remobilised through mechanical, chemical and biological processes, affecting surface and groundwater quality and plant animal and human health.  However, it is not the total amount of a metal stored in sediment, but how it is actually bound that is important in assessing its environmental impact.  Results suggest that a significant proportion of each metal is held in a potentially mobile and bioavailable form, particularly cadmium.The data collected is used to compile mass budgets of sediments and associated metals for the alluvial area of the River Aire in Leeds.  The results suggest that this section of the Aire contributes large metal loads to the Humber Estuary and out into the North Sea.

T2  - Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group)
AB  - Emergence of cities and road networks have characterised human activity and movement over millennia. However, this anthropogenic infrastructure does not develop in isolation, but is deeply embedded in the natural landscape, which strongly influences the resultant spatial patterns. Nevertheless, the precise impact that landscape has on the location, size and connectivity of cities is a long-standing, unresolved problem. To address this issue, we incorporate high-resolution topographic maps into a Turing-like pattern forming system, in which local reinforcement rules result in co-evolving centres of population and transport networks. Using Italy as a case study, we show that the model constrained solely by topography results in an emergent spatial pattern that is consistent with Zipf’s Law and comparable to the census data. Thus, we infer the natural landscape may play a dominant role in establishing the baseline macro-scale population pattern, that is then modified by higher-level historical, socio-economic or cultural factors.

TI  - Study on the Development Strategy of Pingnan County in Guangxi
AU  - Li, Ye Xi
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Pingnan County locates in the southeast of Guangxi, belongs to Guigang city of Guangxi with the county level Guiping city, Guangnan district, Guangbei district and Qintang district. The geography position is superior, which is the conjunction of the East Coastal developed areas and the resourceful western areas.Since reforming and opening, Pingnan County has developed quickly, but at present the traditional industries are the main industries, the urban-rural dual structure still exists in the region. Now Pingnan County is in the key period of urbanization and industrialization. Pingnan County can go an economical development pathway of the characteristic industries and the preponderant industries, regarding the mainstay and obviously advantageous industries as the breakthrough, concerning the regional realities. Studies on the development strategy of Pingnan county has both theoretical and practical significance. The intra-county economy is the important foundation, the comprehensive and regional basic cell of the national economy. The economy of Pingnan county is not only a complex of the macroscopic economy and the microscopic economy, but also a complex of the urban economy and the rural economy.  The paper attempts to explore the problems of the development strategy of Pingnan County by utilizing the theories of regional economics.Regarding Pingnan County which is becoming lagged comparatively as the object researched, the objective of the article is to find an overtaking method or way to exert the late-developing advantage to utmost by using the theories of regional economics and comparative analytical methods. The paper divides four chapters except Guide:Chapter one discusses the development situation of Pingnan county. Before Pingnan county was incorporated into Guigang city in 1996, the economic strength of Pingnan county had been at the medium level within the eight counties or cities in original Yulin district. After establishing of Guigang city at prefecture level, the economic development total quantity of Pingnan county stood at the second status in the whole city, the per Gross Regional Product was at the first, the agricultural development strength is relatively abundant, the per Industrial Value-added was latter, the per capita annual income of urban households stood at the reciprocal second. According to Channer’s judgment standard about the economic development phase, at present Pingnan county is at the transition stage from the pre-industrial society to the prophase of industrialization. At present, the economic increase of Pingnan county has been good. From 1996 to 2004, GDP increased from 2249000000 Yuan to 4409000000 Yuan. In recent years the biggest power of the economic increase was the gross investment growing quickly. The advantages of development of Pingnan county displays in several aspects，including geography, natural resources, agriculture, land and labor force. The regional advantages are obvious, the traffic is convenient, Pingnan county has the superiority along the Xijiang river. The natural resources are abundant. The reserves proven of the limestone are 4600000000 tons. The advantageous conditions are offered to develop the characteristic and ascendancy agriculture products, on account of the subtropical climate, the good foundation of planting and raising industry, the high producing horizon. The industrial land is sufficient; the development cost of land is much lower than the cost in the East Coastal areas. The labor force is rich; the percentage of the persons whose educational level of the senior middle school ＆ higher level occupies 8.06%, the percentage of the persons whose educational level of the junior middle school ＆ higher level occupies 42.13%. On the other hand, some factors are constraining the next development of Pingnan county, such as the delay of urbanization, the low-level industry and the shortage of human resources reserves. In 2000 the urbanization level of Pingnan county was 19.0%. The proportion of the traditional farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery is excessively high. Because of the small value of industry and the low level of industry, the field and scope of the whole industry loading technology is restricted. The professional technical personnel reserves insufficiently. The proportion of agricultural, engineering and economic professional technical personnel is too low. Moreover, this will cause the lack of talented in the primary industry and the secondary industry. However the problems of “Agriculture, Rural Areas, and Farmers” are the main problems that effect the integration of urban and rural. Chapter two analyses the external environment of the development of Pingnan county. Some factors such as the economic integration in the world, the global industrial transform and establishing of the China- ASEAN have brought some profound influences on the economic development of Pingnan county. Now China has entered the intermediate stage of urbanization and industrialization, Pingnan county should persist the guiding ideology of the sustainable development, catch hold of the opportunities of entry to WTO and the strategy of exploiting the west areas, accept initiatively the industrial transform from Guangdong province and Hongkong, strengthen the regional cooperation with “extensive Zhujiang delta” areas , cultivate some core industries or impetus industries in the economic coordination areas of “Yulin and Guigang corridor”.In chapter three, the paper insists the guiding ideology and gives a strategic orientation of the development of Pingnan county, concerning the actual situations.The overall strategic targets and the urban function of Pingnan county can be positioned as the following: the greatest building material industrial city in the southeast of Guangxi, regional assistant center, a base for yielding and processing extraversion subtropical farm produce, the front to accept the economic radiation and industrial transform from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, the amenity landscape garden city by river possessing the characteristic of the south of China.A preliminary forecast of the level of the economic development and urbanization has said that GDP will be over 12580000000 Yuan by 2015, GDP per capita will approximately achieve 8810 Yuan, GDP will be over 37515000000 Yuan by 2025, GDP per capita will approximately amount 22990 Yuan, that the urbanization level will be 39.05% by 2010, the urbanization level will be 47.33% by 2015, the urbanization level will be 56.26% by 2025.In the future, the urban system of Pingnan county will be adopted possibly urban points and axes combination-network model. The group of regional cities and towns will develop according to three axes. The first will base upon the second-class road from Wuxuan county to Pingnan county and the main road along the Xijiang river. The second will base upon the second-class road from Nanning city to Wuzhou city. The third will base upon the second-class roads from Jinxiu county to Pingnan county and from Pingnan county to Rong county. In the future, the urban system will come into being two economic regions of the north and the south, regarding the county seat as the main development center, Daan town and Zhenlong town etc as the vice-center. The five towns of Danzhu, Daan, Sihuang, Daxin and Zhenlong will be selected as the central towns. The towns in the county seat and the central towns may be regarded as the optimization development towns, the other towns on the plains areas may be regarded as the emphatic development towns, the towns in the mountainous areas may be regarded as the limited development towns.The strategic targets above will be divided into two stages. In the first stage, it will take roughly 10 years to speed up the infrastructure, optimize and update the industrial structure, strengthen the basic status of the agriculture, make great efforts to promote the industrialization and urbanization. In the second stage, it will continue to consummate the infrastructure, adjust reasonably the layouts of the primary industry, the secondary industry and the tertiary industry and realize initially the city modernization and the urban and rural integration.The strategic focal points of Pingnan county are choosing and cultivating the leading industries and the new mainstay industries. Cement, chemical pesticide, handicraft manufacture and high quality highly effective characteristic agriculture may be determined the leading industries, because of their huge potential of development and their great advantages of resources, producing technology and producing cost. The cocoon silk industry, manufacture of paper, ceramics and manufacture of textile wearing apparel may be determined the new mainstay industries.Chapter four puts forward six strategic measures of the development of Pingan county as follows. First, the industrialization should be speeded up though recruiting business and drawing capital. We should improve the soft and hard environment of investment, accept actively the industrial transform from Guangdong and Hongkong, and construct prominently the industrial gardens. Second, we should strengthen the human resources development. We should exert great efforts to improve the basic education, establish and perfect the vocational skill training system, and build a good environment to attract talented. Third, we should develop positively the non-government economy.  The government must give macroscopic instruction, guide the innovation of system and management, support the technical innovation and strengthen the service function. Fourth, we should transform the government function and improve the administration efficiency. Fifth, we should push forward the integration of urban and rural and promote the harmonious development of urban and rural. We should solve the problem of the rural surplus labor force shift, expand the way of the farmers’ additional income, establish and perfect the social security system of the rural areas. Sixth, we should insist the sustainable development of agriculture, industry and population to go the way of the sustainable development.The innovations in the paper are chiefly expressed: Firstly, the development strategy of Pingnan county is studied in a new visual angle using the regional economic correlative theories. Secondly, the towns of Pingnan county are divided into optimization development towns, emphatic development towns and limited development towns for the first time, according to the guiding ideology of dividing functional areas in the 11th 5-year planning. Thirdly, the guiding thinking is brought forward first that the colony of the regional towns in Pingnan county must be developed in term of three axes. Fourth, six material and operable measures of the development strategy of Pingan county are brought forward concerning the situations of Pingnan county.Key words: Development strategy，Strategic measures

AB  - While Alberta Environment and Parks assesses the application for the final wildlife corridor in Canmore to be designated, elected officials and community members are also trying to understand the major development application associated with it and its long term implications.The Rocky Mountain Outlook has made multiple requests to AEP to speak to officials knowledgeable and involved with the wildlife corridor process dating back to October, 2015.According to Fark's report to council this week, shared responsibility with the Town of Canmore and the Province of Alberta is needed to ensure adequate resources are available for the long-term success of the wildlife corridor.The Town of Canmore took the leadership role a couple years ago to begin a conversation around human use inside wildlife corridors, as human activity is prohibited in those protected areas unless on designated trails.Preliminary results show a high level of human use in corridors, which is concerning because human activity disturbs wildlife and can diminish the effectiveness of a corridor for movement, according to biologists with AEP that have presented findings so far to Canmore council, the Canadian Parks Conference and several upcoming presentations are also scheduled.Wildlife mitigations proposed, and more specifically the wildlife fence, is a departure from prior efforts to manage interactions between humans in developed areas and wildlife.[...]the Town of Canmore has used a soft edge approach of keeping high densities away from the corridors and tapering off development on the edges.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Due to habitat loss and disease, conservation efforts for Corynorhinus townsendii should be grounded in a deep understanding of this species’ habitat associations and population connectivity. I investigated associations between roost occupancy and mine roost characteristics and external environmental features. I found that no external mine features were associated with occupancy. On smaller spatial scales, proximity to water and habitat types were associated with occupancy. I tested the use of DNA barcoding to identify C. townsendii eDNA in roosts and found that this method is not viable. Finally, I assessed the population structure of C. townsendii in White Pine County, Nevada. I found significant genetic variance among roosts, with a percent variation that suggests some genetic mixing (P = 0.001, Ф = 0.252). It is important that no aggregation becomes isolated, as this will impede gene flow and could leave isolated groups more vulnerable to disturbance, disease, and genetic drift.

TI  - Falcons survive in heart of city; [Final Edition]
AU  - McVey, Diane
T2  - Edmonton Journal
AB  - Oh, I knew this bird was not Arrow. Who of us living in Edmonton hasn't heard of the remarkable female peregrine that nested on the AGT (Telus) Toll Building for 12 years? Arrow and four separate mates fledged seven of their own young and 14 foster chicks from the Canadian Wildlife Service falcon breeding facility in Wainwright. Since she first nested here, Edmonton's peregrine population had grown by 1996 to four breeding pairs, plus two other pairs in the vicinity. Across Alberta, at least 35 active peregrine nests have been found. Arrow failed to return from her journey south in 1993, but she left us a wonderful legacy. Another peregrine has taken her place and now occupies that same nest each summer. It was this bird and her mate I watched that morning.I hiked across the broad, treeless expanse that passes for a park in our part of the city, eager to reach the one small woodlot that provides sanctuary to a few birds, as well as a "wilderness" play area for neighbourhood children and, unfortunately, a refuse dumping ground for others. Perhaps I'd spy again the chickadees I'd watched "excavating" an old woodpecker hole back in February. As I approached the woods along the power line corridor, however, no bird song greeted me. I'd heard the ever-present house sparrows and a few magpies earlier and watched several gulls drifting above a parking lot. But there, where I'd most anticipated bird life, everything was still.

AB  - The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society fears the study will not accurately portray the importance of the wildlife corridor and permit more development in the Wind Valley-Deadman's Flats area near Canmore, about 90 kilometres west of Calgary.A wildlife corridor is a swath of land that allows for the movement of animals from one area to another. Corridors are critical in helping animals move between summer and winter territories. They also prevent animals from becoming isolated and inbred."It would be extremely unfortunate if the current movement of wildlife between the Wind Valley and the Bow Valley were to be cut off by an inadequate wildlife study and subsequent development," CPAWS said in a letter to environment minister Gary Mar.

AU  - Cholakis, Frances Jean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In The Granite Garden, Anne Spirn envisions a future city where "The paths on which people move into and through the city are designed with care. Every street and highway, and every other transportation corridor, is designed for efficient movement, for pleasure, and as an asset to the neighborhood through which it moves" (Spirn 1984, 270).This practicum provides an examination of one of those "paths on which people move into and through the city", a Winnipeg traffic corridors, Pembina Highway, between the Killarney Ave., Kirkbridge Dr. Intersection, and the Perimeter Highway. The practicum looks at what traffic corridors are, what factors have contributed to their present structure, appearance, and character, and what can be done to improve the experience both of being in the corridor and of moving through it. The focus of the proposal is on community liveability and the pedestrian environment.The practicum begins by reviewing various historic and current factors which have influenced the evolution of cities and streets. The corridor, Pembina Highway and its context are analyzed, and factors which affect the use of the site are examined.The results of a literature review are presented in an overview of current design ideas and issues associated with streets, cities, and neighborhoods. Issues identified by the research are used to generate a functional, cohesive, and aesthetically pleasing design for the site. Plant material, pedestrian walkways, open space, bicycle paths, signage, and lighting are all part of the requirements for an attractive, more human scale street environment that reflects the character and identity of the community, provides opportunities for people to move easily through the area, and is supportive of local businesses. This design presents the Pembina Highway traffic corridor as a meaningful and vital urban place as well as an important gateway to Winnipeg.

T2  - Ecosphere
AB  - The community dynamics of organisms that exhibit multi‐scale responses to habitat change are poorly understood. We quantified changes in species diversity and the functional composition of a waterbird community over two iterations of a repeated transition, the annual drying‐down of arid‐region Lake Ngami, Botswana. We used our data to test three theoretical predictions: simplification of the bird community over time due to a reduction in habitat area and concurrent niche loss; large fluctuations in densities of mobile, opportunistic species; and high variance in predator and prey abundance. Despite temporal variance in species accumulation, we observed no obvious simplification and distinct but consistent groupings of abundance and composition across transitional stages. There were some rapid shifts in functional composition, such as loss of deepwater foragers; winners and losers also occurred within foraging guilds. We conclude that understanding community‐level trends during transitional periods will require stronger theoretical frameworks that more effectively integrate unique species traits and functional groups. For conservation managers, our study offers a cautionary tale of the importance of understanding connectivity, trajectories of change, and the potential for large fluctuations in animal communities independent of management actions during periods of ecological transition.

T2  - IOP Conference Series. Materials Science and Engineering
AB  - The beginnings of the Cittaslow movement date back to 1998. Italian towns became a model for other European towns, and subsequently for others, around the world. This is how an international movement came into being, founded on the idea of improvement of the quality of life of residents, savouring “slow”, healthy lifestyle, drawing on the tradition and history and respecting the natural and cultural environment of small towns. Green areas play a huge role in creating the image of Cittaslow towns. They constitute the so-called “green urban corridors” or “green spots” and have cultural, educational and social significance, including recreation and spa functions. They are not only a complement to architecture, but can play a superior role in the structure of cities. The aim of the work is to analyze the state of parks, squares and green areas management in the Cittaslow towns in region of Warmia and Mazury (Poland). There are 20 environmentally, spatially, economically and demographically diverse towns in the region of Warmia and Mazury that acceded to the association. The international network includes towns with a population under 50 thousand. An analysis of the source materials involved gathering and interpretation of information obtained from monographic and cartographic documentation, both current and archival, from websites of Cittaslow towns and mentions in the media. Apart from a monographic study, the authors carried out a landscape and spatial analysis, pre-project studies and made original designs for selected urban parks and greens in Cittaslow towns. All the Cittaslow towns in the Province of Warmia and Mazury under analysis have high potential in terms of using greenery areas with the social and cultural function. Parks and squares are perfect places for integration of communities and for conducting educational and cultural activities. However, diversity regarding land development and programme offer is observed (utility programme). In some towns, greenery areas cover only space with planned (not always in accordance with the art of gardening) plant compositions. However, parks and squares should be planned not only with their visual aspect in mind, but emphasis should be placed on their utility side (active use). Therefore, the article points to the directions of development of new places, as well the possibility of adding socio-cultural functions to existing greenery areas.

AU  - Loh, Kwai Lam Dorothy
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Harbourfront greening to make better use of the unique harbour assets is Hong Kong Government's long-term vision of waterfront gentrification. Land reclamation in the Victoria Harbour has always been a cardinal way to cope with rapid urbanization in Hong Kong, producing more than 60 km2 (5.5%) of land within the 1,100 km2 territory since 1870s. With very limited public open space in built-up areas, impermeability and compactness of the city has generated extensive areas of saturated site coverage and negligence of plantable areas. Waterfront greening and circum-harbour hillslope enrichment were investigated to yield pragmatic recommendations to improve city greenery. This study evaluates greening constraints in the city, finds potential sites for greening improvement, assesses feasibility of reviving degraded peri-hillslopes, and selects appropriate species to faciliate vegetation establishment. Solutions are proposed to increase green spaces along the coastal zone, connectivity among green spaces, pedestrian accessibility to the waterfront precinct, and per-urban woodland expansion. The study is carried out at two locations: (1) the waterfront of Victoria Harbour including one to two street blocks adjacent to the coast; and (2) the urban fringe hillslopes which constitute a viewshed visible from the harbour. The waterfront section is divided into four harbourfront zones according to land use, prospect of potential development and land formation characteristics. Nearly 6 km2 of coastal land are included in the assessment. Major trunk roads and district distributors are included for a comprehensive site analysis. Peri-urban hillslopes in five zones are delineated by natural topographic boundaries of prominent hills. Sluggish natural forest succession at some sites is attributed to instability of slopes and poor site conditions. There is room for improvement in terms of species selection, silvicultural treatment, and maintenance to accelerate woodland establishment at poor sites. To serve as indicators of planting capability, the site assessment of underlying constraints included slope steepness, aspect and instability, landform, parent materials and terrain components. The Greening Potential Index (GPI) in five classes, developed to measure greening possibility of individual coastal sites, shows many high potential sites among 14 districts, of which 42 specific locations were identified for specific on-site and roadside greening recommendations. The Hillslope Suitability Index (HSI) in four classes was formulated to indicate hillslope planting suitability for a 5-year customised afforestation plan. With 43% of the sites in the second unfavourable class, tree planting requires special treatments and efforts. This plan aims at rehabilitating poor sites in the first stage, and enhancement planting of better sites thereafter. Mixed planting with more native species is preferred to enrich plant diversity of woodlands. The greening endeavours aim at the quality and quantity of natural elements, allowing the limited plantable areas in the city to accommodate the optimal vegetation. All vacant or underused space should be enlisted in the greening programmes. The findings hint strongly the need for a different mindset and methodology to bring more green parcels in built-up areas and to enhance the natural backdrop of the city.

T2  - Journal of Geographical Systems
AB  - It is well known that individual impairments create disparities in the accessibility of individuals to opportunities, lengthening the distances or time needed to reach them or even completely impeding access. However, the accurate calculation and representation of these disparities remain a major challenge for urban and transportation planners. In this paper, we adopt the concept of accessibility disparity, originally applied to measure place accessibility by different modes of transport, to measure and represent the accessibility of individuals with physical disabilities compared to those without disabilities. We use spatial network analysis to calculate spatial connectivity and the accessibility of Lisbon's city center, revealing what we define as 'disability-induced accessibility disparity'. Our results reveal not only the locations responsible for reduced accessibility, i.e., barriers and/or deterrents to movement, but also how much any given disparity reduces the accessibility of an individual, allowing the use of this methodology by planners to identify critical areas and to design inclusive public spaces.

TI  - The Role of Spatial Heterogeneity and Urban Pattern in Modulating Ecosystem Services
AU  - Shoemaker, Douglas Allen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The shift of global populations to cities heralds a new epoch marked by human impact, the Anthropocene, and with it radical changes to the biosphere. Some of the most significant change has occurred in developing countries, where amenity migration to rural areas within commuting distance of expanding urban centers has fundamentally restructured the configuration, hydrology and ecologies of surrounding watersheds. The export of urbanization to the countryside is manifested by rapid conversions of greenfields to impervious covers designed for human use, conversions that have consumed and fragmented networks of green infrastructure supporting growing populations. While the benefits of urbanization to human populations have been substantial, the ability of novel and evolving landscapes to sustain the production of environmental services, such as the ability to purify water, sequester climate-changing carbon, and harbor biodiversity, is poorly understood and historically shown to be compromised. The pace of urbanization, and particularly the combinatorial effects of climate change and development-caused hydrological alteration, has made the task of managing landscapes for human well-being increasingly difficult. Given the persistence of land change drivers such as urban population growth, there is a critical need to describe the trajectory of land cover change using both theory and projection, and anticipate impacts associated with urban form in order to proactively respond to environmental vulnerabilities. A socio-ecological systems approach to the challenge of sustainable environmental provisioning has facilitated efforts to understand the dynamics of co-evolving human and environmental systems. However, a lack of concise theory regarding urban pattern and process, and the paucity of representative case study, has left the role of spatial structure in modulating ecosystem function largely unexplored. To overcome some of these challenges, I describe a series of three related studies where I used a novel integration of land change and ecosystem services simulations in order to map and measure the co-evolution of human and natural systems in transitioning socio-ecological landscapes (SEL), and generate ecosystemscale cause and effect data. In the first study I used this data to estimate the costs of waterborne non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration, and land cover based revenues for a rapidly urbanizing model system over a 24 year period. I also compared the effect associated with alternative patterns of urban growth, contrasting sprawl, infill and de-regulated scenarios with business as usual trends to gauge the effectiveness of environmental planning paradigms, such as “smart growth”. In the second, I tested the capacity a leading theory to explain the role of spatial heterogeneity in modulating ecosystem function in urban systems, to induce the integrated simulation results. Using structural equation modeling to translate the conceptualizations of Alberti (2005) into testable hypotheses, I tested for direct, indirect and modulating effects of landscape composition, connectivity, form, and land use intensity on the production of NPSP and carbon storage. In the third I examined land cover projection data for the presence of patterns suggesting that landscapes evolved in predictable ways. Using a dynamic proxy to bridge human and environmental effect, I tracked the evolution of connectivity in urbanizing watersheds by holding magnitude of change constant for three pattern alternative, and analyzing spatial configuration using distance-based, structural and circuit-based methods. These methods represent a move to predictive, rather than reactive, analytical paradigm, and allow us to move beyond the focus of managing current problems. They emphasize the utility of integrated urban growth-ecosystem service analyses in order to anticipate environmental trade-offs likely required by society. My findings emphasize the need for ecosystem service analyses to more adequately understand development tradeoffs in the metropolitan context. We conclude that not all urban growth impacts environments evenly, and that by controlling the compositional mix, configuration and connectedness, not just the amount of development, we can influence more benign environmental outcomes. To reduce environmental impacts regionally, planners are advised to manage amplifying effects of development by maintaining land cover diversity, and limiting the connectivity of developed land covers along hydrological gradients.

T2  - Environmental Research Letters
AB  - New major road infrastructure projects are planned or underway across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and are expected to have complex, and often deleterious, impacts on natural ecosystems across the region. For this reason, it is necessary to review evidence of how and through which mechanisms, roads might affect these landscapes. We reviewed 137 peer reviewed articles and documented 271 reported effects of roads and their underlying mechanisms inside and outside protected areas across SSA.Our findings show that (a) the study of the effects of roads on ecosystems in SSA is growing and not limited to the field of road ecology; (b) the negative effects of roads on species were reported at a similar frequency within and outside of protected areas; (c) the road-effect zone varied with effect but typically is between 1 and 7 km for larger mammals; (d) access to surrounding ecosystems through roads was the main mechanism driving effects; studies found accessibility influenced land use patterns and illegal hunting and harvesting; (e) other mechanisms by which roads affect (animal) species include, through functioning as a foraging site, and a habitat, and by acting as barriers to and corridors for movement; and (f) there was far more evidence on how roads can negatively impact ecosystems; in contrast, there was less certainty around mechanisms by which roads had no significant or a positive impact, since many of these were either speculated or unknown.An understanding of the underlying mechanisms can assist researchers and environmental assessment practitioners to predict how and where future road development might drive changes in biodiversity and land cover. Moving forward, we suggest that future research build a better understanding of the cumulative effects on different mammal and non-mammal communities and ecosystems more broadly and examine the socioeconomic contexts that characterize different road impacts in SSA.

AB  - Another friend, Frank, a retired civil servant, told me he spotted a coyote six years ago by the Witch's Hut in Kildonan Park. "We have two major rivers in the city with a lot of natural habitat, and these provide travelling corridors for wildlife," biologist Brian Joynt, who works for Conservation Manitoba, said during a presentation earlier this winter."The total number of coyotes is virtually impossible to estimate but they are considered abundant," said Joynt, who added that from 3,000 to 8,000 coyotes are harvested each year by licensed trappers in Manitoba."Although coyotes are predators, they are also opportunistic and shift their diets to take advantage of the most available prey.  Coyotes are generally scavengers and predators of small prey, but can shift to large prey occasionally."

T2  - Earth's Future
AB  - High severity rangeland wildfires have enormous negative impacts on human safety and infrastructure and may have long‐term consequences on ecosystem structure, function, and services, across the vast rangelands in the western United States. We explored prefire vegetation structure of all high severity wildfires, as well as associated areas with low and moderate burn severity, in nonherbaceous‐dominated rangelands in western United States from 1985 to 2018, based on fractional cover of annual forbs and grasses, perennial forbs and grasses, shrubs and trees from the Rangeland Analysis Platform. These wildfires were grouped into nine clusters using Expectation Maximization algorithms and patterns of prefire vegetation structure and the major vegetation types were assessed. High woody cover is a common characteristic of the prefire vegetation structure. Four of the clusters, which accounted for more than 70% of the areas of high severity wildfires, were characterized by high (∼50%) woody cover in prefire vegetation structure. The areas with high severity burns also had significantly higher woody cover than the areas with low or moderate severity burns in eight of the nine clusters. Some of these ecosystems can have abundant fine fuel, structural connectivity such as fuel laddering, and/or highly flammable materials, which can facilitate the ignition of the woody crowns, leading to high severity wildfires. Management strategies (such as prescribed burning) that can decrease woody cover and reduce standing dead vegetation and fuel laddering could be effective in reducing the risk and extent of high severity wildfires on rangelands in the western United States.

TI  - Geomorphology and Structure of Taal Volcano and the Macolod Corridor, Philippines From Remote Sending [i.e. Sensing] and Digital Terrain Data
AU  - Siddiqui, Selima Jehan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Synoptic coverage of Southwestern Luzon provided by remote sensing images and new digital terrain data yields new insight into the geomorphology, geologic history and structure of Taal Volcano. Structural evidence for the occurrence of extension at Taal is determined, and a mechanism linking extension and volcanism at Taal to termination of a proximal right-lateral fault, is proposed. The morphologies and structure of other volcanic centers in SW Luzon are also examined, and similar mechanisms of control to their locations are proposed.Taal is characterized by both historically frequent, highly explosive eruptions, and by prehistoric eruption(s) of colossal proportions. The current eruptive center (Volcano Island) occupies a prehistoric, lake-filled volcano-tectonic depression, previously interpreted to be a graben containing caldera(s). Taal is located within an ENE-aligned volcanic region called the Macolod Corridor, which lies broadly normal to the trend of the Bataan-Mindoro subduction-related volcanic arc. The Macolod Corridor is characterized by recently erupted primitive basalts and NE-striking normal faults; therefore previous investigators have argued that Macolod Corridor volcanism is controlled by extension or trans-tension. A major goal of this study is to more closely examine structural evidence for extension.The development of a complete structural understanding of Taal has been impeded largely by poor field access and exposure, due to ubiquitous dense vegetation. This study therefore employs eight remote sensing and digital terrain data sets of SW Luzon as sources of geomorphic and structural information. The data sets include radar backscatter data, the most useful of which is Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) multi-channel data; two Digital Elevation Maps (OEMs), one of radar derivation, and one of topographic map derivation; a Digital Bathymetric Map (DBM) of Lake Taal; and a SPOT multispectral scene of Taal VTD. The DBM is mosaicked with the two DEMs to provide comprehensive views of Taal VTD.

AB  - Accelerated land use and land cover changes affect regional landscape patterns and change the ecological environment, including soil conservation capabilities. This is not conducive to the sustainable development of human society. In this research, we explored the land use change pattern and landscape change pattern in western Hubei from 2000 to 2020. Using the Chinese soil loss equation and stepwise regression, we measure how landscape patterns affect soil erosion under land use and cover changes in western Hubei Province. The results show that average soil erosion in the mountainous areas of western Hubei tended to increase from 2000 to 2010 and decrease from 2010 to 2020; soil erosion was higher in the western than in the eastern part of the study area. The land in areas with high-intensity and low-intensity soil erosion was mainly waterfront/grassland and cropland/forestland, respectively, and the area of moderate to severe soil erosion was greatest when the slope was 10–20°. When the slope exceeded 20°, the soil erosion area of each grade tended to decrease; thus, 20° is the critical slope for soil erosion in the study area. The landscape pattern in mountainous areas changed dramatically from 2000 to 2020. At the landscape level, landscape fragmentation increased and connectivity decreased, but the area of landscape diversity was stable. Soil erosion in western Hubei was positively correlated with the contiguity index, aggregation index and largest patch index but negatively correlated with the Shannon evenness index. The higher the landscape fragmentation and the greater the accumulation of single land-use types, the more severe the soil erosion is, while the higher the landscape connectivity and the richer the landscape diversity, the less severe the soil erosion is. The results can inform regional landscape management and soil conservation research.

AB  - The power consumption and connectivity of mobile nodes to the network are two essential issues in smart cities. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in smart cities. We propose a customized communication protocol compliant with 6LoWPAN along with the scheme that consumes less power regarding previous solutions. The proposed approach organizes static nodes as a tree for efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. The proposed approach has a hybrid data transmission capability by proactively choosing multi-hop or single-hop routing to reduce power consumption of mobile nodes. It is evaluated based on different factors. The results show the superiority of the approach compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the higher performance (about 10% compared to the best scheme) of the proposed approach specifically in reducing the power consumption of mobile nodes.

TI  - Scenic beauty estimation of urban greenway greening in the central district of guangzhou
AU  - Li, Jun Jie
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorNowadays, with rapid urbanization and increasing nature environmental pollution, people call for a nature space urgently to escape the noisy city life. And the emerging of the greenway solves such problem well. It is considered as an eco-corridor functioned with ecological, connective, aesthetic, recreational and cultural. And it also satisfies city residents' request for nature. Pearl River Delta Regional Greenway is constructed with such purpose. It's a regional greenway in China, represents that regional ecology protection makes a great leap from theory research to practical item. Urban greenway is a part of the Pearl River Delta Regional Greenway. It locates in the centre of the city, serves all of the city residents. Its aesthetic and recreational function is more important than any other function in greenway. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and analyze urban greenway in the central district of Guangzhou, discuss the influence of different landscape factors to scenic beauty estimation values (SBEs) with Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE) method belonged to psychophysical paradigm, and finally provide the suggestions based on the classification of such greenways. The study process with SBE method shows below: Select 50 typical landscapes of 26 urban greenways in the central district of Guangzhou, then take photos of the landscapes and investigate the quadrats. Acquire the public preference rating for each photo in three ways, including slides survey, field investigation and internet survey. Calculate the standard SBEs for each landscape with 200 available questionnaires and the landscape factors for each quadrat with the investigation data. Then build the multivariate linear regression model with SBEs and landscape factors: SBEs=6.193+77.983×Arbor Green Looking Ratio+2.521×Species+0.451×Arbor Mean DBH -2.508×Tree Form Diversity, to analyze the influence of landscape factors to standard SBEs. Additionally discuss the differences between three investigation ways and the consistency between different research groups. Finally classify the greenways according to the surrounding site differences into five classifications: park type, river type, brook type, suburban type and street type, and provide suggestions based on the classification. The study results shows below: (1) The preference to the greenway greening for public relates to the classification of greenway, which shows the surrounding landscape and the location of greenway. The greening landscape of park type greenways is more attractive to city residents, such as Datong Road, Shamian Street and Luhu Road. They rank first three. And the SBEs are all above 110. Because in this kind of landscape, the trees are tall and old, the crown is broad, and the park scenery around is beautiful. On the contrary, the SBEs of street type greenways, such as Zhongshan 8 Road, South Kangwang Road, Fangcun Avenue, are all below 15. They rank bottom three, are the most unpopular of all the greenways. So it's a necessary to decrease or shorten such kind of greenways. The river type and brook type greenways receive mixed reviews. We should tighten the bonds of the greening and the environment around during the designing. And the evolution of suburban type greenways relates closely on the greening itself. (2) The landscape factors of arbor green looking ratio, species, tree form diversity and arbor mean DBH has great influence on the SBEs to the landscape. In the regression model, we find that the landscape factor of tree from diversity is in inverse proportion to the SBEs, and the other three are proportional to it. So the ideal greening mode of greenway in people's mind is that of numerous species, tall trees, thick trunk, broad crown and uniform crown style. (3) In SBE method, slides survey could take the place of field investigation, and internet survey should be also used together. Different degrees of familiarity to the greenways makes no difference to the evaluate result. There is no significant difference between slides survey with field investigation. Though analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these investigations, it is found that slides survey should be used primarily. Since the result of internet survey makes different to them, it should be used together with slides survey. The evaluate result by different groups with different degrees of familiarity to the greenways shows no significant difference, and it also proves that office-based evaluation could take the place of field evaluation well. So it's unnecessary to consider such factors during using the SBE method about choosing study groups and survey

AB  - Competition for land is increasing as demand for multiple land uses and ecosystem services rises. Land regulation of the principles of landscape ecology is necessary to develop more sustainable approaches to land use planning. The research evaluated the present land patterns and determined best practices for its regulation of Dongwang Township in Quyang County, located in the Taihang Mountain area of Hebei Province, China. The research used the landscape ecology theory to construct an index system for landscape pattern analysis based on the GIS and Fragstats 3.3 software. In this study, we examined the specific reasons that landscape ecology is superior to traditional methods in land consolidation planning and design, which is conducive to the comprehensive development of land ecological benefits. Landscape ecological planning can effectively reduce landscape fragmentation and improve intensive management. The result found that the descending order of the Shannon index was current landscape, landscape ecological planning, and traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning could protect the natural diversity than traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning enables the creation of long corridors, with higher densities and connectivity and lower average corridor widths than traditional planning. Besides, it can improve ecological service function values in the study area to varying degrees, thus discouraging residents from limiting themselves to grain production. This research has great potential to improve the visibility of ecosystem services in local land use planning and, thus, to improve the ecological functioning of future landscapes.

AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirão Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services.

Rodovia BR-465, km 7, 23890-000 Seropédica, RJ, Brazil.------------ABSTRACTLeptopanchax opalescens (Myers, 1942) is a small seasonal killifish endemic to coastal drainages in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Leptopanchax opalescens was recaptured in temporary open vegetation pools (22°42.35’S, 43°41.59’W) in the hydrographic basin of the Guandu River, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after eight years without records. Information on habitat and population parameters (Capture per unit area (CPUA), size, sex ratio and length-weight relationship (LWR)) are given to provide subsidies for the conservation of this species. Specimens were captured during the rainy season (January-April 2020) in shallow pools (mean depth = 21 ± 12 s.d. cm), with relatively acidic pH (5.2 ± 0.8) and low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (3.5 ± 1 mg/L). The estimated CPUA of the population was 0.89 fish/m2. The total length (TL) of males ranged from 21.1 to 28.8 cm, and females ranged from 17.0 to 31.2 mm. Males were significantly larger (t-test = 2.04, p < 0.05) than females, which were in greater proportion (2.83Female: 1Male, p < 0.001). A positive allometric coefficient (b = 3.19) was found through length-weight relationship curve, indicating that individuals of the species gain proportionally more increment in weight than in length. Leptopanchax opalescens is a critically endangered species, and the results of this study contribute to the knowledge of the distribution, population structure and conservation of the species and its natural habitats.KEW WORDS: Annual fish; Atlantic forest; conservation; Rio de Janeiro; southeast Brazil; threatened faunaINTRODUCTIONRivulidae (Cyprinodontiformes) is a diversified group of killifish with about 456 valid species occurring between southern Florida and northeastern Argentina (Costa 2011, Fricke et al. 2020). Rivulids are sexually dimorphic, secondary freshwater fish, small as adults, and have unique reproductive characteristics among the vertebrates (Loureiro et al. 2018). Many rivulids have a characteristic annual or seasonal life cycle and no generation overlap (Furness 2016, Reichard 2016). Growth, maturity and reproduction occur in a single, short rainy season that favors their development. Through embryonic diapause, the eggs of these fish survive the dry season that the juveniles and the adults cannot tolerate (Furness 2016). Besides dissection, the seasonal habitats of Rivulidae also pose other challenges, including limited energy, space and time for sexual maturation and reproduction (Loureiro et al. 2016). In addition, annual killifish are adapted to habitats that are often subject to a high degree of environmental variation. These environments reach extreme parameters (e.g., high temperatures, low oxygen concentrations, acidic waters) that approach the limits of vertebrate survival (Podrabsky et al. 2016).LeptopanchaxCosta, 2016 comprise six valid species - L. aureoguttatus (Cruz, 1974), L. citrinipinnis (Costa, Lacerda & Tanizaki, 1988), L. itanhaensis (Costa, 2008), L. opalescens (Myers, 1942), L. splendens (Myers, 1942), and L. sanguineus Costa, 2019 - endemic to the Atlantic Forest Biome (Costa 2009a, Fricke et al. 2020) and distributed between the Maricá Lagunar system (22°55’S) in southeastern Brazil and the hydrographic basins draining to Paranaguá Bay (25°31’S), southern Brazil (Costa 2016). Two species, L. citrinipinnis and L. opalescens, are found in temporary pools within open vegetation formations, including coastal restingas, while the other species of Leptopanchax are found in shallow seasonal channels within dense rainforest (Costa 2008, 2016, 2019, Costa et al. 2019). All species in this genus are very vulnerable, and four out of the six species are listed as Critically Endangered (CE) in the Red Book of Brazil’s Endangered Fauna (ICMBio 2018). Leptopanchax sanguineus, although recently described (2019), is possibly “born” extinct (Costa 2019). Habitat loss and fragmentation are the main threats to rivulids (Costa 2009a). Swamps and temporary pools have been drastically destroyed, both in agricultural areas and in areas undergoing urbanization, through deforestation, drainage and landfills (Castro and Polaz 2020, Calhoun et al. 2017). The scarcity of ecological information on the life history of Leptopanchax species does not help their preservation.Leptopanchax opalescens is distinguished from all other species of Leptopanchax by the unique coloration and pigmentation pattern of the body and fins in males (Costa 2009a, 2019). This species was initially described by Myers (1942) as Cynolebias opalescens, being later synonymized as Leptolebias fluminensis (Faria & Muller, 1937) and as Cynolebias nanus (Da Cruz & Peixoto, 1983). More recently, Costa (2016) described a new genus (Leptopanchax) when its current valid status was defined as Leptopanchax opalescens (Myers, 1942). Records of this species are rare and the last one occurred more than eight years ago (Costa 2013). Little information is available on the life history, ecology, and population parameters of most species in the group. In this study, we assessed some population parameters of L. opalescens to support conservation efforts. New occurrence locations are presented, and information on the ecology (habitat description) and population parameters (Capture per unit area-CPUA, individual size, sex ratio and length-weight relationship) are provided for the first time for the species.MATERIAL AND METHODSThe study area comprises temporary pools located approximately 4.6 km from the middle reaches of the Guandu River (hydrographic basin of the Guandu River), which drains into the Sepetíba Bay, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The locali ty of occurrence is an industrial site of BRF S.A (22°42.35’S, 43°41.59’W) in the municipality of Seropédica. The sampling area is part of the Atlantic Forest Biome, but a large part of this original cover has already been lost, and shrubs and grasses currently predominate. The climate is seasonal tropical, with rainy summers and dry winters (Aw climate, according to the Köppen - Geiger classification). The annual average temperature is 23.9 °C, with averages of 26.6 °C in summer and 21.4 °C in winter. The average annual rainfall is 1,354 mm, with rainy season between October and April.Monthly fish sampling and measurements of environmental variables were carried out simultaneously between November 2019 and April 2020. Sixteen (16) sites were delimited, each 1 m2, where the collectors searched for fish for two minutes, totaling 96 samples (16 sites × 6 months). The sampling sites covered different types of wet habitats, from the edges to the bottom of the temporary pools. Fish were collected with immersion nets (hand net with an oval shape, 50 x 40 cm, 1 mm of panel mesh size). After capture, they were anesthetized with hydrochloride benzocaine (50 mg/l) and euthanized in situ. In the laboratory, the fish were measured (precision 0.01 cm), weighed (precision 0.001 g), fixed in 10% formalin and, after 48 hours, preserved in 70% ethanol. In order to reduce the impacts of sampling on fish populations, many live specimens were returned to the pools. The fish were identified and sexed according to Costa (2009a, 2016, 2019). The material was collected under the permission of IBAMA/ICMBio (authorization #10707) and vouchers were deposited at the Ichthyological Collection of the Fish Ecology Laboratory of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (LEP-UFRRJ # 2576-2578) and in the Ichthyological Collection of the Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (MNRJ # 51962).The water physicochemical variables of temperature (°C), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), redox potential (mV), pH, electrical conductivity (mS/cm) and turbidity (NTU) were measured using a multiprobe model Horiba U-52 G (Shanghai, China). Depth (cm) was measured using millimeter rulers and a digital probe (SpeedTech SM-5).Abundance was assessed by the total number of fish caught and expressed as a catch per unit area (CPUA: number of individuals/m2). A Student t-test was performed to compare the differences between the mean of the total body length (TL) between males and females. A possible bias in the population sex ratio was assessed by comparing the expected rate of 1: 1, and tested with a chi-square test (χ2 ), with a 95% of significance level. The length-weight W=a×TLb  relationships (LWR) based on measurements of 39 individuals (males + females) was estimated by linear regression on the transformed equation: log⁡W=log⁡a+blog⁡TL  (Le-Cren 1951), where W is body weight (g), TL is total length (cm), a is the y-intercept and b is the slope (Froese 2006). The areas of occupancy (AOO) for the population were calculated using satellite images in Google EarthPro (version 7.3). The boundaries of the temporary pools were determined according to Lanés et al. (2014), based on visual observations of the watermarks and in the vegetation indicators (e.g., plants with morphological, physiological, or reproductive adaptations to prolonged saturation/flooding).RESULTSA total of 86 individuals of L. opalescens (18 males, 51 females and 17 with undefined sex, Figs 1, 2) were captured in temporary water pools close to the middle reaches of the Guandu River basin (Figs 3, 4). Of these, about 39 live specimens (45.3% of the total captured) were returned to the pools. This is a new area in the proximity of the Guandu River with no previous record of this species. Leptopanchax opalescens (Figs 1, 2; Fig. S1) showed a marked sexual dimorphism: while the females have a light brown color and hyaline fins (Fig. 1), the males have a very striking color (Fig. 2), which allow the differentiation of L. opalescens from other similar species occurring in the Atlantic Forest biome (Costa 2019), such as: (i) dark red band well delimited on the distal margins of the dorsal and anal fins (Fig. 2a), (ii) iridescent golden band on the dorsal fins located below and parallel to the red bands (Fig. 2b), (iii) red body with diffuse light spots (Fig. 2c); (iv) caudal fin with dark red vermiculate spots (Fig. 2d). This color pattern in males corroborates those presented in the identification keys of Leptopanchax species (Costa 2019). In addition to the staining patterns, the meristic counts (e.g., number of fin rays, number of lateral and transversal line scales; Table 1) of the specimens overlap with the reference values presented by Costa (2009a) for L. opalescens and with the holotype of Cynolebias nanus (= L. opalescens, MNRJ# 10621).Figures 1-2 Specimens of Leptopanchax opalescens: (1) female, 24.0 mm TL, hyaline bode and fins; (2) male, 28.8 mm TL). Letters indicating patterns of body and fin color in male: (a) red band on the distal margins of the dorsal and anal fins; (b) gold band below and parallel to the red band in the dorsal fin; (c) red body with diffuse light spots; (d) vermiculate red spots in the anal fin.

The CPUA achieved the highest values between January and March 2020 and there were no records in November-December 2019 (Fig. 5). The estimated areas of occupancy (AOO) of the population found in Seropédica was defined as 8,200 m2 (0.01 km2). From May until the beginning of the rainy season, the pools where the rivulids were previously captured are completely dry.Figure 5 Monthly average and standard deviation (vertical dashes) of the catch per unit area (CPUA: number of individuals/m2) of Leptopanchax. opalescens between November 2019 and April 2020.Leptopanchax opalescens was recorded in a very typical habi tat structure, characterized by small and shallow (<40 cm) and irregular temporary pools formed in small ground depressions (Table 2). The pools had different areas and shapes, depending on the topography of the terrain and the rainfall accumulation in the previous days; most pools were connected, forming a large swamp. The vegetation cover at the margins and within the pools was predominated by grasses and, to a lesser extent, macrophytes (Fig. 4), whereas trees were absent or rare in the area. Two other fish species were captured in sympatry with the rivulids in low densities; only one specimen of the native callichthyid armored catfish Hoplosternum littorale (Hancock, 1828) and five individuals of the non-native three spot gourami Trichopodus trichopterus (Pallas, 1770). The physicochemical water variables in the temporary pools indicate acidic pH (mean ± s.d., 5.2 ± 0.8), high temperatures (26.2 ± 0.8 °C) and low oxygen concentrations (3.5 ± 1 mg/L) (Table 2).Table 2 Habitat and water environmental characteristics in the temporary pools associated with the captures of L. opalescens in the Guandu River basin, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The individual total length (TL) ranged from 11.2 to 31.2 mm. Size in males ranged from 21.1 to 28.8 mm (mean ± s.d., 24.8 ± 2.7 mm TL) and in females ranged from 17.0 to 31.2 mm (22.3 ± 3.0 mm TL). The mean size of males was significantly larger than females (t-test = 2.04, p < 0.05). The length-weight relationship (LWR) with sexes pooled was determined by the following equation fitted to a potential curve: Wt = 0.0088 × TL 3.199 (N = 39; Fig. 6). This equation corresponds to the logarithmic form, ln W = -4.73 + 3.199 × ln L (r = 0.97).Figure 6 Length-weight relationship (LWR) of Leptopanchax opalescens in the Guandu River Basin, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.DISCUSSIONThe main finding of this study is the re-discovery of L. opalescens after eight years without records, and the description of its population parameters in temporary pools of open vegetation in the hydrographic basin of the Guandu River, in South-eastern Brazil. The species is listed as Critically Endangered (CE) in the latest version of the Ministry of Environment’s ‘Livro Vermelho da Fauna Brasileira Ameaçada de Extinção’ (ICMBio 2018).It is rare to find L. opalescens. The last record occurred in 2012, after 31 years without records (Costa 2013). This is not the first time that this species has been captured in Seropédica, RJ. In 1984, a single male specimen “similar” to C. nanus (= L. opales cens) was captured at the Horto Florestal Santa Cruz (currently Flona Mário Xavier), in sympathy with the critically endangered species Notholebias minimus (Myers, 1942) (Costa 1988). Since then, the species has not been recorded in the area. Despite the limitations posed by a record based on a single specimen in a location not represented in a reference collection, the red book considered the record of L. opalescens in Seropédica (ICMBio 2018) as valid. The population captured in the present study, located just 2 km away from this record in 1984, confirms the occurrence of the species for Seropédica and for the drainages of the Guandu River.The known distribution of the species is diffuse, with several records from Baixada Fluminense beginning in the 1940s (Souto-Santos and Beltrão 2018). Due to the urbanization and advancement of industrial and agropastoral activities, the original habitats of L. opalescens have been destroyed and their populations have been excised. For example, the location where L. opalescens was re-discovered in 2012 (22°51’06”S, 43°26’16”W) is the future site of the Rio de Janeiro’s International Autodrome (Kaz 2019). During a contested environmental licensing process in the area, the species was not recaptured on location (Terra Nova 2019, Kaz 2019). In two other small hydrographic basins, Estrela and Iguaçu rivers, in the northern portion of the city of Rio de Janeiro, the species may be locally extinct (Costa 2008). The current record at the Guandu River basin is within an industrial development area. Construction there will invariably lead to losses of seasonal habitats occupied by the annual rivulids. In return, the environmental managers, upon learning about the distribution of this threatened species within the enterprise development area, remodeled the project’s legal reserve area as to protect the remaining habitats of L. opalescens. As the annual fish usually occupy temporary pools of reduced size, this measure was a step towards the preservation of its habitat and to the conservation of this critically endangered species.The average catch per unit area (CPUA) was only 0.89 fish/m2, a low ratio that suggests that L. opalescens occurs at low densities. Other species of Rivulidae were also caught at values <1 fish/m2, such as Austrolebias cheradophilus (Vaz-Ferreira, Sierra de Soriano & Scaglia de Paulete, 1965) (0.86 fish/m2; Lanés et al. 2014) and Austrolebias quirogai Loureiro, Duarte & Zarucki, 2011 (0.33 fish/m2; Volcan et al. 2014) in southern Brazil. In general, the demography of rivulids in wetlands varies according to species, time and local conditions. It is affected by deterministic and stochastic factors, such as water availability and depth of temporary pools, connectivity of habitats, climate change, predation, competition, and reproductive, survival and mortality rates (Costa et al. 2009b, Furness 2016, Loureiro et al. 2016, Lanés et al. 2018, Garcia et al. 2019). The natural lifespan of annual fish is less than eight months, with these species disappearing before habitat desiccation (Lanés et al. 2016). Habitat condition, landscape attributes and changes in climate and hydrological variables over the hydroperiod are the factors that have the greatest influences on the spatiotemporal variation of the fish community (Volcan et al. 2019, 2020). The waters of the temporary open vegetation pools where L. opalescens was captured were acidic, had high temperatures and low oxygen concentrations. In fact, the annual killifish have evolved to withstand a high degree of daily and seasonal environmental variation, in terms of temperature, oxygen concentration, pH, salinity and, of course, availability of water (Podrabsky et al. 2016, Godoy et al. 2020).Leptopanchax opalescens showed a positive allometric growth (b = 3.19), with comparatively more gain in weight than in length (Froese 2006). However, no previous references were found for the LWR of L. opalescens and other species of Leptopanchax, making it impossible to compare our results with other studies. Males of L. opalescens had a larger body than females, corroborating the pattern of sexual dimorphism commonly observed in other species of Rivulidae (e.g., Lanés et al. 2012). In Austrolebias reicherti (Loureiro & García, 2004) for example, males tend to choose larger females, which often produce larger and more numerous eggs (Passos et al. 2019). Differences in body size mediate the coexistence of annual fish in temporary pools (Volcan et al. 2019). The unbalanced sex ratio with a predominance of females of L. opalescens (2.8 female: 1 male), have been also reported in previous studies for other species of Rivulidae (e.g., Reichard et al. 2009, Lanés et al. 2012). Sex ratio might influence ecological conditions whenever sexual dimorphism is associated with ecological dimorphism in species with strong ecological interactions (Fryxell et al. 2015). In Nothobranchius killifish (Nothobranchiidae), for instance, there is a bias in the sex ratio with a higher male mortality in nature (Reichard 2016). This may be associated with males being more frequent targets of heron attacks than females (Haas 1976) and higher male mortality results from their aggressive behavior (Reichard et al. 2014, Polačik and Podrabsky 2016). Annual fish suffer high sex-dependent size-specific mortality that is more strongly related to predation than to density-dependent processes (Reichard et al. 2018).Currently, there are six valid species of annual fish in Leptopanchax and four are endemic to the state of Rio de Janeiro (Costa 2019, Fricke et al. 2020), which reinforces the importance of environmental measures and public policies in the state to preserve fish in this genus. The recovery of degraded habitats and a management plan for a wider area, together with the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the registration of legal preserves and environmental education programs are appropriate measures that can contribute to the conservation of this species. The recapture of L. opalescens was an important step to call the attention to this species and take actions to preserve it. The identification was based on the available literature, including comparison with the holotype of one of the species synonymized as L. opalescens. In view of the high degree of specialization and endemism of rivulids, osteological and genetic techniques should be used in the future to compare the known populations of L. opalescens.In this study, we re-discovered L. opalescens in an industrial area with intense landscape modification, an indication that part of its original habitats has been already lost. After the discovery of these rivulids, the wetland areas where the population of this fish occurs were protected within the area of the enterprise. This is an example of integration between scientific results and effective environmental management practices, with demarcation of protected areas. Besides the recapture of this species, we described population parameters such as capture per unit area (CPUA), length-weight relationship (LWR), sex ratio, and size structure. These are basic information that was previously unknown. The species’ occurrence data are publicly available on the Information System on Brazilian Biodiversity (SIBBr, in Portuguese) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Araújo et al. 2020). We hope that the information generated here will also reach the general public, researchers, and conservation agencies, and help the management and conservation of this annual fish that is threatened in Brazil.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank Paulo A.

TI  - Shared-Use Pathways Located in Natural Settings within the Urban Context: A Multiple Case Study Exploring How Design Affects Use by Children
AU  - Cox, Adina J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With an increasingly urbanized world, children have less opportunity to move freely about their neighborhood environments, interact with nature, and engage in free-play behaviors. Vehicle traffic and parental concerns about safety have limited biking and walking for children. Pathways provide opportunities for multiple healthy behaviors for children, including opportunities for physical activity, contact with nature, active transportation, access to play, and independent mobility. Pathway use by children has not been studied, although the federal government provides transportation funding for pathways and children have need for such recreation and transportation alternatives. Understanding children’s use of pathways is essential for communities that they may effectively utilize transportation dollars in planning and designing high quality pathways for use by children.A case study approach that includes four pathways in four states and utilizes multiple methods informed this research. Two types of pathways were selected as cases: pathways located within destination parks that incorporated play equipment in play pockets, located in Springfield, Missouri; Chattanooga, Tennessee, and pathways located along neighborhood greenways, located in Richardson, Texas; and Cary, North Carolina. Behavior Mapping was used to observe pathway affordances and behavior in settings that occurred along pathway corridors. Parental perceptions of benefits, safety, and independent mobility were determined through surveys conducted at all four sites. Pathway traffic counts conducted on site provided information on the age of.Results suggest the following conclusions: 1. While vegetation may provide benefits such as shade, wildlife habitat, contact with nature, and scenic beauty, dense vegetation my discourage use by increasing parental fears. 2. Installation of play pockets may lead to more frequent pathway visits and increased duration of visits. This is important as time spent outdoors is associated with higher levels of physical activity for children. 3. Children are attracted to wildlife along pathway corridors. This important attribute may be encouraged by pathway planners and managers through careful attention to pathway location and landscape quality. 4. Parents ranked ‘family fun’ highest as a desired pathway benefit, followed closely by physical activity, contact with nature, and scenic beauty. These family benefits may be useful information to public health, and park and recreation system officials to promote pathway use. 5. Parents are concerned about social safety of children in natural environments but high visibility along pathway corridors may decrease parental fears.

TI  - Evaluation of rural land-use plans in protected area bio-networks in northeastern tanzania
AU  - Kaswamila, Abiud Lucas
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The application of rural land-use planning is seen by many in developing countries as a panacea for minimising land-use conflicts and for increasing the productivity of natural resources in African rangelands. However, this assumption has not been thoroughly tested in the context of wildlife corridors in African rangelands. The focus of the research work for this thesis was to evaluate both "conventional" and "participatory" approaches to land-use planning in an African rangeland setting, and to assess the impact of these land-use plans in mitigating conflict and enhancing conservation of important wildlife migratory routes. Nine villages were selected for study in Northeastern Tanzanian rangelands, within the Tarangire-Manyara, Greater Serengeti and MkomaziTsavo ecosystems. Several methods were used to provide an indication of the performance of the plans, against their stated objectives of minimising land-use conflict and conserving wildlife migratory routes. Eight hundred and fifty two households, 13 "expert witnesses" and 4 representatives of planning agencies were interviewed. Several field assessment visits and focus group discussions were also carried out. Review and analysis was conducted on archive data, land-use plans technical reports and general management plans for neighbouring Parks. The results of the research presented in this thesis revealed five major findings: (1) involvement of land-use stakeholders in land use preparation was low; (2) different types of conflicts and encroachments increased after the plans were implemented; (3) Park management failed to involve adjacent villages in the preparation and implementation of Park GMPs; (4) the amount of conflict around villages where plans were in place was comparable to that around villages with no plans, suggesting that the plans made no difference to conflict; (5) overall, both participatory and conventional plans failed to achieve their objectives of mitigating conflicts and enhancing conservation of wildlife corridors and dispersal areas. The major causes of weakness and failure of the plans to achieve their desired objectives were: (l) insufficient participation oflocal communities in the planning process; (2) lack of robust of robust, transparent and accountable implementation strategies for the plans; (3) inadequately qualified rural planners; (4) lack of a comprehensive vision - "holistic approach" - to the planning process. Taking these findings into account, the author has made recommendations for an improved Buffer Zone Land-use Planning framework (BUZLUP) that could contribute to progress in mitigating conflicts and enhancing both conservation and development in Northeastern Tanzania. It is concluded, however, that high quality plans in themselves cannot ensure the successful establishment and maintenance of effective wildlife corridors. In addition to improved planning strategies such as the proposed BUZLUP framework, other broader socio-economic issues need to be addressed, including strengthened conservation education, better protection for rural people's natural resources and support for their livelihoods, equitable benefit sharing from conservation and tourism activities, and more devolution of decision-making powers to the grass-roots level in communities neighbouring conservation areas.

TI  - Community satisfaction and mobility decisions: A case study in Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia
AU  - Sembawa, Essam Adel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation provides a partial explanation for transience in Jubail Industrial City (JIC) in Saudi Arabia despite abundant housing and employment opportunities. A quantitative analysis of a self-administered questionnaire sample of 540 JIC employees revealed that five community attachment factors related to residents' demographics, concrete and perceived housing attributes, and future housing expectations contribute to approximately 45% of the residents' overall satisfaction variance while the latter explained almost 35% of the variance in their mobility decisions. Open-ended response in the latter sample, and the response of nine additional interview cases revealed that inadequacies in social climate and dwelling maintenance were primary contributors to dissatisfaction and the intention to move by JIC residents. Dissatisfaction with the social climate was determined by the nature of JIC as a remote town from the homeplace and major urban centers, and as a work-dominated place with little time for leisurely social activities. Dissatisfied movers attributed their perceptions of declining housing conditions to profit-oriented maintenance contracting at the expense of quality, a perception that is heightened by residents' concern about the long-term effects of sand-storms and air pollution on housing upkeep. In order to enhance residents' commitment to stay in JIC, officials need to enhance the town's connectivity with the rest of the country, diversify leisurely pursuits, expand maintenance policy options for the residents, involve them in the decision-making process, and intensify the use of heat-resistant vegetation along community borders with desert and industrial areas.

TI  - Pedestrian corridors in downtown Dallas, Texas and their implications on the movement of downtown residents
AU  - Lively, Lori Molitor
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The City of Dallas has embarked upon an aggressive economic redevelopment effort in the downtown area. Economic goals of this redevelopment effort are closely tied to and dependent upon a critical mass of downtown residents. The target number of residents is 10,000 by 2015 (Strategic Engagement: Dallas' Economic Development Plan. City of Dallas, Office of Economic Development, 2005.) However, the urban form of downtown Dallas is a vehicle-oriented network of streets. Although downtown residency numbers have climbed from only 896 (excluding institutionalized persons) to 2,277 in the decade between 1990 and 2000 (Census.gov) and was estimated by the metropolitan planning organization to be 5,646 in 2005, no study has documented the location and travel mode choices of these residents. However, recent planning efforts have created physical pathways for pedestrian movement in the Main Street area. Using concepts pioneered by landscape ecology, a wildlife behavior model theory, and surveys of downtown residents and key decision makers, patches and corridors utilized by downtown residents were mapped and analyzed. A new network of corridors was also recommended to better connect the patches identified in the study. In addition to the current land uses and activities, future nodes of activity were predicted along the corridors. These new were nodes predicted based on accessory activity attracted by the presence of large numbers of pedestrians. An active street life is generally understood to be a desirable quality in attracting redevelopment to downtown areas. This study found that the lack of existing pedestrian corridors connecting patches of downtown activity inhibited pedestrian activity and promoted vehicular options, thus decreasing an active street life. The connection of patches within the habitat of downtown residents through designated corridors is applicable to any large urban centers with downtown populations. However, to be effective, the process of identifying patches relevant to populations must be conducted prior to corridor implementation and public entities, such as city planning and zoning regulations, must recognize and support creation of these corridors.

TI  - Land Planning Above the Arctic Circle
AU  - Finkler, Earl
T2  - Planning
AB  - The diversity of both the population and terrain coupled with the recalcitrance of oil and gas companies have made the new subdivision ordinance to accommodate the special needs of Alaska's North Slope Borough a challenging project.  The ordinance was designed to respond to local concerns about appropriate street and lot design and orientation in the 88,000-square-mile borough.  Construction Systems Management (Anchorage) developed the ordinance in coordination with the borough planning staff.  Among the provisions are those that: 1.  prohibit street and road development across the migration paths of wildlife, 2.  encourage roads and transportation corridors to be minimized by such means as clustering, 3.  encourage streets to be aligned so as to maximize the natural removal of snow, 4.  provide for a platting administrator to process minor plats, and 5.  give the borough authority to require the dedication of lands for trails and subsistence areas, such as a whaling park.  The North Slope Borough now has 3 land-management tools to cope with rapidly changing conditions: 1.  the zoning ordinance, 2.  the new subdivision ordinance, and 3.  the overall comprehensive plan.

AB  - Population mobility, increasing demand for transportation, and the complexity of land use have an impact on environmental quality degradation and air quality pollution. This study aims to analyze (1) the effect of population mobility, increased traffic volume, and land use change on air quality pollution, (2) direct and indirect effects of urban activities, transportation systems, and movement patterns on environmental quality degradation and air pollution index, and (3) air pollution strategy and sustainable urban environmental management. The research method used is a sequential explanation design. Data were obtained through observation, surveys, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The results of the study illustrate that the business center and Daya terminal with a value of 0.18 µgram/m3 is polluted, the power plant and Sermani industrial area with a value of 0.16 µgram/m3 is polluted, the Makassar industrial area with a value of 0.23 is heavily polluted, and the Hasanuddin International Airport area with a value of 0.04 µgram/m3 is not polluted. Population mobility, traffic volume, and land use changes have a significant effect on environmental quality degradation, with a determination coefficient of 94.1%. The direct effect of decreasing environmental quality on the air pollution index is 66.09%. This study recommends transportation management on the main road corridor of Makassar City, which is environmentally friendly with regard to sustainable environmental management.

TI  - Climate Change, Species Range Expansion and the Institutional Response
AU  - Gilchrist, Anna Mary
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Climate change poses significant threats and opportunities to all life on Earth. Fundamental to the maintenance of biodiversity, in temperate latitudes, is the degree to which species can undergo range expansion to respond to poleward shifts in suitable climate space. However, in Europe, the ability of lowland species to achieve this may be impeded by the intensively managed and fragmented nature of the landscape, especially in heavily developed areas such as the Urban Mersey Basin Natural Area of North West England, the study area for this research. The thesis aims to further understanding of how species undergo range expansion in such situations, and through this to inform the development of possible adaptation strategies, and their integration into an effective institutional response. Butterflies are chosen as the indicator taxon because of their responsiveness to climate change and because their changing distribution through time has been logged very effectively in Britain by a national recording scheme. This data is used to explore the extent and regional variation of recent range expansion by 15 butterfly species through the British landmass. From this cohort, five generalist species are chosen for more detailed study within the Urban Mersey Basin. Data analyses showed that all five species have successfully extended their range through and beyond this area during the study period (1983-2004). However, the 'movement strategies' are distinctive between species. Two species (comma and speckled wood) were able to navigate successfully though the built up area, two were more associated with open land (purple hairstreak and gatekeeper) and one (small skipper) was intermediate. The analysis of distribution in relation to land cover and habitat type suggests that, for the more selective 'countryside' species, chains of interlinked habitat can provide effective 'movement corridors' or 'networks'. Corridor features within the landscape may impede or facilitate movement, depending on species ecology and behaviour. This knowledge was then applied to four specialist butterfly species, associated with woodland (2), grassland (1) and heathland (1) habitats. This analysis suggested that the availability of preferred habitat and species mobility will both influence potential for range expansion. To facilitate range expansion by specialists it is suggested that habitat specific networks need to be established through restoring, creating and extending habitat patches and by altering corridor management within and between these networks. Climate change adaptation for biodiversity in urbanised parts of lowland Britain should, it is argued, focus on the establishment of near continuous chains of high quality habitat, with strategic planning to 'engineer' effective connectivity for a range of habitat types. Whilst the policy framework at European, national and regional levels recognises the importance of increasing landscape connectivity in response to climate change, the thesis suggests that the facilitation of species range expansion, especially for 'specialists', will require more effective landscape planning and management at the sub-regional scale. This will need to involve a range of actors and agencies in a better targeted and more effectively coordinated response than is currently evident.

AU  - Crawford, Tiffany
T2  - The Vancouver Sun
AB  - Fatal attacks on humans by animals with big, sharp teeth are rare in Canada despite a recent spike in cougar maulings, but a sustainable plan is needed as urban sprawl threatens the habitat of predators, say conservation experts.  Squamish Mayor Greg Gardner said city officials have done some mapping of wildlife habitat but there are currently no wildlife corridors, which are large swaths of land banned to humans to allow the safe movement of predatory animals.

TI  - The natural South Florida system II: Predrainage ecology
AU  - Browder, Joan A
AU  - Ogden, John C
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The goal of the South Florida restoration process is to reestablish a sustainable ecological system that approximates the predrainage system (i.e., the system that existed before canals and water control structures were built). A critical step in the restoration process is to describe the predrainage system with sufficient detail to capture the essential landscape features (e.g., space, connectivity, patterns) that gave the region its defining character and supported its natural abundance and diversity of plants and wildlife.A previous attempt at reconstruction of predrainage (circa 1870) vegetation patterns covered only the Everglades (Davis et al., 1994) but introduced a concept of landscape mosaics that should be extended to South Florida. We propose 16 landscape units that include freshwater landscapes, upland landscapes, coastal wetlands, and estuaries (particularly Florida and Biscayne Bays), the Florida Keys and Reef Tract, and the Inner Southwest Florida Shelf.The predrainage area, because of its enormous size, supported a landscape heterogeneity that was advantageous to animals with several distinct habitat-related life strategies. Five species have been selected to illustrate different dependencies on landscape patterns in predrainage South Florida: wood stork (Mycteria americana), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), and pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum). As individuals or as populations, these animals operated across several spatial and temporal scales. The predrainage system's large spatial extent and complex hydropatterns allowed wood storks and other animals with large feeding ranges to take advantage of the strongly seasonal rainfall pattern, while at the same time providing a refuge somewhere in the system for survival of all other species. Landscape heterogeneity and large spatial extent promoted the region's natural wildlife abundance and species diversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T2  - Forests
AB  - Angola’s forests are abundant and highly productive with enormous potential to support local needs and exportation. The forests are well distributed across the country, but the existing road network is generally poor and, in some cases, inappropriate. Based on our previous work examining deforestation patterns and the modeling of primary tree attributes of vegetation types, we proposed forest management zones (MZ) for future planning in Huambo province in Angola. Herein, that same framework is applied for the detection of the existing road network in Huambo and the proposal of alternative routes inside the MZ. We used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information systems (GIS) to optimize connectivity among the existing forest plantations and their distance to the closest major cities within the province. We developed road suitability maps based on AHP and GIS to ensure safer driving conditions and contribute to the forest planner’s access to the current plantations. According to the suitability map created, 59.51% of the total area is suitable for road development and is counted in classes 4 and 5 in automatic classification. Parameters such as geology, slope, distance from roads to the railway, soil types, elevation, flow accumulation, and aspect were used. We provide a completed assessment of the state of existing roads and evaluate the safety of the observed road sections based on the AHP method. The calculated weights of the factors were all consistent with the model used (consistency ratio was 0.09 < 0.1). Finally, we proposed the best alternative routes to the existing cities, MZ in miombo woodlands, and forest plantations inside the province. Our findings indicated that flow accumulation, soil type, and geology were the most significant factors impacting road construction. Overall, our framework is an important starting point for further research activities towards developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for planning road networks in Angola.

TI  - Natural corridors help nature thrive; [Final Edition]
AU  - Beaudette, Mary Anne
T2  - Kingston Whig - Standard
AB  - Thanks to the diversity of plant and animal life on our doorstep, I no longer view corridors as simply the ragged leftovers of cultivated spaces. It has also made me realize the corridor-like benefits of grouped plantings, even in the most urban of environments. I'm reminded of the line of closely planted cedars that divided the tiny, treeless, suburban backyard of our first house from that of our neighbours. That line of cedars functioned as a miniature corridor of sorts, attracting a variety of birds in summer and winter. It makes me view hedging, grouped shrubbery and the overgrowth of greenery that borders many city backyards with a more appreciative eye. The wildlings of the neighbourhood would probably agree.At this point the vegetation thickened to include five fully grown eastern red cedars, more Manitoba maples, a couple of lovely little saplings , another Chinese elm, and thickets of wild dogwood and other unidentified berry-bearing shrubs. The thicket petered out to some scrubby saplings, a couple of cedars and thick patches of brambles at the southernmost edge of our property. This tangly band of growth extends past our home for nearly a kilometre, ending at the St. Lawrence River.

AB  - Three Sisters Mountain Village has officially submitted its amendment to the Resort Core area structure plan (ASP) and its completed ASP for Smith Creek; the company has submitted its wildlife corridor alignment for approval by Alberta Environment and Parks; Stone Creek Resorts are engaging the public in a conversation about adding gaming and a gondola to its already approved ASP; Stoney Nakoda First Nation has signalled they are interested in partnering with a developer to continue work on the Horseshoe Lands, formerly the Seebee townsite, and the MD of Bighorn has an approved ASP for lands in Dead Man's Flats that has been disputed due to its high ecological value. Two of the most significant development processes occurring simultaneously are the application for the Smith Creek wildlife corridor being considered by the provincial government, which is the legislative body with the authority to designate wildlife corridors on private lands, and the two ASPs submitted to the Town of Canmore's planning department. The key issue with slope, and animal tracking data points to the conclusion, is that most wildlife tend to prefer to travel on terrain that is less than 25 degrees.

AU  - Grant, Carolyn
T2  - Daily Townsman
AB  - In 1998, the Ministry of the Environment, Lands and Parks, in conjunction with the BC Assets and Lands Corporation, conducted a land trade with Cominco to acquire an important wildlife corridor for mule deer and elk and to protect endangered grassland species. The lands purchased by TLC surround this corridor, increasing the protected area from 660 acres to 2659 acres. TLC's long-term vision for the area is to maintain biodiversity and ensure sustainable use of the area through a diversity of interests including ranching, recreation, and wildlife viewing.Grasslands are considered one of the most endangered ecosystems in Canada, and are home to nearly one-third of endangered species. B.C.'s grasslands are home to 55 critical wildlife species, including the badger, long billed curlew, Lewis' woodpecker, and bobolink (CDC - Cranbrook region red-blue listed spp). The protection of grassland is of international, national and regional significance. Less than two percent of grassland areas are protected in Canada.

AB  - Alterations to the functions and connectivity of mangrove–seagrass–patch reef (MSP) seascapes have the potential to impact the survival, foraging activities, and movement of reef-dependent invertebrates (e.g., crabs and shrimp) and fishes. In the current study, we examined carbon flow in the Guánica Biosphere Reserve in southwestern Puerto Rico using pigment analysis of particulate organic matter and stable isotope analysis of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in flora and fauna. Several lines of evidence pointed to N2 fixers (cyanobacteria) being important for fueling primary productivity in this oligotrophic ecosystem including low (<0.7 µg L−1) chlorophyll, prevalence of cyanobacteria based on pigment signatures, and the isotope signatures of seagrass and red mangrove leaf tissue (enriched δ15N values) and consumers (depleted δ15N values). Food web mixing models based on stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) revealed that multiple producers (phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, seagrasses, etc.) contributed organic matter to the consumers (zooplankton, invertebrates, and fishes) in the MSP seascape at the center of the reserve. Contribution estimates for common benthic invertebrates (crabs and shrimp) were taxon-specific, and the highest input was generally linked to particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae (BMA)/seagrass producer categories, although meaningful mangrove contribution was observed for some taxa. Similarly, contribution estimates for fishes were highest for POM and BMA/seagrass, with the latter producer category being more important for species known to migrate from mangroves or patch reefs to seagrass beds at night (bluestriped grunt, French grunt, and white grunt). Although all fish investigated were observed in mangrove prop-root habitats, input of organic matter from mangroves to these consumers was typically limited for most of the species examined. Understanding these complex seascapes contributes to our understanding of the ecology of these vital ecosystems.

TI  - Configuración De La Nueva Área Metropolitana De Quito: Usos Del Suelo y Escenarios Futuros Para La Planificación
AU  - Proaño, Esthela Elizabeth Salazar
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Las áreas metropolitanas han experimentado un crecimiento exponencial en las últimas décadas, especialmente en los sectores periurbanos. La literatura ha descrito este proceso de "expansión urbana" como un fenómeno que está cambiando el paisaje por el incremento en el consumo del suelo, que a su vez ha originado un proceso de conurbación con los territorios y centros poblados aledaños, a modo de un crecimiento desbordado que ha llegado a sobrepasar los límites político-administrativos.Esta investigación, que se encuentra dentro del marco del proyecto Fondecyt- ANID/Chile Nº 1180268 y la beca Senescyt-Ecuador, para estudios de Doctorado convocatoria 2015, toma como caso de estudio Quito y su área de expansión urbana, bajo la visión de dos componentes: lo urbano y sus dinámicas funcionales y la modelación de su crecimiento. Plantea una nueva configuración metropolitana: la movilidad entre asentamientos humanos localizados en diferentes circunscripciones territoriales que, a su vez, permiten la configuración de corredores urbanos y la integración del territorio.También analiza los cambios de uso del suelo que se han producido en Quito y su área metropolitana en un período de 19 años, producto del crecimiento urbano, para lo cual utiliza herramientas y aplicaciones tecnológicas como los sistemas de información geográfica SIG, percepción remota y modelación. Además, y como componente principal, se determinan las fuerzas motrices impulsoras del crecimiento urbano, las demandas, restricciones y como principal entrada la consulta a los stakeholders, todo esto mediante el uso del modelo Dyna-CLUE para la creación de escenarios futuros al 2050. Estos escenarios de simulación urbana consideran una visión holística de las dinámicas de cambio de uso de suelo junto con las políticas de planificación; este caso de estudio anticipa cómo la expansión urbana consumirá áreas agrícolas y naturales, en un claro proceso de deterioro que en su mayoría es irreversible.El nuevo enfoque propuesto en esta investigación, permite plantear recomendaciones que ayuden en la planificación de las ciudades y reorienten las políticas públicas para lograr ciudades más inclusivas, sustentables y resilientes.

TI  - Floodplain connectivity and river corridor complexity: Implications for river restoration and planning for floodplain management
AU  - Tompkins, Mark Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - River channels and floodplains are inextricably linked elements of river ecosystems, and hydrologic connections between the two affect geomorphic, ecological, and flood management conditions in river corridors. Many river channels and floodplains have been disconnected, making floodplain ecosystems among the most endangered in the world. Recently, river managers have begun to reconnect floodplains to restore degraded waterways. However, there is still considerable uncertainty associated with planning and design of floodplain reconnection. To begin to address this uncertainty, I evaluated relationships between floodplain connectivity and river corridor complexity at different scales (i.e., river reach to bedform) and in different settings (i.e., agricultural to urban). I measured changes in river corridor complexity after floodplain disconnection along lower Deer Creek, a tributary to the Sacramento River draining 229 mi2 in Tehama County, California. Using recent and historical aerial photography, I measured decreases in riffle habitat (up to 84%), pool habitat (up to 100%), cumulative channel length (up to 72%), shaded riverine aquatic habitat (up to 81%) and riparian vegetation (up to 94%), and increases in riffle spacing (up to 1162%), pool spacing (up to 178%), and low flow channel width (up to 84%) between 1938 and 1999. These results suggest that significant and persistent reductions in river corridor complexity can be associated with floodplain disconnection, and provide an estimate of restoration potential for floodplain reconnection on lower Deer Creek. Next, to link changes in complexity to river water temperature dynamics, I measured effects of hyporheic exchange on daily water temperature fluctuations in lower Deer Creek at sites of varying channel complexity. Comparing hourly temperature of upwelling hyporheic water with downwelling water, I observed up to 7.19°C reduction in amplitude of daily temperature fluctuation, up to 3.5°C reduction in daily peak temperature, and lag times between downwelling and upwelling peaks of up to 19 hours. Differences in downwelling and upwelling water temperature characteristics were strongly correlated with elevation difference between downwelling and upwelling sites (R2 = 0.61, 0.53, and 0.69; p < 0.008, 0.016, and 0.003 for amplitude reduction, peak reduction, and lag time, respectively), suggesting that channel simplification related to floodplain disconnection can affect processes occurring at the bar-unit scale. I also assessed changes in river corridor complexity associated with small-scale floodplain reconnection through post project appraisals (PPAs) of five compound channel projects in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. In most cases, these projects resulted in improved geomorphic and ecological conditions, with width and elevation of created floodplain surfaces (relative to low flow dimensions) apparently the most significant influence on project success. This research builds on previous studies of channel change to develop a new method to measure changes in river corridor complexity associated with floodplain disconnection. In addition, this research adds to recent studies of hyporheic exchange by placing it in the context of river corridor simplification. This research also provides a systematic assessment of post-project performance of compound channels, an increasingly applied but little studied approach to multi-objective flood management based on floodplain reconnection. Finally, this research proposes a new framework to more effectively put ecosystem restoration on equal footing with flood protection in planning processes for floodplain management.

AU  - Desu, Mohitha
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Coastal areas are contested zones; they are attractive for real estate development, they are exposed to the risk of rising waters, and are critical habitats for many avian, aquatic and land-based species. Loss of these wetlands through sea level rise could pose a threat to coastal economies and water quality. Re-naturalizing a river’s beds and banks and then replacing them with vegetation results in restoring biodiversity, which in turn helps in mitigating floods.Land-Water Interstices argues that a coastal community is resilient only if neighborhoods, buildings and infrastructure can withstand and recover from potential flooding, rising water and other climate occurrences. The research adopts a multidimensional approach to solving the challenge of coastal resilience by combining principles of urban design, landscape and sustainable design, flood mitigation, climate adoption and placemaking.By re-naturalizing Buttermilk Channel and designing a wetland system that connects Red Hook and Governor’s Island, the project addresses the issue of flooding, rising sea waters and climate change. This system forms multiple islands (emerging and proposed) that can serve not only as a ‘sponge basin’, but also as a soft defense edge and can accommodate new ferry connections. These islands can be catalysts oriented towards connectivity and resiliency in the urban realm.

TI  - Amphibian Communities Within a Coffee-Forest Matrix Outside the Protected Buffer of Celaque National Park, Honduras
AU  - Krygeris, Catherine
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The coffee agricultural industry is one of the largest worldwide and is growing in Honduras. Coffee plantations are putting pressure on forested lands and are one reason for the rise of deforestation in the tropics. Outside the protected border of Celaque National Park, Honduras, an increase in deforestation has been documented due to coffee agriculture creating a mixed matrix of coffee agriculture and forest fragments. Amphibian populations respond differently to land use change and the associated physical changes in the environment that comes with deforestation. In some cases, the edge effects along the coffee-forest matrix act as habitat for amphibian species and are a corridor for migration between forested fragments. In other cases, loss of amphibian diversity and species richness occurs. This study found the latter to be true, where both coffee and forest fragments demonstrated low levels of amphibian richness and diversity. While additional research and replication should be done to further study this system, initial analysis show that canopy cover, vegetation density, and microhabitat complexity may be important factors supporting more diverse amphibian communities and species sensitive to human disturbance. With coffee agriculture on the rise in the tropics, exploring these systems and the impacts on amphibian communities will be a necessary field of study for conservation biology.

AB  - Seasonally inspired food, with more than 130 recipes from the chef, farmer, and star of The Biggest Little Farm. More than ten years ago, chef Molly Chester and her filmmaker husband left their urban L.A. life to purchase a neglected piece of land northwest of the city in the hopes of creating a more delicious and purposeful life. With a passion for regenerative, biodynamic farming, but a big learning curve to overcome, they threw themselves into the daunting task of revitalizing the land, which had been decimated by drought and pesticides. Today, they steward 234 thriving acres of gardens, animal pastures, habitat corridors, and orchards, including their abundant "Fruit Basket"--a lush tapestry of landscape that provides seventy-five different varieties of fruit trees. Chester and her husband's gentle, slow, and unconventional approach has inspired other farmers, and was the subject of the 2019 award-winning documentary The Biggest Little Farm.   This debut cookbook brings the bounty of the farm to readers' kitchens. As a chef who has long understood that flavor and healthy food go hand in hand, Chester is passionate about farm-fresh ingredients, and her cooking celebrates the tree-ripened fruits, seasonal vegetables, pastured eggs, and grass-fed meats for which the farm is known. With sections divided by season, and insider tips for sourcing the best produce, this a must-have cookbook for home cooks looking for inspiration for their farmers' market hauls, and anyone looking to create a closer connection to their food. With enticing, preserved end-of-summer larder treasures like Tomato Raisins or a Dried Summer Stone Fruit Medley, comforting dinners like Slow-Roasted Pastured Chicken with Lemon-Fennel Crust or Spring Frittata with Fresh Peas, Arugula, Artichokes, Chevre, and Pesto, and bright, luscious salads like Avocado and Cara Cara Orange Salad with Jalapeño and Sesame-Miso Dressing, these nourishing recipes are a delicious guide to eating in connection with the land.

TI  - Researches on ecologic restoration of the damaged area of fenghuang mountain in wuhan east-lake high-tech zone
AU  - Zhang, Shu Chang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorLocated in the south of Wuhan East-Lake High-tech Zone, Fenghuang Mountain is an important component of the ecology corridor of South-east Wuhan. After more than forty years of building stone mining, the mountain's physiognomy has been severely damaged and formed near 300000 m2 broken slope. In this area, the origin vegetation is almost totally destroyed with only a few masson-pine survived, resulting in bare mountain massif, severe water and soil erosion, ecology system degradation, and severely affected urban environment of Wuhan. To restore the ecology system of the damaged mountain is an important ecological construction project. Guided with ecology theories, this paper analyzed and concluded the landscape restoration mode and technology of the damaged mountain, expounded the necessity of the ecology restoration project of the Fenghuang Mountain, explained the restoration plan, elaborated the restoration technology, investigated the effects of different restoration measures, discussed the key technology and put forward some countermeasures and suggestions. In the restoration plan, this paper analyzed the cause of formation and the characteristics of the mountain damage, investigate the ecological state, put forward the restoration object, discussed the restoration plan principle, concluded the plan idea and object, put forward the design concept, drew up the plant selection and design plan. The ecological restoration of the Fenghuang Mountain included geologic repairing and vegetation restoration. The geologic repairing included topography preparation, retaining wall construction, drain preparation. In vegetation restoration, the technology used included landscape plants transplanting, seed spraying sow with three-dimension net, seed spraying sow with steel net, seed spraying sow with replaced soil, finished vegetation blanket transplanting. Applying the above technology, vegetation restoration was finished from 10 to 90 degree of slope grade in the nearly 300000 m2 broken slope. Near one year's observation after the restoration works was conducted to research the growth states of the plants, the plant species diversity, the plant community diversity and the plant landscape, base on which the restoration effect was analyzed and valuated. Results showed that the vegetation was in good growth state, and good ecologic, social and economic effects were obtained. The research results had important value in Wuhan's "Friendly Environment Society" construction, and provided certain helpful references for comprehensive repairing and restoration of damaged mountain in Wuhan and other

AB  - IntroductionBrown planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens) are the most serious insect pests of rice, one of the world's most important staple crops. They reproduce year‐round in the tropical parts of their distribution, but cannot overwinter in the temperate areas where they occur, and invade seasonally from elsewhere. Decades of research have not revealed their source unambiguously.Methods and ResultsWe sequenced the genomes of brown planthopper populations from across temperate and tropical parts of their distribution and show that the Indochinese peninsula is the major source of migration into temperate China. The Philippines, once considered a key source, is not significant, with little evidence for their migration into China. We find support for immigration from the west of China contributing to these regional dynamics.DiscussionThe lack of connectivity between the Philippine population and the mainland Chinese populations explains the different evolution of Imidacloprid resistance in these populations. This study highlights the promise of whole‐genome sequence data to understand migration when gene flow is high—a situation that has been difficult to resolve using traditional genetic markers.

AB  - This asphalt-covered expanse is more than a parking lot. It is the centrepiece of a mostly unspoiled waterfront. Let's recognize and keep the things that are special about Kamloops.The hotel boosters are in danger of not seeing the park for the parking lot. Importantly, the lot provides for open space and uninterrupted views. It could become a much-admired link between the two parks. When community events are on, such as Canada Day celebrations, the space provides a corridor for the mass movement of people. Consider that by giving up just one row of parking there could be a broader pathway, a screen of trees and hopefully an alternative to the flood prone, dingy walkway under the bridge.

AB  - Endemic species face a variety of threats including predation from non‐native invaders. In some cases, however, invasive species can be managed by directly suppressing populations, and tracking technologies that allow researchers to identify movement patterns and aggregations representative of the population can facilitate suppression activities. In Yellowstone Lake (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming), invasive lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have been the target of a population suppression program for over two decades. For this form of management, the reproductive period is particularly important because fish migrate to and from spawning grounds. From 2011 to 2014, adult lake trout (n = 317) in Yellowstone Lake were tracked using acoustic biotelemetry. After controlling for spatial and temporal dependency in the data, total abundance of unique individuals was estimated where migratory trajectories occurred at confirmed spawning sites. Aggregations and migratory trajectories were further estimated at locations where spawning had not previously been observed. Across years, the greatest number of individuals was observed along a migration corridor in the southwestern area of the lake. Novel strategies for analyzing acoustic telemetry data provided insights into the behavior of an invasive fish species. By betraying the positions of conspecifics, tagged fish revealed potentially important reproductive habitats and migration corridors that warranted further investigation as possible sites for population suppression.

AB  - The distribution range of Jaguar (Panthera onca) is being reduced due to multi-scale habitat conversion, intensive hunting, illegal trafficking, habitat fragmentation, and the construction of highways and other infrastructure. Because of the decrease in population, this species’ listing has changed from vulnerable to a threatened category. Due to the ecological importance of this species, organizations like Red Colombiana de Seguimiento de Fauna Atropellada have proposed the establishment of wildlife corridors. But little is known as to recognize the driving forces in these habitat changes and where these corridors should be established. To address this lack of information, we determined the spatial extent to which the current distribution and access to P. onca habitat is being driven by deforestation, armed conflict, agriculture expansion, urbanization and the construction of highways in the Bajo Magdalena area of Colombia. We then identified potential areas for proposing conservation corridors. To do this, we used available geospatial information on P. onca distribution in the Corporación Autónoma Regional areas in the municipalities of Puerto Salgar, Caparrapí and Guaduas, as well as transportation network, administrative unit, and deforestation data from 2010 to 2018. We also calculated habitat distances to population centers and the distribution of P. onca relative to roads. Our findings suggest that urban population and highways affect 83 % of the total area of its distribution; deforestation increased by 47.9 km2 in the 105.24 km2 study area with 5.6 km2 alone left as P. onca habitat. We concluded that conservation initiatives must be implemented inside P. onca’s distributional range and buffer zones. Urbanization and the construction of highways were highly influential variables associated with the loss of P. onca habitat. Further, we propose that precautions along the principal road that connects Puerto Salgar and Guaduas should be taken into consideration to maintain the genetic flow and movement of the P. onca population as it affects 87 km of this proposed corridor.

AU  - Kumar, Ashok
T2  - Journal of Applied and Natural Science
AB  - The city Jhansi is famous for the fort, gardens and surrounding hilly areas. These gardens and hilly areas have supported for butterflies and other insects. The butterflies are essential part of any natural ecosystem as their adults performs pollination. They are highly mobile organism and are able to maintain connectivity between the fragmental habitats. The larval stages are herbivorous and cause economic damage but adult are beneficial as pollinators of several trees and herbaceous flora. They are vulnerable to changes in flower supply resulting from deforestation and environmental pollution hence they are the biological indicators of pollution. The present study was conducted regarding the different selected sites visited by butterflies, their foraging activity and abundance at different sites of Jhansi. During the visit some species of butterflies were collected as flower visitors on different species of flowering plants (garden, cultivated, semi wild and wild) in selected areas. The species of collected butterflies were showed the most common and highly active species throughout the day. Some species namely Pieris canidia indica, lxias mrianne (Cramer), Catopsilia crocale (Cramer), Catopsilia pyranthe (Linn.), Eurema hecabe fimbriata (Wallace) Colias electo fieldi and Colias erate (Esper) were observed mostly on the flowering plants of each site during the study. The nymphalids were found to be very common in the plane areas of Jhansi as flower visitors and only one species Papilio demoleus could be collected from only two sites.

AB  - Many direct and indirect methods, processes, and sensors available on the market today are used to monitor the occupancy of selected Intelligent Building (IB) premises and the living activities of IB residents. By recognizing the occupancy of individual spaces in IB, IB can be optimally automated in conjunction with energy savings. This article proposes a novel method of indirect occupancy monitoring using CO2, temperature, and relative humidity measured by means of standard operating measurements using the KNX (Konnex (standard EN 50090, ISO/IEC 14543)) technology to monitor laboratory room occupancy in an intelligent building within the Internet of Things (IoT). The article further describes the design and creation of a Software (SW) tool for ensuring connectivity of the KNX technology and the IoT IBM Watson platform in real-time for storing and visualization of the values measured using a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol and data storage into a CouchDB type database. As part of the proposed occupancy determination method, the prediction of the course of CO2 concentration from the measured temperature and relative humidity values were performed using mathematical methods of Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Tree (using IBM SPSS Modeler) with an accuracy higher than 90%. To increase the accuracy of the prediction, the application of suppression of additive noise from the CO2 signal predicted by CO2 using the Least mean squares (LMS) algorithm in adaptive filtering (AF) method was used within the newly designed method. In selected experiments, the prediction accuracy with LMS adaptive filtration was better than 95%.

TI  - Multiple Controls of Carbon and Nitrogen Processes in Freshwater Wetlands of the Mid-Atlantic United States with Implications for Ecosystem Restoration and Disturbance
AU  - Korol, Alicia
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon supports the structure and functioning of all ecosystems and provides valued products and services essential to human well-being. Understanding the controls on these cycles and their interactions with ecological components at multiple scales predicts spatial patterns and response to environmental disturbance, guides management of these resources, and informs environmental policy. This dissertation synthesizes research conducted in three different freshwater wetlands to demonstrate interacting drivers of carbon and nitrogen processes that are important for understanding how ecosystems will respond to large anthropogenic modification. The first two studies in freshwater mesocosms involved tests of the effects of macrophyte planting diversity on biomass production and on three nitrogen cycle processes. Empirical evidence and theory link plant diversity to greater ecosystem functioning. Thirty-four mesocosms were planted with four functionally-distinct macrophyte species across a richness gradient (1, 2, 3, or 4 species). The elevated aboveground biomass of communities in the most species-rich mixtures at the end of the first growing season was temporary, and monocultures of a single species on average produced greater aboveground biomass compared to the most species-rich mixtures by the end of the second growing season. The suppression of biomass production in the two perennials was attributed to a dominant annual found commonly in palustrine wetlands of northern Virginia and early successional vegetation communities. The second study evaluated whether plant richness, along with biomass and tissue N content, had positive effects on soil N processing—ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification—at the end of the second growing season. Greater species richness was related to greater net ammonification potential, but lower net nitrification potential and denitrification potential. By contrast, lower biomass and/or lower tissue N content, characteristics of the two annuals, had stimulatory effects on all three nitrogen processes. The results of the first two studies inform the design of newly-planted restored wetlands and highlight the tradeoffs between managing for multiple ecosystem functions. This research adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that restored ecosystems may not maximize all ecosystem functions and demonstrates that establishing plant diversity in early-successional wetland plant communities may come at the expense of plant productivity and soil biogeochemical development. At the same time, the identification of mechanisms that inhibit these wetland functions suggests restoration designs for alleviating that inhibition ( e.g., spatial or temporal heterogeneity in hydrologic conditions) to best promote multiple functions in restored wetlands. The third and fourth studies were investigations of the controls of denitrification in floodplains of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Largescale characteristics of floodplains, including hydrogeomorphic or landscape features ( i.e., climate, physiography, or ecosystem patterns), are of practical use for the prediction of denitrification due to emerging largescale datasets and because these characteristics may aggregate the effects of local vegetation or soil biogeochemical characteristics on denitrification. Results from the investigation of 18 nontidal floodplains indicated that the highest rates of denitrification are likely to be found in agricultural and urban watersheds with stream-floodplain hydrologic connectivity promoting sedimentation. All largescale predictors, including seasonal air temperature and channel width-to-depth ratio, explained between 43–57% of variation in the denitrification measurements and should be useful for prediction across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In a study of TFFWs in Virginia, potential for denitrification and nitrate-limitation of denitrification were studied along two adjacent rivers that differed notably in concentrations and loads of nitrogen (Pamunkey River carries more nitrogen than the Mattaponi River). Patterns of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in TFFWs were found along a longitudinal gradient but not between rivers. DEA was greater in all tidal wetlands (three sites on each river) than nontidal forested wetlands (one site on each river). Further, DEA was positively related to soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen, and negatively related to bulk density in tidal hummocks, relationships which were all mediated by a longitudinal gradient with highest DEA rates at the lower tidal sites. Modification to hydrogeomorphic processes from accelerated sea level rise may alter these longitudinal gradients in TFFWs. The results of the third and fourth studies inform currently poor understanding of denitrification patterns in floodplains at landscape and regional scales. The studies both demonstrate the existence of largescale predictable patterns in denitrification that have only rarely been demonstrated in the literature. The identification of these patterns alleviate uncertainty in the process given its highly variable nature, which has stymied attempts to confidently extrapolate denitrification rates from one floodplain to another. As such, the research findings on hotspots of the process guides the prioritization of nontidal floodplains for the purposes of restoration as well as predicts how nitrogen removal capabilities of TFFWs will change given quickening sea level rise.

Human traffic would have to be limited. Education programs would be offered so that people, especially children, could learn about conservation.The area is pretty cool because of its unique features. You don't normally find such a large block of land undeveloped this close to the city. The array of wildlife found on the site is diverse. Moose, elk and deer frequent the area. Cougars and bears have been sighted. It also has the highest concentration of red-tailed hawks found in North America.The Cross Conservation Area is a wildlife corridor as it provides the cover and terrain wildlife prefer to use when moving. The increase in acreages and subdivisions means more of the land is being broken up and wildlife is forced to travel through open areas. The U of C's study suggests that increasing the network of wild areas would assist with wildlife movement.

TI  - How multi-lane, one-way street design shapes neighbourhood life: collisions, crime and community
AU  - Riggs, William
AU  - Gilderbloom, John I "Hans"
T2  - Local Environment
AB  - Global recognition of the need for more liveable and "complete" streets has allowed for increased funding to bicycle and pedestrian projects. That said, many streets in urban neighbourhoods remain unsafe. This study hypothesises that some of these issues related to safety issues are tied to multi-lane, one-way streets, which exist primarily in urban business districts and historic neighbourhoods, often occupied by poor and minority residents. There has been little research in this area to test how one-way street configurations relate to collisions, crime and community. To examine this, we use three principal strategies: (1) a cross-sectional citywide evaluation using descriptive and inferential statistics on all collisions occurring within a five-year period in a mid-sized city; (2) a focused assessment of traffic collision data, crime data, counts of trees, housing valuation data, foreclosure and vacant and abandoned structures on a 13-block street segment with both one- and two-way streets and (3) a qualitative broken windows assessment, using photography to evaluate signs of visual distress on one-way versus two-way segments. Our results show a higher incidence of collisions and injuries on multi-lane streets than on their two-way counterparts - for motorists, bikes and pedestrians. Our photographic assessment suggests that these street typologies contribute to degradation and erosion of community. Our results show that neighbourhoods with one-way multi-lane streets experience greater abandonment, lower housing values and slower increases in property values. This research supports expanded thinking about one- to two-way street conversion as a method to improve safety, connectivity, community and sustainability.

TI  - Armazón Hidroecológico de Hualpén: Conservación de las Funciones Hídricas de la Cuenca del Humedal de Lenga en un Contexto de Expansión Urbana Sobre el Delta del Río Bío-Bío
AU  - Stagno, Gianluca Baghetti
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - El área metropolitana del Gran Concepción se emplaza sobre las planicies sedimentarias que conforman el delta del río Bío-Bío, de altísima riqueza en términos de materia orgánica del suelo. Este factor converge con la intrusión marina y los constantes flujos hídricos subterráneos provenientes del río para sustentar los ecosistemas conocidos como humedales, hoy amenazados por el crecimiento urbano. Ellos, que funcionan como una sola gran red hídrica, heredera de los vestigiales cauces pasados del Bío-Bío, se encuentran en distintas condiciones de degradación, dependiendo principalmente de su cercanía a la ciudad. El segundo más grande de ellos, el humedal del estuario de Lenga se encuentra dentro del Santuario de la Naturaleza Península de Hualpén, a 3 kilómetros de la ciudad homónima. Esto tiende a generar una falsa sensación de seguridad en lo que a sus condiciones se refiere, pues si bien efectivamente se encuentra alejado de la acción directa de la urbe, está bajo una enorme presión ecológica desde un punto de vista hidrológico.El humedal de Lenga depende de la suma de las aguas lluvias al infiltrarse y de los drenajes provenientes del río. Esto implica que si bien existe una superficie precisa de humedal -la laguna-, su superficie funcional se extiende, por los procesos y sistemas ecológicos que lo sustentan, a toda el área dentro su cuenca recolectora. Es ahí donde se evidencian las principales problemáticas: la ciudad de Hualpén ha crecido sobre la superficie de la cuenca, ocupando el 14% de ella. Esto afecta tanto a la recarga aportada por las aguas lluvias al impermeabilizar los suelos y deteniendo la infiltración, como a los drenajes que vienen del río al interrumpir los flujos que corren por los paleocanales producto de la compactación de los suelos, lo que amenaza seriamente al humedal y que habría llevado a su desaparición temporal durante los primeros meses de 2021 (figura 1), lo que se suma a la amenaza que representa su cercanía a industrias contaminantes.La presente tesis y proyecto de arquitectura del paisaje apunta a establecer una nueva manera de urbanizar aquellas planicies amenazadas dentro de la cuenca recolectora del humedal en el sector conocido como Peñuelas, de forma sensible y coherente con los sistemas hidroecológicos mencionados anteriormente, considerando que las probabilidades de que la ciudad crezca hacia el sector son muy altas.Así, se propone la creación de un armazón hidroecológico, una red de corredores de infiltración cuyo trazado se origina en la lectura de las capas que configuran las trazas del agua y los procesos geológiccos que le dieron origen, que asegure en el futuro tanto la infiltración de las aguas como los flujos superficiales y subterráneos que corren por esta superficie intermedia entre el humedal de Lenga y el río Bío-Bío.El proyecto contempla finalmente un parque urbano que cumpla las funciones de activar y articular esta nueva zona urbana y costera, proteger un sistema lineal de humedales de menor escala y la vegetación asociada, así como acercar a la población de Hualpén a estos ecosistemas, otorgándole importantes beneficios y cumpliendo un rol de visibilización, educación y configuración de un imaginario clave para su sustento en el tiempo. De cierta forma, ambas maneras de proyectar, tanto a nivel de plan maestro como de parque urbano, lo hacen a partir de un diseño del vacío, permitiendo una apertura al cambio programático a través del tiempo y por lo tanto asegurando una sustentabilidad ecológica, económica y social.

TI  - Systematics, population structure and demography of the African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus spp.): A perspective from multiple scales
AU  - Eaton, Mitchell Joseph
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wildlife harvest is the most geographically widespread form of resource extraction in equatorial forests. The illegal trade in wildlife is worth billions of dollars annually, with some estimates placing it second only to the global trafficking in illicit drugs. In competition with the commercial harvest, many rural inhabitants of tropical forests subsist on wildlife as a protein and economic resource. Lack of understanding of the biology of the system and the inability to implement management controls are cited as the two main impediments to sustainable-use practices in the tropics. To achieve long-term sustainability of wildlife resources, we seek an integrated understanding of the dynamics regulating resource populations and the dynamics of extractive activities influencing the fate of population trajectories. To pursue these goals, my research focuses on a poorly known reptile in tropical Africa that is widely consumed in rural diets but threatened by commercial hunting. African dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus spp.) remain an important subsistence food resource throughout Central and West Africa, but are now threatened by overharvesting. The ability to address harvest issues and conservation priorities for crocodile populations is limited by a lack of knowledge of their biology, ecology and evolutionary history. My research approaches this problem from multiple perspectives. I first seek to resolve an 80-year-old debate on the taxonomy of the dwarf crocodile across its range, which has impeded our understanding of evolutionary significant units (ESUs) and the magnitude of the threats facing regional populations. Novel methods for monitoring the trade in crocodiles and other bushmeat species are needed to understand the magnitude of wildlife use in the tropics. I employed a molecular method to identify commonly hunted African wildlife species. I then attempt to gain inference on population genetic structure, connectivity and landscape factors influencing individual movements at the local and regional scales. At the population level, I used field surveys and capture-recapture methods to estimate demographic parameters and model population growth, incorporating empirical estimates of harvest rates and size-selection bias to evaluate their impact on long-term viability. I offer recommendations for new conservation management units, new techniques for monitoring the bushmeat trade and suggestions for spatial harvest management.

TI  - The Relative Timing of Human Migration and Land-Cover and Land-Use Change: An Evaluation of Northern Taiwan from 1990 to 2015
AU  - Shih, Hsiao-chien
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban land expansion can be driven by and drive population growth, but determining cause-effect relationships of urban land expansion and population growth is challenging due to the temporal resolution of decadal censuses for most countries. The relative timing of urban land expansion and population change was explored based on a case study for north Taiwan from 1990 to 2015. Data on urban land expansion were derived from a dense time series of Landsat satellite imagery, and population change from annual population registers at the district level.A novel algorithm for identifying the starting time of urban expansion was developed and tested based on dense time series of Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) proportion maps derived from Landsat surface reflectance imagery. The time of urbanization estimated by logistic regression was determined from the Impervious cover time series. The identified location and estimated time for newly urbanized lands were generally accurate, with 80% of urban expansion estimated within ± 2.4 years.The random forest (RF) classification routine was applied to Landsat image inputs for detailed urban land-use classification. Input features were extracted from a 2015 Landsat image dataset, and the top 10 most contributing features for RF classifiers were the six spectral wavebands, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) homogeneity of V-I-S, and Vegetation temporal variation. The Landsat image was tested with different input features, and the land-use maps derived from the top 10 features yielded the most accurate map. Areal extents of annual urban land uses (Residential, Employment, and Transportation corridor categories) were derived by applying a conditional statement based on the urbanization date of the urban expansion map and overlaying on the 2015 land-use map. The relative timing and general relationship between urban land-use and population dynamics was explored at the district level. Linear regression was run to understand the general relationship between population and land use. The relative timing between population growth and land-use change was estimated with lagged correlation. Residential land use and change was most related to population and change. Population growth occurred 2.5 years later than Residential land expansion based on the median time lag.

AU  - He, Yu Xuan
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the rapid development of the national economic society, hydropower construction also gets a rapid development. At the same time, environment problems caused by hydropower construction cannot be underestimated, such as effects to hydrological, effects to aquatic ecosystem, effects of construction, effects of the reservoir storage, effects of the operation, effects of the cascade development, and so on. After years of unremitting efforts, countermeasure research of the environmental impact for hydropower development has made some preliminary achievements. But when it comes to some of the ecologically sensitive zone,we still unable to put forward targeted countermeasures. Based on investigation to the natural ecological environment of the area, this thesis conducts a detailed analysis of environmental issues due to the construction of Angu Hydropower Station. At the same time, a systematic study to environmental protection measures for restoration of ecological functions of wetlands is also conducted. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a reference for the solution of ecological problems that caused by hydropower projects in ecologically sensitive areas across the country. Angu Hydropower Station of Dadu River, with a hybrid development approach, is located in Leshan City, Sichuan Province. This thesis firstly gives an overview to the project, then takes a systematic analysis to the natural conditions, development of the socio-economic, and the ecological environment of the field. The results show that the station located in the area with large population, more developed economies, strong human disturbances and seasonal flooded wetlands. The area is the typical region of artificial interference with strong agricultural wetlands, does not belong to the wetlands of International Importance, and does not belong to the wetlands with state protection. The thesis also takes a systematic analysis on the environmental impact to the areas for the construction of Angu hydropower station. The results show that the biggest impaction happens to the topography, the ecosystems, the structure and function of the wetlands. For example, the reservoir inundation, construction, backfilling create land and land use change in its topography; After the completion of the island station node flow will further shifting alliances, the river hydrological regime of wetlands changes; Project impact wetland vegetation types evolved to drought or water logging type of riparian vegetation; Also of amphibians, reptiles habitat and natural landscape works of certain impact areas, and many other issues. Therefore, combine the Angu hydropower station's construction area requirements of the actual situation and the State Environmental Protection. In this thesis, optimization of engineering plans, build connectivity engineering measures, and implementation of wetland restoration three aspects, give the typical countermeasure for environmental protection of these ecologically sensitive areas. By optimizing the engineering program to reduce the area, to reduce the project impact wetlands directly occupied; Construction connection mechanical control measure, let-down ecological flow rate, to ensure that wetlands and river left bank weeks wetland connectivity and integrity of the system; With the late resettlement project, implementation of wetland restoration engineering, remodeling micro-topography for the downstream floodway, Restore rivers in the region of typical wetland ecosystems and other countermeasures. This article analyzes that, the project environmental protection measures by taking the above greatly reduces the level of the rivers of this construction of the wetland ecosystem. And through artificial restoration measures, can improve species diversity of wetland ecosystems and biomass, thereby enhancing the ecological functions of wetlands. After the settlement of this article referred to in dealing with similar environmental problems in ecologically sensitive areas can learn from the text of the environmental planning and engineering to the method of combining measures, to fellow the new progress of water conservancy: Live in harmony with nature and finally intergrowth with each

AB  - "They should have straight edges, be short as possible and as wide as possible," said wildlife tracker Pat Kamenka, who has worked on wildlife corridors in the valley. "Wildlife work on efficiencies. They move in a straight line."The main obstacle when creating a wildlife corridor is fragmentation, caused by natural features such as cliffs, canyons and mountains, and man-made structures, such as highways, railways, towns and other human infrastructure Percy said. While corridors are often described as highways for wildlife, Percy sees them differently. Animals still stop to feed, sleep and hunt in the corridors, however the amount of time they spend there is much shorter than in habitat patches. Habitat patches must offer security and an abundant food supply to be effective -and be more attractive than downtown Canmore.Percy said wildlife corridors are needed to provide secure movement opportunities for wildlife. As human pressures increase, predators such as wolves and grizzly bears have no choice but to move higher up the valley. While some species such as cougars have adapted to hunting at higher elevations, others are squeezed against steep cliffs and human encroachment.

Temporary barrier fencing has been used along the south side of Cootes Drive. The fence has helped guide turtles returning to their feeding areas in the Cootes Paradise march to two culverts under the road.RBG and turtle supporters have urged the city to reduce the speed limit along Cootes Drive from 80 to 60 km-h; improve the water in the western portion of the Old Desjardin Canal; relocate the Dundas Community Garden behind Olympic Arena where turtles have built nests; conduct a mowing program along Cootes Drive; removing phragmites, an invasive plant that impedes turtle movements; and creating a wildlife corridor committee to examine roadkill locations.RBG and turtle supporters have urged the city to reduce the speed limit along Cootes Drive from 80 to 60 km-h; improve the water in the western portion of the Old Desjardin Canal; relocate the Dundas Community Garden behind Olympic Arena where turtles have built nests; conduct a mowing program along Cootes Drive; removing phragmites, an invasive plant that impedes turtle movements; and creating a wildlife corridor committee to examine roadkill locations.

AU  - Curry, Shannon
T2  - Alternatives Journal
AB  - In the latest step in an ongoing struggle to maintain some ecological integrity in the popular core of Banff National Park, federal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps has blocked a proposal for significant expansion of Banff's town site. Banff town council had proposed a new Community Plan that would have allowed for an additional 80,000 square metres of commercial development -- equivalent to 25 percent of the town's present size. Copps instructed the council to create a new plan that solves housing shortages first. Copps' decision is consistent with a commitment made in October 1996 not to allow any further expansion of commercial development in the park. That commitment was made in response to the findings of the Banff recommendations on future protection and development in the Banff-Bow Valley corridor. The Banff town site on the Bow River is in the valley-bottom montane ecoregion. With a relatively mild climate, abundant vegetation and a great diversity of wildlife, the ecoregion is ecologically priceless but also especially attractive to humans.

AB  - [George O. Malanson]'s book is the more comprehensive and theoretical of the two. The focus is on the value of the ideas and method of landscape ecology in understanding and to a lesser extent, in planning and managing riparian areas. In the spirit of the Cambridge Studies in Ecology Series, Malanson presents a wide - ranging and relatively current review of the application of landscape ecology to riparian areas. In so doing he reviews the history of the development of landscape ecology, links the ideas and methods to riparian topics, structures and processes, and eventually to forest, grassland and other ecoregions, channel dynamics, community structure and patterns, edge effects, soil moisture, flooding and other relevant topics. Considerable space is devoted to disturbance and its effects on landforms, and biological communities. Sections of the book are also devoted to corridors, plant dispersal, landscape reproduction and modeling. Overall, the Malanson book is a good general introduction to riparian landscapes from the perspective of landscape ecology. However, it does not devote much attention to riparian wildlife and to the role of riparian areas and landscape ecology in wildlife conservation. In this sense the book is oriented more to the approaches that geographers usually take than to those of more wildlife or biologically oriented scientists, scholars and professionals.

AB  - The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, has been identified as a reservoir for potentially-zoonotic henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus (LBV) in continental Africa. Longitudinal studies at a large urban colony in Accra, Ghana aim to better understand E. helvum and viral ecology, as well as the nature of human-bat interactions. To assess whether the findings from these studies can be extrapolated across the species’ continental range, more information on the movement ecology of the species and connectivity of populations across its range was required. A multifaceted approach, using techniques from the field of genetics, population ecology, and virology, was used to understand the ways in which the structure and dynamics of fruit bat populations across Africa may affect the viral transmission dynamics within them. Given recent difficulties in using electronic positioning systems on E. helvum to track movement, genetic methods were proposed as the most appropriate way to assess connectivity between populations across such a vast range. Henipavirus and LBV serological analyses were undertaken on samples from 12 populations of E. helvum bats across its continental and offshore-island range. A combination of mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers were used to describe the genetic metapopulation structure of E. helvum and data were obtained in each location on population sizes, demographic structure, reproductive and migratory seasonality, as well as bat-human interactions. Consistent with expectations for a vagile migratory species, a panmictic continental population structure was detected across its continental range, although the extent of this panmixia was greater than previously detected in any other mammal or bird. Antibodies to henipaviruses and LBV were detected in all continental populations. Isolated island populations in the Gulf of Guinea were genetically distinct from each other and the continental population. Given the isolation of these island fruit bats and the lack of connectivity with other populations, it was expected that populations would be too small to allow persistence of any viruses that cause acute, immunising infections. Contrary to expectations, island individuals displayed evidence for exposure to both viruses. E. helvum is known to roost close in proximity to human populations across continental Africa, and these results could therefore have important public health implications. Further longitudinal studies across multiple locations and information on social structure, daily and seasonal movements are needed to make inferences about virus transmission dynamics and zoonotic risks within the complex population structure.

AB  - [George O. Malanson]'s book is the more comprehensive and theoretical of the two. The focus is on the value of the ideas and method of landscape ecology in understanding and to a lesser extent, in planning and managing riparian areas. In the spirit of the Cambridge Studies in Ecology Series, Malanson presents a wide - ranging and relatively current review of the application of landscape ecology to riparian areas. In so doing he reviews the history of the development of landscape ecology, links the ideas and methods to riparian topics, structures and processes, and eventually to forest, grassland and other ecoregions, channel dynamics, community structure and patterns, edge effects, soil moisture, flooding and other relevant topics. Considerable space is devoted to disturbance and its effects on landforms, and biological communities. Sections of the book are also devoted to corridors, plant dispersal, landscape reproduction and modeling. Overall, the Malanson book is a good general introduction to riparian landscapes from the perspective of landscape ecology. However, it does not devote much attention to riparian wildlife and to the role of riparian areas and landscape ecology in wildlife conservation. In this sense the book is oriented more to the approaches that geographers usually take than to those of more wildlife or biologically oriented scientists, scholars and professionals.

TI  - Suburban Wild: Emerald necklace for Oak Bay?
AU  - Julian, Barbara
T2  - Oak Bay News
AB  - Clearly the pressing need for wildlife is sufficient space for foraging, mating, nesting and migrating, even as urban growth and pavement-creep eat up the landscape. To protect habitat, conservationists promote eco-corridors containing continuous tree canopy above, green under-storey below, and space for animals to roam and plants to re-wild.Locally, the species that benefit from linkage of green space and tree canopy include squirrels, otters, mink, raccoons, deer, songbirds, bees and butterflies, but their survival depends on the less obvious need to preserve soil, and soils microbial diversity. According to famed entomologist E.O. Wilson, 6,000 species of bacteria might live in one handful of soil. As David Suzuki points out in The Sacred Balance , soil is the interface between life and air.An emerald necklace of green spaces such as Frederick Law Olmstead laid out for Boston, would be welcome in Oak Bay. Olmsteads nephew John Charles Olmstead designed the leafy Uplands estate, where native deer have returned and want only to safely disappear from view with the famous curve. Many people see an emerald necklace as a way of sustaining both urban wildlife and Oak Bays heritage alike.

AB  - Land-use change is among the most important human impacts on habitat quality and species diversity. In this study, we investigated the effects of land use on river habitat quality and sediment granulometry in a larger tropical river, affected by urbanization and agricultural land use. We selected 15 representative sampling reaches in the Rio das Mortes basin, 12 of them along the main river from its headwater to its mouth, and 3 in major tributaries. A habitat survey was conducted in these reaches in the dry season 2010 and sediment samples were taken for granulometry analyses. Sub-basin land cover of reaches was dominated by natural vegetation (41.6 to 60.2% of total land cover), followed by agricultural land cover (38.4% to 56.9%) and urban land cover (1.4% to 5.6%). Sediments were dominated by poorly to moderately sorted silts to sands, little conducive to diverse biological communities. According to the river habitat survey, all investigated river reaches exhibited moderately to totally disturbed habitat integrity, due to diverse and often co-occurring human impacts, such as riparian deforestation, water abstraction, sand and gravel extraction, and margin erosion. Only one of the investigated sampling reaches exhibited the minimum riparian forest corridor width demanded by the Brazilian Forest Code. Our results indicated that river habitat and sediment quality mainly depended on conditions in the direct vicinity of river reaches. Accordingly, initial cost-effective restoration of aquatic habitats could be achieved by relatively simple channel restoration measures and the protection of the riparian corridor in the investigated tropical river.

AU  - Saravia, Valeria Montjoy
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Ante la potente desigualdad socio-territorial que enfrenta Santiago, la infraestructura vial ha sido incapaz de equiparar el acceso a funciones urbanas esenciales, traduciéndose en autopistas que no solo revelan patrones de inequidad, sino que los acrecientan. El protagonismo del automóvil en el modelo de movilidad es evidente; así lo demuestra la cantidad de planes e inversiones destinados a la construcción de nuevas autopistas. De esta manera, al priorizar siempre el tránsito expedito del transporte privado, el modelo favorece una conectividad metropolitana, pero en detrimento de la calidad urbana de barrios. Por lo tanto, la periferia habitacional, el sector más vulnerable y segregado de la ciudad, debe sufrir las consecuencias de una infraestructura hermética que fragmenta y amenaza sus relaciones barriales.La investigación plantea que la manera de reconvertir barrios, detonar desarrollo urbano y generar equidad en la periferia es mediante una movilidad pública y sustentable capaz de revertir las desigualdades generadas por las autopistas. Para ello, detectando la cantidad de superficie ocupada por Vespucio y las vías a su interior, se abre la posibilidad de implementar una estrategia de movilidad en suelos de primer nivel. Así, la reconversión de suelos centrales surge como una oportunidad no solo de brindar accesibilidad, sino que también de proveer a barrios periféricos de espacio público, vivienda y equipamiento de calidad. La propuesta se aborda desde dos escalas: una estrategia metropolitana y su aplicación en una pieza urbana.

AB  - There are few places in the world in which technology is more reasonably equated with life than in Richardson, Texas, home of the Telecom Corridor - the largest concentration of telecom companies in the US. When telecom crashed, the city trembled. Nortel Networks cut almost half of the 900 people it employed there 2 years ago. Alcatel cut thousands of area jobs, shutting down much of its local research and development operations and moving most of what was left to France. Richardson's mayor and economic development team are visiting high-tech companies all over the US, marketing Richardson as a product and urging firms to come to the Telecom Corridor. Ironically, some of the damage done to the corridor even bolsters the pitch: Commercial real estate is now cheaper and more abundant, and the available talent pool is now much more available. The biggest economic development news for the region by far came in June, when microelectronics juggernaut Texas Instruments, which gave birth to the Telecom Corridor when it moved to Richardson in 1956, announced plans to build a $3 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in the region. After it breaks ground in late 2005, the Texas Instruments plant should create 1000 new jobs and give the city a foothold in the next generation of chip technology-not to mention another cash cow.

AU  - Tikalsky, Bryan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Mountain water resources are essential to those living along the Salt Lake City urban corridor. Water resource planners base their policy on twentieth century climate conditions and streamflow records. Often these records only account for a small amount of the natural variability in streamflow and climate. By utilizing dendrochronology this study seeks to better understand variability of streamflow in the Jordan River Drainage Basin over the last 828 years. A GIS model was used to identify potential sampling sites where tree growth would be sensitive to climate and factors affecting stream run-off. Over eighty samples from ancient limber pine (Pinus flexilis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were obtained to perform the reconstruction. Results indicate significant correlation between tree growth and streamflow. A multiple linear regression model created with tree-ring width as the predictor of October - March American Fork River streamflow explained 51.7% of streamflow variance. Analysis of the reconstruction indicates that present records do not adequately represent potential streamflow variability, and several droughts of greater severity and length occurred before the instrumental period.

AU  - Brown, Dane
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Amphibian populations have been declining worldwide for the last century and the major cause of these declines have been habitat destruction. The Celery Bog was once drained for agricultural purposes but has since been restored to a wetland. Amphibian populations had not previously been studied at the Celery Bog Nature Area. This study provided baseline data on amphibians at the Celery Bog Nature Area for the city of West Lafayette. Amphibian mating calls and search and seize surveys were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to monitor amphibian populations. In 2008 and 2009 water samples were collected and analyzed for nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, and pH. The land use was analyzed using ArcGIS. The study found eight species of amphibians living in the nature area. The pothole wetlands not connected to the Celery Bog had the highest species richness both years. The nitrate/nitrite and phosphate levels were below levels that would impact amphibians. In 2009 the pH levels in the Celery Bog were higher than 8.5 on average which could potential impact amphibian populations. There was a negative correlation between species richness and pH in 2009. There was a positive correlation between the species richness and percentage of natural habitat inside each of the four buffer zones (30m, 60m, 289m, and 1km). The Celery Bog Nature Area provides multiple types of habitat for amphibian populations and safe corridors for amphibians to migrate through.

TI  - Protected Area Networks in an Urbanizing Landscape: Spatial Characteristics and Land Acquisition Strategies
AU  - Fenn, Katherine H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The selection of land parcels for preservation and protection (i.e. the designation of a “Protected Area”) is inherently a human social process engaging a complex suite of economic, political, and environmental factors. Since the 1960s, the U.S. federal government has encouraged local engagement in land conservation through new funding opportunities. Consequently, in some states a diverse collection of agencies, both public and private, have participated in the selection process. The following research examines whether diverse conservation organizations, sometimes acting with coordinated goals and sometimes acting independently, can collectively assemble a Protected Area network which aligns with some basic principles of biological conservation network design. The spatial patterns of one emerging Protected Forest (PF) network in the New Jersey Highlands are used a case study. This PF network consists of all forested habitat within the New Jersey Highlands Protected Areas. The primary finding are 1) although most large forest fragments have more than 80% of their land protected, medium and smaller-size fragments have less protection, 2) land cover change within 250 meters of PF boundaries is highly variable and has both increased and decreased aspects of landscape permeability along those boundaries for forest species, and 3) land acquisition since 2000 has been proactive, relative to the threat of urban development. Because PA networks should represent and sustain regional biodiversity and ecosystem function, these findings have implications for future PA management. The pattern of protection of large habitat remnants in this region is favorable for sustaining existing ecological communities and processes. The increase in landscape permeability along the boundaries of some Protected Forests is also favorable because this facilitates species movements among protected habitat patches. However, because land acquisition has been highly proactive, the greatest amount of protection has occurred in the northern part of the region where urban development pressure is lower. The resulting uneven geographic distribution in this regional conservation network indicates that sustaining ecological forest communities and processes across the southern portion of the New Jersey Highlands may pose a significant future challenge.

T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - We applied a river habitat quality (RHQ) assessment method to the Hai River Basin (HRB); an important economic centre in China; to obtain baseline information for water quality improvement; river rehabilitation; and watershed management. The results of the assessment showed that the river habitat in the HRB is seriously degraded. Specifically; 42.41% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 3.31 × 10^sup 4^ km; were designated poor and bad. Habitat in the plain areas is seriously deteriorated; and nearly 50% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 1.65 × 10^sup 4^ km; had either poor or bad habitats. River habitat degradation was attributable to the limited width of the riparian zone (≤5 m); lower coverage of riparian vegetation (≤40%); artificial land use patterns (public and industrial land); frequent occurrence of farming on the river banks and high volumes of solid waste (nearly 10 m^sup 3^); single flow channels; and rare aquatic plants (≤1 category). At the regional scale; intensive artificial land use types caused by urbanization had a significant impact on the RHQ in the HRB. RHQ was significantly and negatively correlated with farmland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01) and urban land (r = 0.998; p < 0.05); and was significantly and positively correlated with grassland and woodland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01). Intensive artificial land use; created through urbanization processes; has led to a loss of the riparian zone and its native vegetation; and has disrupted the lateral connectivity of the rivers. The degradation of the already essentially black rivers is exacerbated by poor longitudinal connectivity (index of connectivity is 2.08-16.56); caused by reservoirs and sluices. For river habitat rehabilitation to be successful; land use patterns need to be changed and reservoirs and sluices will have to be regulated.

AB  - Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and unpredictable ways and analysis of these changes requires coordinated, long‐term research. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of “populations and communities.” This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling “story” about what their site would look like in 50–100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were group into papers along five themes: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the cascading effects theme and includes stories from the Bonanza Creek (boreal), Kellogg Biological Station (agricultural and freshwater), Palmer (Antarctica), and Harvard Forest (temperate forest) LTER sites. We define cascading effects very broadly to include a wide array of unforeseen chains of events that result from a variety of actions or changes in a system. While climate change is having important direct effects on boreal forests, indirect effects mediated by fire activity—severity, size, and return interval—have large cascading effects over the long term. In northeastern temperate forests, legacies of human management and disturbance affect the composition of current forests, which creates a cascade of effects that interact with the climate‐facilitated invasion of an exotic pest. In Antarctica, declining sea ice creates a cascade of effects including declines in Adèlie and increases in Gentoo penguins, changes in phytoplankton, and consequent changes in zooplankton populations. An invasion of an exotic species of lady beetle is likely to have important future effects on pest control and conservation of native species in agricultural landscapes. New studies of zebra mussels, a well‐studied invader, have established links between climate, the heat tolerance of the mussels, and harmful algal blooms. Collectively, these stories highlight the need for long‐term studies to sort out the complexities of different types of ecological cascades. The diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about trophic interactions as an important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.

TI  - Phylogeography of Southeast Asian flying foxes (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae: Pteropus)
AU  - Tsang, Susan M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Flying foxes (Pteropus) are a genus of Old World fruit bats that are important seed dispersers and pollinators for plants native to the 200,000+ islands in Southeast Asia, yet they are some of the most poorly known bats in the world. They comprise some of the largest known bat species, and are morphologically relatively conserved on the genus level.  Pteropus is the most species-rich genus within Pteropodidae, though the origin for this diversity remains incompletely understood. In Chapter 1, I discuss the importance of Pteropus to the ecosystem and as reservoir hosts. In Chapter 2, a molecular phylogeny is presented with  Pteropus species organized into fewer species groups than recognized from previous research that better reflected the comprehensive dataset. An increase in relative divergence rate was detected within Pteropus  during the Pliocene that led to rapid radiations in three species groups. Additionally, discordant signals from nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggested incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization were present, likely as a result of the young clade age, low genetic variability, and rapid diversification of the genus. In Chapter 3, using the species tree generated in Chapter 2, I tested biogeographic mechanisms and scenarios that resulted in current distributions of Pteropus species using several ancestral area reconstruction methods. Dispersal and founder-event speciation were both important mechanisms through which species expanded into new areas. Wallacea was an integral part of the evolutionary history of Pteropus, and likely the region of origin, a new result uncovered largely a product of the increased taxonomic and geographic sampling. I then used a combination of phylogenetics and population genetics to determine the population connectivity of two commonly studied  Pteropus hosts that are of interest to the disease ecology community,  P. vampyrus (Chapter 4) and P. alecto (Chapter 5). Host metapopulation dynamics are important for predictions of pathogen diversity, aggressiveness, and transmission. Pteropus vampyrus and  P. alecto highlight differences in management strategies needed and pathogen model predictions. Chapter 6 presents a general discussion regarding these findings and future directions for research.

AB  - HUNTSVILLE - Holding on to natural biodiversity has been labelled one of the province's greatest challenges, but some Huntsville residents want to help. Mary McCulley and John Brenciaglia made a presentation to the town's planning committee in February and recommended the creation of a conservation advisory committee to monitor and protect natural heritage areas and the natural corridors that link them. Both McCulley and Brenciaglia had volunteered with the now defunct Unity Plan implementation committee, which worked toward realizing the more than 300 recommendations of the town's economic, cultural and environmental sustainability document. The idea for a conservation advisory committee sprung from the implementation committee.  "We took the Unity Plan goals on the basis of increased species loss worldwide. The goals that we picked were a means to protect against further species loss," said McCulley. "That, hopefully, confers some ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change and other natural stresses."  Climate change and biodiversity loss are already a reality, said McCulley. A report noted that fungus and invasive insects in Muskoka have put beech trees at risk. Many trees have already died, she said.  "It is yet another sign," said McCulley. She had stated previously that the larger the natural areas are, the more biodiverse they are. And diverse ecosystems, along with the plant and animal species in them, keep water clean, air clear and soil fertile. Without diversity, nature loses the ability to repair itself, she said.

Mary McCulley and John Brenciaglia made a presentation to the town's planning committee in February and recommended the creation of a conservation advisory committee to monitor and protect natural heritage areas and the natural corridors that link them. Both McCulley and Brenciaglia had volunteered with the now defunct Unity Plan implementation committee, which worked toward realizing the more than 300 recommendations of the town's economic, cultural and environmental sustainability document. The idea for a conservation advisory committee sprung from the implementation committee.  "We took the Unity Plan goals on the basis of increased species loss worldwide. The goals that we picked were a means to protect against further species loss," said McCulley. "That, hopefully, confers some ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change and other natural stresses."  Climate change and biodiversity loss are already a reality, said McCulley. A report noted that fungus and invasive insects in Muskoka have put beech trees at risk. Many trees have already died, she said.  "It is yet another sign," said McCulley. She had stated previously that the larger the natural areas are, the more biodiverse they are. And diverse ecosystems, along with the plant and animal species in them, keep water clean, air clear and soil fertile. Without diversity, nature loses the ability to repair itself, she said.

TI  - Efforts continue to save endangered turtles in Dundas
T2  - Dundas Star News
AB  - Tys Theysmeyer, head of natural lands at the Royal Botanical Gardens, told members of the planning committee April 4 a 1.2-metre high permanent fence installed on the north side of Cootes Paradise and along the Spencer Creek trail has almost eliminated deer collisions on the road while also providing an incentive for snapping and Blanding's turtles to use a wildlife corridor to cross the road to get to their nesting areas. Temporary barrier fencing has been used along the south side of Cootes Drive. The fence has helped guide turtles returning to their feeding areas in the Cootes Paradise march to two culverts under the road.RBG and turtle supporters have urged the city to reduce the speed limit along Cootes Drive from 80 to 60 km-h; improve the water in the western portion of the Old Desjardin Canal; relocate the Dundas Community Garden behind Olympic Arena where turtles have built nests; conduct a mowing program along Cootes Drive; removing phragmites, an invasive plant that impedes turtle movements; and creating a wildlife corridor committee to examine roadkill locations.RBG and turtle supporters have urged the city to reduce the speed limit along Cootes Drive from 80 to 60 km-h; improve the water in the western portion of the Old Desjardin Canal; relocate the Dundas Community Garden behind Olympic Arena where turtles have built nests; conduct a mowing program along Cootes Drive; removing phragmites, an invasive plant that impedes turtle movements; and creating a wildlife corridor committee to examine roadkill locations.

TI  - How Street Features and Lighting Affect Neighborhood Walkability
AU  - Zhang, Xin
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Research has attempted to measure, evaluate, and improve the walkability of streets in neighborhoods. Such studies have found walkability and walking behavior associated with density, diversity, travel distance, design (connectivity and infrastructure), and destination accessibility (referred to as the 5Ds) at macro level and environmental aesthetics at micro (or street) level. Because most studies have been cross-sectional or correlational studies, it is worth doing controlled experiments to test effects of street features on walkability. This dissertation combines walking preference (intention to walk) and aesthetic preferences as a measure of perceived walkability in built environments. It aimed to 1) model the potential effects of selected street characteristics on perceived walkability; 2) find the effects of building styles that convey environmental meanings on perceived walkability; and 3) find effects of lighting modes and enclosure (or openness) on walkability after dark. In the long-term, the approach and findings can point to practical and low-cost measures to stimulate walking in various neighborhood.The dissertation included four studies (one correlational study and three experiments). The first two set up the later studies. A correlational study sought to identify salient groupings of visual properties of streets for walkability. Using t-tests and multivariate analyses, it identified five clusters of attributes that pedestrians perceived as similar to one another for walking choices, as well as the critical ones among those that one could easily manipulate. The remaining studies used 3D models in SketchUp and Vray to create virtual desk-top simulations of streets. The second study sought to identify meanings associated with five street types by building style or type (Tudor and Farm styles, Tudor and Colonial styles, Mediterranean and Saltbox styles, Multi-stories with Traditional styles, and Multi-stories with Modern styles). It had 147 respondents (107 women and 40 men) and used non-parametric analyses to test the perceived desirability, friendliness and social status of the streets. Respondents gave the most favorable scores to the streets with Tudor and Farm or Tudor and Colonial, and they gave the lowest scores to streets with multi-story houses.The two main studies used controlled experiments to test the effect of the physical attributes of streets on perceived walkability. The first experiment used the results from the second study to test the effects of building styles on perceived walkability during the day. It also tested three other attributes identified as salient in the first study: greenery, number of street elements and street enclosure (or openness) selected from the first study. This experiment had 236 participants (156 women, 78 men and 2 unknown). The mixed effect model of the four variables and perceived walkability in daylight found that greenery, traffic controls (signs and crosswalks), street furniture, the preferred building styles, and enclosure each had a positive effect on perceived walkability. The second experiment tested effects of lighting modes (overhead or peripheral, uniform or non-uniform) and enclosure on perceived walkability after dark. It had 186 participants (117 women, 68 men and 1 unknown). The mixed effect model and three ANOVAs found that uniform lighting and overhead lighting had positive effects alone and in combination on perceived walkability. Two logistic regressions analyzed the socio-demographical differences that women and older adults are more sensitive to street characteristics for walking during the daytime and after dark than did men and the younger.For planners, the finding of five cluster suggests that improving one feature in a cluster might achieve the similar effects to improving any of the others. The results from the experiments offer some practical steps communities can take to improve walkability. The addition of trees, better enclosure, traffic safety cues, and overhead and uniform lighting may well make streets more attractiveness for walking. Future research can test how well the verbal measures apply to on-site walkability and how well the findings apply to other kinds of manipulations, other kinds of streets, locations, and populations.

TI  - Study on riparian ecosystem degradation assessment of urban river in shanghai : a case study of suzhou creek
AU  - Wang, Dong Dong
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorRiver degradation becoming the primary problem faced by the river ecosystem of countries all over the word. With the accelerating process of urbanization, riparian zone, especially urban riparian ecosystem suffers serious degradation because of human interference. Degradation assessment is not noly the important means of protect and repair the riparian zone ecosystem, but also is the effective proof of river regulation and sustainable management. Based on this background, try to study on riparian ecosystem degradation assessment of urban river is useful abstractly and practically for urban riparian zone for planning and management regulation. Literatures and references are complete studied, research progress and degradation mechanism of riparian zone at home and abroad are described. Based on which, connotation of urban riparian zone is showed. Practices on assessing riparian zone in Australia, United States, British, Sweden, South Africa and China are concluded from river health assessment, status assessment and ecological restoration and reconstruction after-assessment three aspects, and evaluation factor database is established. Based on horizontal structure of riparian zone, the paper try to characterization of riparian ecosystem degradation degree from waterfront zone, revetment zone, buffer zone and nearshore zone four aspects. With consideration of the characteristics of urban riparian zone in Shanghai, a degradation assessment system of riparian ecosystem of urban river is established with 4 first-grade indexes (including waterfront zone, revetment zone, buffer zone and nearshore zone) and 23 second-grade indexes after determining the assessment indicators, assessment principle, assessment standards and assessment model. Suzhou Creek in Shanghai is selected as the study case for practice, whose natural characteristics are under signiﬁcant destruction and degradation due to rapid urbanization. 43 reaches were selected as the assessment units on the main stream of Suzhou Creek, constructs indicators database using the method of remote sensing image interpretation and spot investigation, measures the Riparian Comprehensive Situation Index (RCSI). Then it identifies the level of degradation interprets and the RCSI response to reaches location, land use types and two banks on the basis of ANOVA analysis and Spearman correlation analysis, and put forward remediation planning and restoration strategies. Meanwhile, the paper preliminary discussed the scope of riparian zone of Suzhou Creek, and the environmental effects of riparian land-use change of urban river are studied on the basis of Pearson correlation analysis. The results show that: (i) The riparian comprehensive situation of Suzhou Creek is in the poor grade with RCSI distributing from 3.79 to 25.03, and no reach is in the minimal degradation, and 69.8% reaches belongs to serious and extreme degradation grade; (ii) River channelization and revetment hardening of Suzhou Creek result in more than 85% reaches of the waterfront and revetment zone status belonging to serious and extreme degradation grade, the width of waterfront zone and type of revetment are the key factors to the grade. Though 72.1% reaches of the buffer zone status belongs to slight and moderate degradation grade, irrational vegetation structure and single species problems are still remained. Rapid urbanization makes more than 50% reaches of the nearshore zone status belonging to serious and extreme degradation grade, and impervious area ratio and facilities richness degree are the crucial factors to the grade; (iii) The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveal that human activity intensity and urbanization are the key forces to cause RCSI and most of other indexes having significant differences in reach location, land use types and two banks, while waterfront zone width, revetment slope, erosion degree, α diversity index and longitudinal connectivity have no significant differences; (iv) It has most significant correlation among RCSI, first-grade indexes and second-grade indexes. (v) The scope of riparian zone based on function of control point source pollution and provides biological corridor range of 5.19-30.00m. The scope of riparian zone based on function of the shipping dock or industrial land range of 0.00-7.00m, The scope of riparian zone based on function of open and public housing range of 6.00-30.00m; (vi) 100m buffer landscape corridor is better reflects the environmental effects of riparian land-use change of urban

AB  - Amphibians are particularly sensitive to landscape fragmentation. Potential barriers between breeding sites can negatively influence the dispersal of individuals and increase genetic structure between populations. In this study, we genotyped 10 microsatellites for 334 marbled newts (Triturus marmoratus) at 11 different locations in Western France. Samples were collected in different regions with contrasting agricultural landscapes (low and high proportion of arable land in the north and south, respectively). We found a strong genetic structure between the northern and southern sampling sites. Isolation by distance was recorded after 62 km, but within the northern region, little or no genetic structure was detected over large distances (up to 114 km). Genetic structure at shorter distance (43 km) was found between sites situated in landscapes with larger amounts of arable lands. A significant positive relationship was found between the pairwise genetic distance (Fst) between sites and the amount of arable land together with the distance between sites. Our results suggest that the Loire River might act as a corridor for the marbled newt, while arable land might act as a barrier. Finally, although a large city is located between sampling sites, no effect was detected on population structure.

TI  - Greened acres: around every other corner, we bump into a patch of grass, some sad-sack trees, a few benches upon which no one ever sits. The last thing Toronto needs is another banal park [Wychwood streetcare barns]
AU  - Lorinc, John
T2  - Toronto Life
AB  - For five years, the city has been trying to formalize this status. But the surprisingly contentious process of turning the Wychwood yard into a neighbourhood park has degenerated into an ugly feud. The NIMBY side, mostly homeowners living adjacent to the site, wants to see most of the car barns demolished to make way for a city park with all the usual trappings: grass, a few trees, some benches and playground equipment, perhaps a pond. The rival faction, which includes area residents, academics, heritage aficionados and arts types, favours a more imaginative vision touted by Artscape, a not-for-profit agency that rents space to artists. A feasibility study released in May lays out a wholesale restoration of several of the barns into community arts facilities, affordable live-work lofts, greenhouses, an interior "covered street" and a rooftop garden. (An earlier version of the plan proposed an amphitheatre with on-site parking, but that suggestion aroused local opposition and was dropped from the final report.) Such a project would cost over $6 million, with the cash coming from the public sector, foundations, community fundraising and rental income. The plans for the open space around the barns have yet to be finalized, but the ideas that have come up include a soccer pitch, naturalized groves and other conventional park amenities.While there have been a few recent success stories (the Yo-Yo Ma-designed Music Garden at Harbourfront, the naturalization project around the Don Valley Brickworks and the amazing momentum of the community gardening movement), much of the problem has to do with the fact that the city's parks budget is drastically overextended. There's scant funding for anything new, much less something innovative. Many councillors are now involved in fundraising for parks projects that stand little chance of winning in the budget sweepstakes. Some are even coming around to the idea that the future lies in flexible public-private partnerships. "As people see their parks deteriorating, you're going to see more 'citizens for vital parks' groups coming forward," predicts Mihevc. "You're going to see a lot more activism about public parks."Robert Allsopp, a Toronto architect who describes the Olmsted style as "almost patronizing," agrees. He worked in Barcelona in the 1980s, when far-sighted planners seized upon the strategy of improving parks as a means of regenerating the city. In the same vein, Allsopp's firm has designed an open-space master plan for the Fort York-Garrison Creek area, with an eye to establishing a corridor of bike paths, land bridges and trails linking the parks north of the rail lines with the isolated historic fort precinct, the new condo projects on Lake Shore Boulevard and Coronation Park. It's an urban planning vision in which the emphasis isn't on creating pastoral landscapes divorced from the city, but rather active social ones that connect previously separated communities. The European approach to open space, says Allsopp, is "a happy mix" of public and commercial--not unlike Harbourfront, or what's envisioned for Wychwood. "We tend to think of parks as green stuff. But more and more, we should be thinking of them as a focal point for redevelopment."

AB  - Understanding the spatial ecology of sturgeon (Acipenseridae) has proven to be a challenge due to the life history characteristics of these fish, especially their long life span, intermittent spawning, and long‐distance migrations. Within the Huron‐Erie Corridor (HEC) of the Laurentian Great Lakes, habitat use of 247 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) was monitored over a three‐year period (2015–2017) with acoustic transmitters. Extensive spatial coverage of receivers throughout the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River between Lake Huron and Lake Erie (~150 km) allowed for continuous monitoring of the movements of acoustic‐tagged individuals. Sequence analysis of individual detection histories was used to describe lake sturgeon habitat use and to determine (1) whether distinct habitat‐use patterns occurred within the HEC; (2) whether the range of habitats occupied varied across seasons among sturgeon grouped by common patterns; and (3) whether variation identified was related to tagging sites in the two rivers or sex. Lake sturgeon were active throughout the HEC, but five distinct habitat‐use patterns were identified. River residents were not broadly distributed across entire rivers, but rather associated with particular segments (middle Detroit River, St. Clair River delta). Variations in habitat‐use sequences were in part related to three river tagging sites, but not sex, and did not produce groups with sequences that reflected all five habitat‐use patterns derived from cluster analysis. Lake sturgeon distribution was reduced to fewer habitat segments during winter and expanded to the maximum extent during the spring and summer. Conservation planning that incorporates behavioral diversity of habitat use is relatively rare due to a lack of observations on movements of individuals at biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales, but using telemetry and sequence analysis methods may promote the success of conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Land development in Massachusetts: Its effect on the environment within Essex and Middlesex counties from 1990 to 2007
AU  - Tardie, Peter Sean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Since the 1970's urban centers in and surrounding Essex and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts have expanded and proliferated into adjacent communities. This expansion has led to the conversion of land for housing, businesses, schools, recreation, and parks, placing significant strain on existing land cover, land use, and available natural resources. Mounting growth pressures and a reduction of undeveloped land have raised serious concerns as cropland and forest fragmentation, wetland destruction, protected open-space infringement, pollution, and systematic losses of rural conditions have become obvious. To monitor development, the post-classification change detection method was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite data and GIS was used to detect, quantity, and document the extent of development and its effect on the environment and to assess and quantify the demographic changes that occurred within the counties from 1990 to 2007. Classification of the 1990 image resulted in 217 clusters and 214 clusters for the 2007 image The overall accuracy achieved for the 1990 image classification was 87.3% with a KHAT value of 0.848, and the overall accuracy for the 2007 classification was 86.27% with a KHAT value of 0.840. From 1990 to 2007 land cover change occurred primarily along major transportation corridors. The post-classification change detection results indicate that Essex and Middlesex County combined gained 23,435.66 "new" acres of land development from 1990 to 2007 through a loss and change in acreage from the Bareland, Forest, Grassland, Water, and Wetland land cover class categories. Results indicate that there was an approximate 0.56% overall (net) increase of newly developed land areas within the 1990 and 2007 image classifications from 415.46 acres or 0.64 square miles. In addition, there was a substantial decrease (-40.0%) within the grassland category. Land development was responsible for a portion of the decrease of grasslands (-13.63%), which occurred mostly within Middlesex County. Results also indicate that "new" land development occurred within several Commonwealth of Massachusetts designated environmentally-sensitive areas: 722 acres in areas of critical environmental concern, 670 acres in priority habitats of rare species, 1,092 acres in living waters core habitats and critical supporting watersheds, 1,318 acres in protected and recreational open spaces, and within 0-1000 feet of 600 certified vernal pools. In addition, several rare or imperiled species inhabiting these areas may have been adversely affected by land development through habitat loss, change, or fragmentation, and/or passage corridor disruptions. A GIS comparison of the "new" land development acreages and census demographic statistics within Essex and Middlesex County cities and towns during this period indicate that communities with more families with children exhibited more land development, and communities with higher median household income exhibited less land development. Land change detection over the 17-year period indicated encroachment of development in areas of environmental concern, but level of development varied by socio-demographic factors.This study also illustrated that the combined use of remotely sensed data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, and demographic data are effective for use as a diagnostic tool and/or base to be built upon to explore associations, indicators, or drivers which may influence land cover change and its effects on existing environmental conditions in areas exhibiting change. In addition, this study provided awareness to ancillary research where scientific guidelines were derived for the protection of specific wildlife habitats and resident species. Lastly, this study presented several land cover modeling and web deployed data dissemination tools for the dissertation results as well as provided a conceptual framework for the successful adoption and implementation of these tools for organizations engaged in natural resource planning and management.

And if we do, we should ensure that we absolutely minimize the impacts these roads have on wildlife and the habitat they depend on . . . especially in national parks," said Douglas Chadwick, an award-winning American naturalist and author.Speaking at the Banff Mountain Book Festival last week, Chadwick, a longtime contributor to National Geographic magazine, praised University of Calgary ecologist Shelley Alexander's proposal to elevate stretches of highway several metres off the ground between Castle Junction and Lake Louise to promote wildlife movement in the Bow Valley.Chadwick and other environmentalists say improving the Trans- Canada Highway's impact on Banff's wildlife habitat is one of the top priorities for the Yellowstone-to-Yukon, or Y2Y initiative. The international effort is aimed at preserving a 3,200-kilometre corridor of prime habitat along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Canada and the U.S.

AB  - In the global economy, competition between Edmonton and Calgary is pointless. Each city has strengths, let's capitalize on them. Looking at the Edmonton-Calgary corridor as a single economic unit, we have a world player: a population of nearly two million people, an abundance of both resources and the expertise to manage them, a huge source of petrochemical feedstock from plants located midway between the cities. A joint economic strategy would be at the core of attracting new investment; in co-ordination with the Alberta and federal governments, investors should be offered one-stop shopping for investment opportunities and requisite governmental reviews.Right now, Canadian petrochemical feedstock is shipped across the Pacific, turned into fabric and clothing, and shipped back across the Pacific. In an Edmonton free port, they could set up manufacturing at the feedstock source, to ship to the North American economy. This would get them around the quota system. If they had a free port, they would avoid paying any tariffs or duties in the North American economy - or in the world economy, for that matter - until the finished product actually left the free-port zone.The way the entrepreneur sees it, a one-hour rail journey between Edmonton and Calgary would make the economic union of the two cities and their hinterland that much easier. That could enable Edmonton's airport(s) to become international air-cargo centres within the free port, and Calgary International to become the Alberta airport for a market of two-million-plus people. Passenger trains would use most of the line's capacity during the day, high-speed freight trains could run at night.

TI  - Ecophysiology of Populus fremontii: Effects of inundation, and interactions among nitrogen form, nutrient level, and water availability
AU  - Auchincloss, Lisa Cutting
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the climate changes and land continues to be developed for agricultural and urban use, ecosystems around the globe will experience shifts in hydrologic cycles, CO2 concentrations, water availability, and nutrient availability.  Semi-arid riparian forests in the North American West will be particularly affected by these changes since establishment of riparian vegetation depends on the river hydrograph, urban and agricultural runoff, water and air temperature, CO2 concentration, and soil nutrient availability.  Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) is an early successional foundation species in these ecosystems that establishes along barren point bars and contributes many important ecosystem functions.  The three chapters of this dissertation investigate responses of P. fremontii  seedlings to 1) variation in inundation depth, duration, and temperature, 2) variation in atmospheric CO2 concentration and N form (NO3- and NH4+), and 3) variation in nutrient level, soil water availability, and N form.    Investigations of seedling tolerance of inundation showed that mortality increased linearly with days of complete shoot submergence (mortality % = 4.6 + (2.5 days)), resulting in greater than 60% mortality after four weeks of complete submergence.  Cooler water temperature (18/11°C day/night) during complete submergence positively affected seedling dry weight and survival resulting in 25% greater seedling survival than at warmer water temperatures (25/18°C day/night).  Results indicated that establishment of new  P. fremontii populations in the riparian corridor will be more successful when flows do not completely cover the shoots of seedlings for more than two weeks and if water temperatures during inundation are cool.    Investigations of seedling response to N form and CO2 level found that seedlings grown with NH4+ had 42% greater average dry weight than those grown with NO3-  regardless of CO2 level.  The lack of an interaction countered our hypotheses that inhibition of leaf NO3- reduction at elevated CO2 would lead to lower dry weights in NO3- fed plants at elevated CO2.  Instead we found that NO3 -  reduction occurred in roots and was not coupled to carbon metabolism in seedling leaves.  The observed differences in dry weight between NO 3- and NH4+ plants were likely due to the increased costs of NO3- reduction and maintenance of charge balance in P. fremontii seedling roots.  Regardless of form, there was no significant difference in average dry weights between plants grown at ambient and elevated CO2, and there was evidence of CO2 acclimation.  The final chapter quantified relative effects of water stress (stressed vs. well watered), nutrient level (low near field conditions, medium, and high non-limiting), and N form (NO3- vs. NH 4+) on growth.  Low nutrient level decreased average plant dry weight to a large extent.  Decreases caused by low nutrients were at least six-fold greater than any decrease in biomass resulting from water stress.  N form had little effect on plant dry weights.  Both water stress and N form interacted with nutrient level such that effects of either factor on growth and allocation were only observed at high and medium nutrient levels.  Thus, effects of water stress and N form are likely to affect plant growth and dry weight allocation only when high, non-limiting nutrients are present, whereas nutrient level consistently affects seedling growth and allocation and dampens effects of the other factors.    Together these chapters provide an assessment of the effects of inundation, nutrient level, CO2 level, N form, and intermittent, moderate water stress on the growth and survival of P. fremontii seedlings during their first season of growth.

AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.

TI  - The effect of urbanization on butterfly species diversity
AU  - Di Mauro, Desiree Kay
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation investigates the impacts of urbanization on butterfly diversity in Washington, DC, northern Virginia, and Maryland and the role of butterfly gardens in butterfly conservation. Using weekly butterfly garden surveys from 135 gardens and 4th of July Butterfly Counts from 1990 to 2001, I investigated whether the matrix surrounding suitable butterfly habitat affects the diversity of the species found in this suitable habitat. The hypothesis of this study was that increasing levels of human development and population density in the matrix surrounding butterfly habitat will negatively affect the butterfly diversity found in the habitat. Results of this study indicate that local, not regional, butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human development (rural, suburban, or urban development) surrounding the habitat, but that the matrix is just one factor in generalist species diversity. Other factors include the size of the suitable habitat, the number of nectar plants blooming in the habitat, the use of pesticides in neighboring areas, and linkages to other suitable habitat. These results indicate that butterfly gardens do serve a purpose in butterfly conservation, most likely serving as stepping stones or corridors between larger tracts of habitat. Conservation efforts should include butterfly gardens, but larger tracts of natural habitat with less development or large gardens should also be included in any conservation plan. Future study should: (1) include species with more specific habitat needs than the twelve species used in the butterfly garden study, (2) more closely investigate the effects of pesticide use in neighboring areas, and (3) use mark-release-recapture techniques to study metapopulations in this area.

AU  - Nikolakaki, P.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The work described in this Thesis, develops a theoretical framework for the development of a spatial woodland creation strategy as a response to habitat fragmentation.The study produced a methodology that used the best available landscape ecological knowledge to generate a set of rules that enabled the creation of a landscape plan. The choice of a target species (the woodland bird, Redstart), which is sensitive to fragmentation effects, allowed precise parameters to be worked out as a framework for the woodland strategy.Two contrasting landscape types with different woodland cover were chosen as case studies for evaluating the success of the re-instating of a woodland framework. The use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) was an indispensable tool for the application of the method.The strategy first identified woods with the highest chances of being occupied: these were considered to be "source" woods, which provided colonizers for local populations in the remaining woods. With regard to the colonization potential of existing sites in relation to the sources, small woods with a low degree of isolation were identified for further expansion so as to satisfy the minimum area requirement for redstarts. Woodland corridors were created to promote dispersal to the isolated woods. In addition , the strategy also suggested planting on degraded areas of urban fringes and colliery sites, so that both visual and ecological benefits would be delivered.

TI  - Pool -breeding amphibian habitat use and conservation in southern Maine's urbanizing landscapes
AU  - Baldwin, Robert Fritz
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Pool-breeding amphibians utilize both wetland and terrestrial habitats, and thus are vulnerable to the combined threats of wetland and terrestrial habitat loss. Habitat loss and degradation are extreme in urbanizing areas, and in the rapidly-developing northeastern United States, pool-breeding amphibians including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) face loss of isolated wetland breeding sites and fragmentation of forested non-breeding habitat. More information on the biology of the species and systematic approaches to conservation are needed to address these threats. To add to the pool-breeding amphibian habitat literature and develop conservation methods, I studied association between breeding population size at 87 seasonal forest pools, and habitat conditions at the aquatic, local (150m) and landscape (500m) spatial scales, in rapidly developing southern Maine. I examined migratory movements and post-breeding habitat selection by 43 wood frogs April–November 2003, using radiotelemetry, and conducted conservation gap and threat analyses. Breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders were greater in long-hydroperiod seasonal pools (≥18 weeks), in relatively isolated upland settings (2–5 neighboring pools). Spotted salamander breeding populations were higher when also associated with late-successional forest conditions (Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia co-dominance). Radiotracked wood frogs migrated 102–340m (median 169m) from breeding pools through forested uplands to neighboring forested wetlands where they spent the summer months. Within wetland macrohabitats, wood frogs selected non-aquatic, moist, shaded microhabitats, primarily utilizing leaf and sphagnum structures as daytime refugia. Conservation GAP and threat analysis at the region (multi-township) scale revealed that nearly half of potential breeding sites receive no protection, and 1.5% of pool-breeding amphibian habitat in the region (453 ha) is immediately threatened by projected human population expansion. Furthermore, National Wetland Inventory maps omit 55% of potential breeding pools (1.77/km2), and thus many pools may be threatened by a lack of remote detection during delineation. To prioritize conservation of pool-breeding amphibian habitat, we recommend identifying (a) landscapes with high habitat value that are threatened by development and within those, (b) high-quality breeding (i.e. intermediate-long hydroperiod seasonal pools) and non-breeding (i.e. forested) habitat. A method to incorporate wetland habitat connectivity using a context-specific GIS is suggested.

TI  - Detroit's suburban office centres
AU  - Matthew, Malcolm R
T2  - Canadian Journal of Urban Research
AB  - Troy and Southfield lead the City of Detroit in various measures of the 'good life'. In Detroit, where 36 percent of the houses are pre-1939, the housing market stagnates so that 1995 average house prices ranged from $22,000 to $77,000 in its twelve real estate districts. The average was $104,000 in Southfield and $171,000 in Troy, with less than 3 percent of these houses pre-1939. In 1990, 29 percent of Detroit's families were classified as low income compared to 3.5 percent in Southfield and 2.0 percent in Troy. The two suburbs' populations are also younger, with only 6.6 percent of the residents being over 65 years of age in 1990 compared to 20 percent in Detroit. These characteristics are reflected by the occupational profiles of the residents in the three municipalities and the way in which these have changed since 1960 (Table 6). The high proportions of production workers and labourers in Michigan, in Detroit and in Troy in 1960 reflected a reliance on manufacturing. As automation brought rising productivity between 1960 and 1990, this proportion shrank steadily in Michigan as a whole and in Detroit. In Southfield, with a proportion of blue collar workers already below average in 1960, it fell more rapidly while in Troy it dropped more rapidly yet, so that in 1990 the proportions of resident production workers and labourers in both Southfield and Troy were half that of Michigan and the City of Detroit. The proportion of managerial and professional workers in Michigan's workforce rose steadily between 1960 and 1990, but the proportion of such workers living in the City of Detroit remained almost unchanged. Meanwhile, in Southfield and Troy this segment of their resident workforces grew to more than double the proportion in Detroit.Every office building in Troy and in Southfield's highway corridor was visited to interview front desk personnel in each establishment briefly to elicit objective data. A response rate of over 80 percent yielded 459 interviews. A random sample of the offices was then selected and all the offices with over 500 employees, that had not already been selected, were added to the sample. I attempted to interview executives in each of these offices about the factors that were considered in the decision to locate in that centre, and the advantages or disadvantages they had found after opening the offices. Some were reluctant to cooperate but 38 interviews were completed. Tables 7 and 8 show the centres' profiles in terms of objective data from the initial interviews. 26 percent of the office establishments in Southfield and 14 percent of those in Troy were law firms (Table 7). These firms were generally small, with a few medium-sized ones, and did not include the large, departmentally-specialized firms, with a hundred or more lawyers, that are still located downtown. Apart from the high proportions of law firms there is little similarity in the functional profiles of the offices in these centres, Troy being the more functionally diverse one. The high degree of specialization in one function resembled what had been found in two of the three Vancouver centres, but the specializations differed, and neither centre is as diversified as the three examined in Toronto. Also, 13 percent of the Southfield offices and only 3 percent of those in Troy were foreign owned, similar to Vancouver's but far lower than in the Toronto centres ([Matthew] 1996). This difference may be related to Detroit's role in the U.S. auto industry, with foreign car manufacturers preferring to locate most of their plants in more southern states, whereas Toronto has a diversified economy and has a growing role of linking Canada to the world's financial markets.About 45 percent of the establishments in each of the two centres had ten or fewer employees (Table 8), which is significantly less than in Vancouver at 72 percent and Toronto at 65 percent ([Gad] 1975; Matthew 1993a, 1996). The head offices of two of the big three auto companies are in the suburbs, but not in either of the centres surveyed. However, Troy's Big Beaver strip has the head offices of KMart (the fifteenth largest U.S. company on the Fortune 500 list) and Kelly Services (ranked 476th), while Southfield had the head office of only one, Lear Seating (355th). There has been minimal physical movement of offices to either of these centres from outside the Detroit PMSA, and few of the offices in the suburban centres have moved there from the CBD. In fact, over 80 percent of the offices in each of the centres were born either in the centre or elsewhere within the Detroit suburbs, reinforcing findings in Toronto and Vancouver that the suburbs are self generators of offices, with little physical relocation of offices from the CBDs to suburban locations in the metropolitan areas.

AB  - As it cuts across South Minneapolis, Lake Street reflects the city's diversity and its rich history. Initially a narrow dirt road out beyond Minneapolis's early city limits, Lake Street evolved into a major transportation route after the turn of the last century. Spurred by the city's population boom during those early years, the Lake Street corridor soon filled in with retail shops, restaurants, movie theaters, and auto dealers. But Lake Street's role as a major commercial corridor did not last. Buffeted by the forces of suburbanization after World War II, businesses along the corridor began to close, leaving Lake Street pockmarked with vacant, blighted buildings. Then, starting in the 1990s, the seeds of the corridor's renewal were planted when an energetic group of new arrivals to the United States began renovating Lake Street's deteriorating storefronts for their family-owned businesses. Lake Street's rejuvenation has continued into the current century as business and community leaders build on the work begun by those 20th-century urban pioneers.

TI  - Man Bites Mosquito: Understanding the Contribution of Human Movement to Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics
AU  - Adams, Ben
AU  - Kapan, Durrell D
T2  - PLoS One
AB  - In metropolitan areas people travel frequently and extensively but often in highly structured commuting patterns. We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it.

TI  - Carnivores in the Southern Canadian Rockies
AU  - Hurtak, F J
T2  - Daily Townsman
AB  - Last February, I attended a lecture at the College of the Rockies, on carnivore core areas and connectivity across the Crowsnest Highway. The lecture was by Dr. John L. Weaver a senior wildlife biologist, who along with several others put together a study for the Wildlife Conservation Society of Canada on carnivores in our general region, that being the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains between Banff National Park and Glacier National Park at the U.S. border.As I have always shown an interest in carnivores in general, I found the lecture facinating. Weaver indicated that our area supports the most diverse, intact system of carnivores in all of North America. Until someone with Weaver's credibility actually points out how diverse a population we really have, I don't think a lot of people really give it much thought.Expanding human developments, and there is obviously more every year here and throughout the region, pose a real threat to maintaining the security and connectivity of habitats and populations across the landscape. The real danger he says is the increasing extent and intensity of this network. It could eventually fragment carnivore populations into smaller and more vulnerable units, reduce gene flow, and restrict options for ecological and geographic shifts in response to climate change.

TI  - Land use change in maasailand: drivers, dynamics and impacts on large herbivores and agro-pastoralism
AU  - Msoffe, Fortunata Urban
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The Maasailand of Kenya and Tanzania supports one of the richest wildlife populations remaining on Earth. However, over the last century, Maasailand has experienced land transformation notably through conversion of former rangelands to croplands. With the anticipated human population increase in East Africa, more impacts should be envisaged on these rangelands. This thesis investigates the root causes and underlying drivers of land-use change in the Maasai-Steppe ecosystems, stemming from historical, socio-cultural, political as well as the biophysical conditions. To analyse the different drivers of change, an integrated methodological approach was employed. This included a collation of historical data and information derived from both gray and published literature, analysis of remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data, field surveys, workshops, observations, as well as personal communications. Observed land-use change from savannah rangelands to expansive croplands are mainly linked to government policies, land tenure, human population growth (which is also likely to be the largest future driver) and climatic conditions. Consequently these changes have impacted the agro-pastoralist community, whose main incomes for their livelihoods depend on pastoralism. Subsequent loss of formerly communal grazing lands to establish protected areas; large-scale farming and/or private ranches have aggravated the problems of sedentarization due to villagization and privatization policies of the formally mobile agro-pastoral communities. Land-use change also had negative impacts on migratory wildlife species, particularly those utilizing both protected areas and dispersal ranges in communal and/or private lands. The impacts ranged from loss of their migratory routes and corridors to massive declines of populations due to the loss of access to grazing resources. The study recommends government’s interventions for keeping the land open for access to grazing resources as well as opening up wildlife corridors, where it is deemed necessary for national interests.

TI  - Patterns and Elements Planning and Design for Linpan Rural Landscape in Longmen Mountain
AU  - Xue, Fei
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Chinese agricultural civilization as well as the traditional rural landscape stranded a high position in the world history. Chengdu Longmen Mountain is located between the first steps (Tibet Plateau) with the second step (Sichuan Basin) of the Chinese geological steps. Because of the complexity of the natural resources, Longmen Mountain has the diversity of the rural landscape. Linpan sites in the Chengdu plain, the decentralized style shows the different with the normal Chinese centralized villages. This style is also chosen by the ancient Sichuan people, by the pattern of the local mountain and water system. After the 5.12 earth quake, the rural landscapes in Longmen Mountain have been greatly changed by the rebuilding and development projects. This research object tries to use the Linpan rural landscape style to change the future of some areas.This paper chooses the Chengdu, Dayi, Sanba as the research area. We can find 6 typical rural landscape elements, by the ecological analyze of Point, Line, Area as well as the Patch, Corridor, Pattern in Sanba village. They are: Mountain, Water, Forest (Natural Oriented) and Farmland, Road, Village (Human Oriented). The Clips are also used as one research method to find the patterns in the Linpan for planning and design. The six rules are found in this research: Linpan centralization rules: Number, Area, Rate between trees and houses; Linpan decentralization rules: Water system, Distance, Classification. The way to plan and design the Sanba rural area uses both these centralization and decentralization rules to rebuild the new Sanba.It can help the other researches to reorganize the village by local traditional landscape style and the method of downscaling, clips and elements and patterns.

AU  - Tully, Tim
T2  - Free Press
AB  - Yet, there has always been a sense of reassuring sameness about Yonge Street despite its four lane facelift. The houses, fields and forests are pretty much how I remember them - until this fall. Driving past Yonge Street today you can't help but notice the scars on the landscape that were once fields east and west of Cornell Drive. A pastoral landscape of tall grasses, old apple trees, Sugar Maples, pines, cedars, and White Ash has been scraped to the bone and piled in a heap - not one natural feature of the landscape is left. Upon investigation at the Midland town office I was told by a planner that the fields had to be bulldozed in order "to level them off for future subdivision development". As a professional naturalist and ecologist, I find this "type" of development an affront on an ecological, aesthetic and planning basis. What we have here is a case of poor planning - it wasn't required of the developer to clear the land in that manner it was simply the easiest and cheapest way of doing it. What they have created is a Toronto style subdivision plan which does not reflect the nature or aesthetic character of Midland.It was with great concern that I read on the front page of the Toronto Star, January 7th, that throughout North America wildlife is in crisis. Gracing the cover was a photograph of an animal I was introduced to in these same fields - the Monarch Butterfly. The Monarch was the most common butterfly encountered back in those days. You couldn't travel far without encountering the characteristic yellow, black and white banded caterpillar chewing away on a milkweed leaf or seeing the green gem of a crysalis delicately suspended by a silken thread. The regal orange and black adults flitted to and fro in large numbers drinking from the sweet scented milkweed blooms. Today the Monarch Butterfly is on Canada's endangered species list classified as a species of special concern. It is "vulnerable" to extinction largely due to habitat destruction and pesticide use. As a young boy I learned my first ecological lesson from this creature. The Monarch's life cycle revolves entirely around one single type of plant found in old fields - the milkweed.When I visited the town office I was assured by the town planner that areas immediately proximal to the lake will be saved as "green belt" which eventually will ring the lake and provide access for a future recreation trail to be built by the town. From an aesthetic point of view it is admirable for the town to consider this option, but from an ecological point of view, many of the ecological functions, including movement corridors and critical wildlife habitat, will be irreparably damaged. The end result will be a disappearance of select species. The ecological reality is the entire area depends on a mixture of forests and fields; individual species will not tolerate this intrusion. As a side bar, it is interesting to see what the town defines as a green belt. Take a look at the few remaining Black Willows left standing by the area's first developer (Little Lake Estates). The developer cut through the supposed natural area illegally in order to get a view of the lake for his condominium buyers. A thin green belt of 50 to 100 meters ringing the lake is simply not enough to guarantee habitat integrity. The town did nothing in response.

TI  - Riparian forest vegetation patterns and historic channel dynamics of the Big Sioux River, South Dakota
AU  - Ley, Matt J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Big Sioux River, a major tributary to the Missouri River, drains approximately 22,550 km2 in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota.  Compared to many other Great Plains rivers, the Big Sioux is relatively natural and free-flowing, with a largely intact riparian corridor and little flow regulation.  Along its course, the river flows through a largely agriculturally dominated matrix that contains several major population centers.  The close proximity to these agricultural and urban land uses have contributed to a number of water quality problems during the last 50 years that have threatened the ecologically integrity of the Big Sioux.  In order to conserve and properly manage the Big Sioux corridor, it will be important to gain an improved scientific understanding of ecological patterns and their environmental correlatives along the river.  This thesis is an attempt to provide these data.   Using modern aerial imagery and ground-truthing techniques, I quantified the current extent of riparian forest communities along a 576 km stretch of the Big Sioux River.  In total, there were 7 dominant riparian forest community types along the river that contributed to 6.85% of the total Big Sioux basin land cover.  Riparian forest extent increased from north to south and was dominated by the Silver Maple-Elm-Cottonwood Forest community type (41% of total).  In addition, 35 riparian forest sites and 5 upland forest sites were sampled to examine the typical vegetative characteristics of forest within the basin.  In general, floristic quality and basal area decreased from south to north and % exotics increased.  These findings provided data on riparian forest habitats along the river and can be used to assess future forest restoration efforts.   Streamflow has increased dramatically over the last 30 years in the Big Sioux basin (122% increase in mean annual flow) resulting in a highly significant, 62% increase in channel planform area, a 4% decrease in channel length and sinuosity, and a 69% increase in channel width.  These channel adjustments were highly correlated with increasing mean annual flows and baseflow.  To examine why these increases have occurred, the relative effects of land use change and climatic variation were examined, with findings from these analyses lending support towards land use change, specifically agricultural intensification, being a more important driver of increased streamflow and channel adjustments than changes in the climatic regime.  These results are in line with findings from similar studies of agriculturally dominated basins throughout the Upper Midwest.   The final chapter examines potential pitfalls and uncertainties associated with using the Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) across state boundaries.  In total, results from 18 riparian and upland forest sites along the South Dakota/Iowa border were compared using Coefficients of Conservatism (C-values) from each state.  Findings indicated that for the 141 observed species, South Dakota mean C-values were higher (3.57) than Iowa (2.50) and that there were 98 C-value divergences between states with 20 being equal to ± 4.  FQA  values calculated using Iowa C-values were consistently lower than South Dakota and highlight the subjective nature of assigning  C-values at the individual state level. This thesis provides several recommendations that would improve the utility of the FQA and allow it to become more widely standardized as a valuable ecological assessment tool.   This thesis provides baseline data critical to targeting current and future management efforts along the Big Sioux and provides an improved scientific understanding of ecological patterns in habitats along this valuable watershed in eastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa.

TI  - 6 Reasons Why Designing UX for IoT is So Difficult
T2  - Microwaves & RF
AB  - Diversity of interfaces and data points Typically, an IoT solution needs to handle multiple data types from multiple devices on a user interface (UI) that flows seamlessly across interfaces.The inverter and weather station would commonly involve "dongle" hardware with a processor and wireless communications chip to pull and send data through a gateway to the cloud.Once these multiple data types from multiple devices are together, the end user needs to access a simple yet informative visualization on any interface they want, like a phone, laptop, or on-site screen.[...]IoT systems are always changing with new data points coming online or devices in the field being changed out.Typical Hardware Selection Criteria Enough MIPS/RAM/ROM Running a real-time operating system (RTOS), or time-based scheduler, would be sufficient for most applications, but it will limit the ability to expand.In some situations, low latency and minimal data loss are very important (autonomous vehicles or volcanic activity monitoring), while in others they are less so (solar generation or tide level monitoring).If you work at a nuclear plant or are monitoring a volcano that's located just above a town, you might be a little paranoid about how much you trust that little green light.Because IoT marries the real and digital worlds, data being right and wrong can have a significant impact on people, which is why trust must be built into the user experience of IoT solutions.

TI  - The new ruralism: A vision for exurban landscapes
AU  - Filuk, Justin L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Residential development has become prevalent in the urban fringe of Canadian cities. This form of low-density growth impacts both the physical and cultural features that define rural landscapes. Preserving farmland, open space, wildlife habitat, natural resources and rural character have all become salient issues of regional significance. The sporadic nature of land subdivision and a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach to site design often fail to address these regional issues. The cumulative effects of these individual developments often result in a fragmented, contrasting and uninspired exurban landscape. This master's degree project recognizes the inevitable growth of exurban development and uses a design-based approach to develop a concept for a residential community. A set of key principles and design process derived from ecological design and rural design precedents provide a framework to guide design decisions within exurban settings. A project site located west of Calgary is used to illustrate the principles and demonstrate a design strategy that responds to the local conditions of the site and its regional context. Over 80% of the site is maintained as open space for agricultural uses, community uses and environmental protection. Houses are clustered to preserve wildlife habitat and movement corridors and to benefit from communal infrastructure. The concept design also establishes connections to its regional context, demonstrating its potential to serve as a building block for open space protection in the local area. The New Ruralism as a model for exurban growth represents a potential form of exurban development that is sustainable and logical in the rural landscape.

TI  - Reunited at Last: Genetic Recovery of Stream Fish Populations after Removal of Passage Barriers
AU  - Prasko, Lauren  M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - One of the top threats to biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems is habitat fragmentation due to human activities. In streams, road crossings with poorly designed culverts can cause fragmentation and block fish passage, which limits genetic exchange between upstream and downstream individuals. The genetic effects of population isolation are well established, but the genetic response, or pattern of recovery, of fish populations following re-establishment of connectivity is poorly understood. This knowledge gap is addressed by measuring allelic diversity, genetic differentiation, and assignment probabilities in Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdii) sampled upstream and downstream of sites with varying time spans since culvert replacement. Sample collection occurred during the summer of 2018 from eight streams located throughout western Pennsylvania. This was the first time Mottled Sculpin microsatellites were used to assess the genetic effects of culvert barriers. Sites with restored passage barriers had little genetic differences among upstream and downstream populations. Results indicate immediate movement between upstream and downstream populations following barrier restoration.

AU  - Stadnyk, Eric Stephen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Alternative open space design strategies need to be sought which work in concert with those qualities of a landscape which contribute to its inherent sense of place. Traditional planning strategies at Omand's Creek in Winnipeg have recently seen this area evolving from an industrial locale into a typical, big-box retail superstore site. Barely a shade of what it used to be, the waterway has become merely an industrial drainage ditch, with little benefit for wildlife or recreational opportunities. Traditional notions of park space development places islands of parks within the urban fabric, unconnected and unrelated to one another, few and far between. Greenway design is a recent movement that brings together nature, recreation and the potential to re-think the way cities and green spaces are put together. Re-integrating nature as a greenway at Omand's Creek explores the exciting potential of the revitalisation of the creek, the reuse of the railway corridor, enhancement of the existing park spaces at Bluestem and Westview, and future linkages to the regional context. As well, as a means of urban design, a greenway may resolve the area's changing and temporal land uses and natural and pedestrian activities. A framework is illustrated which will allow for change to continue to occur on the site as it continues to evolve.

AB  - Background Recognizing the factors influencing migratory individuals throughout their annual cycle is important for understanding the drivers of population dynamics. Previous studies have found that Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) in the Atlantic region have lower survival rates than those in the Great Lakes and the Arctic. One possible explanation for divergent survival rates among these populations is differences in their non-breeding habitats.Methods We tracked Herring Gulls from five populations, breeding in the eastern Arctic, the Great Lakes, Newfoundland, Sable Island, and the Bay of Fundy. We assessed the extent of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering sites, and tested if there were differences in home range size or habitat selection among these populations during the winter.Results The tracked Herring Gulls had strong migratory connectivity between their breeding and wintering areas. We found that Herring Gulls from the Arctic spent most of the winter in marine habitats, while the other populations used a wider variety of habitats. However, the Newfoundland and Sable Island populations selected for urban habitats, and almost all individuals the specialized in urban habitats came from one of the three Atlantic populations.Conclusions Our results suggest that there could potentially be a link between urban habitat use during the winter and reduced adult survival in Atlantic Canada Herring Gulls.

Since the CSP is a guide to municipal planning only, the CSP does not affect land ownership or land use zoning.Controversy has arisen in regard to Council's proposal to redraw Canmore's urban growth boundary, placing Sites 7, 8 and 9 of the Three Sisters Mountain Resort (TSMV) in a 'holding' designation as an 'Environmentally Sensitive Area'. This is not an unreasonable amendment since 400 acres of Site 9 consist of wildlife movement corridors scientifically validated in the 2002 Wind Valley Study and Crown land. Future extension of the urban growth boundary would simply involve another layer of public consultation, possibly in the form of a plebiscite.Environmentally, the CSP is not a controversial municipal document. It merely restates the scientific criteria which have guided the protection of wildlife movement corridors and habitat for approximately a decade, and have been applied in cooperation between municipal and provincial jurisdictions to existing conservation easements and land uses on the TSMV land, where the NRCB has required that "more recent scientific thought" be used.

AB  - "Is it perfect? Obviously not," remarked Ward 5 Coun. Mark Whaley, whose ward will be home to the new subdivision. "The property has been owned and zoned since 1970 for development, and I'm so happy we didn't do anything in 1970 because we would have bulldozed it over, filled in the wetlands and built an unsustainable neighbourhood."A study of deer movements in the area showed the majority were to the south, away from the development. The builder will construct a wildlife corridor on the east end of the subdivision to permit deer access to the lands to the north. It will be about 6.2 metres wide at its narrowest point as it exits onto Woolwich Street.According to the staff report, "White-tailed deer are a highly mobile species and are not considered to be highly sensitive to development."

AB  - The natural abundance of C4 vegetation is substantially higher in the desert zones of Central Asia, where livestock, as part of urban or nomadic subsistence, could have accessed enriched ô13C biomass and provided human consumers with protein-dense foods (meat and milk) with high ô13C values.At these sites, cultural materials associated with eighth- to thirteenth-century radiocarbon chronologies include cotton fabrics and variable mixtures of ceramics, ranging between standardized wheel-spun food storage vessels from distant oases communities and locally produced handmade coarse wares, which are rare in urban contexts.[...]at the community level, a second scale of dietary variability that is representative of multi-resource pastoralism is observed at late Otrar and Zhetysu, which display wide ranges of ô13C values.[...]many of the pan-regional turnovers in religion, language, and political authority that resulted in changes in architecture, technologies, and other commodity classes in the medieval period are historically described as nomadic innovations, and essential routes that connected Silk Road sites in the highland regions of Central Asia were likely shaped by nomadic mobility.

AU  - Campbell, Sylvia
T2  - Harbour City Star
AB  - Sharp-shinned hawks are widely dispersed and seldom-seen nesters that breed mainly in large stands of deciduous, coniferous, and mixed pine-hardwood forests and pine plantations. In temperate areas, nesting coincides with the annual peak in songbird abundance. The species' secretive nature and the dense vegetation of its nesting habitat make it difficult to find and study during the breeding season. The early stages of nesting, in particular, are little studied. The bird is best seen, and most frequently studied, on migration, when large numbers of individuals concentrate along major migratory corridors and bottlenecks, particularly in the east.The common name refers to the exposed thin shin or lower leg. Sharp-shinned hawks have been referred to as bird hawk, bullet hawk, little blue darter, pigeon hawk, and sparrow hawk.

It's also understandable that Bighorn council and administration balked at the likes of the Town of Canmore and environmental groups' negative input on said ASP.Concerns range from homes being built in too close a proximity, to too many people recreating within wildlife corridors, to the width, location and geographic makeup of said corridors. With the proposed Dead Man's ASP, even developers already in the midst of constructing housing in the hamlet aren't enamoured with the situation.So it's no surprise that some are suggesting current work and future development in Dead Man's will render the $1.8 million (2005 dollars) underpass useless and interfere in general with wildlife movement.

AB  - Today, automobile dependency constantly causes traffic congestion, delays, reduced access, increased fuel and energy consumption, and environmental emissions. Automobile dependency has caused many direct and indirect transportation problems that may influence our life. Urban planners and transportation engineers seek to improve transport networks considering social issues. One of the most successful solutions for advocating sustainable transport is transit-oriented development (TOD). Another solution that planners encourage to use is designing the roadways based on a complete street approach, which is a system that provides safe, convenient, and comfortable travel and increases accessibility for users of all ages regardless of their transport modes. The present study employed the saturated roads that have heavy traffic most of the time and public transport e-ticket data to investigate the potential complete streets in Qazvin. An online questionnaire was developed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method based on the TOD and the complete street framework to investigate the essential criteria for redesigning the network based on the active transport approach. Thus, after analyzing the six criteria (density, diversity, distance, accessibility, demand management, and design) and eight sub-criteria (pedestrian flow, pedestrian density, connectivity, safety, bike route, bus route, road width, and urban tree canopy index), the proposed active transport network emerged and results show that five high priority streets were identified to be considered as a solution.

Acid rain, habitat destruction and competing species are pushing the amphibian out of existence.Ten per cent of British butterflies are extinct and many are now declining rapidly. Part of the reason is the disappearance of hedgerows. Since 1985, 20 per cent of England's hedgerows have been destroyed. Not only are they habitats for butterflies, they offer protection and corridors for movement to other animals and wild plants.The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution reports that the total lengths of rivers that are badly polluted have increased from 3,900 kilometres in 1980 to 4,680 kilometres in 1990, while reported incidents of water pollution in England and Wales rose from 12,600 in 1980 to over 28,000 in 1990.

TI  - Analysis of Poultry Trade Networks to Improve Risk-Based Surveillance: A Survey Study in Gujarat, India
AU  - Sequeira, Sara Alexandra Correia
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Poultry production and trading in India have been facing a spectacular growth as the demand for poultry products increases. Live bird shops (LBSs) and poultry trading practices are known risk factors in the spread of diseases within poultry production and distribution networks. Although such shops are ubiquitous in India, poultry trading practices and potential impact on disease risk are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to characterise LBSs for Exotic Broiler (EB) and Desi species, based on trading practices likely to increase infectious risk, and to assess the connectivity between shops through the trade of live poultry.A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 86 LBSs, selected through a multi-stage sampling method. Eight cities were first purposively selected and, within each city, shops were identified using random spatial sampling. The standardised questionnaires focused on shop management characteristics, hygiene practices and details of their chicken suppliers. The suppliers were then contacted and asked about their trading practices and suppliers until catchment areas were identified. Finally, disease transmission pathways were investigated and poultry trading networks were constructed for EB chickens, to assess the connectivity between shops.Preliminary descriptive analysis suggests a high heterogeneity in the scale of operations, with daily sales ranging from 6 up to 800 and from 0 to 30 chickens, respectively for EB and Desi species. Most of the shops reported to have unsold chickens at the end of the day, with a proportion of unsold chickens reaching up to 26% and 45.2%, respectively for EB and Desi chickens. Several practices were identified as having a potential influence on disease introduction and transmission, into and within the shops. The transport of chickens from farms to shops typically involves one (85.3%) or two intermediaries (10.3%). While each city obtained chickens only from one to four districts (out of the 33 districts of Gujarat), four districts supplied more than one city.The described practices may promote pathogen amplification within Gujarat’s shops. Moreover, the network shaped by poultry movements, regarding EB chickens, connect distant poultry populations that include both tribal and non-tribal areas, increasing the risk of pathogen spread in the region. Nevertheless, most of the surveyed cities get their supplies from the closest district(s). Further investigation on risk pathways for disease transmission and identification of their geographical and socio-economic determinants are some of the next steps.

AB  - Six eyes, focused by light beams, peer out of the hurtling steel machine, searching for yellow points of light peering back. One pair of searching eyes buoyed by a steady stream of Red Bull, the other two propped up by a potent mixture of fear and anxiety. Last night the machine decimated one such pair of reflecting eyes., .what was the source of that sound off the bumper? They are travelling at 120 km/h, a steady line of trees frames either side of the corridor of darkness cut through by their headlights. Time seems frozen but their advancement is evidenced by the towns that are swept by through their relentless movement forward: Pays Plat, Rossport, Selim, Schreiber, Terrace Bay, Ripple, Coldwell,... blurring together in a lightscape of High Intensity Discharge yellow. It's 3:14 AM, and the dawning of a new day will bring a fourth lecture in five days in a new city, and the promise of four more lectures: Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax.Part agitprop meant to engage the general public and the different institutions of design across Canada and part heroic statement meant to underline that architecture and architects are very much a part of everyday life, The Roadshow sought to map the currents of contemporary architectural debate. In opposition to past attempts to define Canadian architecture as a stable and legible entity, which is inevitably fraught with misconceptions given architecture's ever-evolving frames of reference beyond our geographic, political and cultural borders, The Roadshow explored a more inclusive framing of architectural ideation and production. The deconstruction of the creative work of eight architects and the examination of their differences and commonalities offered the potential for a structuring of interwoven design sensibilities. In this way, the physical journey across Canada paralleled an intellectual journey of discovery, framing the shift from the determinant aspects of any one architecture, of concrete, glass, steel and wood, to the interconnected preoccupations that frame the landscape of contemporary architectural production in Canada.The participating architects of The Roadshow, [Roger Mullin] (Halifax), [Neil Minuk] (DIN Projects, Winnipeg), Randy Cohen (Atelier Big City, Montreal), David Battersby (Battersby Howat, Vancouver), Manon Asselin (Atelier TAG, Montreal), Lisa Rapoport (PLANT Architect, Toronto), Annie Lebel (Atelier Insitu, Montreal) and Philip Beesley (Philip Beesley Architect, Toronto), presented a single project that was paradigmatic of their design process, and in this way revealed key considerations around the ideation, development and manifestation of architectural intentions. Taken as a whole, these intentions spoke of the interconnection of the following themes and sensibilities of contemporary architecture:

"It's led to a false crisis mentality that has been prevailing for the last 10 years."It became the foundation of Parks Canada's 15-year Banff Management Plan adopted in 1999. The management plan has seen the creation of wildlife corridors off-limits to people, increased use of prescribed fire, removal of non-native species of fish from Banff lakes and the closure of the Banff airstrip and bison paddock to facilitate animal movement through the Bow Valley near the Banff townsite.Kim Endres, executive director of the Association for Mountain Parks Protection and Enjoyment, which represents dozens of Banff businesses, said the association supports protecting Banff's environment but said the study didn't adequately consider" socio- economic" factors in Banff.

TI  - Animal movement in pelagic ecosystems: From communities to individuals
AU  - Schick, Robert S.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Infusing models for animal movement with more behavioral realism has been a goal of movement ecologists for several years. As ecologists have begun to collect more and more data on animal distribution and abundance, a clear need has arisen for more sophisticated analysis. Such analysis could include more realistic movement behavior, more information on the organism-environment interaction, and more ways to separate observation error from process error. Because landscape ecologists and behavioral ecologists typically study these same themes at very different scales, it has been proposed that their union could be productive for all (Lima and Zollner, 1996). By understanding how animals interact with their land- and seascapes, we can better understand how species partition up resources are large spatial scales. Accordingly I begin this dissertation with a large spatial scale analysis of distribution data for marine mammals from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico. I analyzed these data in three separate regions, and in the two data-rich regions, find compelling separation between the different communities. In the northernmost region, this separation is broadly along diet based partitions. This research provides a baseline for future study of marine mammal systems, and more importantly highlights several gaps in current data collections. In the last 6 years several movement ecologists have begun to imbue sophisticated statistical analyses with increasing amounts of movement behavior. This has changed the way movement ecologists think about movement data and movement processes. In this dissertation I focus my research on continuing this trend. I reviewed the state of movement modeling and then proposed a new Bayesian movement model that builds on three questions of: behavior; organism-environment interaction; and process-based inference with noisy data. Application of this model to two different datasets, migrating right whales in the NW Atlantic, and foraging monk seals in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, provides for the first time estimates of how moving animals make choices about the suitability of patches within their perceptual range. By estimating parameters governing this suitability I provide right whale managers a clear depiction of the gaps in their protection in this vulnerable and understudied migratory corridor. For monk seals I provide a behaviorally based view into how animals in different colonies and age and sex groups move throughout their range. This information is crucial for managers who translocate individuals to new habitat as it provides them a quantitative glimpse of how members of certain groups perceive their landscape. This model provides critical information about the behaviorally based movement choices animals make. Results can be used to understand the ecology of these patterns, and can be used to help inform conservation actions. Finally this modeling framework provides a way to unite fields of movement ecology and graph theory.

AB  - Most of sidewalks, especially in developing countries, are roled as public area with many social activities besides as the main function for serving pedestrian movement. Therefore, sidewalks may need some facilities to support user activities, namely benches, planting, including stalls for street vendors. The aims of this research is to evaluate pedestrian facilities in two different characteristic zone y.i. residential and business area in Yogyakarta city using Pedestrian Index (P-Index) method. The data are collected in KHA Dahlan-H Agus Salim-Kauman coridors, and Sudirman-Suroto coridors, that both coridors are considered residential and business area in downtown of Yogyakarta. Some variables are taken in to account, namely mobility, safety, facility, and accessibility. The results reveal that the pedestrian facilities are supportive towards pedestrians. The sidewalk in Sudirman-Suroto corridors are better in safety aspect, but must be improved.

TI  - Town missed opportunity on Petro Canada Trail

AB  - Being a life-long resident of Oakville, particularly in Bronte, I am very disappointed to learn of the decision of the Town of Oakville's decision to use, or should I say waste, $110,000 of tax payers' dollars, to put the Petro Canada Trail back to its original state. There is a stated concern about the impact on migratory songbirds and that these birds will leave the area, never to return. Further harm will come to these birds as they will have no where else to go. I note that development of the area, not only what occurred many years ago, but the recent development of the Lakeshore Woods residential area, has not affected the birds.  As far as the cutting of trees, I walk the Bronte trail system everyday with my dog (and yes, I do scoop). As far as I know, there were no mature trees cleared along the Petro Canada Trail. There was, however, much to my liking, a trail cleared through the forest on the west side of the corridor, so that the new community of Lakeshore Woods could also enjoy walks in the woods.

TI  - Behavior, ecology, and conservation of Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon
AU  - Hintz, William Dean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Large rivers are perhaps the most modified ecosystems worldwide.  Natural flow regimes, ecosystem connectivity, and habitat have been modified for human interests, and poor water quality has resulted from urban settlement and agricultural practices.  Subsequently, such changes have had deleterious effects on riverine biota and many endemic species are of critical conservation concern.  Due to the inter-jurisdictional nature and economic importance of large rivers, conservation efforts must be realistic and recognize human interests.  To reach that point, however, we must understand behavioral and ecological patterns and processes at multiple scales, to ensure conservation strategies are successful.    Fishes have been particularly affected by modifications to large rivers.  Further, freshwater roe fisheries around the world have overfished several species to the brink of extinction; among the most notable are sturgeon populations.  Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) and shovelnose sturgeon (S. platorynchus) are two species that occur in large rivers of the central United States.  Pallid sturgeon are primarily limited to the riverscapes of the Missouri and lower Mississippi Rivers, whereas shovelnose sturgeon are more widely distributed.  Pallid sturgeon are a federally endangered species in the United States and shovelnose sturgeon are federally threatened where they overlap in range with pallid sturgeon. Like other sturgeon species around the world, Scaphirhynchus sturgeon habitat has been modified and degraded by dams, extensive levee systems, and pollution.  To date, our understanding of habitat needs for Scaphirhynchus sturgeon—at multiple spatial scales—remains unknown.  Furthermore, basic behaviors, e.g. anti-predatory behavior or foraging behavior, have yet to be identified.    The goal of my dissertation was to fill knowledge gaps in Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon behavior, ecology, and conservation.  First, I identified a species-loss domino-effect, which may manifest from use of Similarity of Appearance Provisions in the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  The aim of the legislative action was to protect pallid sturgeon by closing the shovelnose sturgeon roe fishery where shovelnose overlap in range with pallid sturgeon (Chapter 1).  It was assumed that closing the shovelnose sturgeon roe fishery to prevent bycatch of pallid sturgeon would increase the number of reproductively viable females in the wild, thereby facilitating pallid sturgeon recovery.  However, I show that this response may have unintended consequences by diverting fishing effort to other economically viable species (e.g. paddlefish  Polyodon spathula) and increase poaching.  Further, I suggest that protecting the shovelnose sturgeon may increase the rate of hybridization and competitive interactions between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon.  I recommend such legislative action be followed by contingency plans for any unintended consequences and protections be ready for species which may experience diverted fishing effort.   Regarding sturgeon behavior, I used shovelnose sturgeon as a model species to test whether sturgeon exhibit predator avoidance behavior (Chapter 2), as predators, or interactions with predators, have strong regulatory effects on populations.  My experiment showed that shovelnose sturgeon do exhibit predator avoidance behavior when they encounter a catfish predator ( Ictalurus punctatus).  This was the first experiment to document such behavior in any sturgeon species and suggested that it was a learned, rather than an innate behavior.   The remaining chapters of my dissertation focus on the goals of elucidating the current status of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon and habitat selection at multiple spatial scales.  In Chapter 3, I estimated the population size of adult pallid sturgeon (N = 1,516) and shovelnose sturgeon (N = 82,336) in the free-flowing middle Mississippi River.  My estimates highlight the critical status of pallid sturgeon, and show that shovelnose sturgeon are faring comparatively well.  In the same study, I found both sturgeon species were most abundant at the downstream ends of alluvial islands.  I suggest restoration of alluvial islands, which were historically present in the Mississippi River, is a realistic goal to facilitate recovery of Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon.  Given pallid and shovelnose sturgeon were found in highest abundance around alluvial islands (Chapter 3), I wanted to understand the uniqueness of habitat surrounding alluvial islands (Chapter 4).  Hydroacoustic techniques were used to quantify the abiotic attributes, and variability in those attributes, around two alluvial island complexes.  At the same time, age-0 Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon were sampled to examine whether they used similar habitats as adults.  All sturgeon sampled were shovelnose sturgeon, but similar to Chapter 3, I found that the greatest abundance of age-0 sturgeon occurred at the downstream ends of the alluvial islands, particularly on the main channel side.  This area had intermediate variability in depth and velocity, and contained sand dunes.  I also found that vegetation was an important attribute of the islands, mostly when inundated by high spring flows.  I suggest that if island restoration is pursued, as in Chapter 3, abiotic attributes identified in Chapter 4 should be replicated.   Alluvial islands represent a coarse, albeit important, scale at which habitat is relevant to Scaphirhynchus sturgeon.  However, for several abiotic attributes and mesohabitats that affect habitat selection by sturgeon, it is difficult to elucidate their relevance at the individual scale due to high flows, turbidity, and depth of large riverscapes like those of the Mississippi River.  Therefore, carefully designed laboratory experiments are an alternative means of identifying pattern and process relevant to individuals.    Velocity is an important abiotic attribute that influences the distribution of individuals in lotic ecosystems (e.g., Chapter 4).  The goal of Chapter 5 was to evaluate how swimming behavior of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon was affected by velocity.  I designed an experiment to specifically test whether sturgeon swimming behavior evolved in a way that reduced the energetic cost of occupying river energy landscapes.  Further, a dynamic state variable model was developed to assess the optimal behavioral decision based on the expectation of food and energetic costs.  Both pallid and shovelnose sturgeon showed a tendency to occupy faster velocity, but their swimming behavior from the experiment was consistent with cost minimization.  The dynamic program revealed that the expectation of food and costs associated with the experimental energy landscape influenced the probability of a sturgeon moving upstream, downstream, or station holding.  It appears the suite of swimming behaviors exhibited by fluvial specialists like pallid and shovelnose sturgeon may have evolved to maximize net energy gain.  Lastly, I examined mesohabitat selection by age-0 Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon (Chapter 6).  Like velocity, substrates and other benthic structures can influence the distribution of individuals.  I tested selection of four common mesohabitat types nested within alluvial island complexes: 1) sand only substratum with no structure, 2) sand substratum with sand dune structure, 3) sand substratum with simulated vegetation, and 4) a gravel only substratum.  Sturgeon almost completely avoided gravel substrate and selected for the sand substratum, structure-less mesohabitat, followed by the mesohabitat with a sand dune.  Vegetated habitat retained less sturgeon than these two habitats but more than the gravel mesohabitat.  Scaled to the population level, the patterns revealed in Chapter 6 could have implications for the macro-distribution of both species.   In summary, I hope that the illustration of a species-loss domino-effect will be considered in the conservation of threatened and endangered species.  The issue of diverted effort, in particular, must be recognized when species are protected in a limited fashion to prevent or anticipate harvest cascading to other valuable and/or vulnerable species.  We must also consider acquiring basic knowledge of sturgeon behavior if we are to understand how best to conserve them.  Herein, the identification of predator avoidance behavior in shovelnose sturgeon suggests that predators in the wild may have regulatory effects on the distribution of young sturgeon.  I also identified how  Scaphirhynchus sturgeon—behaviorally—navigate large river velocity landscapes.  Such contributions regarding sturgeon behavior have largely gone undescribed—I hope the present work will provide a framework for future ethological study.  Lastly, my work has implications for the rehabilitation of large, sand-dominated rivers.  Specifically, my research suggests the restoration of alluvial islands in the free-flowing Mississippi River will contribute to the recovery of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon.  Restoration efforts should be mindful, though, of 1) the attributes that retain sturgeon, 2) habitat selection at multiple scales, and 3) selection differences among species at various scales.  These considerations will assist in facilitating the success of large-river conservation programs.

AB  - ``The montane is basically the road map to environmental conflict in Alberta,'' says Harvey Locke, a local lawyer who's president of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the last five years, environment groups have ferociously, and successfully, fought the latest surge in development in wildlife-rich montane regions such as Wind Valley, Westcastle and the Whaleback.A proposed nine-hole golf course at the Banff Springs Hotel and a new subdivision that the town of Banff wants to build would be in the heart of the montane, says Locke. The other major issue, is closing the Banff airstrip, a move promised in the last Banff management plan but never done. The airstrip is in a wildlife movement corridor, he says.Last September, the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) refused a proposal by Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. to drill an exploratory well in the Whaleback, a montane area 120 kilometres south of Calgary with ridges resembling a whale skeleton. An Amoco spokesman argued at a hearing into the proposed well that there is lots of montane left in Alberta with areas such as Banff and Waterton Lakes National Park.

TI  - "Near-by Nature": A Logical Framework for Building Integrated Agriculture
AU  - Plyler, William
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Building Integrated Agriculture (BIA) aims to reduce the environmental footprint of food production and to improve the human condition. BIA places food producing plants into the everyday working/living environment. This study explored the intersection of the diverse BIA requirements (human, plant, and building) as established by the relevant literature from various disciplines. Kaplan (1992), and Ulrich (1984; 1986; 1992) established the restorative physiological and psychological effects of plants in non-natural settings. Kaplan deemed these settings “Near-by Nature.” In building interiors, “Near-by Nature” is achieved through interiorscaping, a design practice that incorporates plant, building and occupant requirements.This study specifically investigated the implications of considering Building Integrated Agriculture as “Near-by Nature” while allowing for the diverse environmental requirements of the plants and building occupants. The environmental requirements considered were light, temperature and relative humidity. A synthesis of the requirements was applied to two theoretical redesigns of the Honors College dormitory at West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV.This study used a design research approach and fell into the category of design phenomenology. A logical argumentation approach (Groat & Wang, 2002) was used to establish a framework of “Near-by Nature” in the context of interiorscapes. Analog simulation modeling was used to test the “Near-by Nature” structure in the context of BIA (Groat & Wang, 2002).Analysis of interiorscape images was used to establish the structural framework of “Nearby-Nature”. Required crop yields were established using the U.S. Food Market Estimator developed by the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture. The existing baseline building and modified BIA version was modeled using Autodesk Revit 2011 software. Photorealistic images of the modified building with approximated crops provided the means to evaluate “Near-by Nature”.There were two interiorscape categories: those that facilitate movement and those that provide a place for gathering. The “Near-by Nature” framework had three technical terms: pace, distinct and contrast. The framework was combined with the Honors Hall dormitory and crop production requirements. The existing dormitory was found unsuitable to provide “Near-by Nature and plant production. Concept ‘A’ was developed to facilitate movement. The result was an increased occupancy and Gross Square Footage. The vegetables crops created rhythm and established landmarks along the corridors. Concept ‘B’ was developed to provide a space for gathering. The result was a decreased occupancy but an increased Gross square footage. The vegetable crops generated rhythm, created a sense of enclosure and controlled vistas. This study established a framework for designing “Near-by Nature”, developed parameters for further research and design investigations of BIA.

T2  - Autonomous Robots
AB  - In our project on the autonomous guidance of Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs) in confined indoor and outdoor environments, we have developed a vision based autopilot, with which a miniature hovercraft travels along a corridor by automatically controlling both its speed and its clearance from the walls. A hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural roll and pitch stabilization characteristics, in which planar flight control systems can be developed conveniently. Our hovercraft is fully actuated by two rear and two lateral thrusters. It travels at a constant altitude (∼2 mm) and senses the environment by means of two lateral eyes that measure the right and left optic flows (OFs). The visuo-motor control system, which is called LORA III (Lateral Optic flow Regulation Autopilot, Mark III), is a dual OF regulator consisting of two intertwined feedback loops, each of which has its own OF set-point and controls the vehicle’s translation in one degree of freedom (surge or sway). Our computer-simulated experiments show that the hovercraft can navigate along a straight or tapered corridor at a relatively high speed (up to 1 m/s). It also reacts to any major step perturbations in the lateral OF (provided by a moving wall) and to any disturbances caused by a tapered corridor. The minimalistic visual system (comprised of only 4 pixels) suffices for the hovercraft to be able to control both its clearance from the walls and its forward speed jointly, without ever measuring speed and distance. The non-emissive visual sensors and the simple control system developed here are suitable for use on MAVs with a permissible avionic payload of only a few grams. This study also accounts quantitatively for previous ethological findings on honeybees flying freely in a straight or tapered corridor.

TI  - A complex systems approach to dynamic spatial simulation modeling: LandUse and LandCover change in the Ecuadorian Amazon
AU  - Messina, Joseph Paul
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Ecuadorian Amazon, lying in the headwaters of the Napo and Aguarico River valleys, is experiencing rapid change in LandUse and LandCover (LULC) conditions and regional landscape diversity uniquely tied to spontaneous agricultural colonization and oil exploration. Beginning in the early 1970s, spontaneous colonization occurred on squattered lands located adjacent to oil company roads and in government development sectors composed of multiple 50 ha land parcels organized into “piano key” shaped family farms or fincas. Since  fincas are managed at the household level as spatially discrete, temporally independent units, land conversion at the finca-level is recognized as the chief proximate cause of deforestation within the region. Focusing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and plant succession at the finca-level, and urbanization at the community-level, cell-based morphogenetic models of LandUse and LandCover Change (LULCC) were developed as the foundation for predictive models of regional LULCC dynamics and landscape diversity. Two cellular automata models were developed and used to integrate biophysical, geographical, and social variables to characterize temporally dynamic landscapes. The human, geographical, and biophysical dimensions of land use and land cover change were examined, specifically deforestation, anthropogenic extensification, and reforestation. Remotely-sensed data ranging temporally from the 1970s through 1999, combined with thematic map coverages of biophysical gradients and geographical accessibility, were linked to household and community survey data collected in 1990 and 1999. Image processing techniques for LULC characterization and spatial analyses of landscape structure were used to assess the rate and nature of LULCC throughout the time-series. In addition, LULC and LULCC associated with secondary plant succession and agricultural extensification were assessed and simulated for specific landscape strata and study area locations related to development corridors along transportation networks and expanding urban environments. The presented research combines household survey data with biophysical and geographical data through a spatio-temporal modeling context that links complexity theory and landscape ecology to a GIS and remote sensing analytical framework to increase the understanding of landscape dynamics across time, space, and landscape strata.

T2  - Frontiers in Marine Science
AB  - The supply of ecosystem services (ES) that benefit humanity are derived from multiple, interacting ecological functions and processes. Focusing on the ecological mechanisms that underpin ES delivery allows bundles of services to be identified, bridging a critical gap with management. Work in marine systems has not yet progressed to the identification of ES bundles, as a result of data scarcity and complications arising from system complexity and connectivity, as opposed to terrestrial systems where ES bundles have been more widely applied based on spatial clustering. To demonstrate the approach, identification of ES bundles provided by shellfish is used as a case-study. Shellfish provide a number of known ES that need to be strategically managed to ensure sustainable use. As a result of global degradations in shellfish beds ES have been lost, and restoration efforts emphasize the importance in regaining these services. A literature review, including 146 papers aimed specifically at linking shellfish to either ecosystem functions or ecosystem services, was conducted to establish key linkages between processes, functions and services. Based on co-occurrence of services and shared linkages, four bundles of services are identified, including Marine resources, Coastal health and quality, Habitat modification, and Biological structuring. Our study emphasizes the underpinning ecological mechanisms and the importance of interactions between services, expressed in the formation of bundles by mutual drivers and processes, as well as between services in different bundles, as either synergies or trade-offs. The approach enables the translation of ecological knowledge and creates generality to inform policy making and management, thereby providing a format useful for ecologists, managers and other stakeholders.

AB  - His 25-year "Move Mississauga" transit plan is not as far-reaching as [Bonnie Crombie]'s. [Steve Mahoney] focuses on connectivity to the city's employment bases, with most of his proposed rapid transit expansion aimed at getting people who live in Mississauga and beyond to existing office hubs (such as the Pearson airport area and the Meadowvale business park) and future employment areas to be developed along transit corridors.Like Crombie, Mahoney supports the already planned Hurontario LRT. But unlike his opponent's plan for LRT or bus rapid transit lines, Mahoney is proposing five high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) corridors: three east-west ones along Dundas St., Burnhamthorpe Rd. and Eglinton Ave.; and two north-south ones along Erin Mills Pkwy. and Hurontario St. HOV access will be during peak traffic periods and buses will also use the lanes. He's also proposing a 20-kilometre rapid northern rail link along Hwy. 401 between the airport corporate centre and the Meadowvale business park, with one stop in between on the planned Hurontario LRT line. The line would link to SmartTrack, the GO-rail-based transit plan proposed by Toronto mayoral candidate John Tory.Crombie will also support "Inspiration Lakeview, " the development of the waterfront lands on the site of the old Lakeview coal-fired power generation plant. She wants to follow that plan's blueprint to create a new community on more than 40 hectares of land along Lake Ontario. She will create a Mississauga waterfront task force, which, unlike Toronto's waterfront body, will not be a development corporation, avoiding what Crombie calls unnecessary bureaucracy and costs. She would also like to redevelop the Imperial Oil lands just north of the lake at the corner of Mississauga Rd. and Lakeshore Rd.

AB  - SAHA began by performing environmental audits of its hostels, noting where each one was meeting or falling short of the IYHF standards in each of these categories. SAHA also developed a list of short-, mid- and long-term actions that will reduce the hostels  impact on the environment of Banff park and help reduce visitors  impact as well. Karen Alexander, the Lake Louise hostel's person responsible for the environmental initiative, notes the hostel recently began using a worm-composting system to reduce organic waste (park regulations regarding feeding of animals make conventional composting almost impossible). The hostel also recycles all materials currently accepted in the town of Banff (and pays to have them shipped there), and regularly sets up car pools for the organized day hikes offered. In June 1997, an ecotourism management student studied the hostels on a three week work placement, offering suggestions and addressing the concerns of each hostel manager.One of the most ambitious biodiversity preservation programs in North America is the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) project, a coalition of over 80 groups in Canada and the United States. Y2Y s plan is to build and maintain a life-sustaining series of key protected reserves and connecting wildlife movement corridors, using  informed advocacy and science with a mission,  in the words of Banff Y2Y member Bart Robinson, to accomplish this goal. This 1.2 million square kilometre area includes all four mountain parks plus many Alberta and British Columbia provincial parks, private lands and crown lands.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis is rapidly emerging in Canada, and climate change is likely a key driver of the northern spread of the disease in North America. We used field and modeling approaches to predict the risk of occurrence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria causing Lyme disease in North America. We combined climatic and landscape variables to model the current and future (2050) potential distribution of the black‐legged tick and the white‐footed mouse at the northeastern range limit of Lyme disease and estimated a risk index for B. burgdorferi from these distributions. The risk index was mostly constrained by the distribution of the white‐footed mouse, driven by winter climatic conditions. The next factor contributing to the risk index was the distribution of the black‐legged tick, estimated from the temperature. Landscape variables such as forest habitat and connectivity contributed little to the risk index. We predict a further northern expansion of B. burgdorferi of approximately 250–500 km by 2050 – a rate of 3.5–11 km per year – and identify areas of rapid rise in the risk of occurrence of B. burgdorferi. Our results will improve understanding of the spread of Lyme disease and inform management strategies at the most northern limit of its distribution.

TI  - The utility of digital aerial surveys in censusing Dipteryx panamensis, the key food and nesting tree of the endangered great green macaw (Ara ambigua) in Costa Rica
AU  - Chun, Sara L. M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Remote sensing technologies offer an innovative way to study tropical forests and complement research from forest inventory plots. From a logistic standpoint, remote sensing mitigates some of the physical, political, and economic challenges that complicate terrestrial studies of tropical forests. From a biological standpoint, remotely sensed data can elucidate ecological phenomena and dynamics of tropical forests that may be challenging to observe on the ground. I conducted a digital aerial survey during the peak blooming period for Dipteryx panamensis. D. panamensis is a canopy-emergent, keystone tree species within the lowland Atlantic forests of Costa Rica. The aerial survey occurred over Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge, which is situated in the proposed San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor. Maquenque was decreed in 2005 to protect the last breeding habitat for the endangered Great Green Macaw (Ara ambigua) in Costa Rica. The Great Green Macaw depends on D. panamensis as its primary food and nesting resource. However, because of Costa Rica's complex deforestation history, the Great Green Macaw remains imperiled due to habitat fragmentation, degradation, and loss. Only 25 to 35 breeding pairs and 250 individuals likely persist in the country. My research had three main objectives. First, I evaluated a classification technique that capitalized on the unique spectral signature of blooming D. panamensis in order to detect this species using a pattern recognition approach. Second, I determined the landscape density and distribution of this tree species using results from the aerial survey and classification. I also noted environmental factors predicting potential  D. panamensis habitat using a classification and regression tree (CART) model, and I subsequently calculated how much potential habitat exists in Costa Rica. Third, I identified environmental conditions that indicate potential breeding habitat for the Great Green Macaw using a CART model, and I calculated how much potential breeding habitat exists in Costa Rica. Results of the classification work indicate that D. panamensis can be identified based on its unique spectral signature. In particular, the IHS (intensity, hue, saturation) color space was effective at resolving this tree. Results of the density analysis suggest that canopy-emergent D. panamensis  trees occur at densities as high as 2 trees/hectare. This work demonstrates that D. panamensis exists in denser patches than previously determined from forest inventory plots. Environmental conditions that will support high densities of D. panamensis habitat occur between 45 and 125 meters in elevation and on soil with an acid and clay profile. Nearly 240,000 hectares could support high density patches of D. panamensis  in Costa Rica. Potential Great Green Macaw breeding habitat is defined by the density of D. panamensis trees within its 550-hectare breeding territory. Approximately 67,000 hectares of Great Green Macaw breeding territory exist in Costa Rica. Ultimately, the conservation of both  D. panamensis and the Great Green Macaw in Costa Rica may require a multinational partnership between Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have a global distribution, but the population inhabiting the Gulf of California (GoC) is thought to be geographically and genetically isolated. However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either “area-restricted searching” (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or “transiting” (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean = 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean = 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale’s return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.

TI  - Spatial community structure and epidemics
AU  - Sarzynska, Marta
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Networks are a useful quantitative representation for complex systems of interacting entities arising in fields such as biological, physical and social sciences. A network representation provides a degree of simplification while capturing key connectivity patterns. This thesis focuses on two main themes: the study of community structure, an important mesoscopic feature of many networks, and its application to study spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases. Community detection seeks to partition a network into dense sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other dense sets. The notion of denseness is often relative to some "null model" that describes baseline connectivity that can be construed to occur randomly. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss the incorporation of spatial information into null models for community detection. We develop a spatial null model based on the radiation model of mobility. We test different spatial null models using static and temporal (multilayer) spatial benchmarks with planted partitions that represent interactions between human populations. Our results indicate that it is important to incorporate spatial information into null models for community detection, but it is best to incorporate only relevant information into null models, as extraneous information can lower performance. In the second part of the thesis, we present the results of community detection with different null models on disease-correlation networks generated form real and synthetic time series of disease occurrence. We use data sets for endemic diseases (established in a region, with occasional epidemic outbreaks) and emerging diseases (newly-discovered or introduced into a region for the first time). We study the spatial and temporal organization of partitions. Finally, we apply community detection with different null models to synthetic time series generated from an agent-based model (ABM) simulating the spread of endemic and emerging diseases between spatially-embedded cities with a planted, transport-based community structure. We compare the findings on real and synthetic data sets, and we searched for model parameter regimes in which we are able to detect planted partitions or other interesting communities. For emerging diseases, we find spatial communities that are associated with the first times the infection reached a node in both ABM and disease data. For endemic diseases, we are unable to find planted or spatial communities in the ABM data, but we detect spatial communities for two of the three disease data sets. For these diseases, we also detect temporal communities corresponding to some of the important time points in disease history. We hope that these results show that community structure of disease correlation networks appears to be more complicated than simple spatial patterns and is a fascinating topic to study.

TI  - Determination of Sustainability of Aloe Harvesting Empowerment Project in the Emnambithi (Former Ladysmith) Municipality, Kwazulu Natal
AU  - Ross, Donnette
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Ladysmith is a town situated on the banks of the Klip River in the uThukela District of KwaZulu Natal, and falls into the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality. The labour force of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality makes up 32.48 % of the population within the municipality, of which 16.49 % are employed, and 15.99 % are unemployed. A further 22.21 % of the total population in the municipality are not economically active, i.e. are students, homemakers, disabled, too ill to work, or are not seeking work.In an effort to address the poverty within KwaZulu Natal, the Department of Economic Development initiated a process which identified potential poverty-relieving initiatives and proposed to further investigate these development projects to establish which of the identified alternatives would be most feasible and beneficial to target communities. The areas where the poor communities are situated were identified based on the potential ability of the community to be able to support the required infrastructure investment and product development, which were in turn focussed on emerging economic growth points and development corridors (DEAT, 2001). One of the communities identified which could potentially benefit from one of the proposed development projects was that of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality, in KwaZulu Natal. Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality appointed a consultant to compile a Local Economic Regeneration Study for Ladysmith and the rural communities of the locality. The Study is aimed at analysing the local economy and thereby finding economic strategies that will make optimum use of local resources to create sustainable job opportunities and means of redressing economic challenges such as retrenchment and unemployment. A significant component of the Study is the identification of projects, which promote local ownership, local jobs and local reinvestment and illustrate the potential to revitalise the local economy of Emnambithi (Urban Econ, 2005). One of the alternative potentially sustainable poverty relief proposals put forward by the consultants, and other relevant parties, was that of harvesting the plant parts of the Aloes which appeared to be abundant within the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality area. It was proposed that an Aloe pre-processing factory be established in a suitable location, which would provide employment opportunities for the local poor communities, who would either be directly employed by the pre-processing factory, or would be appropriately trained to harvest the required raw material from the natural Aloe populations. Similar operations have been initiatedin the Southern and Eastern Cape by formal sector businesses, which produce products made from Aloe ferox, which are then either sold locally or exported. The sustainability of the harvesting of these plants was determined based on the number of leaves which can be harvested per day by a tapper. It was possible to determine that the Aloe marlothii populations within the study area will not be able to support the harvesting of leaves, and as such, the harvesting thereof will not be sustainable.Several recommendations have been made which will further refine the results of this project. The main shortfall of this study was the limitation of the study area by political boundaries.

TI  - Efficient message dissemination framework for diverse wireless networks
AU  - Khalid, Osman
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wireless networks exhibit diversity, ranging from mostly disconnected delay tolerant networks and partially connected mobile ad hoc networks, to mostly connected cellular networks. Besides having useful applications, including, vehicular communications, emergency response networks, battlefield networks, and wildlife monitoring, wireless networks face numerous challenges, such as unreliable connectivity, bandwidth restrictions, interference, frequent disruptions and delays, power outages, message loss, and malicious attacks. Moreover, when nodes are mobile, communication may be disrupted frequently for longer time periods. Designing protocols to tolerate such disruptions is challenging because of the extreme uncertainty in mobile wireless environments. Most of the existing approaches either require exact knowledge about future connectivity schedules, or perform message flooding in an attempt to improve message delivery rate. However, message flooding results in an increased overhead and loss of messages in resource constrained environments. Moreover, it is almost impossible to acquire precise future contact schedules in real-life scenarios.The goal of this dissertation is to architect robust protocols that overcome disruptions and enable applications in diverse wireless networks. We propose a suite of protocols for wireless environments where nodes transfer messages during opportunistic contacts. To conserve resources, the protocols control flooding by autonomously adapting to the changing network conditions, to find optimal temporal routes between source and destination nodes. Moreover, the dissertation presents novel approaches that utilize time-series forecasting on nodes' contact patterns. Such routing schemes learn from nodes' temporal contacts and mobility patterns, and forecasts the future contact opportunities among the nodes. By making precise predictions about future contacts, messages are forwarded to only those nodes that increase the message delivery likelihood. Simulation results proved that the proposed routing framework can be efficiently utilized in many real-life applications to disseminate delay tolerant data, such as electronic newspapers, weather forecasts, movie trailers, emergency information, and travel routes information in various parts of a city. The dissertation also proposes a novel application for mobile social networks that generates real-time recommendation of venues for a group of mobile users. The proposed framework utilizes Ant colony algorithm, social filtering, and hub and authority scores on the users' contextual information to produce optimal recommendations.

AB  - City councillors withheld approval last week for a subdivision agreement at Sheldon Place on 4th Avenue West over neighbours' concerns about trees being removed. The construction off of 3rd Street A West follows similar development of 13 lots to the north, completing a subdivision plan approved more than 10 years ago.It is one of the last sites available for infill housing in the city, developer Barry Krusselbrink said in an interview Monday. Among the busiest new home builders in Owen Sound in recent years, Krusselbrink said there's abundant demand for the 1,300 to 2,500 square foot houses he expects to build in the Sheldon Place neighbourhood.One long-term resident of the area who attended Monday's meeting was critical of council's concerns about trees. A resident of the area for 45 years, Freida Marsh described several of the existing trees as "stagnant, one-sided branch trees" in an area once known as "the PUC corridor."

TI  - Study on the relationship between the damage of callosciurus erythraeus and landscape pattern and human activities in artificial forest in hongya sichuan
AU  - Wang, Ying
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorCallosciurus erythraeus, also called red-bellied squirrel, belongs to Rodentia, Sciuridae and Callosciurus. During recent years, red-bellied squirrels(Callosciurus erythraeus) have made great damage to artificial forests in some regions of Sichuan by debarking trees, mainly including Crypotomeria fortunei and Cunninghami lanceolata. The debarking of Callosciurus erythraeus influences badly on trees' normal growth, and even causes trees dead. Hongya County of Sichuan has suffered from Callosciurus erythraeus damage for many years, which has become the premier forest diseases and pests of Hongya. In order to find out the relationship between Callosciurus erythraeus damage and the environment, and to explore the reason for squirrel damage, we have conducted 240 samples in Yupingshan Mountain and Caoyutan Village of Hongya from March to April in 2009. Based on the information of these samples, we studied the relationship between the damage and habitat factors in different aged forest respectively. Besides, by combing remote sense, GIS techniques and landscape pattern analysis software (Fragstates Version 3.3), we studied the characteristics of landscape patterns of the damaged regions in Hongya according to landscape metrics. We analyzed the fundamental information of Callosciurus erythraeus damage of the whole county which was provided by local forestry department, and the results showed that squirrel damage occurred in 12 towns of Hongya which governs 15 towns in total, and mostly distributed over Yuping Mountain District, Bamian Mountain District, Muchan Mountain District, Panjiaozui District. There are a significant positive correlation between each town's damaged forest area rate and it's population density(r=0.623, P<0.05) and a very significant negative correlation between each town's damaged forest area rate and it's percentage of forest cover(r=-0.762, P<0.01). The research on the landscape patterns of mainly damaged regions showed that: ⑴ the CLUMPY and COHESION of warm coniferous forest patch type in severely damaged areas and less severely damaged areas are not very different, which indicates that the damage degree of an area has no necessary connection with the clumpiness and connectivity of warm coniferous forest patch; ⑵ the fragmentation of severely damaged areas is a little higher compared to the less severely damaged areas and the area propotion of farmland and shrub patch types in severely damaged areas is larger than in less severely damaged areas. We supposed that when the warm coniferous forest patches are more fragmented and there is a larger propotion of farmland and shrub in a region, it will be more difficulty for the squirrels to transfer to another patch when they face the lack of food, so they are more inclined to debark trees repeatedly in the same patch, which results in more severe damage;⑶ for the whole landscape level, CONTAG (contagion index) of severely damaged areas is a little smaller than the less severely damaged areas, and SHDI(Shannon's Diversity Index) is a little larger compared to less severely damaged areas. It indicated that the distribution of different patch types in severely damaged areas was more mixed, and the heterogeneity of these areas are also a little higher. By studying the relationship between the squirrel damage in different aged coniferous forests and the habitat factors, we found that: ⑴ In mature forests and middle aged and young forests, three habitat factors(slope aspect, slope degree and whether Crypotomeria fortunei and Cunninghami lanceolata are mix-planted or not) is likely to have relations with the damage occurrence;⑵ In mature forests, the trees with high coverage is more easily damaged by Callosciurus erythraeus; in the middle aged and young forest, however, the coverage factor showed no significant difference between the damaged samples and undamaged samples. And It is the same case for another habitat factor distance from water;⑶ the two human disturbance factors(distance from residence and distance from road) have some influence on the squirrel damage of the middle aged and young forests, but the influence in the mature forests are not significant. We believed that the human activities' influence on the squirrel damage to coniferous trees will become much limited as the trees grow into

AU  - van den Berg Jacob

T2  - Probability Theory and Related Fields
AB  - We introduce a new percolation model on planar lattices. First, impurities (“holes”) are removed independently from the lattice. On the remaining part, we then consider site percolation with some parameter p close to the critical value pc. The mentioned impurities are not only microscopic, but allowed to be mesoscopic (“heavy-tailed”, in some sense). For technical reasons (the proofs of our results use quite precise bounds on critical exponents in Bernoulli percolation), our study focuses on the triangular lattice. We determine explicitly the range of parameters in the distribution of impurities for which the connectivity properties of percolation remain of the same order as without impurities, for distances below a certain characteristic length. This generalizes a celebrated result by Kesten for classical near-critical percolation (which can be viewed as critical percolation with single-site impurities). New challenges arise from the potentially large impurities. This generalization, which is also of independent interest, turns out to be crucial to study models of forest fires (or epidemics). In these models, all vertices are initially vacant, and then become occupied at rate 1. If an occupied vertex is hit by lightning, which occurs at a very small rate ζ, its entire occupied cluster burns immediately, so that all its vertices become vacant. Our results for percolation with impurities are instrumental in analyzing the behavior of these forest fire models near and beyond the critical time (i.e. the time after which, in a forest without fires, an infinite cluster of trees emerges). In particular, we prove (so far, for the case when burnt trees do not recover) the existence of a sequence of “exceptional scales” (functions of ζ). For forests on boxes with such side lengths, the impact of fires does not vanish in the limit as ζ↘0. This surprising behavior, related to the non-monotonicity of these processes, was not predicted in the physics literature.

AB  - The bylaw will create an area structure plan for a nine-hectare portion of Sulphur Mountain where council, through its municipal housing authority, wants to build as many as 350 residential units -- duplexes, rowhouses and apartments. The homes would be owned jointly by their occupants and the town.Council proposes separating the housing and corridor with a buffer zone up to 100 metres wide and a 1.2-metre-high fence to ensure local residents and domesticated animals are kept away from wildlife. Wolves, lynx and cougars have been spotted there.

AB  - I realize that some people think that this is just another government money grab; however, in the corridor from Windsor to Quebec City where car emissions are a real problem, something has to be done. I hope that Cornwall's city council remembers that bus transportation, especially with their special natural gas-powered buses, is much better for the environment than cars being driven to work with one occupant.The one that I am interested in is our native Highbush Cranberry. It is very important to only plant the native one because the imported, which only experts can tell apart, is of no interest to the birds. In fact, if you see a Highbush Cranberry with berries still hanging from it, you'll know it is not the native one.You can help them by planting such plants as Bee Balm, Black- eyed Susan, Cardinal Flower, clovers, Cosmos, Lupines, Mallows, Mints and Sunflowers.

TI  - Robust algorithms for estimating vehicle movement from motion sensors within smartphones
AU  - Ustun, Ilyas
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Building sustainable traffic control solutions for urban streets (e.g., eco-friendly signal control) and highways requires effective and reliable sensing capabilities for monitoring traffic flow conditions so that both the temporal and spatial extents of congestion are observed. This would enable optimal control strategies to be implemented for maximizing efficiency and for minimizing the environmental impacts of traffic. Various types of traffic detection systems, such as inductive loops, radar, and cameras have been used for these purposes. However, these systems are limited, both in scope and in time. Using GPS as an alternative method is not always viable because of problems such as urban canyons, battery depletion, and precision errors. In this research, a novel approach has been taken, in which smartphone low energy sensors (such as the accelerometer) are exploited. The ubiquitous use of smartphones in everyday life, coupled with the fact that they can collect, store, compute, and transmit data, makes them a feasible and inexpensive alternative to the mainstream methods. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop models that are able to classify vehicle movement and to detect the stop and start points during a trip. Classifiers such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, classification trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and Hidden Markov models have been tested. Hidden Markov models substantially outperformed all the other methods. The feature quality plays a key role in the success of a model. It was found that, the features which exploited the variance of the data were the most effective. In order to assist in quantifying the performance of the machine learning models, a performance metric called Change Point Detection Performance Metric (CPDPM) was developed. CPDPM proved to be very useful in model evaluation in which the goal was to find the change points in time series data with high accuracy and precision. The integration of accelerometer data, even in the motion direction, yielded an estimated speed with a steady slope, because of factors such as phone sensor bias, vibration, gravity, and other white noise. A calibration method was developed that makes use of the predicted stop and start points and the slope of integrated accelerometer data, which achieves great accuracy in estimating speed. The developed models can serve as the basis for many applications. One such field is fuel consumption and CO2 emission estimation, in which speed is the main input. Transportation mode detection can be improved by integrating speed information. By integrating Vehicle (Phone) to Infrastructure systems (V2I), the model outputs, such as the stop and start instances, average speed along a corridor, and queue length at an intersection, can provide useful information for traffic engineers, planners, and decision makers.

TI  - Juvenile coho salmon habitat utilization and distribution in a suburban watershed: The Salmon River (Langley, British Columbia)
AU  - Giannico, Guillermo Roberto
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I investigated juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) distribution and habitat utilization in an agricultural/urban watershed, the Salmon River, Langley, B.C. The results of my empirical work confirmed the importance of instream woody debris and undercut banks in coho distribution. I examined experimentally how juvenile coho select among patches that differ in foraging profitability and in cover availability. Ideal free distribution (IFD) models were used as the practical basis for hypotheses about habitat choice by coho salmon. My experiments were conducted in artificial stream channels and involved two different types of cover, instream and overhead, and two spatial scales. The two scales (patches within individual pools and pools within stream reaches) were used to detect the effect of different levels of sampling and information processing by the fish. Juvenile coho responded positively to food abundance both within and between pools, but they did not do it as predicted by the IFD model. Cover presence further deviated coho distribution from an IFD. Within pools, coho foraged in open patches away from cover, but preferred pools with cover when choosing between separate units. None of the alternative dispersion models that I considered, derived from the IFD, fully explained the observed dispersion patterns. Coho's ability to maximize food intake rate was not only affected by the physical complexity of their habitat, but also by intraspecific competition and interference. Subsequently, I investigated experimentally coho's response to food and different densities of woody debris in natural stream reaches. If food was abundant, coho favoured pools with sparse cover, which offers accessible refuge and leaves unobstructed foraging patches where prey and perhaps also predators are easy to detect. Pools with either high densities or total lack of woody debris attracted to proportionately less fish. Earlier in the summer, fry were indifferent towards cover, but as they became older their association with instream woody debris increased. Experiments I conducted during winter indicated that velocity and temperature affected juvenile coho downstream movement. The proportion of fish that tried to leave the experimental channel increased with water discharge and decreased with water temperature.Based on the results of my empirical and experimental work, and on information derived from comparative case studies, I evaluated the potential impact of agriculture and urbanization on coho salmon habitat. Activities associated with these types of land developments tend to: (a) reduce stream channel complexity; (b) eliminate off-channel fish habitat; (c) increase both the magnitude and the frequency of peak flows; (d) augment water sediment transport; (e) alter riparian vegetation; and, (f) degrade water quality.A multilayered management plan, aimed at increasing coho salmon production, was developed. The plan's management strategies were devised reflecting on the different spatial scales that watershed components have and on the connectivity processes that exist among them.

AB  - Challenges faced by the recent logistic industry in India The most essential challenge faced by the industry today is insufficient integration of transport networks, information technology and warehousing & distribution facilities. The disorganized nature of the logistics sector in India, its perception as a manpower-heavy industry and lack of adequate training institutions has led to a shortfall in skilled management and client service personnel. Solutions to some of the challenges Infrastructure is the backbone of every country's growth and prosperity and for the logistics industry to flourish special emphasis has to be on building world-class road networks, integrated rail corridors, modern cargo facilities at airports and creation of logistics parks which need to be given a status equivalent to Special Economic Zones.

TI  - Flight characteristics of non-migrating and migrating populations of turkey vultures
AU  - Arrington, David Patrick
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Flight altitude characteristics of non-migrating turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) were examined in Indiana and Ohio for future incorporation into aircraft/bird avoidance models. Vultures spent 74.3% of the day perched and 25.7% in flight. Of time in flight, 97.4% was at or below 151m (500 ft) above ground level (AGL), corroborating previous studies suggesting these birds fly primarily at low altitudes for foraging efficiency and energy conservation, even when available dynamic lift would allow flight at much higher altitudes. There was no significant difference in altitude band selection among 3 sites separated by >200km, demonstrating that altitude modeling is possible. Correlating weather variables with altitude selection proved difficult; regression analysis yielded mixed results, forcing a simplistic altitude model concept. Turkey vultures do not move randomly across the landscape, but remain within annual home ranges that target specific habitat types. Average home range size for 3 separate populations from 1996–1998 ranged from 149km 2 at NPBRS (Ohio site) to 627km2 at CNSWC (south-central Indiana site); associated embedded 90% Kernel values for the same locations were 20km2 and 170km2. Turkey vultures spent 77.7% of the day perched in or flying over wooded habitat and spent much less time in other available habitats—agriculture (15.4%), landfills (6.1%), urban (0.6%) and wetlands (0.1%). Observations, averaged for each site, showed that the majority of movements within home ranges were within 15km of the primary roost—NPBRS (99%), PRFWA (97%), and CNSWC (92%). Data demonstrated that turkey vulture movements around primary roost sites could be modeled for inclusion into existing U.S. Air Force bird avoidance procedures. However, identification of primary roost sites within boundaries of low-level flight corridors is necessary to complete this task. Satellite data were collected on 2 turkey vultures (1 immature and 1 adult) captured at the National Plum Brook Research Station, Ohio. Two additional birds tagged at Pigeon River Fish and Wildlife Area failed to provide data. The immature bird provided 107 locations and 7 migration movements; 5 of the 7 movements (71%) were associated with a weather-front passage. The bird migrated 289km southwest, and settled in spring in an area 211 km south of the initial trapping location. The mature bird provided 93 locations and 15 migration movements; 12 of the 15 movements (80%) were associated with a weather-front passage. The bird migrated 1287km southeast and returned to the trapping area <3 months later. The flight altitude and habitat association data on these birds proved unreliable. In order to attain critical flight altitude and habitat preference data, future bird avoidance research of migrating turkey vultures should utilize global positioning systems.

TI  - Parks and other heritage areas in Ontario's countryside
AU  - Beechey, Tom
AU  - McLeod, Angus
T2  - Environments
AB  - As used in this paper, the terminology "parks and other heritage areas", or simply "heritage areas", corresponds generally with the definition for "protected areas" used by the World Conservation Union's Commission on National Parks and Protected Areas (IUCN/CNPPA). Essentially parks and heritage areas include all areas protected by legal or customary means "to fulfil private, local, national and international responsibilities in marine and terrestrial protection; and to recognize, protect and present, both directly and indirectly, places which are significant examples of the world's heritage in ways that encourage public understanding, appreciation, enjoyment and use of this heritage in a sustainable manner". (TFC/CNPPA 1990).The evolution of this heritage estate, now combined with new ideas in conservation biology, landscape ecology and ecosystem management, is forcing recognition of the need to take a more comprehensive systemic view of the design and protection of parks and heritage areas. The ideas of representation and integrity, as promoted by the Canadian Council on Ecological Areas (Gauthier et al 1995; Gauthier 1992), World Wildlife Fund Canada (Noss 1995; Kavanagh and lacobelli no date), and others (Riley and [Pat Mohr] 1994; Noss 1992), offer cornerstones for protected area systems, that prompt a multi - jurisdictional view of parks and heritage areas based on a common framework to which all areas and all jurisdictions contribute. This multi jurisdictional view sees a network of parks and heritage areas carefully designed at a landscape scale to insure that all elements are adequately represented, and all ecological processes are maintained to sustain the system. Without losing sight of the core areas, today's perspective places equal attention on critical linkages, corridors and ecological processes. Figure 2 depicts one such systemic view, illustrating protected nodes linked by natural corridors, not unlike the connectivity of organs by pulmonary or circulatory system in an organism. Developed to this level, parks and heritage systems assume a central importance in defining and protecting what is colloquially recognized as "countryside" by local communities and citizens.Today, in Ontario, different jurisdictions involved in parks and heritage areas are finding convergent paths that contribute to countryside conservation. On one front, the notion of greater park ecosystem, being advanced by Parks Canada and other conservation bodies, seeks to extend the influence of national parks and other protected areas through the mitigation of trans - boundary stressors and the maintenance of surrounding ecological features and processes essential to sustain an area's ecological integrity ([Bill Stephenson] 1996). From a provincial perspective, Ontario Parks and the Ministry of Natural Resources continue to utilize a complementary systems framework that seeks to represent the ecological diversity of 13 site regions and 65 site districts (Figure 3) within a system of parks and protected areas (McCleary et al 1992). And at a regional level, conservation authorities and municipalities apply planning and regulatory controls that help to protect heritage areas and maintain broader landscape integrity. Many of these regional authorities have instituted environmental advisory committees which solicit community - based input in the course of advising elected officials on environmental matters including heritage conservation. On the landscape, these efforts yield a mosaic of dedicated core areas, nested in larger heritage systems that are feathered into working landscapes (Figure 4).

AB  - Landscape ecological research in the Netherlands has been fruitful because of the mutual exchange of ideas and results of fundamental and applied research. This research project has been focused on methodologies for application of fundamental landscape ecological research in planning for land use and water use with emphasis on nature conservation aspects. The object of research has been the river system, because the river system is both a fundamental landscape ecological unit and an administration unit. The theoretical concept of planning is based on the model of spatial organisation; this model has been worked out by differentiating the rather simple physical aspects into a 'spatial ecological structure'.This model is based on the idea that all species have an ecological web and that these webs together make the - natural - landscape. The main patterns and processes in the spatial ecological structure of river systems are climate and water discharge. Within this context organisms create their ecological webs and these webs together constitute the spatial ecological structure. This spatial ecological structure can be modified by man. Man-through his social organization has an important impact by ecological changes that modify the spatial ecological structure into a manmade physical organisation. It is a model of the interference between sustainability and dynamics. The spatial ecological structure has been used as the guiding principle for the landscape ecological analysis and the interference of landscape ecological processes with changes in society. Within this context the research questions have been formulated as:* the definition of the main processes in river systems that determine ecological development in time and space and its translation into guiding principles and constraints for nature conservation;* evaluation of planning and management of rivers and its related nature in the context of its objectives.To answer these questions several research projects have been carried out, that have all been published in the period 1990-1992. They concerned both questions and emphasised different aspects of the spatial ecological structure. The research projects are: Ecological classification of the climate of the Rhine catchment ( Int. J Biometeorology 1990, 34:194-203 ).In this research an ordination and classification has been carried out on the climate of the Rhine catchment based on data from meteorological stations. The objective of the classification is to provide an ecological interpretation of climate data. The climate of northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland is divided into 5 classes, of which two, the atlantic and the subcontinental are subdivided further into subclasses. The climate classes can be interpreted ecologically and are correlated with floristic and vegetation data. The Rhine valley has a distinctive and characteristic climate. Interpolation of the classification has not been carried out, because of the uneven geographical spread of the sites in the dataset. The position of the Rhine valley as a separate subclass is striking. For the use of climatic data for modelling changes in climate in relation to hydrological effects, this will have minor implications, because the valley is just a section of the total drainage basin. For ecological interpretation of the Rhine catchment however, it will be of major importance, because also climatically the Rhine valley seems to function as a major ecological stream corridor in western Europe. Land use changes or climatic changes in this corridor might improve or hamper its functioning as such. Other rivers do not seem to be characterised by climatic differences in the same way and may not function as climate related stream corridors. They possibly do not have such pronounced effect on the surrounding landscape or insufficient climatic data are lacking to conclude on this.Vegetation, river management and land use in the Dutch Rhine floodplains (Regulated Rivers 1992 7(3):279-289. In this project the relation between vegetation and historical changes in ecological processes has been investigated. The floodplains of the Lower Rhine are situated in a densely populated area of The Netherlands. Although they are intensively used, the floodplains still fulfil important ecological functions. The lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation zone of the River Rhine and its floodplains are characterised by river transported vascular flora originating from southern and eastern Europe. Using multivariate methods data from literature and field data on grasslands and former river beds have been analyzed to find trends in ecological changes. The consequence of continued sedimentation and diminished erosion is an increased drying out of the floodplains. Excavation and recultivation of former excavated land does not reverse the losses in flora and vegetation. Statistically there is a negative relationship between the characteristic dry fluvial flora and recultivated land. Also the natural transversal river gradient disappears together with its characteristic ecological diversity. Aquatic environments in the floodplains have been changed completely since the regulation works started in the 19th century. Most former river beds have disappeared by silting up. Data on short term vegetation succession confirm the long term analysis of map data.Dutch floodplain policy, regulation of landscape ecological processes ( Landschap 1992 9(l):17-29 ). In this project the relation between floodplain vegetation and the management of ecological processes has been investigated. Rivers are landscape ecological systems, characterised by dynamic processes. Floodplains are very important in the ecological functioning of the river system. The Rhine is a regulated river situated in a densely populated area. The Dutch Lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation area of the river. Here the floodplains are strongly influenced by man during the last decades. In general there is a process of drying out going on in both the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine. River dynamics in the floodplains can be analyzed on basic processes as period and time of discharge, stream velocity, relative altitude and morphology. The importance of the floodplains has been recognised by all administrative levels and nature conservation and nature development has become a policy objective. To develop and execute a river floodplain policy translation of river dynamics into practical planning and management is needed. Little experience is available on the effectiveness of the means for policy execution. The available knowledge shows, that at this moment neither physical planning nor water management but only protection by Nature Conservation Law can be used to handle extreme cases.Conservation of brooks in small watersheds: a case for planning (Landscape and Urban Planning 1990 19:55-68). In this research project a simple regional water balance model has been made of the two regions in the Veluwe in order to qualify the consequences of adjacent land use and urban activities for the objectives of the National Park. Nature conservation is under stress in The Netherlands because of intensive land use and related water use. One of the main problems for the brook systems is planning of water use in order to maintain a locally high water-table. From a study of the water balance it is shown, that extraction in some parts of the research area causes water shortage for brook discharge. Water extraction is inevitable because of the dense population in the fringes of the national park. This leads to the conclusion that integration of research and co-ordination of physical planning and water use planning is needed to realise a sound nature conservation policy for this area.Landscape ecological and spatial impacts of climate change in two areas in the Netherlands (Earth surface processes and Landforms 1991 16:639-652). Possible impact of climatic change on the water balance has been analyzed for the river Dommel and the Veluwe, an area drained by many very small brooks. The water balance has been calculated for the winter and the summer period. With help of four scenarios, based on GCM's, climate data from the dry year 1976 and land use scenarios the impact of climatic change and a possible superposed effect of acid precipitation is analyzed. The results show that although the yearly changes in the water balance are small in some cases, in all cases the fluctuations in the water balance between winter and summer period increase. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are multiplied in water storage and runoff. This will have an important impact on water use planning and management.River systems: a leading part in a changing climate (Milieu 1992 7(3):68-75). A review has been made of research carried out on the impact of climate change in rivers. Climate change will influence the environment in Europe not only by changes in CO 2 -content and temperature, but also by changes in hydrology. Rivers might appear to be very sensitive to climatic variability and climate change. Most important impact is expected to be a change in mean discharge, extreme events and seasonality of runoff, which can cause important changes in erosion and sedimentation in various parts of Europe, quality of both groundwater and surface water, functioning of the aquatic and semi-terrestrial ecosystems and the availability of water resources.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes. From this research it can be concluded, that the natural basis for planning can be considered as a spatial ecological structure made by natural ecological processes and related patterns. Such a framework can be used as a guiding principle for landscape ecological modelling and the analysis of the impact of land use changes.The concept of Ecological Main Structure as developed in The Netherlands is a policy concept. Its scientific basis can be found in the spatial ecological structure of catchments. However, for the pleistocene pail of the Netherlands it can be concluded from the analysis that the objectives of the Dutch Ecological Main Structure can only partly be reached. Natural development can best be achieved for whole catchments because of the strong interaction between all land use. A complicating factor is that all large Dutch rivers and many lowland streams originate from headwaters in other countries. This makes international co-ordination necessary. Dry grasslands in the floodplains of the major dutch rivers are significantly related with sites flooded less than two days a year and significantly not related with excavated and recultivated soils. They are severely under threat of extinction. Former river beds tend to silt up and especially the open oxbows and the tidal oxbows have disappeared. Both tendencies have important consequences for nature conservation strategy in the river area and especially for nature redevelopment projects.The use of physical planning regulations to maintain aquatic nature and wetlands has not yet been very successful, nor in planning nor in implementation and management. Intensive co-operation between the water boards and the municipalities is needed both in planning and in management of waters.The climate of the Rhine catchment can be differentiated into several types among which that of the Rhine valley. This can be of importance for research on the impact of climate change. However, it is not yet clear if other rivers have a comparable corridor.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes.

AB  - My analysis and evaluation of the conservation community policy model has shown it to be an effective and economically viable urban policy remedy for negative externalities inherent in urban sprawl development. Using surveys, interviews and election data in a case study analysis of Prairie Crossing, a private conservation community in Lake County, Illinois, I establish that the policy model, as defined in this case study, is a for-profit hydridization of the non-profit land trust model. Incorporating aspects of the New Urbanism movement, Prairie Crossing succeeded in the positive creation of place and community. Resident voting participation in local elections significantly exceeded county norms, and non-voting political participation significantly surpassed the national rates recorded in the ANES data. Community developers substantively created and restored valuable habitats, including the locally extirpated and regionally threatened tall-grass prairie ecosystem. Biotic corridors link the development's wetlands to the local watershed and provide for the exchange of genetic material between populations, mitigating the problem of island biogeography. Conservation homeowner association practices, including exotic invasive and pest species removal, wetland and prairie burning, place-based ecology, organic farming, renewable energy generation, the planting of native organisms, and the reintroduction of endangered fish, have mitigated regional environmental degradation, and have fostered altruistic eco-friendly behaviors within the housing community's residents. Residents self-reported increasing their conservation behavior one-half a point on a four-point conservation rubric. Residents failed to alter transportation-oriented behaviors firmly anchored in American culture, supporting prior research conclusions. Increased environmental awareness at the national and, particularly, the local level substantively contributed to the defeat of a long-time incumbent in the U.S. House of Representatives. Survey data suggests that self-selection of homebuyers did not undermine the policy model. Further resident association practices include education, both internally and externally, and financial and organizational support for outside organizations. The development was successful in competing in the free market with conventional sprawling development. The conservation community policy model offers policy makers an economically competitive alternative to conventional urban sprawl.

AB  - The territorial government has applied to the city to zone six lots Service Commercial restricted (CSx), and two new lots, plus a lot enlargement for Pacific Northwest Moving, as Storage Service Industrial restricted (ISx). The lots are located off the Alaska Highway at Burns Road."Therefore the city should impose a cease and desist order on all plans for further tree removal, soil removal and gravel extraction from this site until proper rezoning has occurred," she said. "Next, discussions should be held with Hillcrest residents regarding the extent of the extraction, the impact on recreational corridors and the future development of the tank farm property."The restriction on the proposed six CSx lots would be a 15 m setback from slopes greater than 30 per cent. The restriction on the lot enlargement for Pacific Northwest and two ISx lots would be that junk yards, auto wrecking yards and welding shops aren't permitted so that it would match the existing zoning on Burns Road.

TI  - Trainspotting: opportunities in Canada's rail system
AU  - Plant, Jeffrey
T2  - Canadian Consulting Engineer
AB  - With deregulation, both Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific (CPR) generally vacated the unprofitable passenger rail services and left them to the crown corporation VIA Rail. Although recently there have been moves to start high speed passenger rail corridors in the Vancouver-Seattle and the Quebec City-Windsor corridors [see p. 42], the economic realities of these projects have little to do with the efficient movement of people. Similarly, notions of new 500 kph magnetically-levitated trains hold out a lot more promise for high-density passenger routes in Japan and western Europe than they do in Canada. While a Canadian high speed rail demonstration project might help Canadian rail technology suppliers better compete in the lucrative Japanese and European markets, or perhaps will provide a politically attractive national unity platform, such a project will succeed only with a massive investment of public money. The cost of the Quebec City-Windsor Lynx high-speed proposal made last May, for example, was estimated at $11 billion.Both CN and CPR railways are involved in the competition to develop a major superport on the east coast of North America. Private carriers Maersk Line and Sea-Land Service Inc. are searching for an east coast terminal for their post-Panamax container fleet. [Post-Panamax vessels are up to 1,000 feet wide, about 50 feet too wide to pass through the Panama Canal. Future ships will be even bigger, exceeding 1,100 feet in width.] CN is betting heavily on Halifax with its natural deep water and ice-free port. CPR is betting that either the port of New York and New Jersey or Baltimore will be home to the majority of Maersk-Sea-Land business. Although both the Baltimore and New York ports will require dredging to accommodate post-Panamax vessels with drafts of 14-15 metres, their proximity to the major eastern markets makes them attractive.Canadian railways are increasingly looking south to increase their business. It may surprise some readers, but Chicago is the key link needed to support continued growth of both major Canadian railways. Chicago is the most important connection node between the eastern and western U.S. railways, and almost 50 per cent of the country's intermodal rail shipments originate, terminate or connect there. It is home to 23 major truck-rail intermodal terminals, accounting for over 10,000 container transfers per day. Any major land bridge between the Pacific and the Atlantic is almost certain to pass through this city.

AB  - Background As a widely distributed and aerial migratory bird, the Common Swift (Apus apus) flies over a wide geographic range in Eurasia and Africa during migration. Although some studies have revealed the migration routes and phenology of European populations, A. a. apus (from hereon the nominate apus), the route used by its East Asian counterpart A. a. pekinensis (from hereon pekinensis) remained a mystery.Methods Using light level geolocators, we studied the migration of adult pekinensis breeding in Beijing from 2014 to 2018, and analysed full annual tracks obtained from 25 individuals. In addition, we used the mean monthly precipitation to assess the seasonal variations in humidity for the distribution ranges of the nominate apus and pekinensis. This environmental variable is considered to be critically relevant to their migratory phenology and food resource abundance.Results Our results show that the swifts perform a round-trip journey of ca 30,000 km each year, representing a detour of 26% in autumn and 15% in spring compared to the shortest route between the breeding site in Beijing and wintering areas in semi-arid south-western Africa. Compared to the nominate apus, pekinensis experiences drier conditions for longer periods of time. Remarkably, individuals from our study population tracked arid habitat along the entire migration corridor leading from a breeding site in Beijing to at least central Africa. In Africa, they explored more arid habitats during non-breeding than the nominate apus.Conclusions The migration route followed by pekinensis breeding in Beijing might suggest an adaptation to semi-arid habitat and dry climatic zones during non-breeding periods, and provides a piece of correlative evidence indicating the historical range expansion of the subspecies. This study highlights that the Common Swift may prove invaluable as a model species for studies of migration route formation and population divergence.

TI  - An integrated multi-controller management framework for highly reliable software defined networking

T2  - Telecommunication Systems
AB  - Software-defined networking (SDN) has become the technology of choice for designing the next-generation network infrastructure that is featured with high-volume traffics, rapidly increased scale, and dynamic nature. Furthermore, to deploy multiple controllers in the control plane of SDN is widely considered with the aim of improving the stability and reliability of the network. This paper presents an integrated framework for a comprehensive multi-controller management in SDN. The proposed framework is comprised of a network planning phase and a runtime maintenance phase. Novel algorithms are proposed in the network planning phase to estimate the required number of controllers in the network, to determine the nodes for placing the controllers, and to assign the switch to its managing controller. Moreover, these algorithms are designed by mitigating the problems of device isolation and controller overload such that the reliability and stability of the control plane can be enhanced. In addition, a mechanism based on the State Behavior Tree is proposed in the runtime maintenance phase of the framework. This mechanism dynamically manages the loading of the controller during the execution time so that the occurrence of the controller overload is minimized. The experimental results show that, compared to the prior arts, the proposed framework reduces the isolation probability by up to 89% and increases the device connectivity by up to 34%. The occurrence of the controller overload during runtime is also significantly decreased.

TI  - Cortical Development; From Specification to Differentiation
T2  - Cortical Development
AB  - The cerebral neo cortex, unique to mammals, is regarded as the prerequisite for higher cognitive function and is the structure most closely associated with the idea of the "mind" . Expansion of mental capa city between mammals is most typically associated with an evolutionary increase in neocortical volume that culminates in the intricately folded configuration of sulci and gyri so charac­ teristic of the primate cerebral cortex. Yet, the basic unit structure and funda­ mental connectivity of cortex appears to have been preserved from the smooth cortex of the mouse or rat to the highly convoluted cortical mantle of the human that, if stretched out as a sheet, would be large enough to wrap the entire human brain multiple times. The basic similarity in structure and func­ tion has made it possible to conduct studies in the relatively simple cortices of rat or mouse and have the results pertain to the understanding of the primate, including human, cortex. The neo cortex is an intriguing structure for the study of cell differentiation. Its dozens of neuronal cell types and small handful of different glial types have their origin in a pseudostratified germinal epithelium lining the ventricular surface of the forebrain. In its mature form, neocortex is a six-Iayered struc­ ture; five of its layers contain multiple different but characteristic neuronal types with the sixth occupied by neuronal processes. Various glial cells are dis­ persed throughout all six layers.

TI  - The Winter Environmental Continuum of Two Watersheds
AU  - Turcotte, Benoit

T2  - Water
AB  - This paper examines the winter ecosystemic behavior of two distinct watersheds. In cold-temperate regions, the hydrological signal and environmental parameters can fluctuate dramatically over short periods of time, causing major impacts to aquatic habitats. This paper presents the results of the 2011-2012 winter field campaign in streams and rivers near Quebec City, QC, Canada. The objective was to quantify water quantity and quality parameters and their environmental connectivity from headwater creeks above to the larger rivers below over the entire freeze-up, mid-winter and breakup periods with a view toward exploring the watershed continuum. The paper presents how aquatic pulses (water level, discharge, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity, measured at seven sites on an hourly basis along channels of different sizes and orders) evolve through the aquatic environment. Ice conditions and the areal ice coverage were also evaluated (on a daily time step along each instrumented channel). Some findings of the investigation revealed that water temperatures remained well above 0 °C during winter in headwater channels, that dissolved oxygen levels during winter were relatively high, but with severe depletions prior to and during breakup in specific settings, that high conductivity spikes occurred during runoff events, that annual turbidity extremes were measured in the presence of ice and that dynamic ice cover breakup events have the potential to generate direct or indirect mortality among aquatic species and to dislodge the largest rocks in the channel. The authors believe that the environmental impact of a number of winter fluvial processes needs to be further investigated, and the relative significance of the winter period in the annual environmental cycle should be given additional attention.

AB  - This left city council with little choice but to close SWARU. And the municipal staff's cost projection of $100,000 a day to close the facility remains a mystery. As a result of the closure, the municipal garbage is now heading towards the Glanbrook landfill. It has now been projected that the dumping of this waste stream will shorten the lifespan of the landfill to approximately 10 years. The solution is waste diversion. The city is aiming to redirect 65 per cent of the municipal waste we generate away from landfills. This is an admirable goal that is achievable.The next toxic spewing smoke stacks on the hit list are Ontario Power Generation's five coal- burning plants. In exchange for the production of electricity, the coal-burning stacks have contributed to Ontario's smog. Last year, a record 27 smog days occurred in Ontario and it is estimated that 1,900 people a year die from smog related illness.The Liberals propose a 'Golden Horseshoe Greenbelt' that would protect lands by linking the Niagara Escarpment to other environmental sensitive areas such as: Oak Ridges Moraine, Dufferin- Rouge Agricultural Preserve, Bronte Creek Provincial Park- Escarpment Corridor, and the provincially-owned Seaton Lands.

AB  - "They start de-watering the area so that they can dig and reduce the flow down here," said [Robert Allen], of Allen's Trout Farms.A previous proposal -- to build more than 400 metres of bank armouring along the Elbow River and erosion protection for the fill pad -- was scrapped to obtain the green light from Rocky View planners, said municipal planner Neil Angus."These flood-proofing measures would have the potential of negatively impacting the natural stream structure, movement, aquatic habitat, riparian habitat and associated wildlife corridors," Angus said.

AB  - An estimated one of every four trees in Lambton is an ash. In some bushlots, 90 per cent of the trees are ash, according to [Jerry Dowding].Last week, another 700 residents along the same corridor were told by the CFIA to stop movement of ash materials, excluding leaves. These notices were sent to property owners within 500 metres of an infested tree and differ from a quarantine because they are permanent, not temporary, orders.

T2  - Mobile Networks and Applications
AB  - In a critical environment, e.g. in a factory where an employee faces hazardous conditions, monitoring the health status of the employee is important. Thus, continuous connectivity of the employee to the network is the main concern of such networks. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in hazardous areas like factory. The proposed mobility structure for hazardous areas, called MSHA, organizes static nodes as a tree for an efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. MSHA is capable of handling multiple failures of static nodes which disconnect a mobile node from the network. MSHA is highly scalable regarding the number of mobile nodes and the size of the covered monitoring area. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on different factors. The results reveal the superiority of MSHA compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the performance (about 20%) of MSHA specifically in reducing packet loss and hand-off delay caused by the failure of the static nodes. The performance does not degrade with increasing the number of mobile nodes.

Conservation of grasslands in the East Kootenays is critically low.The land, which stretches from the St. Mary River to the uplands of Lone Pine Butte is a vital wildlife movement corridor. In 1998, the Ministry of Environment conducted a land trade with Cominco to acquire an important wildlife corridor in this area. The lands TLC is purchasing will complement and surround this corridor, increasing the protected area from 560 acres to almost 2500.This acquisition is a multi-phase project totalling almost 2.5 million dollars, taking place over four years. On April 17th 2001, TLC purchased the first 310 acres (phase one for $352,450). On October 31, 2001 TLC purchased an additional 300 acres (phase two for $422,750).

It's safe to say that there's no other enclave quite like Londonderry Lane, with its promenades, its horizon of mature trees, and its proximity to shopping, restaurants, and highway corridors, here by The Meadowlands of Ancaster.It is the re-designed interiors of these condo townhomes that have struck a chord with the buying public. In contrast to the inspired historic facades -- which blend with the ambiance of old Ancaster -- the interiors are state-of-the-art with nine and 10- foot ceilings that swell the scope of the living spaces, open- concepts that create an ease of movement between the principal rooms, transoms that shower sunshine throughout the premises, and bleached oak hardwood floors that only add to its radiant disposition.The stairs have bleached oak handrails and spindles, with an upper landing that boasts a bird's eye view of the foyer. There is a large master bedroom, with an ensuite and walk-in closet with a window to illuminate your wardrobe. Of the three bedrooms, one has been designed to include a home office with cables and surge protectors for computers -- a standard feature in all the Phase II homes. Among the other standard features in the Townes and other models are ceramic tile flooring in the foyer, kitchen and baths, luxurious broadloom, and mirrored closet doors..

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I have come to believe that every personal story is a landscape story. We frequently forget that our lives are not only our own but a contribution to a web of stories that shape the history of the land. Personal stories of life that make us who we are and our landscapes what they are, often are lost if not documented or passed down to other generations. What stories does the landscape hide and which stories does the landscape reveal? The only way our histories can survive is if we share them. The memories and stories we stow away in our landscapes, come back to us in other circumstances: they reflect us, and we reflect them. So, what are the stories of life? And how are these stories a metaphor of a landscape? The possibility to trace the stories of a life through the land, the soil, the plants, and the water inspires this exploration. Historians, theorists, artists, and environmentalists have explored the phenomenon of connection between human and landscape. The bond of life and land exists through our strong family ties, like that of a woman who stays constant in our stories like the landscape. Women are the life, strength, and stability of our legacies. The aspect of deep genealogy is an exploration of oneself in the landscape. What do we find when we explore it? Our discovery of self in the landscape touches on the notion of what we call home and what we come to find as our identity. Being a participant observer of one’s own genealogy delves into the topic of topographies of memory, meaning, loss, and discovery. When we embed ourselves in the land, it creates a different kind of ecology; one that is closer, more intricate, crucial, and not always rational. Creating a family archive allows for the exploration of one’s life and the purpose behind it. You discover parts of yourself, when you uncover truths of your family; hidden memories waiting to be recovered through the telling of a story. We create new relationships through this journey, not only with people but with the landscape. A river is a place where these connections come together, with the combination of complex concepts of culture and history. As noted by Irine J. Klaver, there is a notion of the atmosphere of a river or “riversphere” as a concept that contains social, cultural, political and emotional dimensions of life by combining hydrology, biology, and ecology with lived experience.  Intertwining environment with the experience of life through storytelling is what enriches the atmosphere of rivers and reveals hidden histories. My exploration of these thoughts began when I was walking to my maternal Grandmother’s house in the Southern Serbian city of Nis, I passed a tributary river to the Nisava that was barely flowing, moving slowly with green muck and miscellaneous trash. The sight of this river prompted me to take a picture before going on my way. I began to think about this river and how its contents are connected to a larger system. I pondered the deeper meaning behind its connectivity: how do collective histories, known and unknown, forgotten, and erased, all contribute to the circumstances that we have today? The composition of invisible traces and transparent ones are revealed through the existence of a river. The color of the water, the shape of its bends, the intensity of its flow is inclusive with the course of a life. Visible form of land is harmonious with the occurrences of our daily lives. The riversphere holds our secrets, revealing some and keeping others buried deep in its sediments; rivers hold the truth about us. This fascinates me because it enters a realm of undocumented stories of history. The idea of tracing history along a river prompted me to begin my personal journey of loss and discovery through deep genealogical archival research along the waterways of Serbia.

AB  - The greenway movement has been evolving since the 19th century, with the creation of axes in cities, along with boulevards, and Olmsted’s parkway concept. The industrial revolution caused an increase of awareness in ecology, along with a set of park and ecologic network projects that aimed towards conservation and sustainability. At present, these corridors are mainly known as the term greenway, with various authors highlighting their connecting, recreation, leisure, environmental and patrimonial conservation and protection functions. They also fall into different categories, such as river corridors, recreation corridors, ecologic corridors, historic/scenic/cultural corridors and greenway network. Integrated inside recreation corridors’ typology are trails that used old rail-ways, canals, waterlines and ridgelines, so, linear routes that obtain new functions. Railways have been highly intervened upon, in the last decades, with very well-known projects such as the Promenade Plantée, in Paris, and the High Line, in New York. Portugal has been reusing old railroads, following REFER’s (current IP, S.A.) “Ecotrail” Strategic Plan (“Plano Estratégico de Ecopistas”), in order to project trails, for the inhabitants, in non-motorized paths that preserve the environment and quality of life. With 11 of these trails inaugurated and 5 to intervene, Aljustrel’s railway is one of the later, inserted in a municipality rich in mining history and ecologic value. A proposal for a greenway in Aljustrel, inserted in recreation corridor’s typology, has all the potential to also be considered an ecological and historic/scenic/cultural corridor. Therefore, the intervention of this path aims at sustainable corridor that offers a recreational, ecological and patrimonial space to the locals and visitors, through a plan that includes three different yet combined routes.

TI  - Mixed Farming: Scope and Constraints in West African Savanna
AU  - Slingerland, Maja
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Since colonial times the crop livestock integration concept has been a leading development model in francophone West Africa. So far, it has failed in certain aspects, such as cultivation of fodder crops, intensification of cereal production through animal traction, and sedentarisation of mobile livestock keepers. Three major flaws in the concept have been identified, that are partly responsible for the reported failure: neglect of the farm (household) context, neglect of the financing role of livestock, neglect of competition for land and labour. Whether crop livestock integration can remain the leading development model in a situation of high population growth, has been explored through the following research question:"Is crop livestock integration or mixed farming a suitable model for farming systems development, leading to guaranteed food security and socio-economic survival for all social entities of the rapidly increasing population in Sahelian countries, without endangering their resource basis? " The contextPhysical contextIn the study area, the village Ka'ibo Sud V5, Province Zoundweogo, Burkina Faso, resources and their use appeared to be heterogeneous. Scenario studies with SHARES, a model at the level of Ka'ibo Sud V5, and HOREB, a model at the level of an average farm in Zoundweogo province, indicated that self-sufficiency in grain can not be achieved under currently applied crop and animal production technology in average rainfall years. External inputs in the form of inorganic fertiliser and/or concentrate feed for livestock are needed to compensate unavoidable nutrient losses, and a cart is needed to allow intensive management of crop residues and manure.Agricultural knowledge systemIn Burkina Faso, policy makers, research and extension appear to follow the transfer of technology model, a top-down approach leading to development of technologies that are not necessarily addressing farmers' needs. Research is either curiosity-driven or guided by objectives of policy makers. Extension only reaches a limited number of farmers, hence the progressive farmers approach dominates their relations. Farmers generally adopt proposed technologies, either because they have the means to introduce the innovations or because the proposed innovation suits them best. Only farmers that adopted technologies were contacted subsequently, and in turn, those farmers actively asked research and extension for solutions to their problems. Only when they were recognised as a constituency of the policy makers, they could influence the research agenda. Resource-poor farmers and mobile livestock keepers are neither recognised as a constituency nor possessed the means to innovate, hence they hardly benefit from research and extension. Farming systems developmentA framework situating discrete farming systems in the development perspective of mixed farming, has been designed. The framework ranges from separate specialised low external input (LEIA) systems, through integrated and mixed farming systems without or with external inputs, to specialised high external inputs (HEIA) farming systems. Observed farming systems in Burkina Faso could be classified within the proposed framework. Policy makers, driven by the objective to settle and control mobile herdsmen and to constrain crop producers to permanent fields, aimed at mixed farming systems for everyone. The recent sustainability debate appears to support their promotion of mixed (LEIA) farming systems because they are assumed to reduce nutrient losses. Mobile Fulani herdsmen engage in crop production only, when forced by circumstances, such as drought or animal diseases, leading to severe losses in livestock, making continuation of their former way of life impossible. Mixed farming is a poverty-induced option for them and therefore not attractive. For Mossi crop producers, on the contrary, wealth is the drive towards mixed farming, cattle being needed to support the associated technologies, such as animal traction and use of manure. Resource-poor farmers going into mixed farming have to apply labour-intensive techniques (their only resource) and, because of their low purchasing power, they cannot afford external inputs and have no option but to (over) exploit the environment. High external input (HEIA) farming should avoid pollution of the environment. Ecologically, both HEIA and LEIA can have negative effects on natural resource quality. Socio-economically, high agricultural production per unit area, based on the use of external inputs will lead to larger scale production and lower prices. Resourcepoor farmers cannot follow this development and run the risk of being expelled from farming. Economically, HEIA farming is only sustainable when cash crops are cultivated or when high prices can be guaranteed. Around cities, capital intensive production systems can exist, because of the high purchasing power of the urban population and because of the short producer-consumer lines. In rural areas, farming systems that do not rely on high-quality infrastructure and use labour-intensive techniques, achieving moderate production levels are most suitable, guaranteeing local self-sufficiency in food. Production for export should be based on industrially organised systems using high levels of external inputs and capital. To aim at a variety of farming systems, each addressing specific societal needs, seems a more suitable strategy than to aim at the mixed farming system proposed in the model. Financing role of livestockIn the mixed farming model, the role of livestock was limited to the supply of manure and animal power for crop production, and to value crop residues. For farmers in Burkina Faso and elsewhere in West Africa, livestock plays an important role as capital asset, to cover (emergency) cash needs. In farming systems where crop production depends on erratic rainfall, as in West Africa, livestock can be used to transfer surpluses from years with abundant rainfall to years with deficiencies. Livestock production was negatively affected by this buffer function, because emergency (premature) sales are associated with losses due to  foregone offspring and foregone live weight. Emergency sales further restricted revenues, when livestock had to be sold in periods with low market prices. Sales of livestock for financing purposes also negatively affected performance of the farming system as a whole, in terms of foregone manure and animal traction, limiting crop production.For financing, farmers preferred livestock to other means, even though taking a loan with a savings and credit co-operative was cheaper. Accessibility, security, liquidity and profitability were all more favourable for livestock than for any of the alternatives examined. The fact that a pledge of 150 % of the credit is needed for a loan from a co-operative, was a major constraint for resource-poor farmers. Financing through livestock was therefore more attractive than taking a loan with a co-operative or any other source. Animal tractionAnimal traction has been presented as a key element of crop livestock integration. It appears to be associated with larger farm sizes, larger areas of cash crop and higher livestock numbers, hence with wealthier farmers. In Zoundweogo province and Ka'ibo village, animal traction could develop as there were sufficient animals to serve all households and to cultivate total current crop area. Additional efforts should be made to increase training of bullocks and transfer of bullocks from Fulani livestock keepers to Mossi crop producers is needed. Bullocks appeared too weak for the tasks asked from them, resulting in short working days of 2-3 hours. Output per animal might be increased through introduction of heavier animal breeds or additional animal feeding. Timeliness of seeding and weeding might also be improved by using additional bullocks. The scope for improvement is limited as any solution depends on purchasing power of the farmer and availability of inputs. Natural resource basisMossi and Fulani herds appeared to use the village territory in different ways, dictated by animal species, production objectives and season. Current high population growth leads to an expanded area under crops, for food production, and consequently reduced grazing area in the rainy season. Crop residue management, as proposed in the crop livestock integration model, leads to increased control over this feed resource by Mossi crop producers. As a result, room for the traditional feeding strategy, applied by Fulani and consisting of mobility and tracking changes in vegetation, becomes limited. The quantity (area) of animal feed becomes limiting, especially in the rainy season. In the post-harvest, dry season, both quantity and quality of animal feed becomes limiting because crop residues are no longer available and their animals thus have to rely on low quality grasses from the natural vegetation. Options for Fulani herds were further restricted by excluding them from the use of village wells in the dry season. Fulani have either to leave the village territory more often and for longer periods, or to accept lower animal production. When Mossi specialised crop producers become mixed farmers, the number of animals in their system increases. When Fulani become mixed farmers, their livestock will reside more permanently on the village territory. Larger livestock numbers and smaller grazing area increase risks of degradation, especially because specialist feeders such as goats and sheep will be forced to accept a more general diet, resulting in diet overlap between formerly complementary feeders. Population growth and subsequent urbanisation has been shown to lead to increased demands for firewood that has to be provided from village territories. Degradation of the natural resources in village territories and a decrease in feed resources for browsers can be the result. ConclusionThe crop livestock integration model, and especially the mixed farming model, has only limited applicability as goal for farming systems development. In Burkina Faso, the majority of the farming population consists of resource-poor farmers, incapable to adopt technologies associated with mixed farming, because they lack the purchasing power to acquire ploughs, draught bullocks, inorganic fertilisers, etc. Mixed farming as a comprehensive development model therefore fails, although several of its components are (at least partially) adopted by a variety of farmers. The concept of restricted nutrient losses through intensive management of manure and crop residues appeared, for instance, valid, but, because of unavoidable losses during (re-)cycling, external inputs are needed to guarantee sufficient food production for the rapidly growing population. Moreover, exchange of crop residues and manure between specialised farming systems, has the same potential for nutrient cycling as mixed farming, but may be preferred because of advantages associated with labour distribution. Constraints for farming system development, especially for crop farmers, can be alleviated by creation of an optimal farm environment, such as a sound financial infrastructure, an agricultural knowledge system addressing farmers needs, a professional infrastructure to provide inputs and to guarantee marketing of outputs, fair farm-gate prices for agricultural products, etc. Attractive prices for meat and milk, infrastructure for veterinary care, grazing rights protected by law and limiting crop production in designated grazing areas and corridors, etc. are needed to facilitate mobile animal production. Technology development should already take its impact on the environment into account. Research and extension should stimulate participation of resource-poor farmers and mobile livestock keepers in technology development and support development of a range of farming systems, in terms of inputs and outputs, because together they can address the variety of societal needs.

AB  - Since early November, the talk of the bird watching community in Northeastern Ontario has been the irruption of great grey owls. The initial report in the Blue Sky Region was from Alex Parker of South River in Lount Township on Nov. 3.The centre of abundance for the owls is the Highway 17 corridor from Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury, where 17 birds were reported by Erwin Meisner on the Ontbirds Internet bird reporting system.The great grey owl is our largest owl. Its most distinct feature is its bright staring yellow eyes, which seem to look right through any observer. It has a smooth rounded head, unlike the great horned owl.

AB  - Ten years ago Ontario Hydro announced they intended to build a power transmission corridor east to west through the middle of our town. They held a public meeting at a golf and country club just north of Toronto. The stated reason for this massive system was this. Over the next ten years, there will be an influx of approximately three million people to the Toronto area, so we need to build a new transmission line. The real reason, of course, was that a bunch of bored engineers, tired of looking out of their window all day were in desperate need of a new project to keep themselves occupied. The transmission line wasn't practical and of course was never built.Education for an extra million kids -- $7.5 billion a year (not to mention training all those new teachers) -- all of it from Ontario taxpayers. Then there's the roads, sewage plants, other municipally-funded infrastructure, all surely in the tens of billions annually.

TI  - Neuroplasticity of the Corticospinal System: Applications of Neuromodulation-based Therapies
AU  - Amer, Alzahraa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The motor cortex and corticospinal tract are necessary for producing skilled movements. I use intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a high-frequency stimulation protocol known to promote neural plasticity, as a tool to characterize short- and long-term plasticity of the CS system.Although it is well known that activity-dependent motor cortex (MCX) plasticity produces long-term potentiation (LTP) of local cortical circuits, leading to enhanced motor evoked potentials (MEPs), the effects produced by the corticospinal (CS) projection on spinal cord neurons have not yet been thoroughly studied. In Chapter 2, I determined if the CS tract (CST) is capable of producing LTP in the spinal cord. I used multichannel recording of motor-evoked intraspinal excitatory local field potentials (LFPs) in adult rats after iTBS. I stimulated the wrist area of MCX and recorded at the 6th cervical spinal cord segment. A single 3-minute block of MCX iTBS potentiated the monosynaptic excitatory LFP recorded within the CST termination field in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone, for at least 15 minutes after stimulation. Ventrolaterally in the spinal cord gray matter, iTBS potentiated a late negative LFP that was localized to the wrist muscle motor pool. Response enhancement after a single block of iTBS in MCX thus produces LTP of the evoked monosynaptic and oligosynaptic CST responses. The time course of this LTP has the properties of early-LTP, the first phase of LTP which enables an increase in synaptic strength and is known to play an important role in memory function in the hippocampus, amygdala and other cortical brain structures in mammals. Pharmacological blockade of iTBS-induced LTP in MCX using MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, failed to prevent spinal LFP potentiation, showing that spinal plasticity can be induced in an activity-dependent manner without MCX LTP. Pyramidal tract iTBS, which preferentially activates the CST, also produced significant spinal LTP, indicating the capacity for plasticity at the CST-spinal neuron synapse. My findings show CST monosynaptic response plasticity in spinal interneurons and demonstrate that spinal premotor circuits are capable of modifying the way descending MCX signals are processed in an activity-dependent manner. These findings are important for understanding the key structures for motor learning and motor recovery after injury and suggest that spinal circuits, as the implementer of supraspinal muscle control signals, are capable of further modifying the actions of the MCX in an activity-dependent manner.I next determined if early-LTP can be converted, with repeated and chronic iTBS into the late phase of long-term potentiation (Late- or L-LTP), which allows enduring modification of the structure and function of neuronal connectivity (Chapter 3). I determined if there is day-to-day carryover of MEP augmentation produced by iTBS and elucidated the anatomical and molecular underpinnings of this robust corticospinal system plasticity.For these experiments, I recorded chronically from the extensor carpi radialis muscle in naïve rats and examined MCX-evoked motor responses (MEPs) as a measure of CS system plasticity. I promoted MEP plasticity by MCX iTBS for varying times daily and for one or more days. I found that one block (3 mins) of iTBS produced strong EMG potentiation lasting for up to 35 min; consistent with early-LTP which is independent of protein synthesis. Five contiguous blocks of iTBS during a single session (27 mins), prolonged EMG potentiation for 24-48 hours and resulted in upregulation of signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of neuronal translational capacity. These changes are a signature of a stable and long-lasting LTP (late-LTP). In addition, iTBS-induced L-LTP was enhanced or blocked bidirectionally by modulating cortical activity chemogenetically using engineered G-protein coupled excitatory and inhibitory receptors (GPCR); Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), respectively. We next assayed CST structural changes that could support the enhanced motor responses. Chronic stimulation promotes a significant increase in CST axon length in the contralateral spinal cord intermediate zone. 3D reconstruction of CST synapses, defined by the co-expression of the pre- and post-synaptic markers VGlut1 and PSD-95 in labeled CST axons, revealed a significant increase in the total number and volume of PSD-95 clusters. Intrinsic presynaptic bouton characteristics did not change; however, the number of presynaptic sites increased in proportion to the increase in CST axon length.Taken together, my findings show early-LTP of the CST EPSP in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone of the spinal cord that leads to early-LTP of the CST oligosynaptic response in the motor pools and wrist muscle. A prolonged potentiation of MEP, or late-LTP, occurs after repeated blocks of iTBS. The transition from early- to late-LTP is accompanied by upregulation of known L-LTP cortical plasticity markers. Remarkably, delivery of iTBS daily for 10 days leads to the emergence of persistent MEP augmentation. We show that iTBS can be used both to lay the groundwork for a brief to an enduring form of MEP enhancement and CST structural changes underlying the stronger and more effective of synaptic transmission of the CST.  The maintained increase in MEP magnitude we observe with L-LTP and CST synaptic structural changes may be viewed as the neurophysiological surrogate for LTP-dependent processes more generally, such as motor learning within the CS motor systems.

AB  - As a result of the closure, the municipal garbage is now heading towards the Glanbrook landfill. It has now been projected that the dumping of this waste stream will shorten the lifespan of the landfill to approximately 10 years. The solution is waste diversion. The city is aiming to redirect 65 per cent of the municipal waste we generate away from landfills. This is an admirable goal that is achievable.The next toxic spewing smoke stacks on the hit list are Ontario Power Generation's five coal- burning plants. In exchange for the production of electricity, the coal-burning stacks have contributed to Ontario's smog. Last year, a record 27 smog days occurred in Ontario and it is estimated that 1,900 people a year die from smog related illness.The Liberals propose a 'Golden Horseshoe Greenbelt' that would protect lands by linking the Niagara Escarpment to other environmental sensitive areas such as: Oak Ridges Moraine, Dufferin- Rouge Agricultural Preserve, Bronte Creek Provincial Park- Escarpment Corridor, and the provincially-owned Seaton Lands.

TI  - Changes in the landscape: Natives, Spaniards, and the ecological restructuration of central Veracruz, Mexico, during the sixteenth century
AU  - Sluyter, Andrew
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The intersection of Old and New Worlds in 1492 rejoined two ecosystems, largely isolated for millennia, and resulted in ecological upheaval: a restructuration of environment, settlement, and land use. The detailed, spatial-temporal processes of that sixteenth-century, ecological restructuration remain manifest in the landscape of central Veracruz, Mexico, as revealed through a combination of geomorphological, palynological, and archival methods.During the Prehispanic period, shifting cultivation contrasted with zones of more intensive land use. Wetland agriculture, terracing, and irrigation supported dense populations and surplus production for trade and tribute. Circa AD 500, more than four millennia of maize cultivation culminated in slope destabilization. By the Spaniards' arrival, the Natives had created a more open vegetation than the mix of savanna, shrubland, and woodland that characterizes these lowlands. The 1519 settlement pattern, comprising a population of some 500,000 people, its ethnic differentiation, and exploitation by highland states were the product of millennia of ecological processes.By the end of the sixteenth century, Old World disease, war, and encomienda had reduced the Natives to less than one percent of the 1519 figure. The Spaniards and their African slaves occupied the central coast and a string of inns connecting the coastal entrepot to Mexico City, controlling the study region as a hinterland and transportation corridor for the Spanish state. After a transitional period of tribute extraction based on Native land uses, livestock ranching came to dominate the landscape. Despite exotic ruminants and high stocking rates, however, environmental restructuration attributable to colonial land use was limited to floristic change and some expansion of savanna at the expense of woodland. No soil erosion is evident which remotely equals that of the Prehispanic period.Nonetheless, given the vastly different temporal scales, any comparison that might argue the relative sustainability of the sixteenth-century Spanish pastroecosystem versus several millennia of Prehispanic agroecosystems would be specious. Scholars, Natives, critical theorists, and environmentalists might still learn much about past ecologies, both Native and Spanish, in order to inform future ecological restructurations.

Andre's gift of engagement was evident in every issue. When EARC  was given the task of reviewing places where locals could walk their  dogs, Andre would personally investigate each location. If there was  a question of the protection of a habitat patch, wildlife corridor,  or a conservation setback, Andre would get on his hiking boots and  explore it for himself, taking along anyone who was interested. He held this education lightly, and it was more than a year before  I discovered that Andre and I had studied with the same graduate  supervisor.

TI  - The Economically Important Nitrogen Pathways of Southwest Florida
AU  - Malkin, Elon M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The global phenomenon of burgeoning coastal population growth has led to coastal watershed landscape transformation and ecosystem degradation, prompting policy-makers to set limits on freshwater withdrawals and labile nutrient loads. Important components of Florida's economies lie in the state's expansive coastal zone; the organisms driving the billion-dollar recreational fishing industry are rooted in coastal habitats, while the agriculture and real-estate industries sprawl throughout numerous coastal watersheds. This study aimed to identify the connections between anthropogenic land use and essential juvenile fish nursery habitats within the coastal zone, which is the first critical step for sustaining the ecology and related economies of the region.   The need for this study arises from the fact that these economies are interconnected through nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen management can influence their prosperity or collapse. Juvenile fish nursery habitats are located in waters that receive nitrogen from adjacent landscapes. Runoff delivers nitrogen derived from human nitrogen use and processing within the watersheds to the juvenile fish nursery habitats. Ecosystem managers must understand that although copious amounts of nitrogen applied to land may ultimately support nursery habitat foodwebs, overwhelming nitrogen loads may also create algal blooms that decay and cause lethal hypoxic events leading to ecosystem degradation. This study aims to pinpoint the specific nitrogen sources that support primary production and ultimately fish production in watersheds dominated by agricultural landscapes and residential neighborhoods.Stable isotopes are versatile tools used to identify these connections. The nitrogen and carbon compounds that make up the moieties of an ecosystem inherently carry information on major nitrogen sources, trophic structure as well as the crucial information concerning dominant nitrogen removal and transformative processes that occur within sediments. Specifically in this study, the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, primary producers, and fish were used to identify 1) the connections between urban and agricultural landscapes and the nutrients that percolate through the foodweb, 2) the primary producers that support fish biomass, 3) the origins of sedimentary organic matter that can provide new nitrogen via recycling, and 4) the heterogeneous function of fish nursery habitats in polluted systems. This study was conducted during the region's wet and dry seasons and in over thirty watersheds that differ from each other in terms of size and anthropogenic influence.  In agricultural watersheds, nitrogen derived from row crops and tree crops ultimately supported fish production during the wet season. Convective afternoon thunderstorms coupled with runoff delivered nitrogen from the landscape to receiving waters. These nutrients supported phytoplankton which deposited into the sediments and supported benthic foodwebs. During the dry season, nitrogen derived from row crops and nitrogen transformation in the sediments ultimately supported fish production. In this case, irrigation water used for agriculture delivered nitrogen from lands covered with row crops to the nursery habitats in receiving waters.   The dry season was characterized by the nitrogen transformation process known as dissimilatory nitrogen reduction to ammonium (DNRA), where biologically available nitrate is converted to biologically available ammonium. Phytoplankton deposits, most likely delivered during the wet season, were recycled through the slow burning DNRA processes, which provided nitrogen for the benthic microalgae that dominated in the dry season. These organisms in turn supported benthic communities which ultimately supported dry season fish production.   In small urban watersheds, nitrogen derived from septic tanks, lawn irrigation, leaky sewage pipes, and atmospheric deposition ultimately supported fish production via phytoplankton, but unlike the nitrogen sources in agricultural watersheds, these sources (with the exception of atmospheric deposition) were seasonally consistent because a mechanisms to deliver nitrogen derived from septic tanks, lawn fertilizer, and leaky sewage pipes were, at least to some extent, available during both seasons.  In polluted, tidal, fish-nursery habitats, the specific mechanism that allowed nursery habitats to decrease the ratio of mortality over growth rates of juvenile fish was not consistent among systems. These mechanisms were likely dependent on physical-chemical parameters and stream geomorphology. If the geomorphology or physical-chemical characteristics of nursery habitats are not adequate to set up an efficient nitrogen transfer process to fish, these habitats become more of a haven from predators rather than a source of food for fish.   This study has several implications for management. Managers must first recognize that microalgae are dominant supporters of tidal nursery foodwebs. Managers must define the relationship between nitrogen loads and fish abundance. If this relationship is unknown, the results of increasing nitrogen loads on fish production will remain uncertain; foodwebs in nursery habitats may collapse due to eutrophication, or fish abundance may increase due to increases in food supply. Connectivity factors derived from stable isotope mechanistic mass-balance models can be used as measurable targets for groups of watersheds. The use of wetlands as nitrogen remediation tools may not be effective at removing nitrogen; nitrogen transformation processes such as DNRA likely outweigh removal processes in wetland soils.

TI  - A comparative study: Utilizing data mining techniques to classify traffic congestion status
AU  - Mirakhorli, Abbas
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Performance measure is a process of evaluating and quantifying a system. Performance measure provides us with information about how good a system is working and how well the predefined goals are met. In order to analyze the performance of a transportation system, the traffic data such as speed, volume, occupancy and travel time of the system need to be collected. These data will generate valuable historical database that can be used to develop models to improve the quality of service of transportation system. The performance measures in transportation studies can be categorized to following main groups: Congestion, Mobility, Accessibility, Reliability, Safety and Environmental. Traffic congestion is one the important issues in any transportation system. Growing congestion in urban transportation network has enforced significant economic burdens to our current society. It causes waste of time, money, fuel and energy for the commuters and consequently impacting daily life of people in the society. Based on 2011 Congested Corridors Report presented by Texas A& M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion incurred $121 billion cost for drivers. Based on this report, 5.5 billion additional hours are wasted waiting in traffic in 2011. It means $818 additional fuel and time cost for each commuter. Being aware of the status of congestion in future can help, decision makers, intelligent systems and apps improve their accuracy and help commuters in their travel routing. To achieve these goals accurate traffic status classification techniques is required. Achieving higher accuracy is still one of the influential driving factor for research in this area. The objective of this thesis is to utilize data mining techniques to classify traffic status to congested or non-congested for some point of time in future based on historical traffic parameters (Vehicle Count, Occupancy, Speed). Moreover, to compare the performance of different data mining techniques on this problem. This dissertation examined several classification techniques including J48 Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector machine, PART and K-Nearest Neighborhood to classify future traffic status to Congested or Non-congested. The one minute traffic data from I-15 Northbound from I-215 up to Desert Inn, Las Vegas, NV were used to run these experiments. Based on the comparison of these algorithms, the J48 algorithm has the best performance.

"They are sleeping during the day, but during the night, you have to bend when walking," said Vlasta Suchankova, police spokeswoman in Liberec, 95 km north of Prague. She said dozens of the small flying mammals fly through the corridors, terrifying the staff. Suchankova added that the bats favor men's toilets on the second floor. She said environmentalists have advised the police to wait for winter, when the bats will hibernate and can be moved to caves.Japanese researchers have been studying a mysterious hum emitted by Planet Earth as its geological and atmospheric events combined to produce a frenetic symphony. Naoki Suda and Kaqunari Nawa dredged out the sounds from a mass of seismic data, according to a report in New Scientist, and say that the pitches of the 50 notes range between 2 and 7 millihertz -- about 16 octaves below middle C. They said that the individual notes sound pleasant enough, but combined, they are like an endless banging on a trash can. They advise that it would be impossible for anyone to hear them with the naked ear, and the sounds are so subtle that a single magnitude-5.5 quake anywhere on the planet would blot them out. The hum is not actually the sound of seismic or weather events, but is the lingering echo of their combined occurrences.

TI  - Observations of atmospheric reactive nitrogen species and nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains
AU  - Benedict, Katherine B.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Many national parks are experiencing increased nitrogen deposition due to increased emissions of reactive nitrogen, especially in the western United States. Excess nitrogen deposition can adversely impact ecosystem function, in some cases leading to degradation of water quality and forest decline. One region of particular interest is the Rocky Mountains, where large increases in wet deposition of oxidized and reduced nitrogeN·have been observed in recent decades. Here we present results from several field campaigns in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and a field campaign in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) focused on identifying important nitrogen deposition pathways and factors that are contributing to nitrogen deposition. To understand nitrogen deposition in RMNP we focused on understanding the spatial variability of reactive nitrogen concentrations across the state of Colorado. We observed large gradients in the reactive nitrogen species that reflected the different source regions across the state. In eastern Colorado, home to large agricultural operations, we observed high concentrations of ammonia and ammonium. Concentrations decreased moving westward toward the Front Range urban corridor and the Rocky Mountains. Concentrations of nitric acid, an important oxidation product of nitrogen oxides emissions, were highest in the Front Range urban corridor. Concentrations of gaseous ammonia and nitric acid were much lower in RMNP than at the sites to the east. Particle concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were generally lower in RMNP as well; however, concentration gradients were sometimes not as strong as for the gas phase compounds. Wet deposition of ammonium and nitrate were the two largest reactive nitrogen deposition pathways in RMNP, yielding inputs of 1.97 kg N·ha -1 or 56% of total nitrogen deposition. Dry deposition of ammonia and wet deposition of organic nitrogen were the next most important deposition pathways; together they accounted for 40% (1.37 kg N·ha-1) of annual total nitrogen deposition. These two pathways are of special interest because they have not historically been monitored as part of regional deposition budgets. The remaining deposition pathways (dry deposition of nitric acid, and PM2.5 ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen) accounted for approximately 3% of total nitrogen deposition. In GTNP there was a strong gradient in ammonia concentrations, with higher average concentrations to the west (0.6 µg/m3) and lower average concentrations to the east (0.3 µg/m3), consistent with the presence of large agricultural operations west of the park. Concentrations of nitric acid, nitrate, and ammonium did not exhibit any clear spatial trends. Ammonia concentrations were higher at GTNP than at RMNP while PM2.5 nitrate and ammonium concentrations were similar in the two regions. Average nitric acid concentrations were similar between the two parks as well, with the exception of one high elevation GTNP site where higher concentrations were observed. Wet deposition of ammonium and dry deposition of ammonia were the largest reactive nitrogen deposition pathways in GTNP followed by wet deposition of nitrate and wet deposition of organic nitrogen. Previous ecological assessments have led to the establishment of a critical load for wet deposition of inorganic nitrogen to RMNP and GTNP. A critical load is the maximum level of nitrogen input that can be sustained by an ecosystem without irreversible damage like loss of biodiversity. Our observations reveal that the critical load is currently being exceeded in both RMNP and GTNP. It is important to recognize that substantial additional inputs of reactive nitrogen are occurring in both parks through dry deposition of ammonia and wet deposition of organic nitrogen. Neither pathway is currently considered in the U.S. critical load framework. In both RMNP and GTNP organic nitrogen was an important component of deposition.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Even the most old-school now realize that good ideas can come from anywhere and that fostering collaboration and group cohesion is vital to any healthy enterprise. But what approach can best create an environment that ensures clear speaking, compassionate listening, and the making of well-grounded decisions? The most ancient one: the circle.The circle was the form of original gathering that taught human beings how to create social patterns. All modern group processes open to collaboration or to flattening the hierarchy are based in some way on circle practices. Here two veteran practitioners offer a comprehensive guide to this foundational form of human interaction The Circle Way lays out the basics of circle conversation based on the original work of the coauthors, who have studied and standardized the essential elements of circle practice and have been implementing them in a variety of organizations for over fifteen years. It opens with a unique visual guide to circle and then presents both structure and story so that readers understand how these elements come into play and how they are interrelated and interactive. Baldwin and Linnea include detailed instructions and suggestions for getting started, setting goals, and solving conflicts. And they delve into the deeper aspects of circle, illuminating the profound transformation the process has on people who participate in it.

TI  - Mapping the Global Black South: Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora
AU  - McInnis, Jarvis Conell
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Recent scholarship on black transnationalism and diaspora in the early twentieth century has largely focused on migration to the urban centers of the US North and Western Europe. “Mapping the Global Black South: Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora” revises this discourse by exploring the movement of people, cultural practices, and ideas between the US South and the Caribbean as an alternative network of African diasporic affiliation. According to Caribbean theorist Édouard Glissant, “the Plantation system” created a “rhythm of economic production” and a “style of life” that links the US South to the Caribbean and parts of Latin America. Building on Glissant’s geographic frame, this dissertation establishes the plantation—a fundamentally modern form of labor organization—as the figural and literal organizing principle of “the global black south”: a matrix of diasporic articulation, subject formation, and knowledge and cultural production. Through close readings of works by Booker T. Washington, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Price-Mars, this study examines how African American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals mobilized aesthetics—literature, music, photographs, and performance—to imagine alternative futures within and against the legacy of the plantation.   By drawing on theories of the plantation in Caribbean and New Southern Studies, “Mapping the Global Black South” makes critical interventions in the field of African American Studies, where the plantation is almost exclusively regarded as a metonym for slavery and anti-modernity. In Caribbean Studies, by contrast, scholars have proposed a more nuanced rendering of the plantation as the genesis of black modern life and culture, and in New Southern Studies, it has been reconceived as the link that tethers the US South to the global south (based on similar patterns of underdevelopment). Through an interdisciplinary and multimedia methodology,  then, this study interrogates the paradox of the plantation as at once local and global, fecund and barren, static and fungible—as a site of agricultural production that animates the flow of global capital, on the one hand, and a modern technology of power that exploits the land and the bodies forced to work it, on the other. In so doing, it establishes the plantation as a matrix of global black south cultures that revises traditional understandings of black modernity and creates new systems of connectivity and legibility for contemporary scholarship.  Moreover, in reconsidering the plantation as a crucible of black modernity, “Mapping the Global Black South” reconstructs the historical significance of the Tuskegee Institute—a former plantation turned industrial school—as a nodal point of black diasporic affiliation and a model for resolving one of the fundamental predicaments of New World blackness: the problem of free labor. Given that slavery was a system of coerced and exploitative labor, the greatest challenge of emancipation throughout the global black south was transforming a mass of formerly enslaved persons into autonomous workers. Thus, by the turn of the twentieth century, black artists and intellectuals from across the region began to embrace (and adapt) Booker T. Washington’s vision of an agrarian and industrial future (by way of Tuskegee) as a strategy for racial uplift and self-determination. Whereas Washington’s reformism is commonly reduced to a foil for W.E.B. Du Bois’ radicalism, this dissertation resituates Washington within a hemispheric framework to reconsider how his theories contribute to a more capacious epistemology of the “plantation” in African American Studies.   “Mapping the Global Black South” is thus organized around two interrelated concerns: the plantation as an alternative framework of black transnationalism and a site of cultural production that evinces the persistence of black life within structures of social death; and Tuskegee’s significance as a symbol of modernity and a nodal point of diasporic articulation at the turn of the twentieth century. In so doing, it illuminates how the plantation shaped the new futures that emerged in the US South and the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery.

TI  - The Archaeology of Small-Scale Slavery in Antebellum Missouri
AU  - Haas, James Elliott
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In this thesis, I examine small-scale slavery and resistance by the enslaved to their condition using the conceptual framework of resistant accommodation, as applied to the circumstances on my family’s farm in Missouri. My family were slaveholders who came from Kentucky and settled in Hardin Township, Clinton County, Missouri, circa 1833. Family oral history included information on the location of the first house, but little else.The term resistant accommodation, developed based on small-scale farming operations in colonial New England, implies that the enslaved outwardly conformed to the demands of their enslavers while covertly circumventing those demands to further their own interests. In this conceptual framework, resistance is not an end in itself. It further suggests that individual acts of resistance coalesced into a community of resistance through the networking, shared experiences, and mutual trust that developed among the enslaved when they were able to exploit gaps in the surveillance of their enslavers. Gaps in surveillance arose in part from enslavers’ competing attempts to maintain surveillance while also using their work force efficiently and emphasizing separateness through the control of shared space. The nature of the landscape was also a factor.I hypothesize that conditions in colonial New England were broad enough to apply to slaveholder surveillance and resistance by the enslaved on small-scale farms across the antebellum Upper South and in Border States such a Missouri. I then present a case study using data from my family farm, settled by my great-great-great grandfather James Elliott, to test whether those data support an interpretation that conditions for the people my family enslaved were consistent with the expectations of resistance accommodation.The Euroamerican settlers of the Upper South were largely small-scale yeoman farmers with smaller acreages and few or no slaves, interspersed physically with a smaller number of large-scale planters with large acreages and many slaves. Conditions and opportunities for the enslaved differed between small-scale and large-scale operations in terms of labor management, housing, and degree of surveillance. To understand the opportunities available to the people my family enslaved, it was important to determine the scale of their farming and slaveholding operation, and the nature of the surrounding landscape, for which I used both archaeological and historical methods.The archaeological investigations included remote sensing and exploratory excavation at the site family oral history indicated was the location of the first house, followed by artifact analysis. The results suggest that a two-room hewn log house on a limestone foundation, typical of the antebellum period, existed on the site. The artifacts support an antebellum origin for the house, and the presence of male and female occupants, but provide no unique markers of African American occupancy. A comparison of the type, number, and quality of artifacts with those from a well-documented large-scale slaveholding operation suggest that the Elliott family had a small-scale operation.Historical records confirmed that James Elliott was a small-scale farmer and slaveholder who raised a typical suite of crops and livestock that was sufficient to support his family and labor force while providing surplus production for the commercial market. Culturally, James and his family and slaves lived in an agrarian society. Only about 29 percent of Hardin Township’s heads of household were slaveholders, but the society was highly stratified based on land and slave ownership, with greater wealth accruing to six large-scale slaveholders.  In a small-scale farming operation, the Elliotts’ enslaved (and those of other small-scale holders) could expect reduced surveillance while working, running approved errands, and attending church. These moments likely afforded the enslaved some time to further their own interests and socialize with their peers. The housing practices of small-scale holders were variable; James was among the 41 percent of them who did not provide separate slave quarters, making unauthorized nighttime excursions more difficult. I used a viewshed analysis to examine the characteristics of physical landscape; this analysis revealed that extensive areas around the Elliott farm were out of sight of the Elliott log house and the houses of neighboring slaveholders, and that the riparian corridors of small creeks connected these areas in ways that would allow slaves to gather clandestinely while avoiding detection. There is, therefore, compelling circumstantial evidence that opportunities were available to the enslaved to reduce or avoid surveillance. In addition, a report by the Hardin Township Slave Patrol from December 1859 shows that African Americans were in fact availing themselves of these opportunities, meeting in groups of two to six without authorization. These group actions show that a community of resistance existed among the township’s enslaved, a community built upon individual acts of resistance. It is likely that similar conditions prevailed throughout the Upper South.

TI  - Cotton Agriculture and the Function of Gravel Mulch in the Northern Rio Grande
AU  - Kessler, Nicholas V.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The site of Poshu’Owingeh was one of several ancestral Tewa villages to experience rapid growth in the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. in northern New Mexico. Recent research has proposed that this growth was one aspect of a trend characterized by nonlinear socioeconomic change produced by increasing population size and connectivity. Agriculture, commodity production, and exchange are fundamental to this model, but direct evidence for intensification is limited and no empirical data exists for the function and mechanics of the technologies which are supposed to have supported surplus production. This research addresses the problem by examining paleobotanical and soil evidence for the function of gravel mulch, a unique agricultural technology hypothesized to have supported cotton agriculture in portions of the Northern Rio Grande.Physical soil properties and base cation ratios are used to reconstruct the irrigation effect of gravel mulch, and soil nutrient levels are measured to assess change in soil quality associated with cultivation. Fossil pollen assemblages recovered from agricultural soil layers are used to determine the mix of crops grown in gravel mulch fields. A spatial database of archaeological sites is used to reconstruct Puebloan population dynamics in the Tewa Basin. This is compared to published estimates of population growth, the timing of socioeconomic developments in the region, and climate reconstructions.Fossil pollen concentrations indicate that cotton was the main crop grown at Poshu’Owingeh. The substantial increase in the ratio of cotton to maize and a decrease in the diversity of economic wild plant taxa at Poshu’Owingeh suggest cotton cultivation was more intensive here than other documented sites in the region. Soil analysis revealed no evidence for degradation associated with gravel mulch. Cation ratios and particle size distribution in the A horizon suggest that gravel mulch continues to enhance subsurface water flux. I estimate that the runoff required to produce the sodium leaching observed in mulched profiles is generated by relatively intense precipitation generated by monsoon storms. Peak rates for the spatial expansion of farming populations responsible for the construction of the gravel mulch-cotton fields follows rapid population growth in the great Tewa Basin, is coincident with the intensification of regional exchange networks, and strengthening of the North American Monsoon. Given the mechanics of agricultural technology documented in this study, and hypotheses for the importance of cotton in the regional economy; it is concluded that population dynamics, climate change, and human niche construction interacted played a significant role in social change and economic expansion in the late precontact Northern Rio Grande.

TI  - Novel Strategies for Glutamate Clearance in the Glia-Deprived Synaptic Hub of C. Elegans
AU  - Chan, Joyce
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, Glutamate (Glu) is critical for normal neuronal physiology. Disruption in Glu clearance results in hyper-stimulation of glutamatergic circuits, potentially leading to excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The canonical model of brain connectivity describes glutamatergic synapses as well insulated and enveloped by glia. These glia express Glu Transporters (GluTs) which work to clear Glu following synaptic activity. However, critical areas of the brain such as the mammalian hippocampus display poor synaptic isolation, which may result in Glu spillover between adjacent synapses and subsequent loss of circuit specificity. How accurate signal transmission is achieved in these glia-deprived areas remains unclear. We approach this question using the C. elegans system, which faces the same dilemma as the mammalian hippocampus. Using a combination of behavioral assays and imaging of transgenic animals expressing Ca2+-sensitive reporter GCaMP or Glu-sensitive reporter iGluSnFR, we demonstrate a combined role of synaptic location and pharyngeal pulsatility in efficient Glu clearance of the nerve ring. We find that perfusion of Glu-rich interstitial fluid plays a vital role in GluT-mediated synaptic clearance, shown in our experiments where we induce paralysis of pharyngeal and head muscles to inhibit local movement. This study provides novel insights to mechanisms of effective Glu clearance in the absence of glia, a feature shared between nematodes and vital areas of the mammalian brain. Investigating novel mechanisms of Glu clearance can inform us in seeking candidate targets for therapeutic interventions in brain ischemia, and potential ways of manipulating brain pulsations and heart rate to promote clearance of solutes and aggregates (such as amyloid β) in patients to slow the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropathies.

TI  - Riverine wetland function and human-induced ecological disturbance: A watershed perspective
AU  - Edge, Julie Mann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation evaluated the relationship between human-induced ecological disturbance and riverine wetland function at a watershed level. Specifically, it addressed the hypothesis that as human-induced ecological disturbance increases riverine wetland functional capacity decreases. The use of a watershed perspective was assessed, as was the Hydrogeomorphic Approach (HGM). The HGM method evaluates wetland function to meet the technical and programmatic requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. HGM is based on the factors that influence how a wetland functions--geomorphic setting, water source, and hydrodynamics. Brinson et al.'s (1995) HGM guidebook for riverine wetlands (HGM-Riverine) was used as the framework for investigating the wetland functional capacity in two small watersheds located in eastern Missouri. HGM-Riverine defines fifteen functions that are categorized as hydrologic, biogeochemical, and habitat functions. It also determines the index of function for a riverine wetland based on the fifteen functions. Nine of the fifteen functions and the index of function proved significant. These functions were long-term surface water storage, moderation of groundwater flow or discharge, nutrient cycling, removal of elements and compounds, characteristic plant communities, spatial structure of habitat, interspersion and connectivity, distribution and abundance of invertebrates, distribution and abundance of vertebrates. For the ecological disturbance tests, the two watersheds were compared based on their population dynamics and land use. Wild Horse Creek watershed and Caulk's Creek watershed are of similar size and terrain, but have contrasting ecological disturbance regimes. Wild Horse Creek is relatively rural and undisturbed while Caulk's Creek is experiencing rapid urbanization as part of the westward expansion of the St. Louis metropolitan area into the City of Wildwood. The tests showed a significant difference in the ecological disturbance factors between the two watersheds. In sum, the research results revealed that Wild Horse Creek's watershed had greater riverine wetland functional capacity and less manifestation of human-induced ecological disturbance than Caulk's Creek's watershed. A watershed perspective enhanced the evaluation of wetland function and ecological disturbance by showing the trends among related wetlands and landscape features. While HGM was not intended to be a watershed-based technique, the results from this dissertation support its use in that capacity.

TI  - Helping stealthy cougar survive; Responsible report of sighting provides them additional protection; [FINAL Edition]
AU  - GRUENEFELD, GEORGE

AB  - There's really no reason why the animals should not exist in Quebec since the province offers extensive tracts of wilderness area which is frequently undisturbed by man. Nevertheless, cougars are less demophobic than we believe them to be and occasionally are attracted to an area by an abundance of deer despite extensive human presence. One example is the apparent presence of cougars on Rigaud Mountain, just west of Montreal, from time to time. Another is the frequency of sightings in the Eastern Townships, including the settled areas east of Lac Memphremagog.The Canadian beaver has made men wealthy, it has tarried on the threshold of scarcity and, in the past few decades, it has recovered to the point of abundance. In the populated southern areas of Canada, it might have even recovered to a level of overabundance. Their compulsion to dam rivers is worse than that of Hydro- Quebec and, in many areas, the beaver ponds flood manicured lawns. One such beaver pond laps at the asphalt of Highway 138 between Montreal and Chateauguay, others actually spill across roads of southwestern Quebec and many areas of Ontario.In one sense the resurgence of beavers can be regarded as a nuisance, but it's also good news for ducks because the ponds provide ideal and much needed nesting habitat for ducks. Black ducks thrive in backwoods pond while mallards take to beaver wetlands in more settled areas. Wood ducks also thrive in the habitat these rodents create. The author of the DU magazine article, Matt Young, cites Canadian Wildlife Service estimates that the mallard nesting population in southern Ontario increased by more than 600 per cent in the two decades between 1951 and 1971 because of the expansion of beaver populations and that southern Ontario now produces 2.5 million ducks for the Atlantic and Mississippi migration corridors.

T2  - Kelowna Capital News
AB  - "The overall vision for Bernard Avenue is to make it safer and more inviting for pedestrians to get around and spend time exploring the area," said Pat McCormick of the city's infrastructure planning department. The seven-metre-wide sidewalks include textural and visual cues to create three distinct "zones" with specific purposes. The middle zone is a two-metre-wide, unobstructed corridor for pedestrian movement. A furnishing zone for benches, trees and lights is located between the middle zone and the road and a merchants' display zone lies between the middle zone and the buildings.

AB  - The city could also demand that developers rehabilitate streams flowing through their properties as a condition of development approvals. [Brian Trushinski] would like to see woodlots and streams linked to each other to facilitate both animal and plant migration."Is the community prepared to have open spaces more natural (such as woodlots) instead of soccer pitches?" Trushinski asks. "There will be a lot of discussion about this."Trillium's "Green Book," an overview of its proposed Beechwood West Neighborhood Four, details areas that will be protected as open spaces, woodlots and wetlands that will be kept, and wildlike habitat and movement corridors, particularly along Laurel Creek, that will be retained.

AB  - The corridors were established to aid the movement of wildlife through the Bow Valley and to restore what officials called the natural predator-prey balance between wolves, bears, cougars and ungulates such as deer and elk.  Elk had become particularly problematic, overrunning the townsite and posing a risk to humans during the spring calving season and fall rut, when adult males and females become aggressive.

TI  - Stopping toxic smoke; [Final Edition]
AU  - D'Angelo, Carmen

AB  - Although, upon review of the Ontario Liberal Party's platform entitled 'Strong Communities', the city's waste diversion program may become mandatory. If the Liberals attain political power after the next provincial election, they vow to "divert 60 per cent of waste from landfills in five years."The next toxic spewing smoke stacks on the hit list are Ontario Power Generation's five coal- burning plants. In exchange for the production of electricity, the coal-burning stacks have contributed to Ontario's smog. Last year, a record 27 smog days occurred in Ontario and it is estimated that 1,900 people a year die from smog related illness.The Liberals propose a 'Golden Horseshoe Greenbelt' that would protect lands by linking the Niagara Escarpment to other environmental sensitive areas such as: Oak Ridges Moraine, Dufferin- Rouge Agricultural Preserve, Bronte Creek Provincial Park- Escarpment Corridor, and the provincially-owned Seaton Lands.
